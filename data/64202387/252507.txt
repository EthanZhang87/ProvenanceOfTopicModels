The American frontier also known as the Old West and popularly known as the Wild West encompasses the geography history folklore and culture associated with the forward wave of American expansion in mainland North America that began with European colonial settlements in the early th century and ended with the admission of the last few contiguous western territories as states in This era of massive migration and settlement was particularly encouraged by President Thomas Jefferson following the Louisiana Purchase giving rise to the expansionist attitude known as manifest destiny and historians Frontier Thesis The legends historical events and folklore of the American frontier known as the frontier myth have embedded themselves into United States culture so much so that the Old West and the Western genre of media specifically has become one of the defining features of American national identity br br br Periodization br Historians have debated at length as to when the frontier era began when it ended and which were its key sub periods For example the Old West subperiod is sometimes used by historians regarding the time from the end of the American Civil War in to the when Superintendent of the Census William Rush Merriam stated the U S Census Bureau would stop recording western frontier settlement as part of its census categories after the U S Census His successors however continued the practice until the Census Others including the Library of Congress and University of Oxford often cite differing points reaching into the early s typically within the first two decades prior to American entry into World War I A period known as The Western Civil War of Incorporation lasted from the s to This period included historical events synonymous with the archetypical Old West or Wild West such as violent conflict arising from encroaching settlement into frontier land the removal and assimilation of natives consolidation of property to large corporations and government vigilantism and the attempted enforcement of laws upon outlaws br In the Superintendent of the Census William Rush Merriam stated Up to and including the country had a frontier of settlement but at present the unsettled area has been so broken into by isolated bodies of settlement that there can hardly be said to be a frontier line In the discussion of its extent its westward movement etc it can not therefore any longer have a place in the census reports Despite this the later U S census continued to show the westward frontier line and his successors continued the practice By the U S census however the frontier had shrunk into divided areas without a singular westward line of settlement An influx of agricultural homesteaders in the first two decades of the th century taking up more acreage than homestead grants in the entirety of the th century is cited to have significantly reduced open land br A frontier is a zone of contact at the edge of a line of settlement Theorist Frederick Jackson Turner went deeper arguing that the frontier was the scene of a defining process of American civilization The frontier he asserted promoted the formation of a composite nationality for the American people He theorized it was a process of development This perennial rebirth this fluidity of American life this expansion westward furnish es the forces dominating American character Turner s ideas since have inspired generations of historians and critics to explore multiple individual American frontiers but the popular folk frontier concentrates on the conquest and settlement of Native American lands west of the Mississippi River in what is now the Midwest Texas the Great Plains the Rocky Mountains the Southwest and the West Coast br Enormous popular attention was focused on the Western United States especially the Southwest in the second half of the th century and the early th century from the s to the s Such media typically exaggerated the romance anarchy and chaotic violence of the period for greater dramatic effect This inspired the Western genre of film along with television shows novels comic books video games children s toys and costumes br As defined by Hine and Faragher frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities the use of the land the development of crops and hotels and the formation of states They explain It is a tale of conquest but also one of survival persistence and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America Turner himself repeatedly emphasized how the availability of free land to start new farms attracted pioneering Americans The existence of an area of free land its continuous recession and the advance of American settlement westward explain American development Through treaties with foreign nations and native tribes political compromise military conquest the establishment of law and order the building of farms ranches and towns the marking of trails and digging of mines and the pulling in of great migrations of foreigners the United States expanded from coast to coast fulfilling the ideology of Manifest Destiny In his Frontier Thesis Turner theorized that the frontier was a process that transformed Europeans into a new people the Americans whose values focused on equality democracy and optimism as well as individualism self reliance and even violence br br br Terms West and frontier br br The frontier is the margin of undeveloped territory that would comprise the United States beyond the established frontier line The U S Census Bureau designated frontier territory as generally unoccupied land with a population density of fewer than people per square mile people per square kilometer The frontier line was the outer boundary of European American settlement into this land Beginning with the first permanent European settlements on the East Coast it has moved steadily westward from the s to the s decades with occasional movements north into Maine and New Hampshire south into Florida and east from California into Nevada Pockets of settlements would also appear far past the established frontier line particularly on the West Coast and the deep interior with settlements such as Los Angeles and Salt Lake City respectively The West was the recently settled area near that boundary Thus parts of the Midwest and American South though no longer considered western have a frontier heritage along with the modern western states Richard W Slatta in his view of the frontier writes that historians sometimes define the American West as lands west of the th meridian or west longitude and that other definitions of the region include all lands west of the Mississippi or Missouri rivers br br br

Colonial frontier br br In the colonial era before the west was of high priority for settlers and politicians The American frontier began when Jamestown Virginia was settled by the English in In the earliest days of European settlement on the Atlantic coast until about the frontier was essentially any part of the interior of the continent beyond the fringe of existing settlements along the Atlantic coast English French Spanish and Dutch patterns of expansion and settlement were quite different Only a few thousand French migrated to Canada these habitants settled in villages along the St Lawrence River building communities that remained stable for long stretches Although French fur traders ranged widely through the Great Lakes and midwest region they seldom settled down French settlement was limited to a few very small villages such as Kaskaskia Illinois as well as a larger settlement around New Orleans In what is now New York state the Dutch set up fur trading posts in the Hudson River valley followed by large grants of land to rich landowning patroons who brought in tenant farmers who created compact permanent villages They created a dense rural settlement in upstate New York but they did not push westward br Areas in the north that were in the frontier stage by generally had poor transportation facilities so the opportunity for commercial agriculture was low These areas remained primarily in subsistence agriculture and as a result by the s these societies were highly egalitarian as explained by historian Jackson Turner Main br br The typical frontier society therefore was one in which class distinctions were minimized The wealthy speculator if one was involved usually remained at home so that ordinarily no one of wealth was a resident The class of landless poor was small The great majority were landowners most of whom were also poor because they were starting with little property and had not yet cleared much land nor had they acquired the farm tools and animals which would one day make them prosperous Few artisans settled on the frontier except for those who practiced a trade to supplement their primary occupation of farming There might be a storekeeper a minister and perhaps a doctor and there were several landless laborers All the rest were farmers br In the South frontier areas that lacked transportation such as the Appalachian Mountains region remained based on subsistence farming and resembled the egalitarianism of their northern counterparts although they had a larger upper class of slaveowners North Carolina was representative However frontier areas of that had good river connections were increasingly transformed into plantation agriculture Rich men came in bought up the good land and worked it with slaves The area was no longer frontier It had a stratified society comprising a powerful upper class white landowning gentry a small middle class a fairly large group of landless or tenant white farmers and a growing slave population at the bottom of the social pyramid Unlike the North where small towns and even cities were common the South was overwhelmingly rural br br br From British peasants to American farmers br The seaboard colonial settlements gave priority to land ownership for individual farmers and as the population grew they pushed westward for fresh farmland Unlike Britain where a small number of landlords owned most of the land ownership in America was cheap easy and widespread Land ownership brought a degree of independence as well as a vote for local and provincial offices The typical New England settlements were quite compact and small under a square mile Conflict with the Native Americans arose out of political issues namely who would rule Early frontier areas east of the Appalachian Mountains included the Connecticut River valley and northern New England which was a move to the north not the west br br br Wars with French and with natives br br Settlers on the frontier often connected isolated incidents to indicate Indian conspiracies to attack them but these lacked a French diplomatic dimension after or a Spanish connection after br Most of the frontiers experienced numerous conflicts The French and Indian War broke out between Britain and France with the French making up for their small colonial population base by enlisting Native war parties as allies The series of large wars spilling over from European wars ended in a complete victory for the British in the worldwide Seven Years War In the peace treaty of France ceded practically everything as the lands west of the Mississippi River in addition to Florida and New Orleans went to Spain Otherwise lands east of the Mississippi River and what is now Canada went to Britain br br br Steady migration to frontier lands br Regardless of wars Americans were moving across the Appalachians into western Pennsylvania what is now West Virginia and areas of the Ohio Country Kentucky and Tennessee In the southern settlements via the Cumberland Gap their most famous leader was Daniel Boone Young George Washington promoted settlements in West Virginia on lands awarded to him and his soldiers by the Royal government in payment for their wartime service in Virginia s militia Settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains were curtailed briefly by the Royal Proclamation of forbidding settlement in this area The Treaty of Fort Stanwix re opened most of the western lands for frontiersmen to settle br br br New nation br The nation was at peace after The states gave Congress control of the western lands and an effective system for population expansion was developed The Northwest Ordinance of abolished slavery in the area north of the Ohio River and promised statehood when a territory reached a threshold population as Ohio did in br The first major movement west of the Appalachian mountains originated in Pennsylvania Virginia and North Carolina as soon as the Revolutionary War ended in Pioneers housed themselves in a rough lean to or at most a one room log cabin The main food supply at first came from hunting deer turkeys and other abundant game br br Clad in typical frontier garb leather breeches moccasins fur cap and hunting shirt and girded by a belt from which hung a hunting knife and a shot pouch all homemade the pioneer presented a unique appearance In a short time he opened in the woods a patch or clearing on which he grew corn wheat flax tobacco and other products even fruit br In a few years the pioneer added hogs sheep and cattle and perhaps acquired a horse Homespun clothing replaced the animal skins The more restless pioneers grew dissatisfied with over civilized life and uprooted themselves again to move or a hundred miles or km further west br br br Land policy br br The land policy of the new nation was conservative paying special attention to the needs of the settled East The goals sought by both parties in the era were to grow the economy avoid draining away the skilled workers needed in the East distribute the land wisely sell it at prices that were reasonable to settlers yet high enough to pay off the national debt clear legal titles and create a diversified Western economy that would be closely interconnected with the settled areas with minimal risk of a breakaway movement By the s however the West was filling up with squatters who had no legal deed although they may have paid money to previous settlers The Jacksonian Democrats favored the squatters by promising rapid access to cheap land By contrast Henry Clay was alarmed at the lawless rabble heading West who were undermining the utopian concept of a law abiding stable middle class republican community Rich southerners meanwhile looked for opportunities to buy high quality land to set up slave plantations The Free Soil movement of the s called for low cost land for free white farmers a position enacted into law by the new Republican Party in offering free acres ha homesteads to all adults male and female black and white native born or immigrant br After winning the Revolutionary War American settlers in large numbers poured into the west In American pioneers to the Northwest Territory established Marietta Ohio as the first permanent American settlement in the Northwest Territory br In Daniel Boone blazed a trail for the Transylvania Company from Virginia through the Cumberland Gap into central Kentucky It was later lengthened to reach the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville The Wilderness Road was steep and rough and it could only be traversed on foot or horseback but it was the best route for thousands of settlers moving into Kentucky In some areas they had to face Native attacks In alone Natives killed over travelers on the Wilderness Road Kentucky at this time had been depopulated it was empty of Indian villages However raiding parties sometimes came through One of those intercepted was Abraham Lincoln s grandfather who was scalped in near Louisville br br br Acquisition of native lands br br The War of marked the final confrontation involving major British and Native forces fighting to stop American expansion The British war goal included the creation of an Indian barrier state under British auspices in the Midwest which would halt American expansion westward American frontier militiamen under General Andrew Jackson defeated the Creeks and opened the Southwest while militia under Governor William Henry Harrison defeated the Native British alliance at the Battle of the Thames in Canada in The death in battle of the Native leader Tecumseh dissolved the coalition of hostile Native tribes Meanwhile General Andrew Jackson ended the Native military threat in the Southeast at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in in Alabama In general the frontiersmen battled the Natives with little help from the U S Army or the federal government br To end the war American diplomats negotiated the Treaty of Ghent signed towards the end of with Britain They rejected the British plan to set up a Native state in U S territory south of the Great Lakes They explained the American policy toward the acquisition of Native lands br br The United States while intending never to acquire lands from the Indians otherwise than peaceably and with their free consent are fully determined in that manner progressively and in proportion as their growing population may require to reclaim from the state of nature and to bring into cultivation every portion of the territory contained within their acknowledged boundaries In thus providing for the support of millions of civilized beings they will not violate any dictate of justice or humanity for they will not only give to the few thousand savages scattered over that territory an ample equivalent for any right they may surrender but will always leave them the possession of lands more than they can cultivate and more than adequate to their subsistence comfort and enjoyment by cultivation If this is a spirit of aggrandizement the undersigned are prepared to admit in that sense its existence but they must deny that it affords the slightest proof of an intention not to respect the boundaries between them and European nations or of a desire to encroach upon the territories of Great Britain They will not suppose that that Government will avow as the basis of their policy towards the United States a system of arresting their natural growth within their territories for the sake of preserving a perpetual desert for savages br br br New territories and states br br As settlers poured in the frontier districts first became territories with an elected legislature and a governor appointed by the president Then when the population reached the territory applied for statehood Frontiersmen typically dropped the legalistic formalities and restrictive franchise favored by eastern upper classes and adopting more democracy and more egalitarianism br In the western frontier had reached the Mississippi River St Louis Missouri was the largest town on the frontier the gateway for travel westward and a principal trading center for Mississippi River traffic and inland commerce but remained under Spanish control until br br br Louisiana Purchase br br Thomas Jefferson thought of himself as a man of the frontier and was keenly interested in expanding and exploring the West Jefferson s Louisiana Purchase of doubled the size of the nation at the cost of million or about per acre million in dollars less than cents per acre Federalists opposed the expansion but Jeffersonians hailed the opportunity to create millions of new farms to expand the domain of land owning yeomen the ownership would strengthen the ideal republican society based on agriculture not commerce governed lightly and promoting self reliance and virtue as well as form the political base for Jeffersonian Democracy br France was paid for its sovereignty over the territory in terms of international law Between and the s the federal government purchased the land from the Native tribes then in possession of it th century accountants and courts have calculated the value of the payments made to the Natives which included future payments of cash food horses cattle supplies buildings schooling and medical care In cash terms the total paid to the tribes in the area of the Louisiana Purchase amounted to about billion or nearly billion in dollars Additional sums were paid to the Natives living east of the Mississippi for their lands as well as payments to Natives living in parts of the west outside the Louisiana Purchase br Even before the purchase Jefferson was planning expeditions to explore and map the lands He charged Lewis and Clark to explore the Missouri River and such principal stream of it as by its course and communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean whether the Columbia Oregon Colorado or any other river may offer the most direct and practicable communication across the continent for commerce Jefferson also instructed the expedition to study the region s native tribes including their morals language and culture weather soil rivers commercial trading and animal and plant life br Entrepreneurs most notably John Jacob Astor quickly seized the opportunity and expanded fur trading operations into the Pacific Northwest Astor s Fort Astoria later Fort George at the mouth of the Columbia River became the first permanent white settlement in that area although it was not profitable for Astor He set up the American Fur Company in an attempt to break the hold that the Hudson s Bay Company monopoly had over the region By Astor had taken over independent traders to create a profitable monopoly he left the business as a multi millionaire in br br br Fur trade br br As the frontier moved west trappers and hunters moved ahead of settlers searching out new supplies of beaver and other skins for shipment to Europe The hunters were the first Europeans in much of the Old West and they formed the first working relationships with the Native Americans in the West They added extensive knowledge of the Northwest terrain including the important South Pass through the central Rocky Mountains Discovered about it later became a major route for settlers to Oregon and Washington By however a new brigade rendezvous system sent company men in brigades cross country on long expeditions bypassing many tribes It also encouraged free trappers to explore new regions on their own At the end of the gathering season the trappers would rendezvous and turn in their goods for pay at river ports along the Green River Upper Missouri and the Upper Mississippi St Louis was the largest of the rendezvous towns By however fashions changed and beaver hats were replaced by silk hats ending the demand for expensive American furs Thus ended the era of the mountain men trappers and scouts such as Jedediah Smith Hugh Glass Davy Crockett Jack Omohundro and others The trade in beaver fur virtually ceased by br br br The federal government and westward expansion br There was wide agreement on the need to settle the new territories quickly but the debate polarized over the price the government should charge The conservatives and Whigs typified by the president John Quincy Adams wanted a moderated pace that charged the newcomers enough to pay the costs of the federal government The Democrats however tolerated a wild scramble for land at very low prices The final resolution came in the Homestead Law of with a moderated pace that gave settlers acres free after they worked on it for five years br The private profit motive dominated the movement westward but the federal government played a supporting role in securing the land through treaties and setting up territorial governments with governors appointed by the President The federal government first acquired western territory through treaties with other nations or native tribes Then it sent surveyors to map and document the land By the th century Washington bureaucracies managed the federal lands such as the United States General Land Office in the Interior Department and after the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture After dam building and flood control became major concerns br Transportation was a key issue and the Army especially the Army Corps of Engineers was given full responsibility for facilitating navigation on the rivers The steamboat first used on the Ohio River in made possible inexpensive travel using the river systems especially the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and their tributaries Army expeditions up the Missouri River in allowed engineers to improve the technology For example the Army s steamboat Western Engineer of combined a very shallow draft with one of the earliest stern wheels In Colonel Henry Atkinson developed keelboats with hand powered paddle wheels br The federal postal system played a crucial role in national expansion It facilitated expansion into the West by creating an inexpensive fast convenient communication system Letters from early settlers provided information and boosterism to encourage increased migration to the West helped scattered families stay in touch and provide neutral help assisted entrepreneurs to find business opportunities and made possible regular commercial relationships between merchants and the West and wholesalers and factories back east The postal service likewise assisted the Army in expanding control over the vast western territories The widespread circulation of important newspapers by mail such as the New York Weekly Tribune facilitated coordination among politicians in different states The postal service helped to integrate already established areas with the frontier creating a spirit of nationalism and providing a necessary infrastructure br The army early on assumed the mission of protecting settlers along with the Westward Expansion Trails a policy that was described by U S Secretary of War John B Floyd in br br A line of posts running parallel without frontier but near to the Indians usual habitations placed at convenient distances and suitable positions and occupied by infantry would exercise a salutary restraint upon the tribes who would feel that any foray by their warriors upon the white settlements would meet with prompt retaliation upon their own homes br There was a debate at the time about the best size for the forts with Jefferson Davis Winfield Scott and Thomas Jesup supporting forts that were larger but fewer in number than Floyd Floyd s plan was more expensive but had the support of settlers and the general public who preferred that the military remain as close as possible The frontier area was vast and even Davis conceded that concentration would have exposed portions of the frontier to Native hostilities without any protection br br br Scientists artists and explorers br br Government and private enterprise sent many explorers to the West In Army lieutenant Zebulon Pike led a party of soldiers to find the headwaters of the Mississippi He later explored the Red and Arkansas Rivers in Spanish territory eventually reaching the Rio Grande On his return Pike sighted the peak in Colorado named after him Major Stephen Harriman Long led the Yellowstone and Missouri expeditions of but his categorizing in of the Great Plains as arid and useless led to the region getting a bad reputation as the Great American Desert which discouraged settlement in that area for several decades br In naturalists Thomas Nuttall and John Bradbury traveled up the Missouri River documenting and drawing plant and animal life Artist George Catlin painted accurate paintings of Native American culture Swiss artist Karl Bodmer made compelling landscapes and portraits John James Audubon is famous for classifying and painting in minute details species of birds published in Birds of America br The most famous of the explorers was John Charles Fr mont an Army officer in the Corps of Topographical Engineers He displayed a talent for exploration and a genius at self promotion that gave him the sobriquet of Pathmarker of the West and led him to the presidential nomination of the new Republican Party in He led a series of expeditions in the s which answered many of the outstanding geographic questions about the little known region He crossed through the Rocky Mountains by five different routes and mapped parts of Oregon and California In he played a role in conquering California In Fr mont was assigned to locate a central route through the mountains for the proposed transcontinental railroad but his expedition ended in near disaster when it became lost and was trapped by heavy snow His reports mixed narrative of exciting adventure with scientific data and detailed practical information for travelers It caught the public imagination and inspired many to head west Goetzman says it was monumental in its breadth a classic of exploring literature br While colleges were springing up across the Northeast there was little competition on the western frontier for Transylvania University founded in Lexington Kentucky in It boasted of a law school in addition to its undergraduate and medical programs Transylvania attracted politically ambitious young men from across the Southwest including who became United States senators representatives governors and ambassadors as well as Jefferson Davis the president of the Confederacy br br br Antebellum West br br br Religion br br Most frontiersmen showed little commitment to religion until traveling evangelists began to appear and to produce revivals The local pioneers responded enthusiastically to these events and in effect evolved their populist religions especially during the Second Great Awakening which featured outdoor camp meetings lasting a week or more and which introduced many people to organized religion for the first time One of the largest and most famous camp meetings took place at Cane Ridge Kentucky in br The local Baptists set up small independent churches Baptists abjured centralized authority each local church was founded on the principle of independence of the local congregation On the other hand bishops of the well organized centralized Methodists assigned circuit riders to specific areas for several years at a time then moved them to fresh territory Several new denominations were formed of which the largest was the Disciples of Christ br The established Eastern churches were slow to meet the needs of the frontier The Presbyterians and Congregationalists since they depended on well educated ministers were shorthanded in evangelizing the frontier They set up a Plan of Union of to combine resources on the frontier br br br Democracy in the Midwest br Historian Mark Wyman calls Wisconsin a palimpsest of layer upon layer of peoples and forces each imprinting permanent influences He identified these layers as multiple frontiers over three centuries Native American frontier French frontier English frontier fur trade frontier mining frontier and the logging frontier Finally the coming of the railroad brought the end of the frontier br Frederick Jackson Turner grew up in Wisconsin during its last frontier stage and in his travels around the state he could see the layers of social and political development One of Turner s last students Merle Curti used an in depth analysis of local Wisconsin history to test Turner s thesis about democracy Turner s view was that American democracy involved widespread participation in the making of decisions affecting the common life the development of initiative and self reliance and equality of economic and cultural opportunity It thus also involved Americanization of immigrant Curti found that from to in Wisconsin the poorest groups gained rapidly in land ownership and often rose to political leadership at the local level He found that even landless young farmworkers were soon able to obtain their farms Free land on the frontier therefore created opportunity and democracy for both European immigrants as well as old stock Yankees br br br Southwest br br From the s to the s pioneers moved into the new lands that stretched from Kentucky to Alabama to Texas Most were farmers who moved in family groups br Historian Louis Hacker shows how wasteful the first generation of pioneers was they were too ignorant to cultivate the land properly and when the natural fertility of virgin land was used up they sold out and moved west to try again Hacker describes that in Kentucky about br br Farms were for sale with from ten to fifty acres cleared possessing log houses peach and sometimes apple orchards enclosed in fences and having plenty of standing timber for fuel The land was sown in wheat and corn which were the staples while hemp for making rope was being cultivated in increasing quantities in the fertile river bottoms br Yet on the whole it was an agricultural society without skill or resources It committed all those sins which characterize wasteful and ignorant husbandry Grass seed was not sown for hay and as a result the farm animals had to forage for themselves in the forests the fields were not permitted to lie in pasturage a single crop was planted in the soil until the land was exhausted the manure was not returned to the fields only a small part of the farm was brought under cultivation the rest being permitted to stand in timber Instruments of cultivation were rude and clumsy and only too few many of them being made on the farm It is plain why the American frontier settler was on the move continually It was not his fear of too close contact with the comforts and restraints of a civilized society that stirred him into a ceaseless activity nor merely the chance of selling out at a profit to the coming wave of settlers it was his wasting land that drove him on Hunger was the goad The pioneer farmer s ignorance his inadequate facilities for cultivation his limited means of transport necessitated his frequent changes of scene He could succeed only with virgin soil br Hacker adds that the second wave of settlers reclaimed the land repaired the damage and practiced more sustainable agriculture Historian Frederick Jackson Turner explored the individualistic worldview and values of the first generation br br What they objected to was arbitrary obstacles artificial limitations upon the freedom of each member of this frontier folk to work out his career without fear or favor What they instinctively opposed was the crystallization of differences the monopolization of opportunity and the fixing of that monopoly by government or by social customs The road must be open The game must be played according to the rules There must be no artificial stifling of equality of opportunity no closed doors to the able no stopping the free game before it was played to the end More than that there was an unformulated perhaps but very real feeling that mere success in the game by which the abler men were able to achieve pre minence gave to the successful ones no right to look down upon their neighbors no vested title to assert superiority as a matter of pride and to the diminution of the equal right and dignity of the less successful br br br Manifest destiny br br Manifest Destiny was the controversial belief that the United States was preordained to expand from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast and efforts made to realize that belief The concept has appeared during colonial times but the term was coined in the s by a popular magazine which editorialized the fulfillment of our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions As the nation grew Manifest Destiny became a rallying cry for expansionists in the Democratic Party In the s the Tyler and Polk administrations successfully promoted this nationalistic doctrine However the Whig Party which represented business and financial interests stood opposed to Manifest Destiny Whig leaders such as Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln called for deepening the society through modernization and urbanization instead of simple horizontal expansion Starting with the annexation of Texas the expansionists got the upper hand John Quincy Adams an anti slavery Whig felt the Texas annexation in to be the heaviest calamity that ever befell myself and my country br Helping settlers move westward were the emigrant guide books of the s featuring route information supplied by the fur traders and the Fr mont expeditions and promising fertile farmland beyond the Rockies br br br Mexico and Texas br br Mexico became independent of Spain in and took over Spain s northern possessions stretching from Texas to California American caravans began delivering goods to the Mexican city Santa Fe along the Santa Fe Trail over the mile km journey which took days from Kansas City Missouri then known as Westport Santa Fe was also the trailhead for the El Camino Real the King s Highway a trade route which carried American manufactured goods southward deep into Mexico and returned silver furs and mules northward not to be confused with another Camino Real which connected the missions in California A branch also ran eastward near the Gulf also called the Old San Antonio Road Santa Fe connected to California via the Old Spanish Trail br The Spanish and Mexican governments attracted American settlers to Texas with generous terms Stephen F Austin became an empresario receiving contracts from the Mexican officials to bring in immigrants In doing so he also became the de facto political and military commander of the area Tensions rose however after an abortive attempt to establish the independent nation of Fredonia in William Travis leading the war party advocated for independence from Mexico while the peace party led by Austin attempted to get more autonomy within the current relationship When Mexican president Santa Anna shifted alliances and joined the conservative Centralist party he declared himself dictator and ordered soldiers into Texas to curtail new immigration and unrest However immigration continued and Anglos with slaves were settled in Texas by In the Texas Revolution erupted Following losses at the Alamo and Goliad the Texians won the decisive Battle of San Jacinto to secure independence At San Jacinto Sam Houston commander in chief of the Texian Army and future President of the Republic of Texas famously shouted Remember the Alamo Remember Goliad The U S Congress declined to annex Texas stalemated by contentious arguments over slavery and regional power Thus the Republic of Texas remained an independent power for nearly a decade before it was annexed as the th state in The government of Mexico however viewed Texas as a runaway province and asserted its ownership br br br Mexican American War br br Mexico refused to recognize the independence of Texas in but the U S and European powers did so Mexico threatened war if Texas joined the U S which it did in American negotiators were turned away by a Mexican government in turmoil When the Mexican army killed American soldiers in disputed territory war was at hand Whigs such as Congressman Abraham Lincoln denounced the war but it was quite popular outside New England br The Mexican strategy was defensive the American strategy was a three pronged offensive using large numbers of volunteer soldiers Overland forces seized New Mexico with little resistance and headed to California which quickly fell to the American land and naval forces From the main American base at New Orleans General Zachary Taylor led forces into northern Mexico winning a series of battles that ensued The U S Navy transported General Winfield Scott to Veracruz He then marched his man force west to Mexico City winning the final battle at Chapultepec Talk of acquiring all of Mexico fell away when the army discovered the Mexican political and cultural values were so alien to America s As the Cincinnati Herald asked what would the U S do with eight million Mexicans with their idol worship heathen superstition and degraded mongrel races br The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of ceded the territories of California and New Mexico to the United States for million which included the assumption of claims against Mexico by settlers The Gadsden Purchase in added southern Arizona which was needed for a railroad route to California In all Mexico ceded half a million square miles million km and included the states to be of California Utah Arizona Nevada New Mexico and parts of Colorado and Wyoming in addition to Texas Managing the new territories and dealing with the slavery issue caused intense controversy particularly over the Wilmot Proviso which would have outlawed slavery in the new territories Congress never passed it but rather temporarily resolved the issue of slavery in the West with the Compromise of California entered the Union in as a free state the other areas remained territories for many years br br br Growth of Texas br The new state grew rapidly as migrants poured into the fertile cotton lands of east Texas German immigrants started to arrive in the early s because of negative economic social and political pressures in Germany With their investments in cotton lands and slaves planters established cotton plantations in the eastern districts The central area of the state was developed more by subsistence farmers who seldom owned slaves br Texas in its Wild West days attracted men who could shoot straight and possessed the zest for adventure for masculine renown patriotic service martial glory and meaningful deaths br br br California Gold Rush br br In about Californios Hispanics lived in California primarily on cattle ranches in what is now the Los Angeles area A few hundred foreigners were scattered in the northern districts including some Americans With the outbreak of war with Mexico in the U S sent in Fr mont and a U S Army unit as well as naval forces and quickly took control As the war was ending gold was discovered in the north and the word soon spread worldwide br Thousands of Forty Niners reached California by sailing around South America or taking a short cut through disease ridden Panama or walked the California trail The population soared to over in mostly in the gold districts that stretched into the mountains east of San Francisco br Housing in San Francisco was at a premium and abandoned ships whose crews had headed for the mines were often converted to temporary lodging In the goldfields themselves living conditions were primitive though the mild climate proved attractive Supplies were expensive and food poor typical diets consisting mostly of pork beans and whiskey These highly male transient communities with no established institutions were prone to high levels of violence drunkenness profanity and greed driven behavior Without courts or law officers in the mining communities to enforce claims and justice miners developed their ad hoc legal system based on the mining codes used in other mining communities abroad Each camp had its own rules and often handed out justice by popular vote sometimes acting fairly and at times exercising vigilantes with Native Americans Indians Mexicans and Chinese generally receiving the harshest sentences br The gold rush radically changed the California economy and brought in an array of professionals including precious metal specialists merchants doctors and attorneys who added to the population of miners saloon keepers gamblers and prostitutes A San Francisco newspaper stated The whole country resounds to the sordid cry of gold Gold Gold while the field is left half planted the house half built and everything neglected but the manufacture of shovels and pickaxes Over miners found a total of more than million in gold in the five years of the California Gold Rush As thousands arrived however fewer and fewer miners struck their fortune and most ended exhausted and broke br Violent bandits often preyed upon the miners such as the case of Jonathan R Davis killing of eleven bandits single handedly Camps spread out north and south of the American River and eastward into the Sierras In a few years nearly all of the independent miners were displaced as mines were purchased and run by mining companies who then hired low paid salaried miners As gold became harder to find and more difficult to extract individual prospectors gave way to paid work gangs specialized skills and mining machinery Bigger mines however caused greater environmental damage In the mountains shaft mining predominated producing large amounts of waste Beginning in at the end of the gold rush through hydraulic mining was used Despite huge profits being made it fell into the hands of a few capitalists displaced numerous miners vast amounts of waste entered river systems and did heavy ecological damage to the environment Hydraulic mining ended when the public outcry over the destruction of farmlands led to the outlawing of this practice br The mountainous areas of the triangle from New Mexico to California to South Dakota contained hundreds of hard rock mining sites where prospectors discovered gold silver copper and other minerals as well as some soft rock coal Temporary mining camps sprang up overnight most became ghost towns when the ores were depleted Prospectors spread out and hunted for gold and silver along the Rockies and in the southwest Soon gold was discovered in Colorado Utah Arizona New Mexico Idaho Montana and South Dakota by br br The discovery of the Comstock Lode containing vast amounts of silver resulted in the Nevada boomtowns of Virginia City Carson City and Silver City The wealth from silver more than from gold fueled the maturation of San Francisco in the s and helped the rise of some of its wealthiest families such as that of George Hearst br br br Oregon Trail br br To get to the rich new lands of the West Coast there were three options some sailed around the southern tip of South America during a six month voyage some took the treacherous journey across the Panama Isthmus but others walked there on an overland route of more than miles km their wagon trains usually left from Missouri They moved in large groups under an experienced wagonmaster bringing their clothing farm supplies weapons and animals These wagon trains followed major rivers crossed prairies and mountains and typically ended in Oregon and California Pioneers generally attempted to complete the journey during a single warm season usually for six months By when the first migrant wagon train was organized in Independence Missouri a wagon trail had been cleared to Fort Hall Idaho Trails were cleared further and further west eventually reaching the Willamette Valley in Oregon This network of wagon trails leading to the Pacific Northwest was later called the Oregon Trail The eastern half of the route was also used by travelers on the California Trail from Mormon Trail from and Bozeman Trail from before they turned off to their separate destinations br In the Wagon Train of some to emigrants headed for Oregon missionary Marcus Whitman led the wagons on the last leg In the Barlow Road was completed around Mount Hood providing a rough but passable wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Willamette Valley about miles km Though the main direction of travel on the early wagon trails was westward people also used the Oregon Trail to travel eastward Some did so because they were discouraged and defeated Some returned with bags of gold and silver Most were returning to pick up their families and move them all back west These gobacks were a major source of information and excitement about the wonders and promises and dangers and disappointments of the far West br Not all emigrants made it to their destination The dangers of the overland route were numerous snakebites wagon accidents violence from other travelers suicide malnutrition stampedes Native attacks a variety of diseases dysentery typhoid and cholera were among the most common exposure avalanches etc One particularly well known example of the treacherous nature of the journey is the story of the ill fated Donner Party which became trapped in the Sierra Nevada mountains during the winter of Half of the people traveling with the group died from starvation and exposure and some resorted to cannibalism to survive Another story of cannibalism featured Alferd Packer and his trek to Colorado in There were also frequent attacks from bandits and highwaymen such as the infamous Harpe brothers who patrolled the frontier routes and targeted migrant groups br br br Mormons and Utah br br In Missouri and Illinois animosity between the Mormon settlers and locals grew which would mirror those in other states such as Utah years later Violence finally erupted on October when militias from both sides clashed and a mass killing of Mormons in Livingston County occurred days later A Mormon Extermination Order was filed during these conflicts and the Mormons were forced to scatter Brigham Young seeking to leave American jurisdiction to escape religious persecution in Illinois and Missouri led the Mormons to the valley of the Great Salt Lake owned at the time by Mexico but not controlled by them A hundred rural Mormon settlements sprang up in what Young called Deseret which he ruled as a theocracy It later became Utah Territory Young s Salt Lake City settlement served as the hub of their network which reached into neighboring territories as well The communalism and advanced farming practices of the Mormons enabled them to succeed The Mormons often sold goods to wagon trains passing through and came to terms with local Native tribes because Young decided it was cheaper to feed the Natives than fight them Education became a high priority to protect the beleaguered group reduce heresy and maintain group solidarity br Following the end of the Mexican American War in Utah was ceded to the United States by Mexico Though the Mormons in Utah had supported U S efforts during the war the federal government pushed by the Protestant churches rejected theocracy and polygamy Founded in the Republican Party was openly hostile towards the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints LDS Church in Utah over the practice of polygamy viewed by most of the American public as an affront to religious cultural and moral values of modern civilization Confrontations verged on open warfare in the late s as President Buchanan sent in troops Although there were no military battles fought and negotiations led to a stand down violence still escalated and there were several casualties After the Civil War the federal government systematically took control of Utah the LDS Church was legally disincorporated in the territory and members of the church s hierarchy including Young were summarily removed and barred from virtually every public office Meanwhile successful missionary work in the U S and Europe brought a flood of Mormon converts to Utah During this time Congress refused to admit Utah into the Union as a state and statehood would mean an end to direct federal control over the territory and the possible ascension of politicians chosen and controlled by the LDS Church into most if not all federal state and local elected offices from the new state Finally in the church leadership announced polygamy was no longer a central tenet thereafter a compromise In Utah was admitted as the th state with the Mormons dividing between Republicans and Democrats br br br Pony Express and the telegraph br br The federal government provided subsidies for the development of mail and freight delivery and by Congress authorized road improvements and an overland mail service to California The new commercial wagon trains service primarily hauled freight In John Butterfield established a stage service that went from Saint Louis to San Francisco in days along a southern route This route was abandoned in after Texas joined the Confederacy in favor of stagecoach services established via Fort Laramie and Salt Lake City a day journey with Wells Fargo Co as the foremost provider initially using the old Butterfield name br William Russell hoping to get a government contract for more rapid mail delivery service started the Pony Express in cutting delivery time to ten days He set up over stations about miles km apart br In Congress passed the Land Grant Telegraph Act which financed the construction of Western Union s transcontinental telegraph lines Hiram Sibley Western Union s head negotiated exclusive agreements with railroads to run telegraph lines along their right of way Eight years before the transcontinental railroad opened the first transcontinental telegraph linked Omaha Nebraska to San Francisco on October The Pony Express ended in just months because it could not compete with the telegraph br br br Bleeding Kansas br br Constitutionally Congress could not deal with slavery in the states but it did have jurisdiction in the western territories California unanimously rejected slavery in and became a free state New Mexico allowed slavery but it was rarely seen there Kansas was off limits to slavery by the Compromise of Free Soil elements feared that if slavery were allowed rich planters would buy up the best lands and work them with gangs of slaves leaving little opportunity for free white men to own farms Few Southern planters were interested in Kansas but the idea that slavery was illegal there implied they had a second class status that was intolerable to their sense of honor and seemed to violate the principle of states rights With the passage of the extremely controversial Kansas Nebraska Act in Congress left the decision up to the voters on the ground in Kansas Across the North a new major party was formed to fight slavery the Republican Party with numerous westerners in leadership positions most notably Abraham Lincoln of Illinois To influence the territorial decision anti slavery elements also called Jayhawkers or Free soilers financed the migration of politically determined settlers But pro slavery advocates fought back with pro slavery settlers from Missouri Violence on both sides was the result in all men were killed by the time the violence abated in By the pro slavery forces were in control but Kansas had only two slaves The antislavery forces took over by as Kansas became a free state The episode demonstrated that a democratic compromise between North and South over slavery was impossible and served to hasten the Civil War br br br Civil War in the West br br Despite its large territory the trans Mississippi West had a small population and its wartime story has to a large extent been underplayed in the historiography of the American Civil War br br br Trans Mississippi theater br br The Confederacy engaged in several important campaigns in the West However Kansas a major area of conflict building up to the war was the scene of only one battle at Mine Creek But its proximity to Confederate lines enabled pro Confederate guerrillas such as Quantrill s Raiders to attack Union strongholds and massacre the residents br In Texas citizens voted to join the Confederacy anti war Germans were hanged Local troops took over the federal arsenal in San Antonio with plans to grab the territories of northern New Mexico Utah and Colorado and possibly California Confederate Arizona was created by Arizona citizens who wanted protection against Apache raids after the United States Army units were moved out The Confederacy then sets its sight to gain control of the New Mexico Territory General Henry Hopkins Sibley was tasked for the campaign and together with his New Mexico Army marched right up the Rio Grande in an attempt to take the mineral wealth of Colorado as well as California The First Regiment of Volunteers discovered the rebels and they immediately warned and joined the Yankees at Fort Union The Battle of Glorieta Pass soon erupted and the Union ended the Confederate campaign and the area west of Texas remained in Union hands br Missouri a Border South state where slavery was legal became a battleground when the pro secession governor against the vote of the legislature led troops to the federal arsenal at St Louis he was aided by Confederate forces from Arkansas and Louisiana The Governor of Missouri and part of the state legislature signed an Ordinance of Secession at Neosho forming the Confederate government of Missouri and the Confederacy controlling Southern Missouri However Union General Samuel Curtis regained St Louis and all of Missouri for the Union The state was the scene of numerous raids and guerrilla warfare in the west br br br Peacekeeping br br The U S Army after established a series of military posts across the frontier designed to stop warfare among Native tribes or between Natives and settlers Throughout the th century Army officers typically built their careers in peacekeeper roles moving from fort to fort until retirement Actual combat experience was uncommon for any one soldier br The most dramatic conflict was the Sioux war in Minnesota in when Dakota tribes systematically attacked German farms to drive out the settlers For several days Dakota attacks at the Lower Sioux Agency New Ulm and Hutchinson killed to white settlers The state militia fought back and Lincoln sent in federal troops The ensuing battles at Fort Ridgely Birch Coulee Fort Abercrombie and Wood Lake punctuated a six week war which ended in an American victory The federal government tried Natives for murder and were convicted and sentenced to death Lincoln pardoned the majority but leaders were hanged br The decreased presence of Union troops in the West left behind untrained militias hostile tribes used the opportunity to attack settlers The militia struck back hard most notably by attacking the winter quarters of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes filled with women and children at the Sand Creek massacre in eastern Colorado in late br Kit Carson and the U S Army in trapped the entire Navajo tribe in New Mexico where they had been raiding settlers and put them on a reservation Within the Indian Territory now Oklahoma conflicts arose among the Five Civilized Tribes most of which sided with the South being slaveholders themselves br In Congress enacted two major laws to facilitate settlement of the West the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railroad Act The result by was millions of new farms in the Plains states many operated by new immigrants from Germany and Scandinavia br br br Postwar West br br br Territorial governance after the Civil War br br With the war over and slavery abolished the federal government focused on improving the governance of the territories It subdivided several territories preparing them for statehood following the precedents set by the Northwest Ordinance of It standardized procedures and the supervision of territorial governments taking away some local powers and imposing much red tape growing the federal bureaucracy significantly br Federal involvement in the territories was considerable In addition to direct subsidies the federal government maintained military posts provided safety from Native attacks bankrolled treaty obligations conducted surveys and land sales built roads staffed land offices made harbor improvements and subsidized overland mail delivery Territorial citizens came to both decry federal power and local corruption and at the same time lament that more federal dollars were not sent their way br Territorial governors were political appointees and beholden to Washington so they usually governed with a light hand allowing the legislatures to deal with the local issues In addition to his role as civil governor a territorial governor was also a militia commander a local superintendent of Native affairs and the state liaison with federal agencies The legislatures on the other hand spoke for the local citizens and they were given considerable leeway by the federal government to make local law br These improvements to governance still left plenty of room for profiteering As Mark Twain wrote while working for his brother the secretary of Nevada The government of my country snubs honest simplicity but fondles artistic villainy and I think I might have developed into a very capable pickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or two Territorial rings corrupt associations of local politicians and business owners buttressed with federal patronage embezzled from Native tribes and local citizens especially in the Dakota and New Mexico territories br br br Federal land system br br In acquiring preparing and distributing public land to private ownership the federal government generally followed the system set forth by the Land Ordinance of Federal exploration and scientific teams would undertake reconnaissance of the land and determine Native American habitation Through treaties the land titles would be ceded by the resident tribes Then surveyors would create detailed maps marking the land into squares of six miles km on each side subdivided first into one square mile blocks then into acre km lots Townships would be formed from the lots and sold at public auction Unsold land could be purchased from the land office at a minimum price of per acre br As part of public policy the government would award public land to certain groups such as veterans through the use of land script The script traded in a financial market often at below the per acre minimum price set by law which gave speculators investors and developers another way to acquire large tracts of land cheaply Land policy became politicized by competing factions and interests and the question of slavery on new lands was contentious As a counter to land speculators farmers formed claims clubs to enable them to buy larger tracts than the acre km allotments by trading among themselves at controlled prices br In Congress passed three important bills that transformed the land system The Homestead Act granted acres km free to each settler who improved the land for five years citizens and non citizens including squatters and women were all eligible The only cost was a modest filing fee The law was especially important in the settling of the Plains states Many took a free homestead and others purchased their land from railroads at low rates br The Pacific Railroad Act of provided for the land needed to build the transcontinental railroad The land was given the railroads alternated with government owned tracts saved for free distribution to homesteaders To be equitable the federal government reduced each tract to acres ha because of its perceived higher value given its proximity to the rail line Railroads had up to five years to sell or mortgage their land after tracks were laid after which unsold land could be purchased by anyone Often railroads sold some of their government acquired land to homesteaders immediately to encourage settlement and the growth of markets the railroads would then be able to serve Nebraska railroads in the s were strong boosters of lands along their routes They sent agents to Germany and Scandinavia with package deals that included cheap transportation for the family as well as its furniture and farm tools and they offered long term credit at low rates Boosterism succeeded in attracting adventurous American and European families to Nebraska helping them purchase land grant parcels on good terms The selling price depended on such factors as soil quality water and distance from the railroad br The Morrill Act of provided land grants to states to begin colleges of agriculture and mechanical arts engineering Black colleges became eligible for these land grants in The Act succeeded in its goals to open new universities and make farming more scientific and profitable br br br Transcontinental railroads br br In the s the U S government sponsored surveys that charted the remaining unexplored regions of the West in order to plan possible routes for a transcontinental railroad Much of this work was undertaken by the Corps of Engineers Corps of Topographical Engineers and Bureau of Explorations and Surveys and became known as The Great Reconnaissance Regionalism animated debates in Congress regarding the choice of a northern central or southern route Engineering requirements for the rail route were an adequate supply of water and wood and as nearly level route as possible given the weak locomotives of the era br br Proposals to build a transcontinental failed because of Congressional disputes over slavery With the secession of the Confederate states in the modernizers in the Republican party took over Congress and wanted a line to link to California Private companies were to build and operate the line Construction would be done by unskilled laborers who would live in temporary camps along the way Immigrants from China and Ireland did most of the construction work Theodore Judah the chief engineer of the Central Pacific surveyed the route from San Francisco east Judah s tireless lobbying efforts in Washington were largely responsible for the passage of the Pacific Railroad Act which authorized construction of both the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific which built west from Omaha In four rich San Francisco merchants Leland Stanford Collis Huntington Charles Crocker and Mark Hopkins took charge with Crocker in charge of construction The line was completed in May Coast to coast passenger travel in days now replaced wagon trains or sea voyages that took to months and cost much more br The road was built with mortgages from New York Boston and London backed by land grants There were no federal cash subsidies But there was a loan to the Central Pacific that was eventually repaid at six percent interest The federal government offered land grants in a checkerboard pattern The railroad sold every other square with the government opening its half to homesteaders The government also loaned money later repaid at per mile on level stretches and to in mountainous terrain Local and state governments also aided the financing br Most of the manual laborers on the Central Pacific were new arrivals from China Kraus shows how these men lived and worked and how they managed their money He concludes that senior officials quickly realized the high degree of cleanliness and reliability of the Chinese The Central Pacific employed over Chinese workers of its manual workforce Ong explores whether or not the Chinese railroad workers were exploited by the railroad with whites in better positions He finds the railroad set different wage rates for whites and Chinese and used the latter in the more menial and dangerous jobs such as the handling and the pouring of nitroglycerin However the railroad also provided camps and food the Chinese wanted and protected the Chinese workers from threats from whites br br Building the railroad required six main activities surveying the route blasting a right of way building tunnels and bridges clearing and laying the roadbed laying the ties and rails and maintaining and supplying the crews with food and tools The work was highly physical using horse drawn plows and scrapers and manual picks axes sledgehammers and handcarts A few steam driven machines such as shovels were used The rails were iron steel came a few years later weighed lb kg and required five men to lift For blasting they used black powder The Union Pacific construction crews mostly Irish Americans averaged about two miles km of new track per day br Six transcontinental railroads were built in the Gilded Age plus two in Canada they opened up the West to farmers and ranchers From north to south they were the Northern Pacific Milwaukee Road and Great Northern along the Canada U S border the Union Pacific Central Pacific in the middle and to the south the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific All but the Great Northern of James J Hill relied on land grants The financial stories were often complex For example the Northern Pacific received its major land grant in Financier Jay Cooke was in charge until when he went bankrupt Federal courts however kept bankrupt railroads in operation In Henry Villard took over and finally completed the line to Seattle But the line went bankrupt in the Panic of and Hill took it over He then merged several lines with financing from J P Morgan but President Theodore Roosevelt broke them up in br In the first year of operation passengers made the long trip Settlers were encouraged with promotions to come West on free scouting trips to buy railroad land on easy terms spread over several years The railroads had Immigration Bureaus which advertised package low cost deals including passage and land on easy terms for farmers in Germany and Scandinavia The prairies they were promised did not mean backbreaking toil because settling on the prairie which is ready for the plow is different from plunging into a region covered with timber The settlers were customers of the railroads shipping their crops and cattle out and bringing in manufactured products All manufacturers benefited from the lower costs of transportation and the much larger radius of business br White concludes with a mixed verdict The transcontinentals did open up the West to settlement brought in many thousands of high tech highly paid workers and managers created thousands of towns and cities oriented the nation onto an east west axis and proved highly valuable for the nation as a whole On the other hand too many were built and they were built too far ahead of actual demand The result was a bubble that left heavy losses to investors and led to poor management practices By contrast as White notes the lines in the Midwest and East supported by a very large population base fostered farming industry and mining while generating steady profits and receiving few government benefits br br br Migration after the Civil War br br After the Civil War many from the East Coast and Europe were lured west by reports from relatives and by extensive advertising campaigns promising the Best Prairie Lands Low Prices Large Discounts For Cash and Better Terms Than Ever The new railroads provided the opportunity for migrants to go out and take a look with special family tickets the cost of which could be applied to land purchases offered by the railroads Farming the plains was indeed more difficult than back east Water management was more critical lightning fires were more prevalent the weather was more extreme rainfall was less predictable br The fearful stayed home The actual migrants looked beyond fears of the unknown Their chief motivation to move west was to find a better economic life than the one they had Farmers sought larger cheaper and more fertile land merchants and tradesmen sought new customers and new leadership opportunities Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions As settlers moved west they had to face challenges along the way such as the lack of wood for housing bad weather like blizzards and droughts and fearsome tornadoes In the treeless prairies homesteaders built sod houses One of the greatest plagues that hit the homesteaders was the Locust Plague which devastated the Great Plains These challenges hardened these settlers in taming the frontier br br br Alaska Purchase br br After Russia s defeat in the Crimean War Tsar Alexander II of Russia decided to sell the Russian American territory of Alaska to the United States The decision was motivated in part by a need for money and in part a recognition amongst the Russian state that Britain could easily capture Alaska in any future conflict between the two nations U S Secretary of State William Seward negotiated with the Russians to acquire the tremendous landmass of Alaska an area roughly one fifth the size of the rest of the United States On March the U S purchased the territory from the Russians for million million in dollars The transfer ceremony was completed in Sitka on October as Russian soldiers handed over the territory to the United States Army br Critics at the time decried the purchase as Seward s Folly reasoning that there were no natural resources in the new territory and no one can be bothered to live in such a cold icy climate Although the development and settlement of Alaska grew slowly the discovery of goldfields during the Klondike Gold Rush in Nome Gold Rush in and Fairbanks Gold Rush in brought thousands of miners into the territory thus propelling Alaska s prosperity for decades to come Major oil discoveries in the late th century made the state rich br br br Oklahoma Land Rush br br In Washington opened acres km of unoccupied lands in the Oklahoma territory On April over settlers and cattlemen known as boomers lined up at the border and when the army s guns and bugles giving the signal began a mad dash to stake their claims in the Land Run of A witness wrote The horsemen had the best of it from the start It was a fine race for a few minutes but soon the riders began to spread out like a fan and by the time they reached the horizon they were scattered about as far as the eye could see In a single day the towns of Oklahoma City Norman and Guthrie came into existence In the same manner millions of acres of additional land were opened up and settled in the following four years br br br Indian Wars br br Indian wars have occurred throughout the United States though the conflicts are generally separated into two categories the Indian wars east of the Mississippi River and the Indian wars west of the Mississippi The U S Bureau of the Census provided an estimate of deaths br br The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more than in number They have cost the lives of about white men women and children including those killed in individual combats and the lives of about Indians The actual number of killed and wounded Indians must be very much higher than the given Fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate br Historian Russell Thornton estimates that from to the Native population declined from to as few as The depopulation was principally caused by disease as well as warfare Many tribes in Texas such as the Karankawan Akokisa Bidui and others were extinguished due to conflicts with Texan settlers The rapid depopulation of the Native Americans after the Civil War alarmed the U S government and the Doolittle Committee was formed to investigate the causes as well as provide recommendations for preserving the population The solutions presented by the committee such as the establishment of the five boards of inspection to prevent Native abuses had little effect as large Western migration commenced br br br Indian Wars east of the Mississippi br br br Trail of Tears br br The expansion of migration into the Southeastern United States in the s to the s forced the federal government to deal with the Indian question The Natives were under federal control but were independent of state governments State legislatures and state judges had no authority on their lands and the states demanded control Politically the new Democratic Party of President Andrew Jackson demanded the removal of the Natives out of the southeastern states to new lands in the west while the Whig Party and the Protestant churches were opposed to removal The Jacksonian Democracy proved irresistible as it won the presidential elections of and By the Indian Removal policy began to implement the act of Congress signed by Andrew Jackson in Many historians have sharply attacked Jackson The law theoretically provided for voluntary removal and had safeguards for the rights of Natives but in reality the removal was involuntary brutal and ignored safeguards Jackson justified his actions by stating that Natives had neither the intelligence the industry the moral habits nor the desire of improvements br The forced march of about twenty tribes included the Five Civilized Tribes Cherokee Chickasaw Choctaw Creek and Seminole To motivate Natives reluctant to move the federal government also promised rifles blankets tobacco and cash By the Cherokee the last Native nation in the South had signed the removal treaty and relocated to Oklahoma All the tribes were given new land in the Indian Territory which later became Oklahoma Of the approximate Natives removed about died from disease starvation and exposure on the route This exodus has become known as the Trail of Tears in Cherokee Nunna dual Tsuny The Trail Where they Cried The impact of the removals was severe The transplanted tribes had considerable difficulty adapting to their new surroundings and sometimes clashed with the tribes native to the area br The only way for a Native to remain and avoid removal was to accept the federal offer of acres km or more of land depending on family size in exchange for leaving the tribe and becoming a state citizen subject to state law and federal law However many Natives who took the offer were defrauded by ravenous speculators who stole their claims and sold their land to whites In Mississippi alone fraudulent claims reached acres km Of the five tribes the Seminole offered the most resistance hiding out in the Florida swamps and waging a war which cost the U S Army lives and million br br br Indian Wars west of the Mississippi br br Native warriors in the West using their traditional style of limited battle oriented warfare confronted the U S Army The Natives emphasized bravery in combat while the Army put its emphasis not so much on individual combat as on building networks of forts developing a logistics system and using the telegraph and railroads to coordinate and concentrate its forces Plains Indian intertribal warfare bore no resemblance to the modern warfare practiced by the Americans along European lines using its vast advantages in population and resources Many tribes avoided warfare and others supported the U S Army The tribes hostile to the government continued to pursue their traditional brand of fighting and therefore were unable to have any permanent success against the Army br Indian wars were fought throughout the western regions with more conflicts in the states bordering Mexico than in the interior states Arizona ranked highest with known battles fought within the state s boundaries between Americans and the Natives Arizona ranked highest in war deaths with killed including soldiers civilians and Native Americans That was more than twice as many as occurred in Texas the second highest ranking state Most of the deaths in Arizona were caused by the Apache Michno also says that fifty one percent of the Indian war battles between and took place in Arizona Texas and New Mexico as well as thirty seven percent of the casualties in the county west of the Mississippi River The Comanche fought a number of conflicts against Spanish and later Mexican and American armies Comanche power peaked in the s when they conducted large scale raids hundreds of miles into Mexico proper while also warring against the Anglo Americans and Tejanos who had settled in independent Texas br One of the deadliest Indian wars fought was the Snake War in which was conducted by a confederacy of Northern Paiute Bannock and Shoshone Native Americans called the Snake Indians against the United States Army in the states of Oregon Nevada California and Idaho which ran along the Snake River The war started when tension arose between the local Natives and the flooding pioneer trains encroaching through their lands which resulted in competition for food and resources Natives included in this group attacked and harassed emigrant parties and miners crossing the Snake River Valley which resulted in further retaliation of the white settlements and the intervention of the United States army The war resulted in a total of men who have been killed wounded and captured from both sides Unlike other Indian Wars the Snake War has widely forgotten in United States history due to having only limited coverage of the war br The Colorado War fought by Cheyenne Arapaho and Sioux was fought in the territories of Colorado to Nebraska The conflict was fought in while the American Civil War was still ongoing Caused by dissolution between the Natives and the white settlers in the region the war was infamous for the atrocities done between the two parties White militias destroyed Native villages and killed Native women and children such as the bloody Sand Creek massacre and the Natives also raided ranches farms and killed white families such as the American Ranch massacre and Raid on Godfrey Ranch br In the Apache Wars Colonel Christopher Kit Carson forced the Mescalero Apache onto a reservation in In Carson used a scorched earth policy in the Navajo Campaign burning Navajo fields and homes and capturing or killing their livestock He was aided by other Native tribes with long standing enmity toward the Navajos chiefly the Utes Another prominent conflict of this war was Geronimo s fight against settlements in Texas in the s The Apaches under his command conducted ambushes on US cavalries and forts such as their attack on Cibecue Creek while also raiding upon prominent farms and ranches such as their infamous attack on the Empire Ranch that killed three cowboys The U S finally induced the last hostile Apache band under Geronimo to surrender in br During the Comanche Campaign the Red River War was fought in in response to the Comanche s dwindling food supply of buffalo as well as the refusal of a few bands to be inducted in reservations Comanches started raiding small settlements in Texas which led to the Battle of Buffalo Wallow and Second Battle of Adobe Walls fought by buffalo hunters and the Battle of Lost Valley against the Texas Rangers The war finally ended with a final confrontation between the Comanches and the U S Cavalry in Palo Duro Canyon The last Comanche war chief Quanah Parker surrendered in June which would finally end the wars fought by Texans and Natives br Red Cloud s War was led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud against the military who were erecting forts along the Bozeman Trail It was the most successful campaign against the U S during the Indian Wars By the Treaty of Fort Laramie the U S granted a large reservation to the Lakota without military presence it included the entire Black Hills Captain Jack was a chief of the Native American Modoc tribe of California and Oregon and was their leader during the Modoc War With Modoc warriors Captain Jack held off men of the U S Army for months Captain Jack killed Edward Canby br br In June in the Nez Perce War the Nez Perce under Chief Joseph unwilling to give up their traditional lands and move to a reservation undertook a mile km fighting retreat from Oregon to near the Canada U S border in Montana Numbering only warriors the Nez Perce battled some American regulars and volunteers of different military units together with their Native auxiliaries of many tribes in a total of eighteen engagements including four major battles and at least four fiercely contested skirmishes The Nez Perce were finally surrounded at the Battle of Bear Paw and surrendered The Great Sioux War of was conducted by the Lakota under Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse The conflict began after repeated violations of the Treaty of Fort Laramie once gold was discovered in the hills One of its famous battles was the Battle of the Little Bighorn in which combined Sioux and Cheyenne forces defeated the th Cavalry led by General George Armstrong Custer The Ute War fought by the Ute people against settlers in Utah and Colorado led to two battles the Meeker massacre which killed Native agents and the Pinhook massacre which killed armed ranchers and cowboys The Ute conflicts finally ended after the events of the Posey War in which was fought against settlers and law enforcement br The end of the major Indian wars came at the Wounded Knee massacre on December where the th Cavalry attempted to disarm a Sioux man and precipitated a massacre in which about Sioux men women and children were killed Only thirteen days before Sitting Bull had been killed with his son Crow Foot in a gun battle with a group of Native police that had been sent by the American government to arrest him Additional conflicts and incidents though such as the Bluff War and Posey War would occur into the early s The last combat engagement between U S Army soldiers and Native Americans though occurred in the Battle of Bear Valley on January br br br Forts and outposts br As the frontier moved westward the establishment of U S military forts moved with it representing and maintaining federal sovereignty over new territories The military garrisons usually lacked defensible walls but were seldom attacked They served as bases for troops at or near strategic areas particularly for counteracting the Native presence For example Fort Bowie protected Apache Pass in southern Arizona along the mail route between Tucson and El Paso and was used to launch attacks against Cochise and Geronimo Fort Laramie and Fort Kearny helped protect immigrants crossing the Great Plains and a series of posts in California protected miners Forts were constructed to launch attacks against the Sioux As Indian reservations sprang up the military set up forts to protect them Forts also guarded the Union Pacific and other rail lines Other important forts were Fort Sill Oklahoma Fort Smith Arkansas Fort Snelling Minnesota Fort Union New Mexico Fort Worth Texas and Fort Walla Walla in Washington Fort Omaha Nebraska was home to the Department of the Platte and was responsible for outfitting most Western posts for more than years after its founding in the late s Fort Huachuca in Arizona was also originally a frontier post and is still in use by the United States Army br br br Indian reservations br br Settlers on their way overland to Oregon and California became targets of Native threats Robert L Munkres read diaries of parties traveling the Oregon Trail between and to estimate the actual dangers they faced from Native attacks in Nebraska and Wyoming The vast majority of diarists reported no armed attacks at all However many did report harassment by Natives who begged or demanded tolls and stole horses and cattle Madsen reports that the Shoshoni and Bannock tribes north and west of Utah were more aggressive toward wagon trains The federal government attempted to reduce tensions and create new tribal boundaries in the Great Plains with two new treaties in early The Treaty of Fort Laramie established tribal zones for the Sioux Cheyennes Arapahos Crows and others and allowed for the building of roads and posts across the tribal lands A second treaty secured safe passage along the Santa Fe Trail for wagon trains In return the tribes would receive for ten years annual compensation for damages caused by migrants The Kansas and Nebraska territories also became contentious areas as the federal government sought those lands for the future transcontinental railroad In the Far West settlers began to occupy land in Oregon and California before the federal government secured title from the native tribes causing considerable friction In Utah the Mormons also moved in before federal ownership was obtained br A new policy of establishing reservations came gradually into shape after the boundaries of the Indian Territory began to be ignored In providing for Indian reservations Congress and the Office of Indian Affairs hoped to de tribalize Native Americans and prepare them for integration with the rest of American society the ultimate incorporation into the great body of our citizen population This allowed for the development of dozens of riverfront towns along the Missouri River in the new Nebraska Territory which was carved from the remainder of the Louisiana Purchase after the Kansas Nebraska Act Influential pioneer towns included Omaha Nebraska City and St Joseph br American attitudes towards Natives during this period ranged from malevolence the only good Indian is a dead Indian to misdirected humanitarianism Indians live in inferior societies and by assimilation into white society they can be redeemed to somewhat realistic Native Americans and settlers could co exist in separate but equal societies dividing up the remaining western land Dealing with nomadic tribes complicated the reservation strategy and decentralized tribal power made treaty making difficult among the Plains Indians Conflicts erupted in the s resulting in various Indian wars In these times of conflict Natives become more stringent about white men entering their territory Such as in the case of Oliver Loving they would sometimes attack cowboys and their cattle if ever caught crossing in the borders of their land They would also prey upon livestock if the food was scarce during hard times However the relationship between cowboys and Native Americans were more mutual than they are portrayed and the former would occasionally pay a fine of cents per cow for the latter to allow them to travel through their land Natives also preyed upon stagecoaches travelling in the frontier for its horses and valuables br After the Civil War as the volunteer armies disbanded the regular army cavalry regiments increased in number from six to ten among them Custer s U S th Cavalry Regiment of Little Bighorn fame and the African American U S th Cavalry Regiment and U S th Cavalry Regiment The black units along with others both cavalry and infantry collectively became known as the Buffalo Soldiers According to Robert M Utley br br The frontier army was a

difficult of all military assignments whether in Africa Asia or the American West br br br Social history br br br Democratic society br br Westerners were proud of their leadership in the movement for democracy and equality a major theme for Frederick Jackson Turner The new states of Kentucky Tennessee Alabama and Ohio were more democratic than the parent states back East in terms of politics and society The Western states were the first to give women the right to vote By the West especially California and Oregon led the Progressive movement br Scholars have examined the social history of the west in search of the American character The history of Kansas argued historian Carl L Becker a century ago reflects American ideals He wrote The Kansas spirit is the American spirit double distilled It is a new grafted product of American individualism American idealism American intolerance Kansas is America in microcosm br Scholars have compared the emergence of democracy in America with other countries regarding the frontier experience Selwyn Troen has made the comparison with Israel The American frontiersmen relied on individual effort in the context of very large quantities of unsettled land with weak external enemies Israel by contrast operated in a very small geographical zone surrounded by more powerful neighbors The Jewish pioneer was not building an individual or family enterprise but was a conscious participant in nation building with a high priority on collective and cooperative planned settlements The Israeli pioneers brought in American experts on irrigation and agriculture to provide technical advice However they rejected the American frontier model in favor of a European model that supported their political and security concerns br br br Urban frontier br The cities played an essential role in the development of the frontier as transportation hubs financial and communications centers and providers of merchandise services and entertainment As the railroads pushed westward into the unsettled territory after they build service towns to handle the needs of railroad construction crews train crews and passengers who ate meals at scheduled stops In most of the South there were very few cities of any size for miles around and this pattern held for Texas as well so railroads did not arrive until the s They then shipped the cattle out and cattle drives became short distance affairs However the passenger trains were often the targets of armed gangs br br Denver s economy before had been rooted in mining it then grew by expanding its role in railroads wholesale trade manufacturing food processing and servicing the growing agricultural and ranching hinterland Between and manufacturing output soared from to million and the population grew by a factor of times to Denver had always attracted miners workers whores and travelers Saloons and gambling dens sprung up overnight The city fathers boasted of its fine theaters and especially the Tabor Grand Opera House built in By Denver had grown to be the th largest city in America and the fifth largest city west of the Mississippi River The boom times attracted millionaires and their mansions as well as hustlers poverty and crime Denver gained regional notoriety with its range of bawdy houses from the sumptuous quarters of renowned madams to the squalid cribs located a few blocks away Business was good visitors spent lavishly then left town As long as madams conducted their business discreetly and crib girls did not advertise their availability too crudely authorities took their bribes and looked the other way Occasional cleanups and crack downs satisfied the demands for reform br With its giant mountain of copper Butte Montana was the largest richest and rowdiest mining camp on the frontier It was an ethnic stronghold with the Irish Catholics in control of politics and of the best jobs at the leading mining corporation Anaconda Copper City boosters opened a public library in Ring argues that the library was originally a mechanism of social control an antidote to the miners proclivity for drinking whoring and gambling It was also designed to promote middle class values and to convince Easterners that Butte was a cultivated city br br br Race and ethnicity br br br European immigrants br br European immigrants often built communities of similar religious and ethnic backgrounds For example many Finns went to Minnesota and Michigan Swedes and Norwegians to Minnesota and the Dakotas Irish to railroad centers along the

came to California in Gold Rush days In after the end of Reconstruction in the South several thousand Freedmen moved from Southern states to Kansas Known as the Exodusters they were lured by the prospect of good cheap Homestead Law land and better treatment The all black town of Nicodemus Kansas which was founded in was an organized settlement that predates the Exodusters but is often associated with them br br br Asians br br The California Gold Rush included thousands of Mexican and Chinese arrivals Chinese migrants many of whom were impoverished peasants provided the major part of the workforce for the building of the Central Pacific portion of the transcontinental railroad Most of them went home by when the railroad was finished Those who stayed on worked in mining agriculture and opened small shops such as groceries laundries and restaurants Hostility against the Chinese remained high in the western states territories as seen by the Chinese Massacre Cove episode and the Rock Springs massacre The Chinese were generally forced into self sufficient Chinatowns in cities such as San Francisco Portland Seattle and Los Angeles In Los Angeles the last major anti Chinese riot took place in after which local law enforcement grew stronger In the late th century Chinatowns were squalid slums known for their vice prostitution drugs and violent battles between

Placer County California to establish the Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Farm Colony Japanese were recruited to work on plantations in Hawaii beginning in By the late th century more Japanese emigrated to

br br br Family life br On the Great Plains very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch farmers clearly understood the need for a hard working wife and numerous children to handle the many chores including child rearing feeding and clothing the family managing the housework and feeding the hired hands During the early years of settlement farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors After a generation or so women increasingly left the fields thus redefining their roles within the family New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles The scientific housekeeping movement promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning advice columns for women in the farm papers and home economics courses in the schools all contributed to this trend br Although the eastern image of farm life on the prairies emphasizes the isolation of the lonely farmer and farm life in reality rural folk created a rich social life for themselves They often sponsored activities that combined work food and entertainment such as barn raisings corn huskings quilting bees Grange meetings church activities and school functions The womenfolk organized shared meals and potluck events as well as extended visits between families br br br Childhood br Childhood on the American frontier is contested territory One group of scholars following the lead of novelists Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder argue the rural environment was beneficial to the child s upbringing Historians Katherine Harris and Elliott West write that rural upbringing allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender promoted family interdependence and at the end produced children who were more self reliant mobile adaptable responsible independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts On the other hand historians Elizabeth Hampsten and Lillian Schlissel offer a grim portrait of loneliness privation abuse and demanding physical labor from an early age Riney Kehrberg takes a middle position br br br Prostitution and gambling br br Entrepreneurs set up shops and businesses to cater to the miners World famous were the houses of prostitution found in every mining camp worldwide Prostitution was a growth industry attracting sex workers from around the globe pulled in by the money despite the harsh and dangerous working conditions and low prestige Chinese women were frequently sold by their families and taken to the camps as prostitutes they had to send their earnings back to the family in China In Virginia City Nevada a prostitute Julia Bulette was one of the few who achieved respectable status She nursed victims of an influenza epidemic this gave her acceptance in the community and the support of the sheriff The townspeople were shocked when she was murdered in they gave her a lavish funeral and speedily tried and hanged her assailant Until the s madams predominantly ran the businesses after which male pimps took over and the treatment of the women generally declined It was not uncommon for bordellos in Western towns to operate openly without the stigma of East Coast cities Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns and only later as the female population increased reformers moved in and other civilizing influences arrived did prostitution become less blatant and less common After a decade or so the mining towns attracted respectable women who ran boarding houses organized church societies worked as laundresses and seamstresses and strove for independent status br Whenever a new settlement or mining camp started one of the first buildings or tents erected would be a gambling hall As the population grew gambling halls were typically the largest and most ornately decorated buildings in any town and often housed a bar stage for entertainment and hotel rooms for guests These establishments were a driving force behind the local economy and many towns measured their prosperity by the number of gambling halls and professional gamblers they had Towns that were friendly to gambling were typically known to sports as wide awake or wide open Cattle towns in Texas Oklahoma Kansas and Nebraska became famous centers of gambling The cowboys had been accumulating their wages and postponing their pleasures until they finally arrived in town with money to wager Abilene Dodge City Wichita Omaha and Kansas City all had an atmosphere that was convivial to gaming Such an atmosphere also invited trouble and such towns also developed reputations as lawless and dangerous places br br br Law and order br br Historian Waddy W Moore uses court records to show that on the sparsely settled Arkansas frontier lawlessness was common He distinguished two types of crimes unprofessional dueling crimes of drunkenness selling whiskey to the Natives cutting trees on federal land and professional rustling highway robbery counterfeiting Criminals found many opportunities to rob pioneer families of their possessions while the few underfunded lawmen had great difficulty detecting arresting holding and convicting wrongdoers Bandits typically in groups of two or three rarely attacked stagecoaches with a guard carrying a sawed off double barreled shotgun it proved less risky to rob teamsters people on foot and solitary horsemen while bank robberies themselves were harder to pull off due to the security of the establishment According to historian Brian Robb the earliest form of organized crime in America was born from the gangs of the Old West br When criminals were convicted the punishment was severe Aside from the occasional Western sheriff and Marshal there were other various law enforcement agencies throughout the American frontier such as the Texas Rangers These lawmen were not just instrumental in keeping the peace but also in protecting the locals from Native and Mexican threats at the border Law enforcement tended to be more stringent in towns than in rural areas Law enforcement emphasized maintaining stability more than armed combat focusing on drunkenness disarming cowboys who violated gun control edicts and dealing with flagrant breaches of gambling and prostitution ordinances br Dykstra argues that the violent image of the cattle towns in film and fiction is largely a myth The real Dodge City he says was the headquarters for the buffalo hide trade of the Southern Plains and one of the West s principal cattle towns a sale and shipping point for cattle arriving from Texas He states there is a second Dodge City that belongs to the popular imagination and thrives as a cultural metaphor for violence chaos and depravity For the cowboy arriving with money in hand after two months on the trail the town was exciting A contemporary eyewitness of Hays City Kansas paints a vivid image of this cattle town br br Hays City by lamplight was remarkably lively but not very moral The streets blazed with a reflection from saloons and a glance within showed floors crowded with dancers the gaily dressed women striving to hide with ribbons and paint the terrible lines which that grim artist Dissipation loves to draw upon such faces To the music of violins and the stamping of feet the dance went on and we saw in the giddy maze old men who must have been pirouetting on the very edge of their graves br It has been acknowledged that the popular portrayal of Dodge City in film and fiction carries a note of truth however as gun crime was rampant in the city before the establishment of a local government Soon after the city s residents officially established their first municipal government however a law banning concealed firearms was enacted and crime was reduced soon afterward Similar laws were passed in other frontier towns to reduce the rate of gun crime as well As UCLA law professor Adam Wrinkler noted br br Carrying of guns within the city limits of a frontier town was generally prohibited Laws barring people from carrying weapons were commonplace from Dodge City to Tombstone When Dodge City residents first formed their municipal government one of the very first laws enacted was a ban on concealed carry The ban was soon after expanded to open carry too The Hollywood image of the gunslinger marching through town with two Colts on his hips is just that a Hollywood image created for its dramatic effect br Tombstone Arizona was a turbulent mining town that flourished longer than most from to Silver was discovered in and by the town had a population of over In the newly arrived Earp brothers bought shares in the Vizina mine water rights and gambling concessions but Virgil Wyatt and Morgan Earp obtained positions at different times as federal and local lawmen After more than a year of threats and feuding they along with Doc Holliday killed three outlaws in the Gunfight at the O K Corral the most famous gunfight of the Old West In the aftermath Virgil Earp was maimed in an ambush and Morgan Earp was assassinated while playing billiards Wyatt and others including his brothers James Earp and Warren Earp pursued those they believed responsible in an extra legal vendetta and warrants were issued for their arrest in the murder of Frank Stilwell The Cochise County Cowboys were one of the first organized crime syndicates in the United States and their demise came at the hands of Wyatt Earp br Western story tellers and film makers featured the gunfight in many Western productions Walter Noble Burns s novel Tombstone made Earp famous Hollywood celebrated Earp s Tombstone days with John Ford s My Darling Clementine John Sturges s Gunfight at the O K Corral and Hour of the Gun Frank Perry s Doc George Cosmatos s Tombstone and Lawrence Kasdan s Wyatt Earp They solidified Earp s modern reputation as the Old West s deadliest gunman br br br Banditry br br The major type of banditry was conducted by the infamous outlaws of the West including the James Younger Gang Billy the Kid the Dalton Gang Black Bart Sam Bass Butch Cassidy s Wild Bunch and hundreds of others who preyed on banks trains stagecoaches and in some cases even armed government transports such as the Wham Paymaster robbery and the Skeleton Canyon robbery Some of the outlaws such as Jesse James were products of the violence of the Civil War James had ridden with Quantrill s Raiders and others became outlaws during hard times in the cattle industry Many were misfits and drifters who roamed the West avoiding the law In rural areas Joaquin Murieta Jack Powers Augustine Chacon and other bandits terrorized the state When outlaw gangs were near towns would occasionally raise a posse to drive them out or capture them Seeing that the need to combat the bandits was a growing business opportunity Allan Pinkerton ordered his National Detective Agency founded in to open branches in the West and they got into the business of pursuing and capturing outlaws To take refuge from the law outlaws would use the advantages of the open range remote passes and badlands to hide While some settlements and towns in the frontier also house outlaws and criminals which were called outlaw towns br Banditry was a major issue in California after as thousands of young men detached from family or community moved into a land with few law enforcement mechanisms To combat this the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance was established to give drumhead trials and death sentences to well known offenders As such other earlier settlements created their private agencies to protect communities due to the lack of peace keeping establishments These vigilance committees reflected different occupations in the frontier such as land clubs cattlemen s associations and mining camps Similar vigilance committees also existed in Texas and their main objective was to stamp out lawlessness and rid communities of desperadoes and rustlers These committees would sometimes form mob rule for private vigilante groups but usually were made up of responsible citizens who wanted only to maintain order Criminals caught by these vigilance committees were treated cruelly often hung or shot without any form of trial br Civilians also took arms to defend themselves in the Old West sometimes siding with lawmen Coffeyville Bank Robbery or siding with outlaws Battle of Ingalls In the Post Civil War frontier over whites blacks and others were victims of lynching However cases of lynching in the Old West wasn t primarily caused by the absence of a legal system but also because of social class Historian Michael J Pfeifer writes Contrary to the popular understanding early territorial lynching did not flow from an absence or distance of law enforcement but rather from the social instability of early communities and their contest for property status and the definition of social order br br br Feuds br br Range wars were infamous armed conflicts that took place in the open range of the American frontier The subject of these conflicts was the control of lands freely used for farming and cattle grazing which gave the conflict its name Range wars became more common by the end of the American Civil War and numerous conflicts were fought such as the Pleasant Valley War Johnson County War Pecos War Mason County War Colorado Range War Fence Cutting War Colfax County War Castaic Range War Spring Creek raid Porum Range War Barber Mizell feud San Elizario Salt War and others During a range war in Montana a vigilante group called Stuart s Stranglers which were made up of cattlemen and cowboys killed up to criminals and range squatters in alone In Nebraska stock grower Isom Olive led a range war in that killed a number of homesteaders from lynchings and shootouts before eventually leading to his own murder Another infamous type of open range conflict were the Sheep Wars which were fought between sheep ranchers and cattle ranchers over grazing rights and mainly occurred in Texas Arizona and the border region of Wyoming and Colorado In most cases formal military involvement were used to quickly put an end to these conflicts Other conflicts over land and territory were also fought such as the Regulator Moderator War Cortina Troubles Las Cuevas War and the Bandit War br Feuds involving families and bloodlines also occurred much in the frontier Since private agencies and vigilance committees were the substitute for proper courts many families initially depended on themselves and their communities for their security and justice These wars include the Lincoln County War Tutt Everett War Flynn Doran feud Early Hasley feud Brooks Baxter War Sutton Taylor feud Horrell Brothers feud Brooks McFarland Feud Reese Townsend feud and the Earp Vendetta Ride br br br Cattle br br The end of the bison herds opened up millions of acres for cattle ranching Spanish cattlemen had introduced cattle ranching and longhorn cattle to the Southwest in the th century and the men who worked the ranches called vaqueros were the first cowboys in the West After the Civil War Texas ranchers raised large herds of longhorn cattle The nearest railheads were or more miles km north in Kansas Abilene Kansas City Dodge City and Wichita So once fattened the ranchers and their cowboys drove the herds north along the Western Chisholm and Shawnee trails The cattle were shipped to Chicago St Louis and points east for slaughter and consumption in the fast growing cities The Chisholm Trail laid out by cattleman Joseph McCoy along an old trail marked by Jesse Chisholm was the major artery of cattle commerce carrying over million head of cattle between and over the miles km from south Texas to Abilene Kansas The long drives were treacherous especially crossing water such as the Brazos and the Red River and when they had to fend off Natives and rustlers looking to make off with their cattle A typical drive would take three to four months and contained two miles km of cattle six abreast Despite the risks a successful drive proved very profitable to everyone involved as the price of one steer was in Texas and in the East br By the s and s cattle ranches expanded further north into new grazing grounds and replaced the bison herds in Wyoming Montana Colorado Nebraska and the Dakota territory using the rails to ship to both coasts Many of the largest ranches were owned by Scottish and English financiers The single largest cattle ranch in the entire West was owned by American John W Iliff cattle king of the Plains operating in Colorado and Wyoming Gradually longhorns were replaced by the British breeds of Hereford and Angus introduced by settlers from the Northwest Though less hardy and more disease prone these breeds produced better tasting beef and matured faster br The funding for the cattle industry came largely from British sources as the European investors engaged in a speculative extravaganza a bubble Graham concludes the mania was founded on genuine opportunity as well as exaggeration gullibility inadequate communications dishonesty and incompetence A severe winter engulfed the plains toward the end of and well into locking the prairie grass under ice and crusted snow which starving herds could not penetrate The British lost most of their money as did eastern investors like Theodore Roosevelt but their investments did create a large industry that continues to cycle through boom and bust periods br On a much smaller scale sheep grazing was locally popular sheep were easier to feed and needed less water However Americans did not eat mutton As farmers moved in open range cattle ranching came to an end and was replaced by barbed wire spreads where water breeding feeding and grazing could be controlled This led to fence wars which erupted over disputes about water rights br br br Cowtowns br br Anchoring the booming cattle industry of the s and s were the cattle towns in Kansas and Missouri Like the mining towns in California and Nevada cattle towns such as Abilene Dodge City and Ellsworth experienced a short period of boom and bust lasting about five years The cattle towns would spring up as land speculators would rush in ahead of a proposed rail line and build a town and the supporting services attractive to the cattlemen and the cowboys If the railroads complied the new grazing ground and supporting town would secure the cattle trade However unlike the mining towns which in many cases became ghost towns and ceased to exist after the ore played out cattle towns often evolved from cattle to farming and continued after the grazing lands were exhausted br br br Conservation and environmentalism br br The concern with the protection of the environment became a new issue in the late th century pitting different interests On the one side were the lumber and coal companies who called for maximum exploitation of natural resources to maximize jobs economic growth and their own profit br In the center were the conservationists led by Theodore Roosevelt and his coalition of outdoorsmen sportsmen bird watchers and scientists They wanted to reduce waste emphasized the value of natural beauty for tourism and ample wildlife for hunters and argued that careful management would not only enhance these goals but also increase the long term economic benefits to society by planned harvesting and environmental protections Roosevelt worked his entire career to put the issue high on the national agenda He was deeply committed to conserving natural resources He worked closely with Gifford Pinchot and used the Newlands Reclamation Act of to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed million acres mi or km under federal protection Roosevelt set aside more Federal land national parks and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined br Roosevelt explained his position in br br Conservation means development as much as it does protection I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land but I do not recognize the right to waste them or to rob by wasteful use the generations that come after us br The third element smallest at first but growing rapidly after were the environmentalists who honored nature for its own sake and rejected the goal of maximizing human benefits Their leader was John Muir a widely read author and naturalist and pioneer advocate of preservation of wilderness for its own sake and founder of the Sierra Club Muir a Scottish American based in California in started organizing support to preserve the sequoias in the Yosemite Valley Congress did pass the Yosemite National Park bill In President Grover Cleveland created thirteen protected forests but lumber interests had Congress cancel the move Muir taking the persona of an Old Testament prophet crusaded against the lumberman portraying it as a contest between landscape righteousness and the devil A master publicist Muir s magazine articles in Harper s Weekly June and the Atlantic Monthly turned the tide of public sentiment He mobilized public opinion to support Roosevelt s program of setting aside national monuments national forest reserves and national parks However Muir broke with Roosevelt and especially President William Howard Taft on the Hetch Hetchy dam which was built in the Yosemite National Park to supply water to San Francisco Biographer Donald Worster says Saving the American soul from a total surrender to materialism was the cause for which he fought br br br Buffalo br br The rise of the cattle industry and the cowboy is directly tied to the demise of the huge herds of bison usually called the buffalo Once numbering over million on the Great Plains the grass eating herds were a vital resource animal for the Plains Indians providing food hides for clothing and shelter and bones for implements Loss of habitat disease and over hunting steadily reduced the herds through the th century to the point of near extinction The last million died out in a decade only survived The tribes that depended on the buffalo had little choice but to accept the government offer of reservations where the government would feed and supply them Conservationists founded the American Bison Society in it lobbied Congress to establish public bison herds Several national parks in the U S and Canada were created in part to provide a sanctuary for bison and other large wildlife The bison population reached by br br br End of the frontier br br Following the U S census the superintendent announced that there was no longer a clear line of advancing settlement and hence no longer a contiguous frontier in the continental United States When examining the later U S census population distribution results though the contiguous frontier line does remain But by the U S census only pockets of the frontier remain without a clear westward line allowing travel across the continent without ever crossing a frontier line br Virgin farmland was increasingly hard to find after although the railroads advertised some in eastern Montana Bicha shows that nearly American farmers sought cheap land by moving to the Prairie frontier of the Canadian West from to However about two thirds of them grew disillusioned and returned to the U S Despite this homesteaders claimed more land in the first two decades of the th century than the th century The Homestead Acts and proliferation of railroads are often credited as being important factors in shrinking the frontier by efficiently bringing in settlers and required infrastructure The increased size of land grants from to acres in and then rangeland to acres in accelerated this process Barbed wire is also reasoned to reduce the traditional open range In addition the growing adoption of automobiles and their required network of adequate roads first federally subsidized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of solidified the frontier s end br The admission of Oklahoma as a state in upon the combination of the Oklahoma Territory and the last remaining Indian Territory and the Arizona and New Mexico territories as states in marks the end of the frontier story for many scholars Due to their low and uneven populations during this period though frontier territory remained for the meantime Of course a few typical frontier episodes still happened such as the last stagecoach robbery occurred in Nevada s remaining frontier in December A period known as The Western Civil War of Incorporation that often was violent lasted from the s to br The Mexican Revolution also led to significant conflict reaching across the US Mexico border which was still mostly within frontier territory known as the Mexican Border War Flashpoints included the Battle of Columbus and the Punitive Expedition The Bandit War involved attacks targeted against Texan settlers Also skirmishes involving Natives happened as late as the Bluff War and the Posey War br Alaska was not admitted as a state until The ethos and storyline of the American frontier had passed br br br People of the American frontier br br br Cowboys br br Central to the myth and the reality of the West is the American cowboy In actuality the life of a cowboy was a hard one and revolved around two annual roundups spring and fall the subsequent drives to market and the time off in the cattle towns spending their hard earned money on food clothing firearms gambling and prostitution During winter many cowboys hired themselves out to ranches near the cattle towns where they repaired and maintained equipment and buildings Working the cattle was not just a routine job but also a lifestyle that exulted in the freedom of the wide unsettled outdoors on horseback Long drives hired one cowboy for about head of cattle Saloons were ubiquitous outside Mormondom but on the trail the cowboys were forbidden to drink alcohol Often hired cowboys were trained and knowledgeable in their trade such as herding ranching and protecting cattle To protect their herd from wild animals hostile Natives and rustlers cowboys carried with them their iconic weaponry such as the Bowie knife lasso bullwhip revolvers rifles and shotguns br Many of the cowboys were veterans of the Civil War a diverse group they included Blacks Hispanics Native Americans and immigrants from many lands The earliest cowboys in Texas learned their trade adapted their clothing and took their jargon from the Mexican vaqueros or buckaroos the heirs of Spanish cattlemen from the middle south of Spain Chaps the heavy protective leather trousers worn by cowboys got their name from the Spanish chaparreras and the lariat or rope was derived from la reata All the distinct clothing of the cowboy boots saddles hats pants chaps slickers bandannas gloves and collar less shirts were practical and adaptable designed for protection and comfort The cowboy hat quickly developed the capability even in the early years to identify its wearer as someone associated with the West it came to symbolize the frontier The most enduring fashion adapted from the cowboy popular nearly worldwide today are blue jeans originally made by Levi Strauss for miners in br Before a drive a cowboy s duties included riding out on the range and bringing together the scattered cattle The best cattle would be selected roped and branded and most male cattle were castrated The cattle also needed to be dehorned and examined and treated for infections On the long drives the cowboys had to keep the cattle moving and in line The cattle had to be watched day and night as they were prone to stampedes and straying While camping every night cowboys would often sing to their herd to keep them calm The workdays often lasted fourteen hours with just six hours of sleep It was grueling dusty work with just a few minutes of relaxation before and at the end of a long day On the trail drinking gambling and brawling were often prohibited and fined and sometimes cursing as well It was monotonous and boring work with food to match bacon beans bread coffee dried fruit and potatoes On average cowboys earned to per month because of the heavy physical and emotional toll it was unusual for a cowboy to spend more than seven years on the range As open range ranching and the long drives gave way to fenced in ranches in the s by the s the glory days of the cowboy came to an end and the myths about the free living cowboy began to emerge br br br Miners br br In James W Marshall was building a sawmill for Sutter s Fort on the riverside of the American River when he noticed metal flakes under the waterwheel He recognized the flakes to be gold However the sawmill he was building was not his meaning that when he finished building the sawmill his client John Sutter would also notice Word quickly spread of gold in the American River leading to a surge of westward migration to California in the hope of striking it rich This was the start of the California Gold Rush The California Gold Rush had positive and negative benefits for America It simultaneously increased the population of California to almost people which helped with the modernization of California but it also reduced the population of other states Their employment rates took a hit as well as people were quitting their jobs so they could embark on their journeys The California Gold Rush finally came to an end in The extraction of gold from the river was done by dust panning with most dust panning normally done by prospectors br Even after the California Gold Rush mining was still a common occupation Most mountainside towns likely had a mineshaft Most miners were poor as mining was a very labor intensive job Miners would use pickaxes in order to mine into the mountains They mined gold zinc copper and other metals These metals were sold to shopkeepers and rich people for currency Miners were paid a salary of per day br Similarly other gold rushes happened in other territories as other expeditions were happening Events such as the Black Hills Gold Rush in the Dakota Territory following the Black Hills Expedition Or the Pike s Peak Gold Rush in the Nebraska Territory br br br Women br br Laws were less restrictive in the West for white women Western states allowed women to vote long before the eastern states did and had more liberal divorce laws Minority women did not experience the same freedoms Native women were forced onto reservations but still tried to maintain their ways of life and support their families Chinese women immigrated to work in the laundries inns and saloons of mining camps Some were sold to work in mining camps by their impoverished families in China Some women were also forced to work in the sex industry br The main occupation of women was running the household and raising children Tasks included cooking cleaning making clothes gardening and helping out on the farm Sometimes women were the sole operators of farms Women were also entrepreneurs running saloons boarding houses laundries and inns Independent women earned a living through teaching or sex work In towns with male dominated industries such as logging and mining the gender imbalance led to different roles for women Women were paid for domestic work that was traditionally unpaid br Some women also worked in predominantly male positions there were cowgirls female business owners female gunslingers and female bounty hunters br Women had less lawful protection compared to men br br br Loggers br br Being a lumberjack was a labor intensive occupation The job was a fairly common occupation to have in this era similarly to miners and railroad workers many people pursued these careers but was ultimately very dangerous Loggers were paid more than both miners and railroaders combined making every day br To cut down trees lumberjacks had many tools to help them in the process To cut down trees they would send multiple loggers depending on the size of the tree From there they would use double sided axes to chop the base of the tree After the tree collapsed if the tree was too big to chop with the double sided axes they would use a gigantic saw called a crosscut These saws could be over feet in length br And for transportation they would either float the logs down a river a profession known as log driving or use a high wheel loader to lift the massive logs that were strapped together using rope Another rope was tied to oxen then the oxen would pull the logs to wherever they needed to be br br br Frontiersmen br br The frontiersmen were the explorers of the Old West In Thomas Jefferson closed the deal of the Louisiana Purchase for million dollars With the square miles of gained territory He sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark along with other men to go explore the new territory Their expedition across the Western United States turned into the famous Lewis and Clark Expedition There were many dangers on the trail they had to travel up portage and ford rivers suffer injuries disease famine and fending off grizzly bears and hostile Native American tribes The Lewis and Clark expedition did take place before the Wild West era but it was a major event in United States history and was one of the main reasons the Wild West era began br Besides Lewis and Clark the Wild West era brought many other frontiersmen They were very self sufficient compared to normal townspeople They cleared their own land built their own shelter and farmed and foraged for their food Their nomadic lifestyle was hurtful for America s economy as unemployment made it difficult for more money to go into circulation and stores were going bankrupt from a lack of customers This also caused territorial disputes with the Native Americans For example Charles Bent s arrival into Colorado caused the Taos Revolt Bent shortly died from an assault from multiple Pueblo warriors br br br Gunfighters br br The names and exploits of Western gunslingers took a major role in American folklore fiction and film Their guns and costumes became children s toys for make believe shootouts The stories became immensely popular in Germany and other European countries which produced their novels and films about the American frontier The image of a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth based on repeated exaggerations Actual gunfights in the Old West were more episodic rather than being a common thing but when gunfights did occur the cause for each varied Some were simply the result of the heat of the moment while others were longstanding feuds or between bandits and lawmen Although mostly romanticized there were instances of quick draw that did occur though rarely such as Wild Bill Hickok Davis Tutt shootout and Luke Short Jim Courtright duel Fatal duels were fought to uphold personal honor in the West The most notable and well known took place in Arizona New Mexico Kansas Oklahoma and Texas To prevent

exploitation and conflicts of the American Old West form a unique tapestry of events which has been celebrated by Americans and foreigners alike in art music dance novels magazines short stories poetry theater video games movies radio television song and oral tradition which continues in the modern era Beth E Levy argues that the physical and mythological west inspired composers Aaron Copland Roy Harris Virgil Thomson Charles Wakefield Cadman and Arthur Farwell br Religious themes have inspired many environmentalists as they contemplate the pristine West before the frontiersmen violated its spirituality Actually as a historian William Cronon has demonstrated the concept of wilderness was highly negative and the antithesis of religiosity before the romantic movement of the th century br The Frontier Thesis of historian Frederick Jackson Turner proclaimed in established the main lines of historiography which fashioned scholarship for three or four generations and appeared in the textbooks used by practically all American students br br br Popularizing Western lore br The mythologizing of the West began with minstrel shows and popular music in the s During the same period P T Barnum presented Native chiefs dances and other Wild West exhibits in his museums However large scale awareness took off when the dime novel appeared in the first being Malaeska the Indian Wife of the White Hunter By simplifying reality and grossly exaggerating the truth the novels captured the public s attention with sensational tales of violence and heroism and fixed in the public s mind stereotypical images of heroes and villains courageous cowboys and savage Natives virtuous lawmen and ruthless outlaws brave settlers and predatory cattlemen Millions of copies and thousands of titles were sold The novels relied on a series of predictable literary formulas appealing to mass tastes and were often written in as little as a few days The most successful of all dime novels was Edward S Ellis Seth Jones Ned Buntline s stories glamorized Buffalo Bill Cody and Edward L Wheeler created Deadwood Dick and Hurricane Nell while featuring Calamity Jane br Buffalo Bill Cody was the most effective popularizer of the Old West in the U S and Europe He presented the first Wild West show in featuring a recreation of famous battles especially Custer s Last Stand expert marksmanship and dramatic demonstrations of horsemanship by cowboys and natives as well as sure shooting Annie Oakley br Elite Eastern writers and artists of the late th century promoted and celebrated western lore Theodore Roosevelt wearing his hats as a historian explorer hunter rancher and naturalist was especially productive Their work appeared in upscale national magazines such as Harper s Weekly featured illustrations by artists Frederic Remington Charles M Russell and others Readers bought action filled stories by writers like Owen Wister conveying vivid images of the Old West Remington lamented the passing of an era he helped to chronicle when he wrote br br I knew the wild riders and the vacant land were about to vanish forever I saw the living breathing end of three American centuries of smoke and dust and sweat br br br th century imagery br br Theodore Roosevelt wrote many books on the west and the frontier and made frequent reference to it as president br From the late th century the railroads promoted tourism in the west with guided tours of western sites especially national parks like Yellowstone National Park br Both tourists to the West and avid fiction readers enjoyed the visual imagery of the frontier After Western movies provided the most famous examples as in the numerous films of John Ford He was especially enamored of Monument Valley Critic Keith Phipps says its five square miles square kilometers have defined what decades of moviegoers think of when they imagine the American West The heroic stories coming out of the building of the transcontinental railroad in the mid s enlivened many dime novels and illustrated many newspapers and magazines with the juxtaposition of the traditional environment with the iron horse of modernity br br br Cowboy images br The cowboy has for over a century been an iconic American image both in the country and abroad br br Heather Cox Richardson argues for a political dimension to the cowboy image The timing of the cattle industry s growth meant that cowboy imagery grew to have extraordinary power Entangled in the vicious politics of the postwar years Democrats especially those in the old Confederacy imagined the West as a land untouched by Republican politicians they hated They developed an image of the cowboys as men who worked hard played hard lived by a code of honor protected themselves and asked nothing of the government In the hands of Democratic newspaper editors the realities of cowboy life the poverty the danger the debilitating hours became romantic Cowboys embodied virtues Democrats believed Republicans were destroying by creating a behemoth government catering to lazy ex slaves By the s cattle drives were a feature of the plains landscape and Democrats had made cowboys a symbol of rugged individual independence something they insisted Republicans were destroying br The most famous popularizers of the image included part time cowboy and Rough Rider President Theodore Roosevelt a Republican who made cowboy internationally synonymous with the brash aggressive American He was followed by trick roper Will Rogers the leading humorist of the s br Roosevelt had conceptualized the herder cowboy as a stage of civilization distinct from the sedentary farmer a theme well expressed in the Hollywood hit Oklahoma that highlights the enduring conflict between cowboys and farmers Roosevelt argued that the manhood typified by the cowboy and outdoor activity and sports generally was essential if American men were to avoid the softness and rot produced by an easy life in the city br Will Rogers the son of a Cherokee judge in Oklahoma started with rope tricks and fancy riding but by discovered his audiences were even more enchanted with his wit in his representation of the wisdom of the common man br Others who contributed to enhancing the romantic image of the American cowboy include Charles Siringo and Andy Adams Cowboy Pinkerton detective and western author Siringo was the first authentic cowboy autobiographer Adams spent the s in the cattle industry in Texas and the s mining in the Rockies When an play s portrayal of Texans outraged Adams he started writing plays short stories and novels drawn from his own experiences His The Log of a Cowboy became a classic novel about the cattle business especially the cattle drive It described a fictional drive of the Circle Dot herd from Texas to Montana in and became a leading source on cowboy life historians retraced its path in the s confirming its basic accuracy His writings are acclaimed and criticized for realistic fidelity to detail on the one hand and thin literary qualities on the other Many regard Red River directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift as an authentic cattle drive depiction br The unique skills of the cowboys are highlighted in the rodeo It began in an organized fashion in the West in the s when several Western cities followed up on touring Wild West shows and organized celebrations that included rodeo activities The establishment of major cowboy competitions in the East in the s led to the growth of rodeo sports Trail cowboys who were also known as gunfighters like John Wesley Hardin Luke Short and others were known for their prowess speed and skill with their pistols and other firearms Their violent escapades and reputations morphed over time into the stereotypical image of violence endured by the cowboy hero br br br Code of the West br Historians of the American West have written about the mythic West the west of western literature art and of people s shared memories The phenomenon is the Imagined West The Code of the West was an unwritten socially agreed upon set of informal laws shaping the cowboy culture of the Old West Over time the cowboys developed a personal culture of their own a blend of values that even retained vestiges of chivalry Such hazardous work in isolated conditions also bred a tradition of self dependence and individualism with great value put on personal honesty exemplified in songs and cowboy poetry The code also included the gunfighter who sometimes followed a form of code duello adopted from the Old South in order to solve disputes and duels Extrajudicial justice seen during the frontier days such as lynching vigilantism and gunfighting in turn popularized by the Western genre would later be known in modern times as examples of frontier justice br br br Historiography br Scores of Frederick Jackson Turner s students became professors in history departments in the western states and taught courses on the frontier influenced by his ideas Scholars have debunked many of the myths of the frontier but they nevertheless live on in community traditions folklore and fiction In the s a historiographical range war broke out between the traditional frontier studies which stress the influence of the frontier on all of American history and culture and the New Western History which narrows the geographical and temporal framework to concentrate on the trans Mississippi West after It avoids the word frontier and stresses cultural interaction between white culture and groups such as Natives and Hispanics History professor William Weeks of the University of San Diego argues that in this New Western History approach br br It is easy to tell who the bad guys are they are almost invariably white male and middle class or better while the good guys are almost invariably non white non male or non middle class Anglo American civilization is represented as patriarchal racist genocidal and destructive of the environment in addition to hypocritically betraying the ideals on which it supposedly is built br By Steven Aron argues that the two sides had reached an equilibrium in their rhetorical arguments and critiques Since then however the field of American frontier and western regional history has become increasingly inclusive The field s more recent focus was captured in the language of the Call for Papers of the Western History Association br br The Western History Association was once an organization dominated by white male scholars who typically wrote triumphalist narratives We are no longer that organization We now produce pathbreaking scholarship by and about the members of the many communities previously excluded from traditional tales of expansion This new work and the people writing it have transformed the WHA the history of the U S West and the profession more broadly br Meanwhile environmental history has emerged in large part from the frontier historiography hence its emphasis on wilderness It plays an increasingly large role in frontier studies Historians approached the environment for the frontier or regionalism The first group emphasizes human agency on the environment the second looks at the influence of the environment William Cronon has argued that Turner s famous essay was environmental history in an embryonic form It emphasized the vast power of free land to attract and reshape settlers making a transition from wilderness to civilization br Journalist Samuel Lubell saw similarities between the frontier s Americanization of immigrants that Turner described and the social climbing by later immigrants in large cities as they moved to wealthier neighborhoods He compared the effects of the railroad opening up Western lands to urban transportation systems and the automobile and Western settlers land hunger to poor city residents seeking social status Just as the Republican party benefited from support from old immigrant groups that settled on frontier farms new urban immigrants formed an important part of the Democratic New Deal coalition that began with Franklin Delano Roosevelt s victory in the presidential election br Since the s an active center is the history department at the University of New Mexico along with the University of New Mexico Press Leading historians there include Gerald D Nash Donald C Cutter Richard N Ellis Richard Etulain Ferenc Szasz Margaret Connell Szasz Paul Hutton Virginia Scharff and Samuel Truett The department has
