obstacles and enemies mostly consisting of enemies from the other games in the Mario series br One difference of the predecessor March of the Minis is that all of the end of level bonuses are now required In the previous game extra points were earned by getting all Minis to the exit getting them to the exit with no long time intervals between any two Minis and getting them to the exit without stopping any of them Also in this game the minis cannot be controlled Only items and obstacles can be used to control their direction Additionally all minis must reach the door in time otherwise the door will lock up and the player will fail the level br Like with the first installment there is a life counter system that uses M Tokens Players start with five lives which are lost if a mini touches an enemy touches spikes traps or any pitfalls falls a distance of ten or more blocks if the next mini fails to reach the door on time after one enters or the timer runs out Just like the first

five more lives by choosing Retry In each level there is a Mini Mario card that must be collected eight scattered in the levels and one in the Donkey Kong battle to spell M I N I M A R I O When they are all collected the player will unlock the special level br At the end of each floor the player must fight Donkey Kong to go to the next floor The player always starts the battle with Mini Marios

Mini Mario tries to hit Donkey Kong it breaks The player also has three minutes to defeat Donkey Kong Sometimes Donkey Kong will send blue clocks down that when collected it adds seconds to the time remaining Starting with the fourth floor there will be steamed clocks that removes seconds from the timer if collected If the player runs out of time or all six Mini Marios are destroyed the player will lose a life and must restart the battle There is also an O card in the Donkey Kong stages br The game featured a level editor called the Construction Zone in which players could select the types
