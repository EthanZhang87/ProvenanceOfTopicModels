GoldenEye have been cited as among the greatest and most influential games of all time though some fans and former employees have been critical of the company s output under Microsoft br br br History br br br Founding br Rare evolved from the company Ultimate Play the Game which was founded in Ashby de la Zouch Leicestershire by former arcade game developers Tim and Chris Stamper After multiple critically and commercially successful releases including Jetpac Atic Atac Sabre Wulf and Knight Lore Ultimate Play The Game was one of the biggest UK based video game development companies The ZX Spectrum home computer the platform the company usually developed games for was only popular in the UK and they believed that working on that platform would not be beneficial to the company s growth as they considered it a dead end Meanwhile the company inspected an imported console from Japan the Famicom and believed that it would be an ideal future platform of choice for the company as it was more sophisticated than the Spectrum it had a worldwide market and its cartridges had no load times As a result Rare was established in Its main goal was to reverse engineer the console and investigate the codes for Famicom s games to learn more about the console s programming With successful results the company decided to sell the Ultimate brand to U S Gold and ceased game development for the ZX Spectrum in the following year br The Famicom s manufacturer Nintendo claimed that it was impossible to reverse engineer the console Using the information the Ultimate Play the Game team acquired from Rare the team prepared several tech demos and showed them to the Nintendo executive Minoru Arakawa in Kyoto Impressed with their efforts Nintendo decided to grant the Ultimate Play the Game team an unlimited budget for them to work on games for the Famicom platform After they returned to England they moved from Ashby de la Zouch to Twycross and established a new studio through Rare They set their headquarters in a Manor Farmhouse Rare also set up another company known as Rare Inc in Miami Florida Headed by Joel Hochberg the American company was involved in maintaining Rare s operation in the US and contacting major US publishers Hochberg was previously the vice president of American arcade manufacturer Centuri The Famicom was eventually released in North America and Europe under the name Nintendo Entertainment System NES br br With the unlimited budget Rare could work a large variety of different games The first project Rare worked on was Slalom a downhill skiing game The company then worked with various gaming publishers that included Tradewest Acclaim Entertainment Electronic Arts Sega Mindscape and Gametek to produce over games for the NES and several additional Game Boy conversions They helped in creating new and original intellectual properties including R C Pro Am a racing game with vehicular combat elements and Snake Rattle n Roll an action platform game with Tim Stamper developing the game s graphics Rare also developed Battletoads a beat em up inspired by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise The game became known for its extreme difficulty and upon seeing success publisher Tradewest published multiple ports for the game and tasked Rare to develop sequels Tradewest also gave their own Double Dragon licence to Rare allowing them to develop a crossover game between the two franchises Rare released three Battletoads games in including Battletoads Double Dragon The Ultimate Team Battletoads in Ragnarok s World and Battletoads in Battlemaniacs The last Battletoads game from that era was released for the arcade in Several Battletoads games were also ported to some Sega s systems like the Mega Drive Genesis br Rare worked on licensed properties such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Hollywood Squares and ports including Marble Madness Narc and Sid Meier s Pirates The development of four of Rare s games were outsourced to Zippo Games including Wizards Warriors and the third instalment of the Jetpac series Solar Jetman Hunt for the Golden Warship Rare eventually acquired Zippo Games and renamed them to Rare Manchester According to Ste Pickford a Rare team member through the late s and the early s Rare just wanted to make as many games as they could in their window of opportunity The huge library of games made large profits but none became a critical success for the company while less creativity and innovation were shown in them br When the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was conceived Rare was not yet ready for the change Rare limited their releases to some Battletoads games and decided to invest their significant NES profit in purchasing expensive Silicon Graphics workstations to make three dimensional models This move made Rare the most technologically advanced developer in the UK and situated them high in the international market Their priority also changed at that time as the team decided to focus on quality instead of quantity br br br Partnership with Nintendo br Rare using the SGI systems created a boxing game demo and presented it to Nintendo As the SNES at that time could not render all of the SGI graphics at once Rare used the SGI graphics to produce D models and graphics before pre rendering these graphics onto the cartridge of the SNES system a process known as Advanced Computer Modelling Their progress with the D graphics on the SGI systems impressed Nintendo and in Nintendo bought a stake in the company that gradually increased to making Rare a second party developer for Nintendo Rare maintained autonomous operations green lighting and designing projects without significant involvement from Nintendo br During this period Rare started selling their games under the trademark name Rareware The company was considered one of Nintendo s key developers and had enough recognition that Nintendo offered Rare the Nintendo catalogue of characters to create a D CGI game The Stampers asked for Donkey Kong The resulting game was Donkey Kong Country which was developed by a total of people and enjoyed an month development cycle Rare staff also visited Twycross Zoo observing and videotaping real gorillas The game was a critical success with critics praising the game s highly advanced visuals and artstyle Donkey Kong Country sold over nine million copies worldwide making it the third best selling game in the SNES library The game received several Game of the Year honours and was followed by two sequels Donkey Kong Country Diddy s Kong Quest and Donkey Kong Country Dixie Kong s Double Trouble as well as several handheld spin offs such as the Donkey Kong Land series br Nintendo s stake purchase allowed Rare to expand significantly The number of staff members increased from to and Rare moved out from their headquarters at the Manor Farmhouse Rare also developed a CGI arcade fighting game Killer Instinct on their own custom built arcade machine Killer Instinct was set to be released for Nintendo s own bit system the Nintendo in but was forced to release the game for the bit SNES system and had to downgrade the game s graphics Killer Instinct sold million copies and was followed by a sequel Killer Instinct Killer Instinct Gold the console version of Killer Instinct suffered from a graphical downgrade due to the compression technology used to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo cartridge br Rare then developed Blast Corps for the Nintendo The game sold one million copies which was considered disappointing by Rare At that time Rare was split into several teams working on different projects A large scaled platformer was set to be released afterwards but was delayed As a result Rare changed their schedule and released their smaller projects first The first project was GoldenEye a game based on the James Bond film GoldenEye The project was led by Martin Hollis and development was conducted by an inexperienced team Inspired by Sega s Virtua Cop Goldeneye had originally been an on rails shooter before the team decided to expand the gameplay and turn it into a free roaming first person shooter New elements such as stealth headshot mechanics and reloading were introduced A split screen multiplayer was added to the game by the end of its development GoldenEye was the first console first person shooter developed by Rare and it was released two years after the release of the film The game received critical praise and received numerous awards Goldeneye remained one of the best selling games for two years and sold more than eight million units worldwide br Rare then developed Diddy Kong Racing their first self published game Originally intended as a real time strategy game involving cavemen the game was re imagined into a racing game prior to its release in It was one of the fastest selling games at the time as recorded by The Guinness Book of Records Diddy Kong Racing also features protagonists from some future Rare games including Banjo and Conker At the time Rare was still working on the large scale platform game Originally codenamed Dream Land of Giants it was a game featuring a young boy named Edison and pirates The protagonist was then replaced by a bear known as Banjo and Rare expanded the role of Kazooie the bird The two characters were inspired by characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios films and Rare hoped that they could appeal to a younger audience Banjo Kazooie was released in June to critical acclaim A sequel Banjo Tooie was released in It was a critical success and it outsold the first game selling million copies br Upon the completion of Banjo Kazooie s development Hollis immediately began another project Originally set to be a tie in for Tomorrow Never Dies Rare was significantly outbid by another publisher forcing Rare to develop a new concept with new characters With a major emphasis on lighting the game was named Perfect Dark Hollis left Rare for Nintendo months after the start of Perfect Dark s development Around the same time numerous employees left the company and formed new studios With major project leads departing a new team took over its development and diminished the role of lighting in the game making it a more straightforward first person shooter The game s troubled development did not affect the progress of Rare s other teams When Perfect Dark was still in development Rare released two other games Jet Force Gemini and Donkey Kong In Nintendo signed an agreement with Disney and assigned Rare to develop several racing and adventure games featuring Mickey Mouse The project later became Mickey s Speedway USA and Mickey s Racing Adventure Perfect Dark eventually resurfaced and it was released in to critical acclaim The game sold approximately million copies br Conker the Squirrel also had his own game originally named Conker s Quest It was later renamed Twelve Tales Conker however the new game was criticised for being too family friendly and too similar to Banjo Kazooie As a result the team renamed the game Conker s Bad Fur Day and it was re revealed in Conker s Bad Fur Day unlike Banjo Kazooie was intended for a mature audience and features violence profanity and scatological humour The game received positive reviews from critics but was a commercial failure as the game was released at the end of the Nintendo s life cycle and was not actively promoted by Nintendo due to its crude content br After the completion of Diddy Kong Racing another team was working on a new game known as Dinosaur Planet for the Nintendo However Nintendo Senior Managing Director Shigeru Miyamoto suggested the team redesign the game as part of the Star Fox series for Nintendo s new console the GameCube Unlike previous Star Fox games Star Fox Adventures focuses on ground based open world exploration The game received positive reviews upon its launch in Star Fox Adventures was the only game developed by Rare for the GameCube br br br Microsoft era present br Game development costs gradually increased and Nintendo did not provide Rare with more capital nor did they purchase the company s remaining stake The Stampers were surprised that Nintendo did not directly acquire the studio Rare looked for potential buyers In early workers from Activision and Microsoft began visiting Rare with purchase offers According to Microsoft s Ed Fries Nintendo Activision and Microsoft then became embroiled in a bidding war for ownership of Rare Rare expressed interest in Activision s offer but Microsoft offered more money On September Microsoft purchased Rare for million million in Rare became a first party developer for Microsoft s Xbox Character trademarks from games developed by Rare for Nintendo consoles such as Conker of Conker s Bad Fur Day and Banjo of the Banjo Kazooie series were retained by Rare intellectual property created by Nintendo such as Donkey Kong and Star Fox were retained by Nintendo This left Donkey Kong Racing due for release for the GameCube unreleased employees left Rare during the transition br br Since Microsoft was not part of the handheld video game console market Rare continued to develop games for Nintendo handheld consoles after the acquisition In August Rare and Microsoft entered an agreement with THQ for THQ to publish Rare s games for the Game Boy Advance including Sabre Wulf a game based on an Ultimate character Banjo Kazooie Grunty s Revenge initially intended as a Game Boy Color game and It s Mr Pants a puzzle game originally developed as Donkey Kong Coconut Crackers January saw the completion of this deal with the release of Banjo Pilot known as Diddy Kong Pilot before the Microsoft acquisition br In Rare released their first Microsoft game Grabbed by the Ghoulies a humorous action adventure game set in a haunted mansion full of supernatural creatures Originally intended as a free roaming game it was significantly streamlined in design and concept to attract a larger more casual audience The game received mixed reviews from critics and was considered Rare s worst and least popular game At E Microsoft s Ken Lobb said that Rare had obtained Nintendo DS development kits and was working on two games for the Nintendo DS Shortly afterwards Microsoft issued a statement that the company and its studios had no plans for Nintendo DS development However in July Rare posted job openings for Nintendo DS development on its website and said that it was creating key DS games Only two were ever released with the first one being Diddy Kong Racing DS a remake of the Nintendo title Diddy Kong Racing which was released in February and the second being Viva Pi ata Pocket Paradise a life simulation game released on September Both games support the Nintendo DS Rumble Pak br Rare released Conker Live Reloaded a remake of Conker s Bad Fur Day in with updated graphics and a reworked multiplayer option The game received generally favourable reviews but similar to Bad Fur Day was a commercial failure Xbox successor Xbox was released in and two of its launch games were developed by Rare Perfect Dark Zero and Kameo Elements of Power Zero a prequel to the first Perfect Dark was originally intended for GameCube before its redesign as an Xbox game Rare removed several features to meet the game s release deadline in Kameo Elements of Power was also intended for the GameCube A new intellectual property in it the player character shape shifts to solve puzzles Although both received generally positive reviews from critics and sold more than a million copies they were considered disappointments br br In the company released Viva Pi ata a game involving gardening Incorporating elements of several franchises including The Sims Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon it was acclaimed as innovative The game s commercial performance was a disappointment however and some Rare team members questioned Microsoft Studios large marketing budget for Gears of War and its relative neglect of Viva Pi ata On January Rare founders Chris and Tim Stamper left the company to pursue other opportunities Former lead designer Gregg Mayles became Rare s creative director and Mark Betteridge the company s studio director That year saw the release of Jetpac Refuelled a remake of Jetpac for Xbox Live Arcade br br Rare unveiled work on Xbox Live avatars Viva Pi ata Trouble in Paradise the next game in the Viva Pi ata series and Banjo Kazooie Nuts Bolts in Made by the core team that developed the first Banjo Kazooie Nuts Bolts received significant criticism from players due to its focus on vehicle construction rather than traditional platforming Though generally receiving positive reviews the company s games for Microsoft sold poorly and Microsoft decided to restructure the studio at the end of the decade In March Rare opened a new facility at Fazeley Studios in Digbeth Birmingham Later that year Microsoft confirmed that Scott Henson a developer who had worked on the hardware and software designs of the Xbox console and Kinect for Xbox replaced Mark Betteridge as studio manager and announced a focus on Xbox Live avatars Rare also shifted their focus to Kinect According to Henson Kinect will be the main focus for Rare going forwards as it s a very rich canvas This is just the beginning of an experience that will touch millions of people Rare s first Kinect project Kinect Sports was released in November Originally titled Sports Star a more complex sports simulation game the game was streamlined into what Microsoft executive Don Mattrick hoped would be the Kinect equivalent of Wii Sports According to a former Rare employee the team was worried about the game during its development because of Kinect s limitations Its reviews were average but it was a commercial success selling three million units by May Rare and BigPark another Microsoft studio collaborated on the development of a sequel Kinect Sports Season Two br In March Scott Henson announced that Craig Duncan who had worked on Sonic Sega All Stars Racing and the Colin McRae Rally series was hired as senior studio director Simon

Rare composer Robin Beanland the year would be significant for the company At E a new compilation game Rare Replay celebrating the studio s th anniversary was introduced it was released in August The compilation s thirty titles only include games to which Rare owned the intellectual property Because of this Rare s operations director Drew Quakenbush explains why GoldenEye is not included in

game Super Smash Bros Ultimate At the X event in November Rare announced it was developing Everwild an action adventure game for Windows and Xbox Series X S As of January Rare had more than employees after growing at a consistent pace for five years br br br Culture br According to Mark Betteridge one of Rare s main goals is to create games people will find enjoyable rather than just to earn profit The Stamper brothers gave the team considerable creative freedom although they would intervene if a product was technically flawed or under performing Some employees noted that working for Rare in its early days could be difficult with staff members allowed minutes for lunch and possibly working more than hours a week Nintendo worked closely with Rare and their relationship was described as a creative partnership by Viva Pi ata designer Justin Cook According to Hansen in innovation is very important to the company thus they focus on trying out new technology such as Xbox s Kinect Historically the company has developed only for video game consoles never for PCs or arcade units with the Stamper brothers citing a preference for working on a stable standard format which is specifically designed for playing games According to Duncan in Rare would only develop games that had unique ideas and will never develop a generic game with their intellectual properties br br Ed Fries head of Microsoft Studios publishing division at the time of acquisition said that the company attempted to preserve Rare s culture so its staff could continue feeling that they worked for Rare rather than Microsoft Rare employees differed about working conditions after the Microsoft acquisition According to Star Fox Adventures lead engineer Phil Tossell conditions became more stressful after an imperceptible start and the culture of the two companies began clashing Tossell said that Microsoft gradually imposed a corporate structure on Rare including more performance reviews and meetings to which some Rare members found difficulty in adapting Some admitted that early changes such as permitting team members to discuss projects they were not working on and allowing staff members to use the Internet or listen to music during work hours were beneficial to team morale Betteridge called the overall change positive saying that Microsoft s capital could help Rare develop their projects Former Rare employee Gavin Price said that some Microsoft executives such as Phil Spencer were supportive of the developer Grant Kirkhope a former composer at Rare strongly criticised Microsoft following the acquisition Former Xbox executive Peter Moore voiced his disappointment with Rare s works after the acquisition He noted that Rare employees were attempting to recreate the glory years but their skills had become outdated and were no longer applicable in today s market Duncan insisted that there were still a lot of talented people working at Rare and they will have a bright future br Unlike other software developers Rare acquired a reputation for secrecy the approach to their office buildings in Manor Park near Twycross was monitored by cameras The company was internally divided into different barnes where employees worked exclusively on their group s game According to Tim Stamper br br Rare has a different philosophy We don t really have much contact with other game development companies and we just do things the way they ve evolved We try to employ people who are great games players and games enthusiasts and they re really interested in seeing the other games we re developing in the company so it s really a group of games enthusiasts all working together to produce the best games they can that s Rare br Though normally secretive Rare allowed several exclusive tours of its studio by fansites Rarenet in Rare Extreme in and again in as well as by the website Eurogamer in In Rare declined an offer by fansite MundoRare to film a documentary about their studios at MundoRare s expense The film to celebrate Rare s th anniversary would have been distributed on the internet and Xbox Live Rare refused permission to shoot the film saying that it was not on message MundoRare was shut down and stated that the site could not support the company s new corporate direction Rare s secrecy was criticised by Hardcore Gamer s Alex Carlson as they thought that it made them disconnected and prompted them to develop games that their fans don t want When Duncan took over as the studio s head he intended to change the culture of the studio Rare s office was completely remodeled so as to facilitate idea sharing between team members The studio also adopted a more open attitude to its community with the studio inviting fans to take part in the development project of their latest game Sea of Thieves br br br Related companies br br Around a number of Rare employees left to establish separate companies The first was Eighth Wonder underwritten
