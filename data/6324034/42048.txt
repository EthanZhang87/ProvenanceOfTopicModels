Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration reconstruction or alteration of the human body It can be divided into two main categories reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery Reconstructive surgery includes craniofacial surgery hand surgery microsurgery and the treatment of burns While reconstructive surgery aims to reconstruct a part of the body or improve its functioning cosmetic or aesthetic surgery aims to improve the appearance of it A comprehensive definition of plastic surgery has never been established because it has no distinct anatomical object and thus overlaps with practically all other surgical specialties An essential feature of plastic surgery is that it involves the treatment of conditions that require or may require tissue relocation skills br br br Etymology br The word plastic in plastic surgery is in reference to the concept of reshaping and comes from the Greek plastik tekhn the art of modelling of malleable flesh This meaning in English is seen as early as In the surgical context the word plastic first appeared in and was established in by Eduard Zeis preceding the modern technical usage of the word as engineering material made from petroleum by years br br br History br br Treatments for the plastic repair of a broken nose are first mentioned in the c BC Egyptian medical text called the Edwin Smith papyrus The early trauma surgery textbook was named after the American Egyptologist Edwin Smith Reconstructive surgery techniques were being carried out in India by BC Sushruta was a physician who made contributions to the field of plastic and cataract surgery in the th century BC br br The Romans also performed plastic cosmetic surgery using simple techniques such as repairing damaged ears from around the st century BC For religious reasons they did not dissect either human beings or animals thus their knowledge was based in its entirety on the texts of their Greek predecessors Notwithstanding Aulus Cornelius Celsus left some accurate anatomical descriptions some of which for instance his studies on the genitalia and the skeleton are of special interest to plastic surgery br br Several ancient Sanskrit medical treatise mentions some types of plastic surgery in India such as the works of Sushruta and Charaka These works were translated into the Arabic language during the Abbasid Caliphate in AD The Arabic translations made their way into Europe via intermediaries In Italy the Branca family of Sicily and Gaspare Tagliacozzi Bologna became familiar with the techniques of Sushruta br br A pioneer in all fields of surgery the Arab physician surgeon and chemist Al Zahrawi talks of the use of silk thread suture to achieve good cosmesis He describes what is thought to be the first attempt at reduction mammaplasty for the management of gynaecomastia He gives detailed descriptions of other basic surgical techniques such as cautery and wound management br British physicians travelled to India to see rhinoplasties being performed by Indian methods Reports on Indian rhinoplasty performed by a Kumhar potter vaidya were published in the Gentleman s Magazine by Joseph Constantine Carpue spent years in India studying local plastic surgery methods Carpue was able to perform the first major surgery in the Western world in the year Instruments described in the Sushruta Samhita were further modified in the Western world br In Sabuncu s book description and classification of hypospadias were more informative and up to date Localization of the urethral meatus was described in detail Sabuncuoglu also detailed the description and classification of ambiguous genitalia In mid th century Europe Heinrich von Pfolspeundt described a process to make a new nose for one who lacks it entirely and the dogs have devoured it by removing skin from the back of the arm and suturing it in place However because of the dangers associated with surgery in any form especially that involving the head or face it was not until the th and th centuries that such surgery became common br In Joseph Carpue successfully performed an operative procedure on a British military officer who had lost his nose to the toxic effects of mercury treatments In German surgeon Carl Ferdinand von Graefe published his major work entitled Rhinoplastik Von Graefe modified the Italian method using a free skin graft from the arm instead of the original delayed pedicle flap br The first American plastic surgeon was John Peter Mettauer who in performed the first cleft palate operation with instruments that he designed himself br br Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach specialized in skin transplantation and early plastic surgery His work in rhinoplastic and maxillofacial surgery established many modern techniques of reconstructive surgery In Dieffenbach wrote a comprehensive text on rhinoplasty titled Operative Chirurgie and introduced the concept of reoperation to improve the cosmetic appearance of the reconstructed nose Dieffenbach has been called the father of plastic surgery br Another case of plastic surgery for nose reconstruction from at Bellevue Hospital was described in Scientific American br In American otorhinolaryngologist John Roe presented an example of his work a young woman on whom he reduced a dorsal nasal hump for cosmetic indications In Robert Weir experimented unsuccessfully with xenografts duck sternum in the reconstruction of sunken noses In James Israel a urological surgeon from Germany and in George Monks of the United States each described the successful use of heterogeneous free bone grafting to reconstruct saddle nose defects In Jacques Joseph the German orthopaedic trained surgeon published his first account of reduction rhinoplasty In Alexander Ostroumov the Russian pharmacist and perfume and cosmetics manufacturer founded a unique plastic surgery department in his Moscow Institute of Medical Cosmetics In Jacques Joseph published Nasenplastik und Sonstige Gesichtsplastik br br br Nascency of maxillofacial surgery br br The development of weapons such as machine guns and explosive shells during World War I created trench warfare which led to a rapid increase in the number of mutilations to the faces and the heads of soldiers because the trenches mainly offered protection to the body The surgeons who were not prepared for these injuries were even less prepared for a large number of injuries and had to react quickly and intelligently to treat the greatest number br Facial injuries were hard to treat on the front line because of the sanitary conditions many infections could occur Sometimes some stitches were made on a jagged wound without thinking about the amount of flesh that had been lost so scars after were hideous and disfigured soldiers Some injured had important injuries and the stitches were not sufficient so some became blind or were left with gaping holes instead of their nose br Harold Gillies scared by the number of new facial injuries and the lack of good surgical techniques decided to dedicate an entire hospital to the reconstruction of facial injuries as fully as possible He took into account the psychological dimension Gillies introduced skin grafts to the treatments of soldiers so they would be less horrified by looking at themselves in the mirror br It is the multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of facial lesions bringing together plastic surgeons dental surgeons technicians and specialized nurses which has made it possible to develop techniques leading to the reconstruction of injured faces br Harold Gillies identified the need to advance the specialty of maxillofacial surgery which would be directly dedicated to the management of war wounds at this time He has developed a new technique using rotational and transposition flaps but also bone grafts from the ribs and tibia to reconstruct facial defects caused by the weapons during the war Gillies experimented with this technique so he knew that he had to start by moving back healthy tissue to its normal position and then he will be able to fill with tissue from another place on the body of the soldier One of the most successful techniques in skin grafting had the aim of not completely severing the connection to the body It was possible by releasing and lifting a flap of skin from the wound The flap of skin still connected to the donor site would then be swung over the site of the wound this technique allows the maintenance of physical connection and ensures that blood is supplied to the skin and increases the chances of the skin graft being accepted by the body br At this time we assisted also to improving in treating infections also meant that important injuries had become survivable mostly thanks to the new technique of Gillies Some soldiers arrived at the hospital of Gillies without noses chins cheekbones or even eyes But for them the most important trauma was psychological br br br Development of modern techniques br br The father of modern plastic surgery is generally considered to have been Sir Harold Gillies A New Zealand otolaryngologist working in London he developed many of the techniques of modern facial surgery in caring for soldiers with disfiguring facial injuries during the First World War br During World War I he worked as a medical minder with the Royal Army Medical Corps After working with the renowned French oral and maxillofacial surgeon Hippolyte Morestin on skin grafts he persuaded the army s chief surgeon Arbuthnot Lane to establish a facial injury ward at the Cambridge Military Hospital Aldershot later upgraded to a new hospital for facial repairs at Sidcup in There Gillies and his colleagues developed many techniques of plastic surgery more than operations were performed on more than men mostly soldiers with facial injuries usually from gunshot wounds After the war Gillies developed a private practice with Rainsford Mowlem including many famous patients and travelled extensively to promote his advanced techniques worldwide br In Gillies cousin Archibald McIndoe joined the practice and became committed to plastic surgery When World War II broke out plastic surgery provision was largely divided between the different services of the armed forces and Gillies and his team were split up Gillies himself was sent to Rooksdown House near Basingstoke which became the principal army plastic surgery unit Tommy Kilner who had worked with Gillies during the First World War and who now has a surgical instrument named after him the kilner cheek retractor went to Queen Mary s Hospital Roehampton and Mowlem went to St Albans McIndoe consultant to the RAF moved to the recently rebuilt Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead Sussex and founded a Centre for Plastic and Jaw Surgery There he treated very deep burns and serious facial disfigurement such as loss of eyelids typical of those caused to aircrew by burning fuel br McIndoe is often recognized for not only developing new techniques for treating badly burned faces and hands but also for recognising the importance of the rehabilitation of the casualties and particularly of social reintegration back into normal life He disposed of the convalescent uniforms and let the patients use their service uniforms instead With the help of two friends Neville and Elaine Blond he also convinced the locals to support the patients and invite them to their homes McIndoe kept referring to them as his boys and the staff called him The Boss or The Maestro br His other important work included the development of the walking stalk skin graft and the discovery that immersion in saline promoted healing as well as improving survival rates for patients with extensive burns this was a serendipitous discovery drawn from observation of differential healing rates in pilots who had come down on land and in the sea His radical experimental treatments led to the formation of the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital Sussex Among the better known members of his club were Richard Hillary Bill Foxley and Jimmy Edwards br br br Sub specialties br br Plastic surgery is a broad field and may be subdivided further In the United States plastic surgeons are board certified by American Board of Plastic Surgery Subdisciplines of plastic surgery may include br br br Aesthetic surgery br Aesthetic surgery is a central component of plastic surgery and includes facial and body aesthetic surgery Plastic surgeons use cosmetic surgical principles in all reconstructive surgical procedures as well as isolated operations to improve overall appearance br br br Burn surgery br Burn surgery generally takes place in two phases Acute burn surgery is the treatment immediately after a burn Reconstructive burn surgery takes place after the burn wounds have healed br br br Craniofacial surgery br br Craniofacial surgery is divided into pediatric and adult craniofacial surgery Pediatric craniofacial surgery mostly revolves around the treatment of congenital anomalies of the craniofacial skeleton and soft tissues such as cleft lip and palate microtia craniosynostosis and pediatric fractures Adult craniofacial surgery deals mostly with reconstructive surgeries after trauma or cancer and revision surgeries along with orthognathic surgery and facial feminization surgery Craniofacial surgery is an important part of all plastic surgery training programs Further training and subspecialisation is obtained via a craniofacial fellowship Craniofacial surgery is also practiced by maxillofacial surgeons br br br Ethnic plastic surgery br br Ethnic plastic surgery is plastic surgery performed to change ethnic attributes often considered used as a way of passing br br br Hand surgery br br Hand surgery is concerned with acute injuries and chronic diseases of the hand and wrist correction of congenital malformations of the upper extremities and peripheral nerve problems such as brachial plexus injuries or carpal tunnel syndrome Hand surgery is an important part of training in plastic surgery as well as microsurgery which is necessary to replant an amputated extremity The hand surgery field is also practiced by orthopedic surgeons and general surgeons Scar tissue formation after surgery can be problematic on the delicate hand causing loss of dexterity and digit function if severe enough There have been cases of surgery on women s hands in order to correct perceived flaws to create the perfect engagement ring photo br br br Microsurgery br br Microsurgery is generally concerned with the reconstruction of missing tissues by transferring a piece of tissue to the reconstruction site and reconnecting blood vessels Popular subspecialty areas are breast reconstruction head and neck reconstruction hand surgery replantation and brachial plexus surgery br br br Pediatric plastic surgery br br Children often face medical issues very different from the experiences of an adult patient Many birth defects or syndromes present at birth are best treated in childhood and pediatric plastic surgeons specialize in treating these conditions in children Conditions commonly treated by pediatric plastic surgeons include craniofacial anomalies Syndactyly webbing of the fingers and toes Polydactyly excess fingers and toes at birth cleft lip and palate and congenital hand deformities br br br Prison plastic surgery br Plastic surgery performed on an incarcerated population in order to affect their recidivism rate a practice instituted in the early th century that lasted until the mid s Separate from surgery performed for medical need br br br Techniques and procedures br In plastic surgery the transfer of skin tissue skin grafting is a very common procedure Skin grafts can be derived from the recipient or donors br br Autografts are taken from the recipient If absent or deficient of natural tissue alternatives can be cultured sheets of epithelial cells in vitro or synthetic compounds such as integra which consists of silicone and bovine tendon collagen with glycosaminoglycans br Allografts are taken from a donor of the same species Kidney transplants are an example of allograft transfer Joseph Murray American Plastic Surgeon is credited for completing the first successful kidney transplantation in br Xenografts are taken from a donor of a different species br Usually good results would be expected from plastic surgery that emphasize careful planning of incisions so that they fall within the line of natural skin folds or lines appropriate choice of wound closure use of best available suture materials and early removal of exposed sutures so that the wound is held closed by buried sutures br br br Reconstructive surgery br br Reconstructive plastic surgery is performed to correct functional impairments caused by burns traumatic injuries such as facial bone fractures and breaks congenital abnormalities such as cleft palates or cleft lips developmental abnormalities infection and disease and cancer or tumors The goal of reconstructive plastic surgery is to restore both form and function br The most common reconstructive procedures are tumor removal laceration repair maxillofacial surgery scar revision hand surgery and breast reduction plasty According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons the number of reconstructive breast reductions for women decreased in by percent from the year before Breast reduction in men decreased in by percent In there were performed br Some other common reconstructive surgical procedures include breast reconstruction after a mastectomy for the treatment of cancer cleft lip and palate surgery contracture surgery for burn survivors and creating a new outer ear when one is congenitally absent br Plastic surgeons use microsurgery to transfer tissue for coverage of a defect when no local tissue is available Free flaps of skin muscle bone fat or a combination may be removed from the body moved to another site on the body and reconnected to a blood supply by suturing arteries and veins as small as to millimeters in diameter br br br Cosmetic surgery procedures br br Cosmetic surgery is a voluntary or elective surgery that is performed on normal parts of the body with the only purpose of improving a person s appearance or removing signs of aging Some cosmetic surgeries such as breast reduction are also functional and can help to relieve symptoms of discomfort such as back ache or neck ache Cosmetic surgeries are also undertaken following breast cancer and mastectomy to recreate the natural breast shape which has been lost during the process of removing the cancer In nearly million cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States alone The number of cosmetic procedures performed in the United States has almost doubled since the start of the century of cosmetic procedures were performed on women in up from in million cosmetic procedures were performed in with the five most common surgeries being Nose Reshaping Eyelid surgery Facelift Liposuction and breast augmentation Breast augmentation continues to be one of the top cosmetic surgical procedures and has been since Silicone implants were used in and saline implants in of all breast augmentations in The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looks at the statistics for different cosmetic procedures Nineteen of the procedures are surgical such as rhinoplasty or facelift The nonsurgical procedures include Botox and laser hair removal In their survey revealed that there were total procedures in the United States Of those procedures were surgical p They also found that a large majority of the procedures were done on Caucasian people p br In Americans underwent cosmetic surgery procedures and by this number rose to almost half a million people The American Society of Plastic Surgeons ASPS estimates that more than cosmetic procedures were performed on patients years of age or younger in the US in compared to approx in In more than patients between the ages of and underwent plastic surgery compared to just over patients in the same age group in Concerns about young people undergoing plastic surgery include the financial burden of additional surgical procedures needed to correct problems after the initial cosmetic surgery long term health complications from plastic surgery and unaddressed mental health issues that may have led to surgery The increased use of cosmetic procedures crosses racial and ethnic lines in the U S with increases seen among African Americans Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans as well as Caucasian Americans In Asia cosmetic surgery has become more popular and countries such as China and India have become Asia s biggest cosmetic surgery markets South Korea is also rising in popularity due to their expertise in facial bone surgeries see cosmetic surgery in South Korea br Plastic surgery is increasing slowly rising from to According to the annual plastic surgery procedural statistics there were million surgical and minimally invasive cosmetic procedures performed in the United States in a percent increase over A study from found that requests for cosmetic procedures had increased significantly since the beginning of the COVID pandemic possibly due to the increase in videoconferencing cited estimates include a increase in the United States and a increase in France br The most popular aesthetic cosmetic procedures include br br Abdominoplasty tummy tuck reshaping and firming of the abdomen br Blepharoplasty eyelid surgery reshaping of upper lower eyelids including Asian blepharoplasty br Phalloplasty penile surgery construction or reconstruction of a penis or sometimes artificial modification of the penis by surgery often for cosmetic purposes br Mammoplasty br Breast augmentations breast implant or boob job augmentation of the breasts by means of fat grafting saline or silicone gel prosthetics which was initially performed for women with micromastia br Reduction mammoplasty breast reduction removal of skin and glandular tissue which is done to reduce back and shoulder pain in women with gigantomastia and for men with gynecomastia br Mastopexy breast lift Lifting or reshaping of breasts to make them less saggy often after weight loss after a pregnancy for example It involves removal of breast skin as opposed to glandular tissue br Augmentation mastopexy breast lift with breast implants Lifting breasts to make them less saggy repositioning the nipple to a higher location and increasing breast size with saline or silicone gel implants Recent studies of a newer technique for simultaneous augmentation mastopexy SAM indicate that it is a safe surgical procedure with minimal medical complications The SAM technique involves invaginating and tacking the tissues first in order to previsualize the result before making any surgical incisions to the breast br Buttock augmentation butt implant enhancement of the buttocks using silicone implants or fat grafting Brazilian butt lift where fat is transferred from other areas of the body br Cryolipolysis refers to a medical device used to destroy fat cells Its principle relies on controlled cooling for non invasive local reduction of fat deposits to reshape body contours br Cryoneuromodulation Treatment of superficial and subcutaneous tissue structures using gaseous nitrous oxide including temporary wrinkle reduction temporary pain reduction treatment of dermatologic conditions and focal cryo treatment of tissue br Calf Augmentation done by silicone implants or fat transfer to add bulk to calf muscles br Labiaplasty surgical reduction and reshaping of the labia br Lip augmentation alter the appearance of the lips by increasing their fullness through surgical enlargement with lip implants or nonsurgical enhancement with injectable fillers br Cheiloplasty surgical reconstruction of the lip br Rhinoplasty nose job reshaping of the nose sometimes used to correct breathing impaired by structural defects br Otoplasty ear surgery ear pinning reshaping of the ear most often done by pinning the protruding ear closer to the head br Rhytidectomy face lift removal of wrinkles and signs of aging from the face br Neck lift tightening of lax tissues in the neck This procedure is often combined with a facelift for lower face rejuvenation br Browplasty brow lift or forehead lift elevates eyebrows smooths forehead skin br Midface lift cheek lift tightening of the cheeks br Genioplasty augmentation of the chin with an individual s bones or with the use of an implant usually silicone by suture of the soft tissue br Mentoplasty surgery to the chin This can involve either enhancing or reducing the size of the chin Enhancements are achieved with the use of facial implants Reduction of the chin involved reducing the size of the chin bone br Cheek augmentation cheek implant implants to the cheek br Orthognathic Surgery altering the upper and lower jaw bones through osteotomy to correct jaw alignment issues and correct the teeth alignment br Fillers injections collagen fat and other tissue filler injections such as hyaluronic acid br Brachioplasty Arm lift reducing excess skin and fat between the underarm and the elbow br Laser Skin Rejuvenation or laser resurfacing the lessening of depth of facial pores and exfoliation of dead or damaged skin cells br Liposuction suction lipectomy removal of fat deposits by traditional suction technique or ultrasonic energy to aid fat removal br Zygoma reduction plasty reducing the facial width by performing osteotomy and resecting part of the zygomatic bone and arch br Jaw reduction reduction of the mandible angle to smooth out an angular jaw and creating a slim jaw br Buccal Fat Extraction extraction of the buccal pads br Body contouring the removal of this excess skin and fat from numerous areas of the body restoring the appearance of skin elasticity of the remaining skin The surgery is prominent in those who have undergone significant weight loss resulting in excess sagging skin being present around areas of the body The skin loses elasticity a condition called elastosis once it has been stretched past capacity and is unable to recoil back to its standard position against the body and also with age br Sclerotherapy removing visible spider veins Telangiectasia which appear on the surface of the skin br Dermal fillers Dermal fillers are injected below the skin to give a more fuller youthful appearance of a feature or section of the face One type of dermal filler is Hyaluronic acid Hyaluronic acid is naturally found throughout the human body It plays a vital role in moving nutrients to the cells of the skin from the blood It is also commonly used in patients with Arthritis as it acts like a cushion to the bones which have depleted the articular cartilage casing Development within this field has occurred over time with synthetic forms of hyaluronic acid is being created playing roles in other forms of cosmetic surgery such as facial augmentation br Micropigmentation is the creation of permanent makeup using natural pigments to places such as the eyes to create the effect of eye shadow lips creating lipstick and cheek bones to create a blush like look The pigment is inserted beneath the skin using a machine which injects a small needle at a very fast rate carrying pigment into the skin creating a lasting colouration of the desired area br In the most popular surgeries were Botox liposuction eyelid surgery breast implants nose jobs and facelifts According to the Plastic Surgery Statistics Report which is published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons the most surgical procedure performed in the U S was Rhinoplasty Nose reshaping accounting for of all cosmetic surgical procedures that year followed by Blepharoplasty Eyelid surgery which accounted for of all procedures The third most populous procedure was Rhytidectomy Facelift of all procedures then Liposuction of all procedures br br br Complications risks and reversals br All surgery has risks Common complications of cosmetic surgery includes hematoma nerve injury infection scarring implant failure and end organ damage Breast implants can have many complications including rupture In a study of his augmentation mammaplasty patients Eisenberg reported that overfilling saline breast implants significantly reduced the rupture deflation rate to at years post implantation In FDA stated that one in five patients who received implants for breast augmentation will need them removed within years of implantation br br br Psychological disorders br Though media and advertising do play a large role in influencing many people s lives such as by making people believe plastic surgery to be an acceptable course to change our identities to our liking researchers believe that plastic surgery obsession is linked to psychological disorders like body dysmorphic disorder There exists a correlation between those with BDD and the predilection toward cosmetic plastic surgery in order to correct a perceived defect in their appearance br BDD is a disorder resulting in the individual becoming preoccupied with what they regard as defects in their bodies or faces Alternatively where there is a slight physical anomaly then the person s concern is markedly excessive While of people have body dysmorphic disorder in the United States of patients seeing a dermatologist and cosmetic surgeons have the disorder Half of the patients with the disorder who have cosmetic surgery performed are not pleased with the aesthetic outcome BDD can lead to suicide in some people with the condition While many with BDD seek cosmetic surgery the procedures do not treat BDD and can ultimately worsen the problem The psychological root of the problem is usually unidentified therefore causing the treatment to be even more difficult Some say that the fixation or obsession with correction of the area could be a sub disorder such as anorexia or muscle dysmorphia The increased use of body and facial reshaping applications such as Snapchat and Facetune have been identified as a potential triggers of BDD Recently a phenomenon referred to as Snapchat dysmorphia has appeared to describe people who request surgery to resemble the edited version of themselves as they appear through Snapchat Filters As a protest to the detrimental trend Instagram banned all augmented reality AR filters that depict or promote cosmetic surgery br In some cases people whose physicians refuse to perform any further surgeries have turned to do it yourself plastic surgery injecting themselves and running extreme safety risks br br br Minimally invasive cosmetic medicine br br With the growing popularity of plastic surgery has also come a widespread increase in minimally invasive alternatives involving intradermal and intramusclular injectables including various neurotoxins such as Botox Dysport Xeomin and Jeuveau amongst others alongside
