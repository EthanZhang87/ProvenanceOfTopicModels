s father who helps Tally decide to turn in Shay He is a Middle Pretty br br br Major motifs br br br Identity br According to critics Uglies contains themes of identity particularly regarding teenagers Phillip Gough said the government of Tally s city which controls what happens within the operation removes responsibility for identity creating sameness and uniformity By placing heavy emphasis on the role of individualism the novel shows the importance of teen s self concept Because identity is formed by displacement and all citizens are carefully sheltered there is no chance for them to branch out into independence Physical identity is determined by committees noted Gough in his essay discussing Westerfeld s novel Due to the lack of choice all markers of physical identity are destroyed by their government br br br Beauty br Kristi N Scott and M Heather Dragoo note that another recurring theme in the image obsessed society is beauty and its recurring relationship with individuality Gough agreed commenting that when everyone is equal beauty loses its meaning Beauty went hand in hand with identity Uglies were taught to think of their bodies and faces as temporary something that would be replaced later with cosmetic surgery A strong line is drawn to connect features with personality and one critic stated that the characters develop ugly and pretty personalities with each stage of their operations br br br Dystopian society br A utopia resting on ruthless suppression of individual freedom was Amanda Craig of The Times s description of Tally s city Many critics identified the trend of a controlling government in the novel People in the protagonist s world are programmed and designed by the Pretty committee with no say so in their operation and identity is placed firmly in the hands of the state Dragoo and Scott point out how segregated the city is with Pretties Uglies Middlies and Crumblies neatly divided into different sections Many reviewers have commented on the way in which the city manipulates its inhabitants including the supposedly rebellious uglies who are nothing more than docile bodies Bedies the dystopian society depicted by Westerfeld includes a particularly common trope in the genre the duality of spaces the metropolis representing the totalitarian civilization and nature as a field for freedom br br br Humanity br Various critics also found a theme of humanity within Uglies Phillip Gough noted that Pretties and Specials those who worked for Special Circumstances are posthuman because of their operations Others including Scott and Dragoo argued against this claiming the human body provides an artistic and political canvas for intentional manipulation and that this physical transformation can be an outlet for humanity The novel Uglies seems to take no definite stance on it though clearer points are shown in Pretties and Specials the following books in the trilogy br br br Background br When asked how he came up with the idea of Uglies Westerfeld said the inspiration came from a friend whose dentist asked him to consider getting cosmetic surgery He is the son of a computer programmer for Univac which meant he grew up familiar with the cutting edge of s technology Amanda Craig said that it is his prescient perception of how such inventions will lead to absolute loss of privacy which has elicited as much fan mail as the issue of how looks dominate our lives br The book shares many themes with the The Twilight Zone episode Number Looks Just Like You The author of the books noted that he saw the episode in his childhood but had forgotten the details br In the dedication page for Uglies Westerfeld says This novel was shaped by a series of e mail exchanges between myself and Ted Chiang about his story Liking What You See A Documentary His input on the manuscript was also invaluable In another interview Westerfeld says that this short story is about a new technology that enables an individual to turn off their ability to see beauty so they can focus on the deeper and more important parts of another individual In a interview on Bookyurt Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to make a big commentary on the issues with beauty but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in the world and to be aware of our own ideas about beauty and our need to think for ourselves br br br Reception br The novel has received mostly positive reviews The Baroque Body praised the novel as having creative slang unique technical gadgets and defining characteristics of personhood Cory Doctorow complimented its perfect parables of adolescent life and stated that it is fine science fiction for youth Jennifer Mattson claimed it to be ingenious Reed Business Information praised the convincing plot and noted that it is highly readable br However Publishers Weekly commented that Tally was a rather passive protagonist and the United Kingdom Times complained that Tally herself is a bit too vague as a character Critic Jennifer Mattson noted that the brisk pace of the novel as being bad for convincing relationships br The novel sparked discussion over the use of plastic surgery to improve one s looks The author said he has received many letters from girls who have decided against having surgery since reading Uglies while others sparked by Uglies have started to ponder the ethics of changing your body s appearance Westerfeld has theorized that having extreme cosmetic surgery will be like buying a Gucci bag an indication that you are a member of the privileged class Critics echo his opinion However Westerfeld has also stated he wouldn t hesitate to use plastic surgery if he had a kid with port wine stain We have all been altering our appearances ever since clothing was invented Other critics have stated that while altering one s appearance with plastic surgery can be ethically debatable the benefits of it to people who have need for it are tremendous br There is also some moderate debate sparked by Uglies over the issue of monitoring people The state has started to track teens through their cell phones and on occasion through dental implants Westerfeld feels that this will result in a total loss of privacy however others feel that this technology is necessary to properly supervise people br
