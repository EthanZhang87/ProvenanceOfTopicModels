A port wine stain nevus flammeus is a discoloration of the human skin caused by a vascular anomaly a capillary malformation in the skin They are so named for their coloration which is similar in color to port wine a fortified red wine from Portugal br A port wine stain is a capillary malformation seen at birth Port wine stains persist throughout life The area of skin affected grows in proportion to general growth br Port wine stains occur most often on the face but can appear anywhere on the body particularly on the neck upper trunk arms and legs Early stains are usually flat and pink in appearance As the child matures the color may deepen to a dark red or purplish color In adulthood thickening of the lesion or the development of small lumps may occur br Port wine stains may be part of a syndrome such as Sturge Weber syndrome or Klippel Tr naunay Weber syndrome br br br Types br br Nevus flammeus may be divided as follows br br Nevus flammeus nuchae br Midline nevus flammeus also known as salmon patch and angel s kiss is a vascular birthmark which may be found on the glabellar region or on one upper eyelid and presents in approximately of newborns br br br Genetics br Port wine stains were shown to be caused by a somatic activating c G A mutation in the GNAQ gene An association with RASA has also been described br br br Diagnosis br br A healthcare provider can usually diagnose a port wine stain based entirely upon the history and appearance In unusual cases a skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis Depending on the location of the birthmark and other associated symptoms a physician may choose to order a measurement of intraocular pressure or X ray of the skull br An MRI of the brain may be performed under anesthesia on infants who have a port wine stain in the head area in order to check for signs of Sturge Weber syndrome br If the port wine stain is inside the mouth a provider may check the insides of a newborn baby s throat with a scope to see if there are any changes growths other than just the color br If the port wine stain is around the eye or on the eyelid a referral may be made to an optometrist or ophthalmologist for a test of the ocular pressures in that eye If swelling occurs in the port wine stain it may cause vision problems glaucoma or blindness br br br Treatment br Many treatments have been tried for port wine stains including freezing surgery radiation and tattooing port wine stains can also be covered with cosmetics br Lasers may be able to destroy the capillaries without significant damage to the overlying skin Lasers and other light sources may therefore be able to reduce the redness of port wine stains although there is not enough evidence to recommend one form over another br For most people in trials of pulsed dye laser more than of the redness was reduced by laser after one to three treatments Adverse effects were rare in these trials although some people had changes to the color of the skin especially Chinese people with darker skin There can be pain crusting and blistering in the two weeks after treatment The trials only followed people for six months so long term outcomes are not known Up to treatments may be necessary for improvement but complete removal may not result The use of topical rapamycin as an adjunct to pulsed dye laser may improve results br Treatment is generally given before one year of age br With older laser treatments the skin is filled with black marks the size of a pen This is due to the laser instrument s size the black marks disappear within weeks The treated area can be sore and swollen for a couple of days However with newer v beam laser treatments there may not be any marks at all br br br Prognosis br In the absence of successful treatment hypertrophy increased tissue mass of the stains may cause problems later in life such as loss of function especially if the stain is near the eye or mouth bleeding and increasing disfigurement Lesions on or near the eyelid can be associated with glaucoma If the port wine stain is on the face or other highly visible part of the body its presence can also cause emotional and social problems for the affected person br br br Epidemiology br Studies have recorded an incidence of about cases per newborn babies br br br
