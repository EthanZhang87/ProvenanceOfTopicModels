Uglies is a book series by Scott Westerfeld for young adults Westerfeld originally intended for Uglies to be a trilogy However after publishing the series first three novels Uglies Pretties and Specials he ultimately wrote an additional fourth book Extras This fourth book is dedicated t o everyone who wrote to me to reveal the secret definition of the word trilogy On February Westerfeld announced a continuation of the series consisting of four new novels the first one being Impostors that was released in September br The first three novels focus on the exploits of Tally Youngblood In the post apocalyptic future society where Tally lives teenagers upon reaching their sixteenth birthday undergo a surgery to mold them into a so called Pretty When Tally s new friend Shay runs away to the Smoke a secret refuge for those who oppose the city s government the future of Tally s own operation becomes uncertain Dr Cable the head of the mysterious Special Circumstances cuts Tally a deal betray her friends and help the city locate the runaways or remain an Ugly forever When Tally joins the Smokies she learns a chilling truth the surgeries that the city performs are not just intended to render its inhabitants beautiful The city also puts lesions into the minds of the Pretties making them shallow unintelligent and ultimately an easier to control population Over the course of the novels Tally struggles to maintain her sense of self within a society that literally alters how people think and ultimately succeeds in undoing the system of mind alteration br The fourth novel centers on Aya Fuse a girl struggling to find her place in the chaotic world after Tally frees people to think for themselves br br br Setting br In humanity s future a new type of society has been formed after a disastrous oil bug was released upon the planet that killed of the human population and left many cities in ruins The new society is composed of about one hundred small post scarcity independently run city states spread out across the seven continents which now have different coastlines as a result of global warming Tally s city is located somewhere in Washington state west of the Cascade Mountains The new society holds three values at its core Sustainability Peace and Equality The new society promotes these values through the use of The Surge a type of extreme cosmetic surgery that all citizens undergo at the age of The Surge transforms ordinary humans into paragons of beauty right down to perfect facial symmetry New Pretties are given access to life in New Pretty Town the innermost part of the city where food shelter and entertainment are provided by the government free of charge Within the post Surge part of a person s life everyone s common beauty inspires peace and equality among the citizens br br br Inspiration for the series br In an interview with Simon and Schuster s book newsletter author Scott Westerfeld talks about the inspiration behind the series Westerfeld thinks that the future will allow people greater control over their appearance We are definitely heading toward a world in which lots of people will get to decide how they look That will change what we think of as beautiful and what beauty means to us In light of this Westerfeld wanted to write a future in which these technologies were fairly common br Westerfeld also cites Liking What You See A Documentary by Ted Chiang as an inspiration br Additionally the series shares many of its themes with the The Twilight Zone episode Number Twelve Looks Just Like You In a blog posting the author of the books notes that he had seen the episode in his childhood and had forgotten all the details br br br Social age groups br br br Littlies br Littlies are young children They live with their parents in the suburbs surrounding New Pretty Town and they will attend elementary school until they turn twelve They become uglies during their preteen years br br br Uglies br When children turn years old they are considered Ugly because of the burgeoning physical developments experienced by all preteens and teens Uglies are then moved out of the suburbs and live in monitored dorms in Uglyville where they attend middle and high school Uglies are encouraged to call each other nicknames based on their personal imperfections e g Fatty Skinny Squint or Zits as well as to use software to generate preferences for their facial features The former and latter are both methods of building up the Uglies anticipation for the Pretty operations they will undergo upon turning Unbeknownst to them Uglies are also monitored by city authorities not to restrain their behavior but to see which of them are most capable of pulling tricks such as sneaking out at night and into New Pretty Town This information is used in the Uglies later life to determine whether they are capable of holding jobs that require decisiveness initiative and independent thinking such as being a surgeon a firefighter or a Special br br br New Pretties br When an Ugly turns they undergo a massive Operation that makes them perfect in beauty and health The Operation completely overhauls a person s body structure and also includes lesions upon the brain which makes them compliant and less likely to cause conflict The lesions also tend to dumb them up They become New Pretties and are moved into apartments or mansions in New Pretty Town New Pretties do not have to work the only thing they do in New Pretty Town is have fun and maintain an active social life br New Pretties generally join popular cliques such as the Swarm who only go places massed into large groups the Hot Airs whose favored pastime is floating in hot air balloons and the Crims The Crims commonly consist of those who pulled the most tricks when they were Uglies and are therefore considered to have a criminal past hence the name br br br Middle Pretties br Middle Pretties have picked their professions and gone through a second minor operation that makes them look older and wiser but still beautiful They then move to the suburbs and are allowed to marry and have children but are encouraged to do so only every years so as to discourage the formation of sibling bonds and to ensure that the population of the city doesn t rise over capacity Middle pretties are the working class The Middle Pretties Littlies children are allowed to stay with their parents until they turn br br br Late Pretties br Late Pretties or Crumblies Littlies uglies and new pretties may refer to their parents as crumblies even if they are still middle pretties are parents grandparents great grandparents etc They live in assisted living homes and receive life extension surgery that allows them to live into their middle hundreds and two hundreds br br br Specials Optional br Uglies are surveillanced surveilled by Special Circumstances to see if they have what it takes to become a Special The security system in Pretty Town is too easy to hack and trick It is believed that the Specials were created by Dr Cable to stop humans from expanding into the wild or resisting the cities Specials are described as frighteningly beautiful and as a cruel pretty with features like large coal black eyes sharp cheekbones etc They undergo a special surgery that gives them the ability to feel vibrations with their hands enhanced senses muscles sheathed with self repairing mono filament sharp orbital alloy teeth incredible reflexes bones made out of aircraft ceramics light as bamboo and hard as diamonds Furthermore they are implanted with skintenna an antenna implanted on their spine which allows them to hear see what the others are doing talk to each other or listen to music They are also very strong br br br The Surge br The Surge also called The Operation is an internationally standardized and performed medical procedure mandated by the new society that plays a central part in the plot of the Uglies series The Surge consists of many steps taking place over a single twenty four hour period half of which is spent in anaesthetic stasis The Surge is mostly cosmetic but also involves major surgery being performed on the nervous immune and neurological systems The point of The Surge itself is to promote and inspire peace among its recipients with the idea that beauty ultimately trumps all forms of inequality and bigotry Things like race and orientation don t matter when everyone is beautiful The Surge is performed at the age of sixteen on every citizen in the world although some cities perform it at age and is hinted to be performed at in some and is strictly regulated by The International Committee For Morphological Standards The Pretty Committee which converges yearly to exchange notes on things such as innovations anaesthesia techniques and standard levels of attraction worldwide because of the cities attitude towards codependence these meetings are mostly just to make sure every city is making their recipients the same kind of pretty and to not have any one city have more attractive post ops br The schedule for The Surge is as follows br hours before No food or liquid is to be ingested by the patient It is requested that the patient rests as much as possible beforehand and dressed comfortably for the operation It is also asked that the patient does not pack heavily for their transition into New Pretty Town as they will most likely throw it away afterwards br hour before The patient is collected by a warden of the state and is taken into peaceful custody They are delivered to the city hospital and are taken to a waiting room while their operation tank is prepared br minutes before the patient is stripped of all clothing and is lowered into a Surge Tank a large glass tube which suspends the body in a thick fluid swarming with nanobots which deliver nutrients and oxygen to the body The patient is anaesthetised br At this point The Surge begins The first step involves grinding away the patients skin and replacing it with new grafts which are incapable of scarring burning or bruising The patient is then transformed from the top down starting with giving the face perfect symmetrical proportions and new plastic cheekbones Natural teeth are replaced with teeth made of aircraft ceramic Eyes are replaced or at least altered to give added shine colour and depth After this the patients nervous system is fine tuned for better reaction times and higher self awareness The skeletal structure is changed for a more attractive body shape and height and joints are padded for ease Bodily organs are improved or replaced and the immune system of the patient is technologically enhanced After this the final step of the invasive surgery is to create small lesions on the upper parts of the brain These lesions impede creativity violent behaviour apathy dysphoria adrenaline release and cause the new pretties to forget grudges These lesions ensure that The Surge works to its full potential of inspiring peace as the impeded aspects could cause chaos if left unaltered To allow the body time to recuperate burn away unwanted fat and to allow the musculature of the patient to be altered to a beneficial state the patient is put under electrolysis for hours When the patient is taken off electrolysis and wakes up the surgery is considered complete br For about two weeks afterwards the patient experiences extremely sensitive skin as their new grafts toughen up to withstand pressure This sensitivity is likened to having extremely bad sunburn br This operation performed at the median age of sixteen is only the first of many surgeries When a new pretty reaches a certain age or so they are given the surgery that transforms them into middle pretties This surgery is entirely cosmetic unless the pretty is entering a job which requires creativity and quick thinking in which case some lesions are removed and can be performed in an afternoon The second Surge gives the pretty light crows feet and a few grey hairs which inspire trust and authority There is no official third surgery though a crumbly can undergo multiple life extension surgeries which allow them to live into their mid two hundreds comfortably and attractively br br br The Cures br br br The Pretty Cures br br br Initial Pill Treatment br The first cure Maddy developed consisted of two pills In the first pill the nanos tiny robot machinery widely used throughout the prettytown were to break down the lesions The nanos in the second pill were to stop the nanos in the first pill from spreading Both pills were to be taken together Since Zane only took the first pill his brain was permanently damaged which ultimately led to his paralysis and later death br br br Later Pill Treatment br The second cure consisted of only one pill needed for the treatment of the lesions Maddy made the pills much safer instead of removing a part of the brain it stimulated the brain to work around the lesions The Smokies in partnership with another city Diego mass distributed the pills across the world causing the Mind Rain which marked the end of the prettytime In the second book Tally cures herself by rewiring herself br br br Unassisted Cure br Pretties are able to cure their own brain lesions by feeling bubbly enough i e participating in activities which stimulate the brain and increase brain chemicals Daring dangerous or thrilling acts all cause the bubbly feeling as well as physical pain and heightened emotional states such as stress or interest Pretties who are self motivated enough to continue undertaking challenging actions can eventually cure their own brain lesions which is considered a sign they are suitable for higher skilled jobs such as government positions doctors or Specials once they become Middles br Pain was used by Shay in Pretties to feel bubbly Unlike other cures it needed to be done frequently and wasn t long term just staving it off for a bit br br br The Special Cure br After she created the pills curing pretty lesions Maddy created a cure for Specials Unlike the pills the Special Cure had to be injected with a needle This cure didn t remove the scary appearance sharp teeth and fingernails but it removed the lesions in the brain like the pills After the mind rain Tally is the only Special in existence from her city without
