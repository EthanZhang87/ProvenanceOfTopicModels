protagonist Tally rebels against her society s rules first with harmless pranks and eventually by leaving the city altogether She finds a group of runaway uglies who refuse to conform to social norms that includes undergoing cosmetic surgery Similarly So Yesterday examines popularity and why certain trends are considered cool The novels praises innovators who think outside the box and come up with new fashion statements entirely on their own br Another common theme in Westerfeld s novels is coming of age Because Westerfeld writes primarily for young adult audiences his protagonists are usually teenagers who find themselves over the course of the novel or series Tally in Uglies Cal in Peeps and Hunter in So Yesterday all struggle with finding where they belong until they come to terms with who they are br Courage is another common theme in Westerfeld s work His protagonists often face frightening or dangerous problems and have to rely on their own courage to overcome the problem Often adults are not present during the time of crisis and the protagonist is left to his or her own devices For example Cal in Peeps is trained by adults on how to track down vampires but he goes alone to actually catch them and must accomplish this task completely on his own br br br Awards br Evolution s Darling was a New York Times Notable Book and won a Special Citation for the Philip K Dick Award
