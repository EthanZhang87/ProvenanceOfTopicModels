Characters br br br Cal Thompson br The protagonist of the novel Cal is a carrier of the parasite Essentially his body contains the parasite that in most people causes dementia cannibalism and other vampiric symptoms Cal gains the advantages of the parasite without suffering from the dementia suffering only minor side effects Because the parasite is transferred through almost any bodily fluid it causes Cal to feel sexually aroused at all times Due to its effects on people who are not carriers however he must resist these urges which prevents him from having any natural relationships br Cal is nineteen years of age and has been a carrier of the parasite for a year when the novel begins He is a hunter for the Night Watch hunting down out of control Peeps or Parasite Positives beginning with his ex girlfriends whom he infected The Night Watch dates back to colonial times in America but has never revealed itself to society for fear of causing widespread panic The novel focuses primarily on his hunt for Morgan the mysterious woman who infected him with the parasite Along the way he forms a relationship with Lace and discovers that the Night Watch has not told him all that they should have br br br Lace br Lacey known primarily as Lace meets Cal Thompson by chance in the elevator of her apartment building Because of her conviction in wanting to keep her expensive apartment at the amazingly low price she currently lives in it for she tags along in Cal s investigation in search of the means to which she can blackmail her landlord She becomes entangled in Cal s life and duties as a member of the Night Watch after being infected by his cat Cornelius who had made her a carrier and on the way begins to form an emotional tie with him br br br Morgan Ryder br Cal s progenitor Morgan changed his life eternally when she infected him with the parasite She met him a year prior to the beginning of the novel at a gay bar called Dick s Bar She is from one of the city s old families and her parasite is part of the old strain meaning that she does not go crazy from the parasite but still gets things like superhuman hearing and strength br br br Setting br The novel itself begins in Hoboken New Jersey but mostly takes place in the heart of New York City Also it takes place a lot in the sewers below New York br br br Parasite br The parasite featured in the novel is portrayed as being the source of many myths and legends The symptoms in a carrier are only a craving for fresh meat and sexual arousal around the clock but the symptoms of the normally affected are quite different The parasite causes dementia and cannibalism which were suggested as causing legends of most notably vampires but also werewolves and zombies among others The protagonist describes the superhuman strength speed and vision as the human body simply operating on emergency power He describes it as being the same as a mother protecting her child specifically the rush of adrenaline provided so that she can act as she needs to The parasite simply causes the body to act on this emergency adrenaline all the time requiring extra food These superior ability are shown in the novel several times by Cal He claims to need to tape over the light of his DVD player to be able to sleep at night as well as being able to read fine print by starlight He jumps fearlessly from a balcony to the one beside it causing suspicion from Lace not afflicted with the parasite at the time The parasite can be spread either directly from human to human or via an infected rat or cat Rats are shown to be attracted to infected persons The parasite also seems to give those infected with it either immortality or at least extreme longevity as shown by the Nightmayor who had lived for centuries br Two different strains were featured in the novel The first to appear is a new strain the symptoms and possible treatments for which have been known to Cal prior to the events of the novel The body can react in two ways to this strain The first and most common causes dementia cannibalism and a painful response to light of any kind Other symptoms involved hatred of what was once loved which can range from a singer to a skyline which can be used in order to capture the infected and near total reliance of primitive instincts Seemingly supernatural strength is present in this response but it is used most often in instinctive reactions and basic needs primarily food In order to keep the parasite spreading through the population of the earth the infected can spread the parasite to rats who defend them and continue to spread the parasite even if their progenitors cannot The out of control cannibals who contract the disease and exhibit these symptoms are hunted down by the Night Watch a group which fights to contain this strain of the parasite There is no true cure for this reaction to the strain and hospitalization coupled with an experimental plan of drugs is the only known treatment to contain a threat apart from imprisonment The second possible reaction to this strain and the much less common involves a more subtle response People who contract this strain of the parasite and receive this reaction are known as carriers of the disease for they do not suffer from its worst effects but have the possibility of spreading the disease nonetheless A craving for meat remains involving that of the human variety but a carrier of the strain is no longer forced to succumb totally to their instincts It is possible for the carriers of this strain to live a near normal life because the stronger symptoms are absent However they must shy away from any close contact with others humans involving simple things such as kissing and sharing a toothbrush for fear of spreading the disease further The worst of the remaining reactions primarily sexual arousal and cravings for meat can be overcome The carriers are compared to Mary Mallon most commonly referred to as Typhoid Mary by the protagonist br The second and older strain presents itself in a different manner To the untrained eye it may appear to be the same as the new strain However this strain is much more manageable It appeared in ancient times long before the new strain existed and aided in defeating the attack of a race of large worms By infecting as many people as possible an army was created to defeat the giant worms threatening humanity This older strain all but disappeared after it was no longer needed existing only in a brood of rats living underground When the giant worms that once threatened the existence of the human race return they force the infected rats to the surface who then spread the old strain back into the human population The strain is used to defeat the giant worms once again allowing the human race to survive but not without a certain degree of damage done to the world The dementia and cannibalism are present towards the beginning of the infection and is much more easily treatable Old methods which were used in the last large scale parasite infection are rediscovered and used such as garlic and rosemary This is evidently meant to represent the beginnings of vampire legends involving garlic as protection br The parasite is further explained in The Last Days adding another dimension to the parasite It is revealed that in ancient times there were certain singers that could call up giant worms from within the Earth so that they could be more easily killed This allowed the army of fighters against the giant worms to attract the worms under their preferred conditions such as time and location with sufficient preparation The singers were able to attract the worms by singing words that were guided by the parasite living within them sounding meaningless to the average human but captivating nonetheless Dr Prolix The Shrink an age old carrier of the parasite has vague memories of seeing one of these singers calling a giant worm up to be killed and Minerva a prominent character in The Last Days has inherited this ability from the parasite positives of centuries ago She experiences receiving these songs from underground in her home where old burial grounds are located giving a possible origin to this ability br br br Other parasites br Many other parasites are discussed within the story each one adding to the plausibility of the story One of these is Toxoplasmosis a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii Another is Trematoda a parasitic worm commonly referred to as a fluke Wolbachia a bacterium was also mentioned br
