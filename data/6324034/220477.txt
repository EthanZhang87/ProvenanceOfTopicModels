first they are good to their users then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers finally they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves Then they die I call this enshittification and it is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value combined with the nature of a two sided market where a platform sits between buyers and sellers hold each hostage to the other raking off an ever larger share of the value that passes between them br The word gained traction in where it was used by a variety of sources in reference to several major platforms discontinuing free features in order to further their monetization or taking other actions that were seen to degrade functionality In its annual vote the American Dialect Society designated enshittification as s Word of the Year br br br In popular culture br The webcomic xkcd has occasionally featured a partially
