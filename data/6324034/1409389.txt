The Twilight Zone marketed as Twilight Zone for its final two seasons is an American fantasy science fiction horror anthology television series created and presented by Rod Serling which ran for five seasons on CBS from October to June Each episode presents a standalone story in which characters find themselves dealing with often disturbing or unusual events an experience described as entering the Twilight Zone often with a surprise ending and a moral Although often considered predominantly science fiction the show s paranormal and Kafkaesque events leaned the show much closer to fantasy and horror there are about twice as many fantasy episodes as science fiction The phrase twilight zone has entered the vernacular used to describe surreal experiences br The series featured both established stars and younger actors who would become much better known later Serling served as executive producer and head writer he wrote or co wrote of the show s episodes He was also the show s host and narrator delivering monologues at the beginning and end of each episode and typically appeared on screen to address the audience directly during the opening scene Serling s opening and closing narrations usually summarize the episode s events encapsulating how and why the main characters had entered the Twilight Zone br br br Development br By the late s Rod Serling was a prominent name in American television His successful television plays included Patterns for Kraft Television Theatre and Requiem for a Heavyweight for Playhouse but he was frustrated by constant changes and edits made by the networks and sponsors In Requiem the line Got a match had to be cut because the sponsor sold lighters other programs had similar striking of words that might remind viewers of competitors to the sponsor including one case in which the sponsor Ford Motor Company had the Chrysler Building removed from a picture of the New York City skyline br According to comments in his anthology Patterns Serling had been trying to delve into material more controversial than his works of the early s This led to Noon on Doomsday for the United States Steel Hour in a commentary by Serling on the defensiveness and total lack of repentance he saw in the Mississippi town where the murder of Emmett Till took place His original script closely paralleled the Till case then was moved out of the South and the victim changed to a Jewish pawnbroker and eventually became just a foreigner in an unnamed town br Serling thought that a science fiction setting would give him more freedom and less interference in expressing controversial ideas than more realistic settings The Time Element was Serling s pilot pitch for his show a time travel adventure about a man who goes back to Honolulu in and unsuccessfully tries to warn everyone about the impending attack on Pearl Harbor The script however was rejected and shelved until Bert Granet discovered and produced it as an episode of Desilu Playhouse in The show was a great success and enabled Serling to finally begin production on The Twilight Zone Per the BFI Film Classics library the cruel indifference and implacability of fate and the irony of poetic justice were motifs for Serling br br br Episodes br br br Season br br There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity It is the middle ground between light and shadow between science and superstition and it lies between the pit of man s fears and the summit of his knowledge This is the dimension of imagination It is an area which we call The Twilight Zone br br The Twilight Zone premiered on October to rave reviews Twilight Zone is about the only show on the air that I actually look forward to seeing It s the one series that I will let interfere with other plans said Terry Turner for the Chicago Daily News Daily Variety ranked it with the best that has ever been accomplished in half hour filmed television and the New York Herald Tribune found the show to be certainly the best and most original anthology series of the year br Even as the show proved popular with television critics it struggled to find a receptive audience CBS was banking on a rating of at least or but its initial numbers were much worse The series future was jeopardized when its third episode Mr Denton on Doomsday earned a rating Still the show attracted a large enough audience to survive a brief hiatus in November after which it finally surpassed its competition on ABC and NBC and persuaded its sponsors General Foods and Kimberly Clark to stay on until the end of the season br With the exception of The Chaser the first season featured scripts written by Rod Serling Charles Beaumont and Richard Matheson The trio was responsible for of the episodes in the series With the exception of A World of His Own Serling never appeared on camera during any first season episode as he would in future seasons present only as a voice over narrator Serling did appear on screen in Twilight Zone promotional spots plugging the following week s episode just not in the episodes themselves These promo spots were unseen for several decades after their initial airings while many have been released in the DVD and Blu ray releases of The Twilight Zone a few are lost completely and some survive only as audio tracks Most are available through Paramount when watching the full episodes br Many of the season s episodes proved to be among the series most celebrated including Time Enough at Last The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street Walking Distance and The After Hours The first season won Serling an unprecedented fourth Emmy Award for dramatic writing a Producers Guild Award for Serling s creative partner Buck Houghton a Directors Guild Award for John Brahm and the Hugo Award for best dramatic presentation br Bernard Herrmann s original opening theme music lasted throughout the first season For the final five episodes of the season the show s original surrealist pit and summit opening montage and narration was replaced by a piece featuring an eye that closed revealing the setting sun and shorter narration and a truncated version of Herrmann s theme br Some first season episodes were available for decades only in a version with a pasted on second season opening These re themed episodes were prepared for airing in the summer of as summer repeats the producers wanted to have a consistent opening for the show every week During the original run Herrmann s theme was used in every first season episode The first season openings for these episodes have since been restored to recent DVD and Blu ray reissues although incorrect openings were restored on two episodes Mr Denton on Doomsday and A Passage for Trumpet br br br Season br br You re traveling through another dimension a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind a journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination That s the signpost up ahead your next stop the Twilight Zone br br The second season premiered on September with King Nine Will Not Return Serling s fresh take on the pilot episode Where Is Everybody The familiarity of this first story stood in stark contrast to the novelty of the show s new packaging Bernard Herrmann s stately original theme was replaced by Marius Constant s more jarring and dissonant and now more familiar guitar and bongo theme The closing eye was replaced by a more surreal introduction inspired by the new images in Serling s narration such as That s the signpost up ahead and Serling himself stepped in front of the cameras to present his opening narration rather than being only a voice over narrator as in the first season The openings of the first three episodes of the season retained the eye opening s narration br A new sponsor Colgate Palmolive replaced the previous year s Kimberly Clark as Liggett Myers would succeed General Foods in April and a new network executive James Aubrey took over CBS Jim Aubrey was a very very difficult problem for the show said associate producer Del Reisman He was particularly tough on The Twilight Zone because for its time it was a particularly costly half hour show Aubrey was real tough on the show s budget even when it was a small number of dollars In a push to keep the show s expenses down Aubrey ordered that seven fewer episodes be produced than last season and that six of those being produced would be shot on videotape rather than film a move Serling disliked calling it neither fish nor fowl Two additional episodes filmed in the second season The Grave and Nothing in the Dark were held over to the third season br Season two saw the production of many of the series most acclaimed episodes including Eye of the Beholder Nick of Time The Invaders The Trouble With Templeton and Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up The trio of Serling Matheson and Beaumont began to admit new writers and this season saw the television debut of George Clayton Johnson Emmys were won by Serling his fifth for dramatic writing and by director of photography George T Clemens and for the second year in a row the series won the Hugo Award for best dramatic presentation It also earned the Unity Award for Outstanding Contributions to Better Race Relations and an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Program Achievement in the Field of Drama The Twilight Zone was mentioned in Newton Minow s landmark speech Television and the Public Interest as one of the few quality television series on the air at the time in a vast wasteland of mass produced junk with Minow praising the series as dramatic and moving br br Five weeks into season two the show s budget was showing a deficit The total number of new episodes was projected at twenty nine more than half of which sixteen had already been filmed by November As a cost cutting measure six episodes The Lateness of The Hour The Night of the Meek The Whole Truth Twenty Two Static and Long Distance Call were produced in the cheaper videotape format which also required fewer camera movements In addition videotape was a relatively primitive medium in the early s the editing of tape was next to impossible Each of the episodes was therefore camera cut as in live TV on a studio sound stage using a total of four cameras The requisite multi camera setup of the videotape experiment made location shooting difficult severely limiting the potential scope of the story lines Even with those artistic sacrifices the eventual savings amounted to only per episode far less than the cost of a single episode The experiment was not attempted again Kinescope versions of the videotaped episodes were rerun in syndication br br br Season br br You re traveling through another dimension a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind a journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination Your next stop the Twilight Zone br In his third year as executive producer host narrator and primary writer for The Twilight Zone Serling was beginning to feel exhausted I ve never felt quite so drained of ideas as I do at this moment In the first two seasons he contributed scripts or of the show s total output he contributed of this season s output The show now seems to be feeding off itself said a Variety reviewer of the season s episode two Sponsors for this season included Chesterfield Bufferin tablets and Pepsi Cola br Despite his avowed weariness Serling again managed to produce several teleplays that are widely regarded as classics including It s a Good Life To Serve Man Little Girl Lost and Five Characters in Search of an Exit Scripts by Montgomery Pittman and Earl Hamner Jr supplemented Matheson and Beaumont s output and George Clayton Johnson submitted three teleplays that examined complex themes The episode I Sing the Body Electric was written by Ray Bradbury By the end of the season the series had reached over episodes br The Twilight Zone received two Emmy nominations for cinematography and art design but was awarded neither It again received the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation making it the only three time recipient until it was tied by Doctor Who in br In spring The Twilight Zone was late in finding a sponsor for its fourth season and was replaced on CBS s fall schedule with a new hour long situation comedy called Fair Exchange In the confusion that followed this apparent cancellation producer Buck Houghton left the series for a position at Four Star Productions Serling meanwhile accepted a teaching post at Antioch College his alma mater Though the series was eventually renewed Serling s contribution as executive producer decreased in its final seasons br br br Season br br You unlock this door with the key of imagination Beyond it is another dimension a dimension of sound a dimension of sight a dimension of mind You re moving into a land of both shadow and substance of things and ideas you ve just crossed over into the Twilight Zone br br In November CBS contracted Twilight Zone now sans The as a mid season January replacement for Fair Exchange the very show that replaced it in the September schedule In order to fill the Fair Exchange time slot each episode had to be expanded to an hour an idea which did not sit well with Serling nor the production crew Ours is the perfect half hour show If we went to an hour we d have to fleshen our stories soap opera style Viewers could watch fifteen minutes without knowing whether they were in a Twilight Zone or Desilu Playhouse Serling responded Herbert Hirschman was hired to replace long time producer Buck Houghton One of Hirschman s first decisions was to direct a new opening sequence this one illustrating a door eye window and other objects suspended in space His second task was to find and produce quality scripts Sponsors included Johnson Johnson br This season of Twilight Zone once again turned to the reliable trio of Serling Matheson and Beaumont However Serling s input was limited this season he still provided the majority of the teleplays but as executive producer he was virtually absent and as host his artful narrations had to be shot back to back against a gray background during his infrequent trips to Los Angeles Due to complications from a developing brain disease Beaumont s input also began to diminish significantly Additional scripts were commissioned from Earl Hamner Jr and Reginald Rose to fill in the gap br With five episodes left in the season Hirschman received an offer to work on a new NBC series called Espionage and was replaced by Bert Granet who had previously produced The Time Element Among Granet s first assignments was On Thursday We Leave for Home which Serling considered the season s most effective episode There was an Emmy nomination for cinematography and a nomination for the Hugo Award br br br Season br br Serling later claimed I was writing so much I felt I had begun to lose my perspective on what was good and what was bad By the end of this final season he had contributed scripts in five years This season the new alternate sponsors were American Tobacco and Procter Gamble The show returned to its half hour format br Beaumont was now out of the picture almost entirely contributing scripts only through the ghostwriters Jerry Sohl and John Tomerlin and after producing only episodes Bert Granet left and was replaced by William Froug with whom Serling had worked on Playhouse br br Froug made a number of unpopular decisions first by shelving several scripts purchased under Granet s term including Matheson s The Doll which was nominated for a Writer s Guild Award when finally produced in on Amazing Stories secondly Froug alienated George Clayton Johnson when he hired Richard deRoy to completely rewrite Johnson s teleplay Tick of Time eventually produced as Ninety Years Without Slumbering It makes the plot trivial complained Johnson of the resulting script insisting he be given screen credit for the final version of the episode as Johnson Smith Tick of Time became Johnson s final submission to The Twilight Zone br Even under these conditions several episodes were produced that are well remembered including Nightmare at Feet A Kind of a Stopwatch The Masks and Living Doll Although this season received no Emmy recognition An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge a French short film which was modified slightly for broadcast received the Academy Award for best short film in It was based on the short story of the same name by Ambrose Bierce Serling introduces it as a haunting study of the incredible from the past master of the incredible br In late January CBS announced the show s cancellation For one reason or other Jim Aubrey decided he was sick of the show H e claimed that it was too far over budget and that the ratings weren t good enough explained Froug But Serling countered by telling the Daily Variety that he had decided to cancel the network ABC showed interest in bringing Serling over to their network to write a more explicitly horror themed series Witches Warlocks and Werewolves but Serling was not impressed The network executives seem to prefer weekly ghouls and we have what appears to be a considerable difference in opinion I don t mind my show being supernatural but I don t want to be booked into a graveyard every week Shortly afterwards Serling sold his share in The Twilight Zone to CBS leaving the show and all projects involving the supernatural behind him until when Night Gallery debuted br br br Casting br br Being an anthology series with no recurring characters The Twilight Zone features a wide array of guest
