id: 20785969
A dystopia from Ancient Greek dus bad and t pos place also called a cacotopia or anti utopia is a community or society that is extremely bad or frightening It is often treated as an antonym of utopia a term that was coined by Sir Thomas More and figures as the title of his best known work published in which created a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime violence and poverty The relationship between utopia and dystopia is in actuality not one simple opposition as many utopian elements and components are found in dystopias as well and vice versa br Dystopias are often characterized by fear or distress tyrannical governments environmental disaster or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society Themes typical of a dystopian society include complete control over the people in a society through the usage of propaganda heavy censoring of information or denial of free thought worshiping an unattainable goal the complete loss of individuality and heavy enforcement of conformity Despite certain overlaps dystopian fiction is distinct from post apocalyptic fiction and an undesirable society is not necessarily dystopian Dystopian societies appear in many fictional works and artistic representations particularly in stories set in the future Famous examples include Yevgeny Zamyatin s We Aldous Huxley s Brave New World George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four and Ray Bradbury s Fahrenheit Dystopian societies appear in many sub genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to society environment politics economics religion psychology ethics science or technology Some authors use the term to refer to existing societies many of which are or have been totalitarian states or societies in an advanced state of collapse Dystopias through an exaggerated worst case scenario often make a criticism about a current trend societal norm or political system br br br Etymology br Dustopia the original spelling of dystopia first appeared in Lewis Henry Younge s Utopia or Apollo s Golden Days in Additionally dystopia was used as an antonym for utopia by John Stuart Mill in one of his Parliamentary Speeches Hansard Commons by adding the prefix dys Ancient Greek bad to topia reinterpreting the initial u as the prefix eu Ancient Greek good instead of ou Ancient Greek not It was used to denounce the government s Irish land policy It is perhaps too complimentary to call them Utopians they ought rather to be called dys topians or caco topians What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable br Decades before the first documented use of the word dystopia was cacotopia kakotopia using Ancient Greek s bad wicked originally proposed in by Jeremy Bentham As a match for utopia or the imagined seat of the best government suppose a cacotopia or the imagined seat of the worst government discovered and described Though dystopia became the more popular term cacotopia finds occasional use Anthony Burgess author of A Clockwork Orange said it was a better fit for Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four because it sounds worse than dystopia br br br Theory br Some scholars such as Gregory Claeys and Lyman Tower Sargent make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias For example Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the society in which the author writes Some of these are anti utopias which criticise attempts to implement various concepts of utopia In the most comprehensive treatment of the literary and real expressions of the concept Dystopia A Natural History Claeys offers a historical approach to these definitions Here the tradition is traced from early reactions to the French Revolution Its commonly anti collectivist character is stressed and the addition of other themes the dangers of science and technology of social inequality of corporate dictatorship of nuclear war are also traced A psychological approach is also favored here with the principle of fear being identified with despotic forms of rule carried forward from the history of political thought and group psychology introduced as a means of understanding the relationship between utopia and dystopia Andrew Norton Schwartzbard noted that written many centuries before the concept dystopia existed Dante s Inferno in fact includes most of the typical characteristics associated with this genre even if placed in a religious framework rather than in the future of the mundane world as modern dystopias tend to be In the same vein Vicente Angeloti remarked that George Orwell s emblematic phrase a boot stamping on a human face forever would aptly describe the situation of the denizens in Dante s Hell Conversely Dante s famous inscription Abandon all hope ye who enter here would have been equally appropriate if placed at the entrance to Orwell s Ministry of Love and its notorious Room br br br Society br br Dystopias typically reflect contemporary sociopolitical realities and extrapolate worst case scenarios as warnings for necessary social change or caution Dystopian fictions invariably reflect the concerns and fears of their creators contemporaneous culture Due to this they can be considered a subject of social studies In dystopias citizens may live in a dehumanized state be under constant surveillance or have a fear of the outside world In the film What Happened to Monday the protagonists identical septuplet sisters risk their lives by taking turns onto the outside world because of a one child policy place in this futuristic dystopian society br In a study Frank Kermode suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode Christopher Schmidt notes that while the world goes to waste for future generations people distract themselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment br In the s there was a surge of popular dystopian young adult literature and blockbuster films Some have commented on this trend saying that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism Cultural theorist and critic Mark Fisher identified the phrase as encompassing the theory of capitalist realism the perceived widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it and used the above quote as the title to the opening chapter of his book Capitalist Realism Is There No Alternative In the book he also refers to dystopian film such as Children of Men originally a novel by P D James to illustrate what he describes as the slow cancellation of the future Theo James an actor in Divergent originally a novel by Veronica Roth explains that young people in particular have such a fascination with this kind of story It s becoming part of the consciousness You grow up in a world where it s part of the conversation all the time the statistics of our planet warming up The environment is changing The weather is different These are things that are very visceral and very obvious and they make you question the future and how we will survive It s so much a part of everyday life that young people inevitably consciously or not are questioning their futures and how the Earth will be I certainly do I wonder what kind of world my children s kids will live in br The entire substantial sub genre of alternative history works depicting a world in which Nazi Germany won the Second World War can be considered as dystopias So can other works of Alternative History in which a historical turning point led to a manifestly repressive world For example the mockumentary C S A The Confederate States of America and Ben Winters Underground Airlines in which slavery in the United States continues to the present with electronic slave auctions carried out via the Internet and slaves controlled by electronic devices implanted in their spines or Keith Roberts Pavane in which th Century Britain is ruled by a Catholic theocracy and the Inquisition is actively torturing and burning heretics br br br Common themes br br br Politics br In When the Sleeper Wakes H G Wells depicted the governing class as hedonistic and shallow George Orwell contrasted Wells s world to that depicted in Jack London s The Iron Heel where the dystopian rulers are brutal and dedicated to the point of fanaticism which Orwell considered more plausible br The political principles at the root of fictional utopias or perfect worlds are idealistic in principle and result in positive consequences for the inhabitants the political principles on which fictional dystopias are based while often based on utopian ideals result in negative consequences for inhabitants because of at least one fatal flaw br Dystopias are often filled with pessimistic views of the ruling class or a government that is brutal or uncaring ruling with an iron fist Dystopian governments are sometimes ruled by a fascist or communist regime or dictator These dystopian government establishments often have protagonists or groups that lead a resistance to enact change within their society as is seen in Alan Moore s V for Vendetta br Dystopian political situations are depicted in novels such as We Parable of the Sower Darkness at Noon Nineteen Eighty Four Brave New World The Handmaid s Tale The Hunger Games Divergent and Fahrenheit and such films as Metropolis Brazil Battle Royale FAQ Frequently Asked Questions Soylent Green The Purge Election Year Logan s Run and The Running Man An earlier example is Jules Verne s The Begum s Millions with its depiction of Stahlstadt Steel City a vast industrial and mining complex which is totally devoted to the production of ever more powerful and destructive weapons and which is ruled by the dictatorial and totally ruthless Prof Schultze a militarist and racist who dreams of world conquest and as the first step plots the complete destruction of the nearby Ville France a utopian model city constructed and maintained with public health as its government s primary concern br br br Economics br The economic structures of dystopian societies in literature and other media have many variations as the economy often relates directly to the elements that the writer is depicting as the source of the oppression There are several archetypes that such societies tend to follow A theme is the dichotomy of planned economies versus free market economies a conflict which is found in such works as Ayn Rand s Anthem and Henry Kuttner s short story The Iron Standard Another example of this is reflected in Norman Jewison s film Rollerball br Some dystopias such as that of Nineteen Eighty Four feature black markets with goods that are dangerous and difficult to obtain or the characters may be at the mercy of the state controlled economy Kurt Vonnegut s Player Piano depicts a dystopia in which the centrally controlled economic system has indeed made material abundance plentiful but deprived the mass of humanity of meaningful labor virtually all work is menial unsatisfying and only a small number of the small group that achieves education is admitted to the elite and its work In Tanith Lee s Don t Bite the Sun there is no want of any kind only unabashed consumption and hedonism leading the protagonist to begin looking for a deeper meaning to existence Even in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society s flaws as in Brave New World the state often controls the economy a character reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body cites as a reason that works for everyone else br Other works feature extensive privatization and corporatism both consequences of capitalism where privately owned and unaccountable large corporations have replaced the government in setting policy and making decisions They manipulate infiltrate control bribe are contracted by and function as government This is seen in the novels Jennifer Government and Oryx and Crake and the movies Alien Avatar RoboCop Visioneers Idiocracy Soylent Green WALL E and Rollerball Corporate republics are common in the cyberpunk genre as in Neal Stephenson s Snow Crash and Philip K Dick s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep as well as the film Blade Runner influenced by and based upon Dick s novel br br br Class br Dystopian fiction frequently draws stark contrasts between the privileges of the ruling class and the dreary existence of the working class In the novel Brave New World by Aldous Huxley a class system is prenatally determined with Alphas Betas Gammas Deltas and Epsilons with the lower classes having reduced brain function and special conditioning to make them satisfied with their position in life Outside of this society there also exist several human settlements that exist in the conventional way but which the World Government describes as savages br In George Orwell s Nineteen Eighty Four the dystopian society described within has a tiered class structure with the ruling elite Inner Party at the top the Outer Party below them functioning as a type of middle class with minor privileges and the working class Proles short for proletariat at the bottom of the hierarchy with few rights yet making up the vast majority of the population br In Ypsilon Minus by Herbert W Franke people are divided into numerous alphabetically ranked groups br In the film Elysium the majority of Earth s population on the surface lives in poverty with little access to health care and are subject to worker exploitation and police brutality while the wealthy live above the Earth in luxury with access to technologies that cure all diseases reverse aging and regenerate body parts br Written a century earlier the future society depicted in H G Wells The Time Machine had started in a similar way to Elysium the workers consigned to living and working in underground tunnels while the wealthy live on a surface made into an enormous beautiful garden But over a long time period the roles were eventually reversed the rich degenerated and became a decadent livestock regularly caught and eaten by the underground cannibal Morlocks br br br Family br Some fictional dystopias such as Brave New World and Fahrenheit have eradicated the family and kept it from re establishing itself as a social institution In Brave New World where children are reproduced artificially the concepts of mother and father are considered obscene In some novels such as We the state is hostile to motherhood as a pregnant woman from One State is in revolt br br br Religion br In dystopias religious groups may play the role of oppressed or oppressor One of the earliest examples is Robert Hugh Benson s Lord of the World about a futuristic world where Marxists and Freemasons led by the Antichrist have taken over the world and the only remaining source of dissent is a tiny and persecuted Catholic minority In Brave New World the establishment of the state included lopping off the tops of all crosses as symbols of Christianity to make them T s as symbols of Henry Ford s Model T In C S Lewis s That Hideous Strength the leaders of the fictional National Institute of Coordinated Experiments a joint venture of academia and government to promote an anti traditionalist social agenda are contemptuous of religion and require initiates to desecrate Christian symbols Margaret Atwood s novel The Handmaid s Tale takes place in a future United States under a Christian based theocratic regime br br br Identity br In the Russian novel We by Yevgeny Zamyatin first published in people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are only referred to by numbers instead of names The latter feature also appears in the film THX In some dystopian works such as Kurt Vonnegut s Harrison Bergeron society forces individuals to conform to radical egalitarian social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment or even competence as forms of inequality Complete conformity and suppression of individuality to the point of acting in unison is also depicted in Madeleine L Engle s A Wrinkle in Time br br br Violence br Violence is prevalent in many dystopias often in the form of war but also in urban crimes led by predominately teenage gangs e g A Clockwork Orange or rampant crime met by blood sports e g Battle Royale The Running Man The Hunger Games Divergent and The Purge It is also explained in Suzanne Berne s essay Ground Zero where she explains her experience of the aftermath of September br br br Nature br Fictional dystopias are commonly urban and frequently isolate their characters from all contact with the natural world Sometimes they require their characters to avoid nature as when walks are regarded as dangerously anti social in Ray Bradbury s Fahrenheit as well as within Bradbury s short story The Pedestrian In That Hideous Strength science coordinated by government is directed toward the control of nature and the elimination of natural human instincts In Brave New World the lower class is conditioned to be afraid of nature but also to visit the countryside and consume transport and games to promote economic activity Lois Lowry s The Giver shows a society where technology and the desire to create a utopia has led humanity to enforce climate control on the environment as well as to eliminate many undomesticated species and to provide psychological and pharmaceutical repellent against human instincts E M Forster s The Machine Stops depicts a highly changed global environment which forces people to live underground due to an atmospheric contamination As Angel Galdon Rodriguez points out this sort of isolation caused by external toxic hazard is later used by Hugh Howey in his series of dystopias of the Silo Series br Excessive pollution that destroys nature is common in many dystopian films such as The Matrix RoboCop WALL E April and the Extraordinary World and Soylent Green as well as in videogames like Half Life A few green fictional dystopias do exist such as in Michael Carson s short story The Punishment of Luxury and Russell Hoban s Riddley Walker The latter is set in the aftermath of nuclear war a post nuclear holocaust Kent where technology has reduced to the level of the Iron Age br br br Science and technology br Contrary to the technologically utopian claims which view technology as a beneficial addition to all aspects of humanity technological dystopia concerns itself with and focuses largely but not always on the negative effects caused by new technology br br Technologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature br Jaron Lanier a digital pioneer has become a technological dystopian I think it s a way of interpreting technology in which people forgot taking responsibility Oh it s the computer that did it not me There s no more middle class Oh it s not me The computer did it This quote explains that people begin to not only blame the technology for the changes in lifestyle but also believe that technology is an omnipotence It also points to a technological determinist perspective in terms of reification br Technologies harm our interpersonal communication relationships and communities br A decrease in communication within family members and friend groups due to increased time in technology use Virtual space misleadingly heightens the impact of real presence people resort to technological medium for communication nowadays br Technologies reinforce hierarchies concentrate knowledge and skills increase surveillance and erode privacy widen inequalities of power and wealth giving up control to machines br Douglas Rushkoff a technological utopian states in his article that the professional designers re mystified the computer so it wasn t so readable anymore users had to depend on the special programs built into the software that was incomprehensible for normal users br New technologies are sometimes regressive worse than previous technologies br The unforeseen impacts of technology are negative br The most common way is that there s some magic artificial intelligence in the sky or in the cloud or something that knows how to translate and what a wonderful thing that this is available for free But there s another way to look at it which is the technically true way You gather a ton of information from real live translators who have translated phrases It s huge but very much like Facebook it s selling people back to themselves With translation you re producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime the original translators aren t paid for their work You re actually shrinking the economy br More efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life by causing stress destroying jobs making us more materialistic br In his article Prest o Change o technological dystopian James Gleick mentions the remote control being the classic example of technology that does not solve the problem it is meant to solve Gleick quotes Edward Tenner a historian of technology that the ability and ease of switching channels by the remote control serves to increase distraction for the viewer Then it is only expected that people will become more dissatisfied with the channel they are watching br New technologies can solve problems of old technologies or just create new problems br The remote control example explains this claim as well for the increase in laziness and dissatisfaction levels was clearly not a problem in times without the remote control He also takes social psychologist Robert Levine s example of Indonesians whose main entertainment consists of watching the same few plays and dances month after month year after year and with Nepalese Sherpas who eat the same meals of potatoes and tea through their entire lives The Indonesians and Sherpas are perfectly satisfied Because of the invention of the remote control it merely created more problems br Technologies destroy nature harming human health and the environment br The need for business replaced community and the story online replaced people as the soul of the Net Because information was now able to be bought and sold there was not as much communication taking place br br br In pop culture br Dystopian themes are in many television shows and video games such as Cyberpunk The Hunger Games Cyberpunk Edgerunners Blade Runner Elysium and Titanfall br br br See also br br Alternate history br Horror fiction br Apocalyptic and post
