History br Several speculative fiction author bibliographies were posted to the USENET newsgroup rec arts sf written from to by Jerry Boyajian Gregory J E Rawlins and John Wenn A more or less standard bibliographic format was developed for these postings Many of these bibliographies can still be found at The Link ping Science Fiction Archive In a searchable database of awards information was developed by Al von Ruff In John R R Leavitt created the Speculative Fiction Clearing House SFCH In late he asked for help in displaying awards information and von Ruff offered his database tools Leavitt declined because he wanted code that could interact with other aspects of the site In Al von Ruff and Ahasuerus a prolific contributor to rec arts sf written started to construct the ISFDB based on experience with the SFCH and the bibliographic format finalized by John Wenn The first version of ISFDB went live on September and a URL was published in January br The ISFDB was first located at an ISP in Champaign Illinois but it suffered from constrained resources in disk space and database support which limited its growth In October the ISFDB moved to SF Site a major SF portal and review site Due to the rising costs of remaining with SF Site the ISFDB moved to its own domain in December but it was shut down by the hosting ISP due to high resource usage In February it began to be hosted by The Cushing Library Science Fiction and Fantasy Research Collection and Institute for Scientific Computation at Texas A M University The ISFDB moved to a commercial hosting service in br On February the database and the underlying code became available under Creative Commons licensing br ISFDB was originally edited by a limited number of people principally Al von Ruff and Ahasuerus Editing was opened in to the general public on an open content basis with changed content being approved by one of a limited number of moderators in an attempt to protect the accuracy of the database br In late the ISFDB was publicly criticized for its refusal to update its record of an author s name after a name change The record remained uncorrected for more than a year with an ISFDB editor deploying transphobic talking points at one point in spite of the fact that maintaining a trans author s deadname violates best practices and recommendations from various professional organizations br
