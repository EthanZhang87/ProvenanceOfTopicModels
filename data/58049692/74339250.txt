id: 74339250
From July to November the American actors union SAG AFTRA Screen Actors Guild American Federation of Television and Radio Artists was on strike over a labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers AMPTP As the longest strike in SAG AFTRA history its combined impact with the Writers Guild of America strike resulted in the loss of jobs and an estimated billion loss to the economy of Southern California According to Deadline Hollywood the harshest pain was perhaps felt among the below the line workers who ve had to sell or mortgage their homes and wipe through IRAs to survive br Along with the Writers Guild of America strike which ended on September it was part of a series of broader Hollywood labor disputes Both the SAG AFTRA and WGA strikes contributed to the biggest interruption to the American film and television industries since the impact of the COVID pandemic in just three years prior In addition to standing in solidarity with the writers the strike was led by changes in the industry caused by streaming and its effect on residuals as well as other new technologies like AI and digital recreation It marked the first time that actors initiated a labor dispute in the U S since the actors strike and the first time that actors and writers have walked out simultaneously since br Negotiations between SAG AFTRA and the AMPTP took place from October to October and resumed on October On November a tentative deal between the two sides was reached Striking ended on November at a m PST On December the SAG AFTRA membership officially ratified the contract with over of members voting in favor of it br br The Screen Actors Guild American Federation of Television and Radio Artists SAG AFTRA is a labor union that represents approximately media professionals and entertainers The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers AMPTP is a trade association that represents film and television studios in collective bargaining negotiations with unions such as SAG AFTRA the Directors Guild of America DGA and Writers Guild of America East and Writers Guild of America West comprising the Writers Guild of America WGA SAG AFTRA was formed by the merger of the Screen Actors Guild SAG and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists AFTRA in March allowing SAG AFTRA to represent not only actors but also journalists talk show hosts and other broadcast workers The WGA and the Screen Actors Guild have not simultaneously been on strike since when actors joined striking writers over residual payments from films sold to television networks The actors strike involved the combined efforts of SAG and AFTRA The largest SAG AFTRA strike since occurred in in which commercial actors went on strike to push for a continuation of the residual system against advertiser backlash amidst the divisions between SAG and AFTRA br During the last decade and the rise of streaming writers and actors have been frustrated over studio policy regarding residuals from streaming services the decline of network television has led to a stronger reliance on other residuals The WGA strike was motivated in large part by studio executives insisting that writers should receive no residuals from streaming services The strike cost the city of Los Angeles an estimated US billion according to NPR As with striking WGA writers actors have expressed concerns about the use of artificial intelligence noting that it could be used to replicate their likeness without compensation br br Weeks after the Writers Guild of America went on strike in May SAG AFTRA s national board of directors unanimously agreed to pursue a strike authorization vote ahead of a renewed contract SAG AFTRA approved a new contract in that would expire on June The union stated that it did not intend to strike but that it sought to give its negotiators maximum bargaining leverage ahead of negotiations on June SAG AFTRA cited several issues in negotiations including economic fairness residuals regulating the use of artificial intelligence and alleviating the burdens of the industry wide shift to self taping and told its members that the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers would cut actors salaries to pad corporate profits In a video released on May SAG AFTRA members Julia Louis Dreyfus Jean Smart and Kumail Nanjiani appealed to members to vote to strike but reserved that a vote for strike authorization was solely a bargaining tool not a vote to order an immediate strike br On June SAG AFTRA approved the strike authorization by a margin according to the union High profile members including Quinta Brunson Jennifer Lawrence and Rami Malek signaled their willingness to strike ahead of the deadline to achieve a transformative deal despite extremely productive negotiations SAG AFTRA agreed to extend negotiations to midnight on July in an attempt to avoid a strike but negotiations broke down in July SAG AFTRA surveyed members on a strike on July and began preparing picket signs two days later br The AMPTP agreed to a last minute request for mediation from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service on July congressional and public affairs director Greg Raelson stated that a federal mediator would be present the following day In turn SAG AFTRA accused the AMPTP of attempting to extend negotiations beyond the deadline and reiterated that it would not continue negotiating after July A number of high profile actors including Lawrence and Malek then affirmed their support again by signing a letter urging the union to take aggressive measures and stating their willingness to strike It was later reported by Variety that mediation collapsed after AMPTP President Carol Lombardini insulted negotiators by telling them to be civilized and avert a strike which prompted a walkout by union negotiators In response to Lombardini s comment SAG AFTRA president Fran Drescher reportedly said to AMPTP negotiators Now you ve got two unions on strike as they left br On July a statement was made announcing the construction of a Fast Furious themed roller coaster the date of the announcement coincided with the deadline SAG AFTRA gave before ending negotiations with the AMPTP and construction began by the strike s start This added to the construction that began on May shortly after the WGA began protesting on site obstructing Lankershim Boulevard along the west end of the park s campus and parking lot and further restricting sidewalk access The sidewalks in front of Gates and would be scaffolded off and demolished in this construction Despite prior advice from the Los Angeles Police Department s Labor Relations Unit to place K rails from River Road to Universal Hollywood Drive for the safety of protesters and other pedestrians since WGA protests as early as June none were placed by July by which time reports of two protesters being struck by vehicles had been made br br On July with no agreement between SAG AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers AMPTP the SAG AFTRA negotiating committee voted unanimously to recommend a strike to the union s national board The national board held a vote officially approving the strike SAG AFTRA president Fran Drescher announced the strike would begin at midnight on July the cast of Oppenheimer left the film s London premiere ahead of the announcement to walk out Joined by chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree Ireland Drescher asserted that the strike was a reluctant last resort and described the proposed contract as moving around furniture on the Titanic In the press conference Crabtree Ireland alleged that the AMPTP attempted to include a proposal that allowed studios to for a one time fee equivalent to one day s pay have exclusive and indefinite rights to extras likenesses including the use of generative AI to replicate them on screen Media commentators likened this to the film The Congress and the Black Mirror sixth series episode Joan Is Awful However AMPTP denied these claims stating that their proposal would allow usage of these replicas within the specific film for which they are employed and that any other uses would require consent and further compensation br br The strike officially began on July As part of the rules established on July actors cannot engage in film or television productions and cannot take part in promotional work such as press junkets film premieres and events including San Diego Comic Con which was scheduled for July The strike action does not apply to SAG AFTRA members who work under contracts that are negotiated by the union separately from the AMPTP contract including broadcast journalists Work in podcasts micro budget independent films and student films is allowed as is unscripted television work such as game shows reality competition shows documentaries and talk shows Internationally SAG AFTRA members are authorized to continue work in the United Kingdom under pre established Equity collective bargaining agreements as UK law criminalizes solidarity strikes The HBO series House of the Dragon thus continued its UK based filming with SAG AFTRA actors operating under Equity contracts prompting backlash among fans of the series br On July the Ficus trees on Barham Boulevard s sidewalk outside Gate were pruned almost entirely of their leaves Pine trees on the opposite side of Barham were not touched nor were a row of pepper trees behind the fence near the production gate The pruning was described as a vindictive action because the trees had been being used by protesters as shade from the over F C summer temperatures of Southern California The pruning was also described as illegal on the grounds that the trees are owned by the city and that Los Angeles tree ordinances prohibit trimming them between July and September NBCUniversal issued a statement to Deadline Hollywood denying that the trimming was done out of malice claiming that they trim the trees outside the park in July annually for safety and describing it and the obstructive construction hazards as unintended challenges for demonstrators NBCUniversal was fined US for violating tree laws and destroying city property br Also on July SAG AFTRA released a twelve page statement outlining the breakdown in negotiations and terms they found unacceptable including but not limited to a five percent salary increase for actors while the union had asked for eleven percent The AMPTP released a counter statement highlighting that its actions were being deliberately distort ed and that SAG AFTRA had chosen to pass over the most lucrative deal we have ever negotiated valued at million over the three year term of the contract br On July NBCUniversal was accused of conducting business at Universal Studios Hollywood to deter or endanger the protesters and infringe on their rights to protest In response SAG AFTRA and WGA issued a joint grievance to the National Labor Relations Board against NBCUniversal accusing the company of interfering with their freedom to picket and endangering their members Writers Guild of America West additionally filed a petition to the AMPTP in response to NBCUniversal s failure to install barriers to protect WGA and SAG AFTRA protestors from the risk of being forced into traffic NBCUniversal responded to The Hollywood Reporter in a statement We are aware of the WGA and SAG AFTRA complaints We strongly believe that the company has fulfilled our legal obligations under the National Labor Relations Act NLRA and we will cooperate with respect to any inquiries by the National Labor Relations Board on this issue While we understand the timing of our multi year construction project has created challenges for demonstrators we continue to work with public agencies to increase access We support the unions rights to demonstrate safely br On July SAG AFTRA approved more films to be shot during the strike including Ishana Night Shyamalan s The Watchers Sam Raimi s Don t Move and David Lowery s Mother Mary films then became eligible to shoot under strike rules br On July thousands of actors rallied Tuesday morning at Times Square from A M to noon to voice their concerns about fair treatment and wages SAG AFTRA s main contractual negotiator Duncan Crabtree Ireland spoke about the struggle that the union is facing with the AMPTP Many celebrities gave speeches to express their concerns about the future of their union and technological advancements in the industry In attendance were Lauren Ambrose Matt Bomer Christine Baranski Steve Buscemi Bobby Cannavale Tituss Burgess Liza Col n Zayas Bryan Cranston Jessica Chastain Gregory Diaz Jennifer Ehle Brendan Fraser Nancy Giles Danai Gurira Jill Hennessy Marin Hinkle Stephen Lang Arian Moayed Christopher Meloni Chlo Grace Moretz Wendell Pierce Michael Shannon Christian Slater Corey Stoll Merritt Wever and Rachel Zegler br br Picketing was called off for one day August due to Hurricane Hilary br br On September the SAG AFTRA National Board voted to send the video game strike authorization vote to its members and on September the results showed the authorization passed with voting in favor br After the WGA and AMPTP reached a tentative agreement on September leading to the official end of the WGA strike on September SAG AFTRA announced that it remains on strike and called for renewed negotiations with the AMPTP Later on September SAG AFTRA and AMPTP made a joint announcement that SAG AFTRA and the AMPTP will resume negotiations for a new TV Theatrical contract on Monday October br br On October SAG AFTRA and the AMPTP met for negotiations in the first meeting between the two unions since the SAG AFTRA strike began on July Unlike the WGA s negotiations the SAG AFTRA s negotiations were held at SAG AFTRA s headquarters on Wilshire Boulevard rather than the AMPTP s headquarters in Sherman Oaks as according to Deadline SAG AFTRA officials were displeased with the AMPTP s setup and wanted a change of scenery Participants included AMPTP chief Carol Lombardini Donna Langley NBCUniversal David Zaslav Warner Bros Discovery Ted Sarandos Netflix Bob Iger Disney as well as SAG AFTRA s Fran Drescher Duncan Crabtree Ireland and Ray Rodriguez The meeting concluded with an announcement that they would meet again on the th This pattern continued from October to when a joint statement announced a meeting on October However negotiations broke down on October br Beginning October numerous reasons were given as to why negotiations stopped Sarandos said that talks broke down because SAG AFTRA introduced a levy on subscribers on top of other areas which he said was a bridge too far However SAG AFTRA accused the AMPTP of using bully tactics with SAG AFTRA president Fran Drescher stating that the AMPTP had given us a proposal package We worked for like hours on it We brought it back to them We walked them through it and they left and then called a few hours later and said We re breaking negotiations Drescher has also said that SAG AFTRA wants to continue negotiations Duncan Crabtree Ireland SAG AFTRA also responded stating that the public statement from the CEOs in their press release from the AMPTP characterized our demands as excessive But really we don t think they are The numbers they ve been using are wildly overstated br On October SAG AFTRA announced that it will schedule negotiations regarding a new video game contract br On October Deadline Hollywood reported that a Zoom call between Hollywood stars George Clooney Scarlett Johansson Kerry Washington Tyler Perry Bradley Cooper Meryl Streep Jennifer Aniston Robert De Niro Ben Affleck Laura Dern Emma Stone Reese Witherspoon Ryan Reynolds and Ariana DeBose and SAG AFTRA leaders introduced a proposal that amounts to the town s biggest earners defraying the costs to AMPTP signatories by eliminating the cap on membership dues to be used to bolster health benefits and other areas that SAG AFTRA is trying to shore up The offer would remove the million cap on membership dues and ultimately would have brought million over three years While Crabtree Ireland found the proposal worthy of review and consideration as someone wanting to help is not someone wanting to undermine Drescher ultimately rejected the offer saying that it is not feasible She instead called upon the AMPTP to resume negotiations with SAG AFTRA br On October actress and former SAG president Melissa Gilbert dismissed a message from SAG AFTRA stating that actors should not wear Halloween costumes of characters from struck companies and said THIS is what you guys come up with Literally no one cares what anyone wears for Halloween do you really think this kind of infantile stuff is going to end the strike please tell me you re going to make this rule go away and go negotiate people are suffering mightily this is the kind of silly bullshit that keeps us on strike br On October a joint statement announced that negotiations would resume on October After a full day of negotiations on the th the initial plan of meeting on October was moved to October Negotiations thus resumed on October with Crabtree Ireland stating that they are focused on making a fair deal at the table I am cautiously optimistic that can happen I don t really want to characterize what s going on in the room but we re really focused on just staying prepared and focused on getting the negotiations done An individual also speculated to The Wrap that studios believe that if they can t reach a deal in the next week with the Screen Actors Guild which has been on strike since July then no new production will be able to start before After the meeting they announced that negotiations will continue on October Also on October a public letter signed by thousands of high profile actors was sent to the SAG AFTRA negotiating committee encouraging them to keep fighting for their values rather than cave in to the studios demands saying As hard as this is we would rather stay on strike than take a bad deal br On October negotiations continued but no deal was made and it was announced that talks will continue over the weekend The four studio CEOs did not attend the meeting and Lombardini attended in their stead The meeting on October was conducted virtually between SAG AFTRA leaders Drescher Crabtree Ireland and the SAG AFTRA negotiating committee with the guild awaiting a response from the studios and plans to meet again on October br Then after intermittent communications on October a guild source told Deadline Hollywood that there is a feeling of optimism looks like we re in the final stretch Deadline also states that both sides expressed confidence a
