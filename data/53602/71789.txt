Mara Jade Skywalker is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise She appears in the now non canon Legends series as the wife of Luke Skywalker and mother of Ben Skywalker She has been voiced by Heidi Shannon Edie Mirman and Kath Soucie in various Star Wars video games br br br Concept and development br Her first appearance was in Timothy Zahn s Heir to the Empire Zahn imagined Jade as a strong complex female character somebody he thought lacking in the Star Wars universe While competent she is flawed When the Thrawn trilogy ended in with The Last Command Zahn thought it was the last book for which he would develop the character Asked to write another novel he established two goals to end the war between the New Republic and the Empire and to get Luke Skywalker and Mara together Although Lucasfilm resisted the idea of Luke marrying Mara they eventually acquiesced br In Zahn said Lucasfilm gave him some creative control over the character of Mara Jade any appearance of Mara in new works requires Zahn s approval Zahn also explained that Lucasfilm Story Group held the authority to prevent him from incorporating Mara back into the canon so any appearance of the character must be approved by both parties Zahn said he would only allow her to appear if she plays an important role in the plot and he would block any kind of cameo Previously the character of Grand Admiral Thrawn another Zahn creation made the jump from Legends to canon albeit with a slightly reworked story Subsequently Zahn said he hoped to find a way to bring Mara into the canon stating If there was a generic or organic spot for her to fit into a story I promise people I will pitch it to the Lucasfilm story group and then it s their decision whether to allow it or not br Compared to Princess Leia Zahn said Mara has a sharper and sarcastic manner and of course she had to go through the painful realization her service was to an evil cause But both women are strong without sacrificing their femininity a balance which I think some authors have trouble writing Bear in mind too Leia was one of the first people in the New Republic who decided Mara could be trusted which perhaps says something about their understanding of each other br br br Appearances br Mara is introduced as smuggler Talon Karrde s second in command in Heir to the Empire The novel establishes she was previously an Emperor s Hand a special agent for Emperor Palpatine br Several stories depict Jade before the events in Heir to the Empire showing her training under Palpatine and executing his orders The Thrawn trilogy depicts Mara s first confrontation with Luke Skywalker whom she swears to kill to avenge Palpatine s death Palpatine sent her a faked image of Luke and Vader turning on him together rather than Vader killing Palpatine and the demand for Luke s death motivated by Palpatine s desire for revenge against his father rather than Luke s actions br This was re inforced by the Emperor s final telepathic command to assassinate Luke plaguing her thoughts since his death upon learning this situation Luke vowed to help Mara break Palpatine s hold on her regardless of the threat she posed to Luke Toward the end of the trilogy she turns against the Empire and resolves her anger toward Luke silences the command without killing him and instead killing Luke s clone Luuke Skywalker made by the Dark Jedi Joruus C baoth to challenge Luke br In doing so she took Luke s lightsaber that was recovered after his initial duel with Darth Vader and used it to stab C baoth At the close of The Last Command Luke gives her Anakin s lightsaber because he believed she earned it and because he truly wanted her to have it Over the course of the series Luke recognizes in Mara an underdeveloped affinity for the Force and although she initially resists Jedi training she eventually becomes a Jedi Master br Luke and Mara develop a strong bond in Zahn s The Hand of Thrawn duology he proposes marriage and the two wed in Michael A Stackpole s graphic novel Union She delivers a son Ben during The New Jedi Order series br In the Legacy of the Force series Mara is suspicious of her nephew Jacen Solo after he sends Ben on several ethically dubious missions Upon learning Jacen is a Sith apprentice Mara vows to kill him but Jacen ultimately kills her in Sacrifice She later appears as a Force ghost first to Ben then to Luke in Revelation She also appears as a Force ghost to Cade Skywalker in the Legacy comics set more than a century after the Star Wars films br br br Other appearances br Mara also appears in the short story Sleight of Hand The Tale of Mara Jade by Timothy Zahn in the anthology Tales from Jabba s Palace In this story she infiltrates Jabba the Hutt s palace as a dancing girl to assassinate Luke Skywalker under orders of the Emperor but misses her chance after Jabba drops him into the Rancor s lair then escapes br Mara was portrayed by model Shannon McRandle as Shannon Baksa

Galactic Battlegrounds br She was portrayed by Denise Donovan in the Team Starkid musical parody Ani br br br Canonicity br In when franchise creator George Lucas said there would be no sequel trilogy he explained that plot elements from the Expanded Universe were not part of his story saying Luke doesn t get married With the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating film Star Wars were re branded as Star Wars Legends and declared non canon to the franchise in April br br br Reception br Mara Jade was
