expanding his special effects company Industrial Light Magic instead Filmed from March to September in Finse Norway and at Elstree Studios in England The Empire Strikes Back faced production difficulties including actor injuries illnesses fires and problems securing additional financing as costs rose Initially budgeted at million costs had risen to million by the project s conclusion br Released on May the highly anticipated sequel became the highest grossing film that year earning approximately million worldwide Unlike its lighthearted predecessor Empire met with mixed reviews from critics and fans were conflicted about its darker and more mature themes Critics praised the expressive features and characterization of the puppeteered character Yoda a diminutive creature who serves

and adjusted for inflation it is the th highest grossing film in the United States and Canada br Since its release The Empire Strikes Back has been critically reassessed and is now often regarded as the best film in the Star Wars series and among the greatest films ever made It has had a significant impact on filmmaking and popular culture and is often considered an example of a sequel superior

br br Following the unexpected financial success and cultural impact of Star Wars a sequel was swiftly put into production In case Star Wars had failed creator George Lucas had contracted Alan Dean Foster to write a low budget sequel later released as the novel Splinter of the Mind s Eye Once the success of Star Wars was evident Lucas was reluctant to direct the sequel because of the stress of making the first film and its impact on his health The popularity of Star Wars brought Lucas wealth fame and positive attention from the public but it also brought negative attention in the form of threats and many requests for financial backing br Conscious that the sequel needed to exceed the original s scope making it a bigger production and that his production effects company Lucasfilm was relatively small and operating out of a makeshift office Lucas considered selling the project to th Century Fox in exchange for a profit percentage He had profited substantially from Star Wars and did not need to work but was too invested in his creation to entrust it to others Lucas had concepts for the sequel but no solid structure He knew the story would be darker would explore more mature themes and relationships and would continue to explore the nature of the Force Lucas intended to fund the production independently using his million profit from Star Wars to relocate and expand his special effects company Industrial Light Magic ILM and establish his Skywalker movie ranch in Marin County California with the remainder as collateral for a loan from Bank of America for the film s million budget br Fox had the right of first negotiation and refusal to participate in any potential sequel Negotiations began in mid between the studio and Lucas s representatives Fox had already given Lucas controlling interest in the series merchandising and sequels because it had thought Star Wars would be worthless Terms were agreed quickly for the sequel compared to the original in part because Fox executive Alan Ladd Jr had been supportive of the original and was eager for the sequel The page contract was signed on September dictating that Fox would distribute the film but have no creative input in exchange for of the gross profits on the first million earned with the percentage increasing to in the producers favor if it exceeded million Filming had to begin by January for release on May The deal offered the possibility of significant financial gain for Lucas but he risked financial ruin if the sequel failed br To mitigate some of the risk Lucas founded The Chapter II Company to control the film s development and absorb its liabilities He signed a contract between the company and Lucasfilm granting himself of the box office gross profits He also founded Black Falcon to license Star Wars merchandising rights using the income to subsidize his ongoing projects Development for the sequel began in August under the title Star Wars Chapter II br Lucas considered replacing producer Gary Kurtz with Howard Kazanjian because Kurtz had not fulfilled his role and left problems unresolved while filming Star Wars Kurtz convinced him otherwise by trading on his longtime loyalty to Lucas and knowledge of the Star Wars property Lucas took an executive producer role enabling him to focus on his businesses and the development of Raiders of the Lost Ark By late Kurtz began hiring key crew members including production designer Norman Reynolds consultant John Barry makeup artist Stuart Freeborn and first assistant director David Tomblin Lucas rehired artists Ralph McQuarrie and Joe Johnston to maintain visual consistency with Star Wars and the three began conceptualizing the Hoth battle in December By this point the budget had increased to million Lucas wanted a director who would support the material and accept that he was ultimately in charge He considered around directors including Alan Parker and John Badham before hiring his old acquaintance Irvin Kershner in February Kershner was reluctant to direct the sequel to a film as successful as Star Wars and his friends warned him against taking the job believing he would be blamed if it failed Lucas convinced Kershner it was not so much a sequel as a chapter in a larger story he also promised him he could make the film his own way br br br Writing br br Lucas began formulating ideas in August These included the Emperor Luke s lost sister and an explanation of facial injuries Hamill had suffered from an accident after filming Star Wars Lucas told Hamill that had he died his character would have been replaced not recast Hamill recounted being told the sister character might be Leia which he found disappointing Lucas had written Star Wars but did not enjoy developing lore for an original universe Science fiction writer Leigh Brackett whom Lucas met through a friend excelled in quick paced dialogue He hired her for aware that she had cancer br Between November and December Lucas and Brackett held a story conference Lucas had core ideas in mind but wanted Brackett to piece them together He envisioned one central plot complemented by three main subplots set across scenes script pages and a two hour runtime They formed a general outline and ideas that included the Wookiee homeworld new alien species the Galactic Emperor a gambler from Han s past water and city planets Luke s lost twin sister and a diminutive froglike creature Minch Yoda Lucas drew on influences including The Thing from Another World the novel Dune and the television series Flash Gordon Around this time Kurtz conceived the title The Empire Strikes Back He said they avoided calling it Star Wars II because films with II in their titles were seen as inferior br Brackett completed her first draft in February titled Star Wars sequel from the adventures of Luke Skywalker The draft contained a city in the clouds a chase through an asteroid belt a greater focus on the love triangle between Luke Han and Leia who is portrayed as a damsel in distress the battle of Hoth and a climactic duel between Luke and Darth Vader The ghosts of his father and Obi Wan visit Luke leaving Vader a separate character The draft reveals Luke has a sister not Leia Han goes on a mission to recruit his powerful stepfather and Lando is a clone from the Clone Wars Lucas made detailed notes and attempted to contact Brackett but she had been hospitalized and died of cancer a few weeks later on March br br br Rewrite br The strict schedule left Lucas no choice but to write the second draft himself Though Brackett s draft followed Lucas s outline he found she had portrayed the characters differently than he intended Lucas completed his handwritten page draft on April He found the process more enjoyable than on Star Wars because he was familiar with the universe but struggled to write a satisfying conclusion leaving it open for a third film This draft established Luke s sister as a new character undertaking a similar journey Vader s castle and his fear of the emperor distinct power levels in controlling the Force Yoda s unconventional speech pattern and bounty hunters including Boba Fett Lucas wrote Fett like the Man with No Name combining him with an abandoned idea for a Super Stormtrooper Lucas s handwritten draft included mention of Vader being Luke s father but the typed script omitted this revelation Despite contradictory information in drafts that included the ghost of Luke s father Lucas said he had always intended for Vader to be Luke s father and omitted it from scripts to avoid leaks Lucas included elements such as Han s debt to Jabba and recontextualized Luke leaving Dagobah to rescue his friends in Brackett s draft Obi Wan instructs Luke to leave Lucas had Luke choose to do so He also removed a scene of Luke massacring stormtroopers to convey him falling to the dark side wanting to instead explore this in the next film Lucas believed it was important the characters be inspirational and appropriate for children His typed draft is titled Star Wars Episode V The Empire Strikes Back br In June impressed with his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark Lucas hired Lawrence Kasdan to refine the draft Kasdan was paid In early July Kasdan Kershner and Lucas held a story conference to discuss Lucas s draft The group collaborated on ideas challenging Lucas when his made no sense Lucas embraced their ideas Mandated to deliver a fifth of the script every other week Kasdan began his rewrite focusing on developing character relationships and psychologies he completed the third draft by early August This version refined Minch Yoda alternately named the Critter Minch Buffy and simply Yoda from a slimy creature to a small blue one each version retained the character s long life and wisdom Yoda was intended to teach Luke to respect everyone and not judge by appearances and defy audience expectations The draft tightened or expanded dialogue to better pace action scenes added more romance and added or changed locations such as moving a Vader scene from a spaceship deck to his private cubicle Lucas removed a line mentioning Lando deliberately abandoning his people and had Luke contact Leia through the Force instead of Obi Wan s ghost The fourth draft mostly the same but with more detailed action was submitted on October br Although some of Brackett s ideas remained such as Luke s Dagobah training her dialogue and characterization were removed Kasdan described her take as from a different era lacking the necessary tone Kazanjian did not believe the Writers Guild of America West would approve of her receiving credit but Lucas liked Brackett and supported her credit as co writer He also provided for her family beyond her contracted pay The fifth draft was completed in February It revised some scenes and introduced a Hogmen species devised by Kershner Lucas did not like the idea because he perceived them as slaves br br br Casting br br Mark Hamill Luke Carrie Fisher Leia Harrison Ford Han Peter Mayhew Chewbacca and Kenny Baker R D all reprised their Star Wars roles Hamill and Fisher were contracted for a second third and fourth film but Ford had declined similar terms because of earlier bad experiences he agreed to return because he wanted to improve on his Star Wars performance Hamill spent four months bodybuilding and learning karate fencing and kendo to prepare for his stunts br David Prowse hesitated to return as Darth Vader because as he was hidden behind a costume he believed the role offered little job security he returned after being told further delays would lead to his being replaced James Earl Jones returned to voice Vader but as with Star Wars declined a credit because he considered himself special effects to Prowse s physical performance He earned for half a day s work plus a small percentage of the profits Anthony Daniels was reluctant to return as C PO because he had received little acknowledgment for his previous performance as the filmmakers played down his involvement to portray the droid as a real being He ultimately agreed however for an improved salary Alec Guinness said he could not return as Obi Wan because his failing eyesight required him to avoid bright lights Recasting him was considered but determined to recruit him Lucas agreed to a deal in late August which gave him a more limited role Guinness was paid of Empire s box office gross for his few hours of work br Billy Dee Williams was cast as Lando Calrissian making him the first black actor with a starring role in the series He found the character interesting because of his cape and Armenian surname Williams believed this gave him room to develop the character Williams said Lando was much like himself a pretty cool guy He believed it was a token role but was assured it was not specifically written for a black actor Kershner said Williams had the fantastic charm of a Mississippi riverboat hustler Howard Rollins Terry Alexander Robert Christian Thurman Scott and Yaphet Kotto were also considered for the part Yoda was voiced and puppeteered by Frank Oz with assistance from Kathryn Mullen David Barclay and Wendy Froud Lucas had intended for a different actor to provide Yoda s voice but decided it would be too difficult to cast someone who could match their voice to Oz s puppetry br Jeremy Bulloch did not audition for Boba Fett he was hired because the costume fit him It was uncomfortable and top heavy making it difficult to maintain his balance and the mask often steamed up Bulloch assumed his lines would be dubbed over as he had little dialogue Fett s voice actor Jason Wingreen remained uncredited until Bulloch also appears as an Imperial officer who restrains Leia on Bespin No other cast member was available for this role so Kurtz had him quickly change out of the Fett costume to stand in John Morton portrays Fett in the same scene There was no extensive casting for the Emperor Lucas chose Clive Revill to provide the character s voice and actress Marjorie Eaton physically portrayed the Emperor in test footage The footage proved unsatisfactory and special effects artist Rick Baker created a full mask that his wife Elaine wore Chimpanzee eyes were superimposed over her face cat eyes and assistant accountant Laura Crockett s eyes were also considered br br br Pre production br Pre production began in early Although Kershner wanted two years this phase only lasted a year Seeking an area to represent the ice planet Hoth location scouts considered Finland Sweden and the Arctic Circle The location needed to be free of trees and near populated areas for amenities Kershner credited a Fox distribution employee with recommending Finse Norway Kurtz said it was Reynolds who had done so For the bog planet Dagobah scouts looked at Central Africa Kenya and Scandinavia but Lucas wanted to avoid shooting on location He funded the construction of a Star Wars stage at Elstree Studios London for the Dagobah and rebel base sets Construction for the stage which measured cubic feet m and cost million began at the end of August Sets were the single biggest expense of the production costing a total of million By December the budget had increased to million more than double the original estimate Financial projections for The Chapter II Company suggested it would run a monthly deficit of million by the end of including over million in production costs and to fund ILM br As the start of filming in January loomed a fire on Elstree s Stage where The Shining was being filmed destroyed the space planned for Empire s sets The impact was significant resulting in the Empire production being forced to give up two stages so The Shining could continue filming Sixty four sets had to be moved through nine stages and the filming schedule had to be altered Poor weather delayed construction of necessary sets props and the Star Wars stage By February the Finse location crew had arrived in Norway to receive flown in equipment containers and begin digging trenches for battle scenes br br br Music br br The musical score for The Empire Strikes Back was composed and conducted by John Williams and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra at a cost of about Williams began planning the score in November estimating the film would require minutes of music For two weeks across three hour sessions just after Christmas Williams recorded the score at Anvil Studios and Abbey Road Studios London Up to musicians were involved at a time playing such instruments as oboes piccolos pianos and harps br br br Filming br br br Commencement in Norway br br Principal photography began on March on the Hardangerj kulen glacier near Finse Norway representing the planet Hoth Initially scheduled to conclude on June by the end of the first week it was obvious it would take longer and cost more br Filming the Hoth scenes on a set was considered but ultimately rejected as inauthentic The location filming coincided with the area s worst snowstorm in half a century impeding the production with blizzards mile per hour km h winds and temperatures between F C and F C The weather cleared only twice some days filming could not take place The frigid conditions made the acetate film brittle camera lenses iced over snow seeped into equipment and effects paint froze inside the tin To counter these effects lenses were kept cool but the camera body was warmed to protect the film battery and camera operators hands The crew was outside for up to hours at a time being subjected to thin air limited visibility and mild frostbite one crewman slipped and broke two ribs The difficult conditions led to strong camaraderie among crewmembers br Avalanches blocked direct transport links and trenches dug by the crew quickly filled with snow Scenes could be prepared only a few hours in advance and many scenes were filmed just outside the crew s hotel as the shifting weather regularly altered the scenery Although Fisher was not scheduled to film scenes in Norway she joined Hamill on location because she wanted to observe the process Ford was not scheduled for the Finse phase but to compensate for the delays he was brought there instead of creating a separate set in a Leeds studio On a few hours notice he arrived in Finse having traveled the last miles km of the snow laden journey by snowplow Production returned to England after a week though Hamill had an additional day of filming The second unit remained in Norway through March to film explosions incidental footage and battle scenes featuring mountain rescue skiers as extras The skiers work was compensated with a donation to the Norwegian Red Cross br To film the Imperial probe landing eight sticks of dynamite were placed on the glacier and set to explode at sunrise but the demolitions expert in charge knocked the battery out of his radio and received the message too late to capture the intended shot The opening sweeping shot of the area was captured by flying a helicopter to feet m and performing a controlled drop at a rate of miles per hour km h or feet m a minute A heated shelter for the helicopter had to be constructed which delayed filming of the shot by four weeks The second unit scheduled to be in Finse for three weeks was there for eight When the crew returned to London they had only half the planned footage and background images for special effects shots were uneven Empire s budget increased to around million because of the delays and having to rework scenes to compensate for the missing footage br br br Filming at Elstree Studios br br Filming at Elstree began on March Production remained behind schedule without Stage which had been destroyed by fire and the incomplete Star Wars stage lacked protection from the cold weather The result was that the crew had to work out of any available space To save time some scenes were shot simultaneously such as those set in the ice cavern and medical bay Kershner wanted each character to make a unique entrance in the film While filming Vader s entrance the snow troopers preceding Prowse tripped over the polystyrene ice and the stuntman behind him stood on his cape breaking it off causing Prowse to fall onto the snow troopers br The shoot was strenuous and mired in conflicts Fisher suffered from influenza and bronchitis her weight dropped to pounds kg while working hour days and she collapsed on set from an allergic reaction to steam or spray paint She was also allergic to most makeup Her overuse of hallucinogens and painkillers worsened her condition as did the anxiety she experienced while performing her speech to the rebels Stress and personal traumas led to frequent arguments among Hamill Fisher and Ford Ford and Hamill fell ill or were injured at different times Hamill was depressed by his isolation from human cast members as his scenes required him to interact mostly with puppets robots and actors whose voices would be added later or dubbed over He was meant to use an earpiece to hear Oz s Yoda dialogue but for various reasons this did not work and he struggled to form a relationship with the character The Dagobah set was liberally sprayed with mineral oil which caused him physical discomfort for long periods Hamill called it a physical ordeal the whole time but I don t really mind that At one point Oz cheered Hamill up with a Miss Piggy routine Hamill recalled Ford giving him a kiss instead of reading his lines which entertained the crew Mayhew fell ill while filming Han s torture scene because the set used bursts of steam which raised the ambient temperature to F C while he was wearing a wool suit br Bank of America representatives visited the set in late March concerned about rising costs Lucas rarely visited the set but arrived on May after realizing the production was behind schedule and over budget An official Lucasfilm memo instructed staff to misstate the film s direct costs as million At this point Kurtz and Lucas estimated it would cost million to complete filming Finances ran out in mid July when Bank of America refused to increase the loan The crisis was kept from the crew including Kershner and tactics were used to delay its impact including paying staff biweekly instead of weekly and Lucas borrowing money from his merchandising company Black Falcon Lucas worried he would have to sell Empire and its associated rights to Fox to sustain the project losing his creative freedom Fox was also threatening to buy out the bond and take over filming With about of Empire left to film Lucasfilm president Charles Weber arranged for Bank of Boston to refinance the loan to million including million from Bank of Boston and million guaranteed by Fox in exchange for an increased percentage of the theatrical returns and of merchandising profits Lucasfilm took out the loan making the company directly liable br The Star Wars stage was completed in early May It was too small to house the Rebel hangar and Dagobah sets and an extension had to be funded and built The producers mandated filming begin on the stage on May regardless of its state The hangar scene involved rebel extras which cost per day Around short tons long tons of dendritic salt mixed with magnesium sulfate for a sparkle effect were used for the snowy sets this combination of substances gave the cast and crew headaches Second unit director John Barry died suddenly in early June Harley Cokeliss replaced him a week later The typical purpose of the second unit was to do time consuming filming for special effects shots but they were now filming main scenes including Luke s ice cave imprisonment because the schedule had overrun by around days Hamill was unavailable for several days after injuring his hand during a stunt jump from a speeder bike Having been called in for the stunt the same day his son was born aggravated by the salt laden setting and exhausted he angrily chastised Kurtz for not using a double for the scene Kershner s hands on directing style which included him acting out how he wanted a scene performed agitated Hamill Kershner for his part was frustrated that Hamill was not following his advice br The life size hangar set was dismantled in mid June to allow the construction of other sets around the full scale Millenium Falcon These scenes had to be filmed efficiently so the Falcon could be dismantled to make way for the Dagobah set Filming began on the carbon chamber scene in late June while the second unit filmed anything they could The raised set was largely incomplete and low lighting and steam were used to conceal any obvious flaws The fog machines and heat from the steam made many cast and crew members sick it took approximately three weeks to film The confession of love between Leia and Han was scripted with both of them admitting their feelings for the other Kershner felt this was too sappy He had Ford improvise lines repeatedly until Ford said he would do only one more take his response to Leia s confession of love in the final take was I know By the end of the month cast and crew morale was low br br br The duel Dagobah and conclusion br br Hamill returned in early July to film his climactic battle against Darth Vader portrayed by stunt double Bob Anderson who said the experience was like fighting blindfolded because of the costume Hamill spent weeks practicing his fencing routine eventually growing frustrated and refusing to continue The next scene where Vader confesses he is Luke s father was shrouded in secrecy Prowse was given the line Obi Wan Kenobi is your father to read because he was known for repeatedly leaking information Only Kershner the producers and Hamill knew the actual line While filming the scene Hamill was positioned on a platform suspended feet m above a pile of mattresses Footage of his fall into the reactor shaft was damaged during processing and the scene had to be reshot in early August The Vader confrontation took eight weeks to film Hamill insisted on doing as many of his stunts as possible though the insurers refused to allow him to perform a foot m fall out of a window He accidentally fell from a nine inch ledge feet m high but rolled on landing to avoid injury Lucas returned to the set on July and stayed for the rest of filming He rewrote Luke s scenes on Dagobah removing or trimming them so they could be shot in just over two weeks br Most of the cast completed filming by the start of August including Ford Fisher Williams Mayhew and Daniels Hamill began filming on the Dagobah set with Yoda They only had days to film because Oz was scheduled for another project With the film now over days behind schedule Kurtz was removed from his role and replaced by Kazanjian and associate producer Robert Watts One of the last scenes shot was of Luke exploring the dark side tree on Dagobah A wrap party was held on the set to mark the official conclusion of filming on September after days Guinness filmed his scenes against a bluescreen the same day Kershner and the second unit continued filming additional footage including Luke s X Wing being raised from the swamp Kershner left the set on September and Hamill finished days of filming two days later The second unit finished filming on September with Hamill s stunt double There was approximately feet m of film or hours of footage br The final budget was million Kurtz blamed inflation which had increased resource cast and crew costs significantly Lucas blamed Kurtz for lack of oversight and poor financial planning Watts said Kurtz was not good with people and never developed a working relationship with Kershner making it difficult for him to temper the director s indulgences Kurtz had also given Kershner more leeway because of the delays caused by the Stage fire Kershner s slower work pace had frustrated Lucas He described his filming style as frugal performing two or three takes with little coverage film that could later compensate for mistakes Watts and Reynolds said Kershner often looked at new ways of doing things but this required planning that only delayed things further Kershner had tried replicating the quick pacing of Star Wars not lingering on any scene for too long and encouraged improvisation modifying scenes and dialogue to focus more on characters emotions such as C PO interrupting Han and Leia as they are about to kiss Kazanjian said many mistakes were made but blamed Weber Lucasfilm vice president John Moohr and primarily Kurtz Actor John Morton called Kurtz an unsung hero who brought his experience of filming war to Empire br br br Post production br The schedule overrun resulted in filming and post production taking place simultaneously filmed footage was shipped immediately to ILM to begin effects work A rough cut resembling the finished film minus special effects was put together by mid October Lucas provided pages of notes about changes he wanted mainly alterations in dialogue and scene lengths Jones recorded Vader s dialogue in late and early In early Lucas changed the long planned opening of Luke riding his tauntaun to a shot of the Star Destroyer launching probes He continued tweaking elements to improve the special effects but even with ILM staff working up to hours a day six days a week there was not enough time to do everything they wanted A Dagobah pick up scene in which R D is spat out by a monster was filmed in Lucas s swimming pool the Emperor s scenes were filmed in February br Fox executives did not see a cut of the film until March That month Lucas decided he wanted an additional Hoth scene and auditioned ILM crew to appear as Rebels The final minute cut was completed on April which triggered a million payment from Fox to Bank of Boston Lucasfilm also launched an employee bonus scheme to share Empire s profits with its staff Test screenings were held in San Francisco on April While the tauntaun special effect was criticized audiences liked Han s reply of I know to Leia s confession of love Lucas was unimpressed by the scene believing it was not how Han would act Because the magnetic soundtrack could flake from the film reels Kurtz hired people to watch the film reels hours a day to identify defects were defective br Shortly after the film s theatrical release Lucas decided the ending was unclear about where Luke and Leia were in relation to Lando and Chewbacca In the three week window between its limited and wider release Lucas Johnston and visual effects artist Ken Ralston filmed enhancement scenes at ILM using existing footage a new score modified dialogue and new miniatures to create establishing shots of the Rebel fleet and their relative positions By the project s conclusion around people had worked on Empire br br br Special effects and design br br Lucas s firm Industrial Light Magic developed the special effects for The Empire Strikes Back at a cost of million including staffing and the construction of the company s new facility in Marin County California The building was still under construction when staff arrived in September and initially lacked the equipment that would be necessary to complete their work Compared to the special effects shots for Star Wars Empire required around br The crew supervised by Richard Edlund and Brian Johnson included Dennis Muren Bruce Nicholson Lorne Peterson Steve Gawley Phil Tippett Tom St Amand and Nilo Rodis Jamero Up to people worked on the project daily including Stuart Freeborn who was responsible mainly for crafting the Yoda puppet Various techniques including miniatures matte paintings stop motion articulated models and full size vehicles were used to create Empire s many effects br br br Release br br br Context br br Industry professionals expected comedies and positive entertainment to dominate theaters in because of low morale in the United States caused by an economic recession This generally increased theatrical visits as audiences sought escapism and ignored romantic films and depictions of blue collar life A surge of interest in science fiction following Star Wars led to many low budget entries in the genre attempting to profit by association and big budget entries such as Star Trek The Motion Picture and The Black Hole both released just months before The Empire Strikes Back Sequels were not expected to perform as well as their originals and there were low expectations for merchandising Even so tie in deals were arranged with Coca Cola Nestl General Mills and Topps collectibles br Fox was confident in the film and spent little money on advertising taking out small advertisements in newspapers instead of full page spreads The studio s market research showed of those interested in the film were male Lucasfilm set up a telephone number allowing callers to hear a message from cast members Fox demanded a minimum week appearance in theaters although weeks was the norm for major films Estimates suggested Empire needed to earn million to be profitable after marketing distribution and loan interest costs br br br Credits and title br As with Star Wars Lucas wanted to place all of the crew credits at the end of the film to avoid interfering with the opening The Writers Guild of America WGA and Directors Guild of America DGA had allowed this for the first film because Lucas directed and it opened with the logo for his namesake Lucasfilm but for Empire they refused to allow Kershner or the first and second unit directors to be credited only at the end fined Lucas when he ignored them and tried to have the film removed from theaters Because Lucas had followed the laws relevant to the United Kingdom where it was produced the DGA was unable to sanction him and instead fined Kershner Lucas paid his fine but was so frustrated that he left the WGA DGA and Motion Picture Association which restricted his ability to write and direct future films br The Hollywood Reporter leaked the film s title in January it was officially announced in August The opening crawl identified the film as Star Wars Episode V The Empire Strikes Back establishing Lucas s plan to make a nine part Star Wars series Star Wars was also renamed Episode IV A New Hope Roger Kastel designed the theatrical poster br br br Box office br br A sneak preview of The Empire Strikes Back took place on May at the Dominion Theatre in London followed by another preview screening on May at the Kennedy Center in Washington D C This event which featured the principal cast was attended by children including Special Olympians The film s world premiere took place on May at the Odeon Leicester Square in London Dubbed Empire Day the event included actors in Stormtrooper attire interacting with people across the city br In North America Empire opened mid week on May leading into the extended Memorial Day holiday weekend The number of theaters was deliberately limited to to make it difficult to get a ticket thus generating more appeal a strategy used with films expected to receive positive word of mouth The film earned million during its opening day an average of per theater It garnered a further million during the weekend and million during the Monday holiday for a total of million an average of per theater This made Empire the number one film of the weekend ahead of the counterprogrammed debuts of the comedy The Gong Show Movie million and The Shining By the end of its first week the film had earned million a

Critical response br The Empire Strikes Back received mixed reviews upon its initial release a change from the positive reception of Star Wars In March The Los Angeles Times released a summary of the leading critics choices for top films of the year Robert Redford s Ordinary People appeared on lists while Empire made it onto Fan reactions were decidedly mixed with many concerned by the film s change in tone and surprising narrative revelations particularly Leia s love for Han over Luke and Luke s relationship with Vader br Some critics believed The Empire Strikes Back was a good film but not as enjoyable as Star Wars They believed the tonal shift featuring darker material and more mature story lines detracted from the charm fun and comic silliness of the original The Wall Street Journal s Joy Gould Boyum believed it was absurd to add dramatic weight to the lighthearted Star Wars stripping it of its innocence Writing for The Washington Post Gary Arnold found the darker undercurrents and greater narrative scale interesting because it created more dramatic threads to explore The New Yorker s David Denby argued it was more spectacular than the original but lacked its camp style The Hollywood Reporter s Arthur Knight believed the novelty of the original and the plethora of space opera films produced since made Empire seem derivative even so he called it the best in the genre since Star Wars Writing for Time Gerald Clarke said Empire surpassed Star Wars in several ways including being more visually and artistically interesting The New York Times s Vincent Canby called it a more mechanical less suspenseful experience br Writing for the Los Angeles Times Charles Champlin said the inconclusive ending cleverly completed the narrative while serving as a cliffhanger but Clarke called it a not very satisfying conclusion Canby and the Chicago Reader s Dave Kehr believed that as the middle film it should have focused on narrative development instead of exposition finding little narrative progression between the film s beginning and end The Washington Post s Judith Martin labeled it a good junk film enjoyable but fleeting because it lacked a stand alone narrative Knight and Clarke found the story sometimes difficult to follow Knight because the third act jumped between separate storylines and Clarke because he missed important information in the fast paced plot Kehr and Sight Sound s Richard Combs wrote that characterization seemed to be less important than special effects visual spectacle and action set pieces that accomplished little narratively br Reviews were mixed for the principal cast Knight wrote that Kershner s direction made the characters more human and less archetypal Hamill Fisher and Ford received some praise with Champlin calling Hamill youthfully innocent and engaging and Fisher independent Arnold described the character progression as less about development and more about finesse with little change taking place while Kehr felt the characters were stiffer without Lucas s direction Knight called Guinness s performance half hearted and Janet Maslin criticized Lando Calrissian the only major black character in the film as exaggeratedly unctuous untrustworthy and loaded with jive The Chicago Tribune s Gene Siskel said the non human characters including the robots and Chewbacca remained the most lovable creatures with Yoda being the film s highlight Knight Gould Boyum and Arnold thought Yoda to be incredibly lifelike Arnold considered his expressions so realistic that he believed an actor s face had been composited onto the puppet Canby called the human cast bland and nondescript and said even the robot characters offered diminishing enjoyment but Yoda was a success when used sparingly br Although Arnold praised Kershner s direction others believed that Lucas s oversight was obvious and Empire lacked Kershner s established directorial sensibilities Denby described his work as impersonal and Canby believed it was impossible to identify what Kershner had contributed Combs believed Kershner was an ill advised director because he emphasized the characters and the result was common tropes at the expense of the comic strip pace of Star Wars Peter Suschitzky s cinematography was praised for its visuals and bold color choices and the special effects were lauded as breathtaking ingenious and visually dazzling Jim Harwood said he was let down only by the familiarity of the effects from the original which were emulated by other films Champlin appreciated that the effects were used to enhance scenes rather than being the focus br br br Accolades br br At the Academy Awards The Empire Strikes Back won the award for Best Sound Bill Varney Steve Maslow Gregg

machines were produced exclusively in Australia br br br Thematic analysis br br br Mythology and inspirations br Critical analysis has suggested various inspirations for Empire particularly the early s Flash Gordon serials that include a cloud city similar to Bespin Film critic Tim Robey wrote that much of Empire s imagery and narrative can be connected to the film Dersu Uzala directed by Akira Kurosawa whose work inspired Lucas Muren described the Empire s assault on Hoth with AT AT vehicles as an analogy for the Vietnam War specifically an invading military employing equipment inappropriate for the local terrain br Clarke identified Luke as the heir to mythological heroes such as Prometheus Jason and Galahad He is guided initially by a traditional aide Obi Wan who offers the promise of destiny until he is replaced by Yoda Anne Lancashire wrote that the Yoda narrative is a traditional mythological tale in which the hero is trained by a wise old master and must abandon all his preconceived notions Clarke described Luke s journey as the hero who ventures into the unknown to be tested by his own dark impulses but eventually overcomes them He believed this represented the human ability to control irrational impulsiveness to serve love order and justice br Lucas wanted Yoda to be a traditional fairy tale or mythological character akin to a frog or an unassuming old man to instill a message about respecting everyone and not judging on appearance alone because he believed that would lead the hero to succeed The New York Observer s Brandon Katz described Yoda as deepening the Force through philosophy Yoda says they are all luminous beings beyond just flesh and matter and presents the Jedi as Zen warriors who work in harmony with the Force Kasdan described them as enlightened warrior priests similar to Samurai br br br Religion br In developing the Force Lucas said he wanted it to represent the core essence of multiple religions unified by their common traits Primarily he designed it with the intent that there is good evil and a god Lucas s personal faith includes a belief in God and basic morality such as treating others fairly and not taking another s life The Presbyterian Journal described the film s religious message as closer to Eastern religions such as Zoroastrianism or Buddhism than Judeo Christian presenting good and evil as abstract concepts Similarly God or the Force is an impersonal entity taking no direct action Christianity Today said that the film s drama is caused by the absence of a righteous god or being creating a direct influence br Lancashire and J W Rinzler described Luke s journey as based purely on Christianity focused on destiny and free will with Luke serving as a Christ like figure and Vader as a fallen angel attempting to lure him toward evil Kershner said any religious symbolism was unintentional as he wanted to focus on the power of an individual s untapped potential instead of magic br br br Duality and evil br Anne Lancashire contrasted the first Star Wars film s message of idealism heroics and friendship with the more complex tone of Empire The latter challenges the former s notions primarily because Luke loses his innocence in coming to perceive people as neither entirely good nor evil The scene in which Luke enters the dark side cave on Dagobah represents where his anger will lead him and forces him to move beyond his belief that he is completely on the light side of the Force Kershner said the cave tests Luke against his greatest fear but because the fear is in his mind and he brought his weapon with him it creates a scenario where he is forced to use it After defeating the avatar of Vader the mask splits open to reveal Luke s face suggesting he will succumb to the temptations of the dark side unless he learns patience and to abandon his anger br The darkness is similarly presented in Han a self interested smuggler struggling with his growing feelings for Leia and the responsibility associated with her cause The film represents his two sides in Leia and Lando a representative of his smuggler life Empire questions the cost of friendship Where Star Wars presents traditional friendship Empire presents friendship as requiring sacrifice Han sacrifices himself in the frigid cold of Hoth to save Luke s life Similarly Luke abandons his Jedi training something he has longed for to rescue his friends This can be seen as a selfish choice as he does so against Yoda and Obi Wan s instructions potentially sacrificing himself for his friends instead of training to defeat the Empire a cause his friends support According to Lancashire characters are shown to be heroic through sacrificing for others instead of fighting battles br Lancashire believed that Luke s impatience to leave for Bespin exemplifies his lack of growth from his training There Vader tempts him with the power of the dark side and the revelation that he is Luke s father Vader wants Luke s help to destroy the Emperor not for good but so that Vader can impose his own order over the galaxy This admission robs Luke of the idealized image of his Jedi father reveals Obi Wan s deception in hiding his parentage and takes the last of his innocence Gerald Clarke suggests Luke is not strong or virtuous enough to resist Vader during this confrontation and so allows himself to fall into the airshaft below showing the antagonist does sometimes win The concept of a character having a good father and an evil father is a common story trope because of its simple representations of good and evil At the film s finale Luke has a greater understanding of the relationship between good and evil and the dual nature of people br br br Legacy br br br Critical reassessment br The Empire Strikes Back remains an enduringly popular piece of cinema It is considered groundbreaking for its cliffhanger ending influence on mainstream films and special effects Brian Lowry of CNN wrote that without the groundwork laid by one of the best sequels ever the Star Wars franchise wouldn t be the force that it is now br Despite the film s initial mixed reception it has since been reevaluated by critics and fans and is now often considered the best film in the Star Wars series and one of the greatest films ever made In members of the entertainment industry ranked Empire as the nd best film of all time in a poll conducted by The Hollywood Reporter Star Wars was Empire magazine named it the third best film of all time stating that the modern clich of sequels employing a darker tone can be traced back to Empire A retrospective review by Roger Ebert declared the film the best of the original trilogy praising the depth of its storytelling and its ability to create a sense of wonder in the audience A vote by Business Insider readers in listed it as the greatest film ever made it is also included in the film reference book Movies You Must See Before You Die The revelation that Vader is Luke s father continues to be seen as one of the greatest plot twists in cinema Similarly Han saying I know in response to Leia s love confession is considered one of the most iconic scenes in the Star Wars films and one of the more famous lines of improvised dialogue in cinema br Empire magazine selected the film as the sixth greatest movie sequel lauding the bold unresolved ending and willingness to avoid the same formula as the first film Den of Geek called it the second best sequel after Aliens and hailed it as Lucas s masterpiece Playboy named it the third best sequel describing the disclosure of the relationship between Luke and Vader as the emotional core that has elevated Star Wars to the pantheon of timeless modern sagas The BBC and Collider listed it as one of the best sequels ever made while Time and Playboy described it as a sequel that surpasses the original Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes recognizes it as the th best sequel based on review scores Rolling Stone s reader voted list of the best sequels listed Empire at third br Rotten Tomatoes offers the film a approval rating from the aggregated reviews of critics with an average score of The website s critical consensus reads Dark sinister but ultimately even more involving than A New Hope The Empire Strikes Back defies viewer expectations and takes the series to heightened emotional levels Empire has a score of out of on Metacritic based on the reviews of critics indicating universal acclaim Characters introduced in the film such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian are now considered iconic The American Film Institute ranked Darth Vader as the third best villain on its list of the Best Heroes Villains after Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter br br br Cultural impact br br The Empire Strikes Back was ubiquitous in American culture upon its release Freddie Mercury ended a Queen concert by riding on the shoulders of someone dressed as Darth Vader The film was referenced in political cartoons Kershner received letters from fans around the world asking for autographs and from psychologists who had used Yoda to explain philosophical ideas to their patients Other films television shows and video games have extensively referenced or parodied the film including the Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU Spaceballs The Muppet Show American Dad South Park The Simpsons Family Guy and Robot Chicken In the United States Library of Congress selected The Empire Strikes Back for preservation in the National Film Registry for being culturally historically or aesthetically significant br Landon Palmer Eric Diaz and Darren Mooney argue that Empire and not Star Wars created the concept of the modern blockbuster film franchise which includes sequels serving as chapters in an infinitely expanding narrative a template which was embraced by other film properties in the decades following Empire s release This new paradigm stood in opposition to the popular trend of exploiting a successful film by creating low budget sequels which resulted in diminishing returns as happened with the Jaws franchise Instead more money was spent on Empire to expand the fictional universe and reap greater box office returns The use of a cliffhanger ending to set up a future sequel is seen in many modern films particularly those in the MCU It has also been suggested that Empire forged a narrative structure that continues to be emulated in trilogies wherein the middle film is darker than the original and features an ending in which the protagonists fail to defeat the antagonists which sets up a subsequent film Emmet Asher Perrin and Ben Sherlock cite the series Back to the Future The Matrix The Lord of the Rings and Pirates of the Caribbean as examples br Filmmakers such as the Russo brothers Roland Emmerich and Kevin Feige cite Empire as an inspiration in their careers or identify as fans br br br Sequels prequels and adaptations br br The Empire Strikes Back was adapted into a radio play broadcast on National Public Radio in the United States Return of the Jedi was released in concluding the original film trilogy Jedi s plot follows the Rebel assault on the Empire and Luke s final confrontation with Vader and the Emperor Like the previous films Jedi was a financial success and fared well with critics br Nearly two decades after the release of Empire Lucas wrote and directed the prequel trilogy consisting of The Phantom Menace Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith The films chronicle the history between Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker and the latter s fall to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader The storylines and certain new characters in the prequel films polarized critics and fans After Lucas sold the Star Wars franchise to the Walt Disney Company in Disney developed a sequel trilogy consisting of The Force Awakens The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker Original trilogy cast members including Ford
