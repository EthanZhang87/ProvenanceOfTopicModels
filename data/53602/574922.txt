the best known symphonic movie themes it is used as a leitmotif throughout the Star Wars franchise br br br Use in Star Wars br The Imperial March is sometimes referred to simply as Darth Vader s Theme In the movies except for the original Star Wars the march is often played when Darth Vader appears It is also played during Darth Sidious s arrival on the Death Star in Return of the Jedi though it does segue into the Emperor s own theme as he appears br br br Original trilogy br The Imperial March is first heard in The Empire Strikes Back in low piccolos as the Galactic Empire sends probe droids across the galaxy in search of Luke Skywalker Its major opening occurs as Imperial class Star Destroyers amass and Darth Vader is first presented in the film minutes into the movie The theme and related motifs are also incorporated into tracks such as The Battle of Hoth during the eponymous battle The Asteroid Field during the chase sequence involving the Millennium Falcon and The Clash of Lightsabers during Luke and Vader s duel on Cloud City over Bespin Return of the Jedi makes similar use of the theme though its final statement is significantly different making quiet use of a harp as a redeemed Anakin Skywalker dies in his son s arms br br br Prequel trilogy br The Imperial March appears on a few occasions in the prequel trilogy most often used to foreshadow Anakin Skywalker s future as Darth Vader An innocent theme for the nine year old Anakin in The Phantom Menace at H is thematically based on The Imperial March The Imperial March is also heard towards the end as Yoda acknowledges Anakin as Obi Wan s apprentice in saying The Chosen One the boy may be Nevertheless grave danger I fear in his training at H It is also heard softly at the end of the final credit roll where it fades into the character s signature breathing showing that the rest of the prequel trilogy will reveal how Anakin became Darth Vader In the second prequel Attack of the Clones The Imperial March is sometimes played subtly when an event foreshadows Anakin s future It is first played when Yoda senses Anakin slaughtering a tribe of Tusken Raiders to avenge his mother s death and later with more force when Anakin tells Padm Amidala what he did It is played most prominently and recognizably during the final sequence when clone troopers assemble and depart Coruscant foreshadowing the end of the Republic Although Across the Stars is featured most prominently in the film s end credits several notes from The Imperial March are heard beneath it near the end br In Revenge of the Sith The Imperial March is first played when Anakin rebukes the Jedi Council for denying him the rank of Jedi Master although appointing him to the Council at H The track can also be heard when Anakin tells Mace Windu about Palpatine s true identity Darth Sidious It is later played when Anakin is dubbed as the Sith Darth Vader shortly after the death of Mace Windu The Imperial March is quoted when clone troopers find dead Wookiees on Kashyyyk and when Padm confronts Anakin on Mustafar A few notes of the March are played when Vader arrives on Mustafar to kill the Separatists The piece is played more clearly during the Battle of the Heroes scene between Obi Wan and Darth Vader at the movie s climax and in the simultaneous battle between Yoda and Sidious as a rearrangement of the version heard in The Clash of Lightsabers from The Empire Strikes Back It is also played when Darth Vader receives his armor at H and when he looks up at the first Death Star with Sidious at H br br br Sequel trilogy br In the Star Wars The Force Awakens two bars from the brass motif of The Imperial March are played after antagonist Kylo Ren regards the charred remains of Darth Vader s helmet vowing to finally succeed where the Galactic Empire failed In the Star Wars The Last Jedi the track was briefly played after Supreme Leader Snoke compares antagonist Kylo Ren to Darth Vader saying he saw the potential of A new Vader In the Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker the track is present in the scenes where the mask of Darth Vader is shown when Darth Sidious first reveals the Final Order a massive armada of Xyston class Star Destroyers built by the Sith Eternal to Kylo Ren when Rey seeks Sidious Sith wayfinder in the Death Star s wreckage and when a Sith Star Destroyer arrives to destroy Kijimi br br br Star Wars Anthology br Trailers for Rogue One A Star Wars Story featured the track prominently the first notes of The Imperial March can be heard at the end of the trailer as the letters turn to reveal the name of the upcoming movie Prior to this Darth Vader can be heard breathing and his appearance is seen as a reflection on the floor In the film proper scored by Michael Giacchino the theme can be heard when Vader emerges from his sanctum to confer with Director Orson Krennic and again after Vader warns Krennic about overstepping his bounds The theme can be heard once more when Vader attacks the Rebel soldiers trapped in a hallway it is slowed down enough not to be obvious and joined with a chorus reminiscent of that from Revenge of the Sith The theme is finally heard outright when Vader witnesses the Tantive IV fleeing into hyperspace br The track appears early in Solo A Star Wars Story transposed into a major key as diegetic music in the Corellia spaceport as part of a commercial encouraging viewers to join the Imperial Navy encouraging Han Solo to enlist as his ticket off the planet This brief appearance marks the first and thus far only in universe appearance of
