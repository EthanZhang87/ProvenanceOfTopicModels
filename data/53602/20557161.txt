Solo was chosen as the th greatest film hero by the American Film Institute and was selected as the fourth greatest film character by Empire magazine Entertainment Weekly ranked Solo as the seventh coolest hero in popular culture br br br Creation and development br In the earliest version of the Star Wars screenplay Solo was an alien of the Ureallian race with green skin enormous gills and no nose He was also a member of the Jedi Bendu and was acquainted with General Skywalker The next draft of the script depicted Solo as a bearded flamboyant pirate Lucas decided to make him human to better develop his relationships with the other human characters After this alteration Chewbacca became his alien sidekick By the third draft Solo had developed into the tough James Dean style starpilot that would appear in the finished film Lucas also used Humphrey Bogart as a reference point for the character br While developing the story for the first sequel The Empire Strikes Back Lucas described Solo as coming to grips with accepting responsibility An early plot line involved him being separated from Luke while on a crucial mission Lucas thought Solo should meet with a business leader who deals with the Empire and with whom Solo has some kind of relationship like a stepfather In the finished film Solo instead unites with his old friend Lando Calrissian an administrator willing to conduct business with the Empire In early screenplay drafts of Revenge of the Sith a ten year old Solo helps the Jedi Master Yoda locate General Grievous The early scripts also revealed that Solo was raised by Chewbacca on the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk Some concept art of the young Solo was created but Lucas ultimately decided to remove the character from the film br The script for The Force Awakens was written by Michael Arndt Lawrence Kasdan and the film s director J J Abrams In an early draft Solo reconciled with Leia and survived the film but Abrams felt his character was not contributing to the plot in a meaningful way He realized that Solo s death at the hands of his son would move the story forward while also giving Kylo Ren the chance to develop into a worthy successor to Darth Vader Solo s appearance in the film was influenced by that of Rooster Cogburn in the film True Grit br br br Portrayal br When casting Star Wars Lucas had a preference for unknown actors He initially resisted casting Ford as Solo since Ford had previously worked with him on American Graffiti and was therefore not unknown Instead the director asked Ford to assist with auditions by reading lines with other actors However Lucas was eventually won over by Ford and cast him as Solo over many other actors who auditioned Mark Hamill who plays Solo s companion Luke Skywalker admired Ford s ability to re write his character s dialogue He observed Ford crossing out lines in the script and replacing them with modified versions which he felt were more appropriate for Solo br br br Characterization and analysis br In Lucas described Solo as a cynical loner who realizes the importance of being part of a group and helping for the common good In he described the character as the selfish sidekick of the selfless Luke br The noted mythologist Joseph Campbell said of Solo He thinks he s an egoist but he really isn t That s a very loveable kind of human being They think they re working for themselves but there s something else pushing them On another occasion Campbell said Solo was a very practical guy at least as he thought of himself a materialist But he was a compassionate human being at the same time and didn t know it The adventure evoked a quality of his character that he hadn t known he possessed br br br Appearances br br br Original trilogy br Solo
