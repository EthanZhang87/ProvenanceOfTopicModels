be much left for him to return to There s a gang of villains bent on destroying the Sanctuary there are some very powerful people who want Valkyrie dead and as if all that was not enough it looks very

his large gallery of characters br Phillip Ardagh The Guardian br br It s exciting pacy nicely handled and it s fun There s nothing worthy about it and it s all the better for that And I might add it s self contained Landy may well revisit these characters I sincerely hope he does but it s a pleasingly rounded tale which is refreshing in these days of endless open ended books of never ending series br Nathan Nicholls Whitby Gazette br br There is no expense spared by Landy in this book and I would have to say that everyone who could be bothered to read it would definitely be drawn into it and certainly enjoy it Something for everyone and everything for someone Skulduggery Pleasant is easily my book of the year so far Read it br Christina Hardyment The Independent br br Landy is an established horror writer and the combats between Skulduggery Serpine and his legions of Hollow Men and vampires rival the climaxes of the Potter films for hair raising effects it isn t often that writing makes you feel as if you are watching a film br The Times br br Derek Landy s debut Skulduggery Pleasant has a distinctly Horowitzian humour and verve to it being a detective story featuring a wizard s skeleton as hero When Stephanie s uncle dies she discovers his horror stories weren t fiction and that evil forces are after her for a mysterious key Wisecracking madly the duo must survive each other as well as Hell At the end of it readers of may well be regretting their consumption of chocolate eggs br The series did not prove popular in the US and the publisher stopped releasing there after the third book br br br Film adaptation br A film adaption was in development under Warner Brothers but according to Derek Landy the script was the worst thing he had ever read with Skulduggery Pleasant a skeleton body who somehow retained his head and face a magnifying glass magic wand and a musical number where he danced to Michael Jackson s Man in the Mirror In December Landy announced on his blog that the movie rights were back with him In October Landy confirmed he had written a new screenplay draft adapting the first novel and elements of a short story In interviews
