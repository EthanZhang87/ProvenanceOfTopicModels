Book of Boba Fett Fennec and Fett come into conflict with various enemies attempting to seize power from them leading them to ally with the Mandalorian once more to defend their new crime empire br The character has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike and has been described as a fan favorite br br br Concept and creation br Elements of Fennec Shand s personality and development were inspired by the character s name which Wen said brought to mind the idea of the namesake fennec fox Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair noted the fennec fox is a particularly appropriate model for the character because like Fennec Shand it is both predator and prey Wen felt the character shared common attributes with the fox including trickiness stealthiness maneuverability and the ability to survive br The character of Fennec Shand and the casting of Wen was first announced at the D Expo in Anaheim California on August Bob Iger CEO of The Walt Disney Company announced the news on the same day that Wen was named one of the Disney Legends for her past work in Disney works Footage of Fennec Shand was first publicly shown in a second teaser trailer for The Mandalorian released on November The teaser concluded with a shot of Fennec delivering the line Your name will be legendary Abbey White said the character was eagerly anticipated by the time The Mandalorian premiered br br br Portrayal br Fennec Shand is portrayed by Ming Na Wen It marks one of several notable performances by Wen in Walt Disney Company projects including voicing Mulan in the animated films Mulan Mulan II and the video game Kingdom Hearts II making a cameo appearance in the live action remake as a court guest and portraying Melinda May on the Marvel series Agents of S H I E L D Patrick Hipes of Deadline Hollywood called this a Disney franchise trifecta Wen has jokingly said of Disney Please just keep acquiring all these different franchises because I just keep getting employed by them I have hit every bucket list thanks to Disney br As a child Wen was a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy and as one of the few Asian girls growing up in Mt Lebanon Pennsylvania she particularly related to the character Luke Skywalker and his dreams of a more meaningful life recalling Just that image of him looking at the binary suns and wishing for more it always stays with me She has described Star Wars as her favorite all time genre Wen grew up in the same town as The Mandalorian executive producer Dave Filoni who also directed the episode in which she appears br Fennec Shand is the first major Star Wars villain antihero portrayed by an Asian actress Wen said she is pleased there has been more representation of Asians among the casts of Star Wars projects in recent years citing Kelly Marie Tran s portrayal of Rose Tico in Star Wars The Last Jedi as another example She also noted that the Star Wars franchise has often been influenced by Asian cultures both in its costuming and set design elements despite an earlier lack of Asian actors being cast she noted There was all this incredible imagery but yet there were very few Asians in the films Any sort of representation is important and necessary And I m just happy that I got chosen br After attending the premiere of The Mandalorian on November Wen posted photos from the event on Twitter and wrote What a night If you told my yr old self that I d be on the red carpet celebrating being IN a starwars project she d think you were nuts Well that little girl inside me still think it s nuts br br br Costume br br Fennec Shand s costume was created by Joseph Porro the costume designer for The Mandalorian A black leather outfit of armor with broad shoulders and accents of orange it was inspired by the fennec fox referenced in the character s name Wen referred to it as an amazing outfit that I fell in love with right away br Original plans for Fennec s hair called for it to be loose and unkempt but Wen suggested her hairstyle include some of the fennec fox architecture similar to the costume She also felt the original plan was too similar to the long flowing hair of her Melinda May character on Agents of S H I E L D and she wanted the two characters to be more differentiated Wen brought these ideas to Dave Filoni and The Mandalorian creator and showrunner Jon Favreau and they responded enthusiastically As a result the hairstylist on The Mandalorian conceived a braiding system with triangular points similar to the ears of a fennec fox The braids are pulled back tight against her head and threaded with orange which was also influenced by the fennec fox animal Wen said felt the hairstyle gives her such a strong unique look br br br Characterization br Fennec Shand is characterized as an elite assassin one who is mysterious and very dangerous She is a highly skilled fighter at both firearms and hand to hand combat and displays a sharpshooter s ability with a sniper rifle She is very graceful and agile and stealthy demonstrating an ability to maneuver and survive Ming Na Wen the actress who portrays Fennec felt the character has a moral ambiguity similar to that of popular Star Wars character Han Solo She is also very tricky playing mind games with her victims as demonstrated by her attempts to manipulate Toro Calican once captured Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair has noted that the character is rather talkative in this way in contrast to the usually stoic and silent title character the Mandalorian Wen feels the character has a good sense of humor about it all as well Nevertheless she also at times demonstrates a gruff and reserved personality Fennec is ruthless independent unpredictable and is loyal to herself first and foremost She occasionally shows errors in judgment such as when she almost fatally underestimates the ruthlessness of Toro Calican br br br Appearances br br br The Mandalorian br In The Mandalorian Fennec Shand is presented as an elite mercenary and assassin who

Fennec was added to Fortnite Battle Royale alongside Black Krrsantan br br br Reception br Fennec Shand has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike Izak Bulten of Screen Rant wrote Despite appearing in just one episode she had a clear well realized character and has quickly become a favorite amongst fans of the series Men s Health writer Evan Romano said In only a few lines this character has already had some very impressive lore built around her Vanity Fair writer Anthony Breznican felt the character continued a positive and significant trend of greater diversity in Star Wars casting citing other examples of Asian actors in recent projects such as Kelly Marie Tran in The Last Jedi and Christopher Sean in Star Wars Resistance Joanna Robinson also of Vanity Fair praised the character saying she had a coiled power in her and complimented the casting of Wen Jackson McHenry of Vulture praised Wen s performance and called the character one of the badder ass badasses in the world of The Mandalorian Fennec Shand was included on Vulture s list of the show s best cameo appearances from season one br Before her return in the second season several reviewers felt the character was eliminated too quickly and did not get the chance to live up to her potential Joanna Robinson said she would have preferred a full episode of word play between Fennec and the Mandalorian and said of Fennec s role in the episode There s a real potential there and it was over too quickly for my taste I would ve loved more of it Dirk Libbey of CinemaBlend called the character criminally underused and Allie Gemmill of Inverse called her death hasty Breznican said There s way too much potential for that character to just vanish like this Keith Phipps of Vulture wrote that she seemed too clever to be taken out so easily by a rookie Kerr Lordygan of TV Fanatic wrote that Fennec s demise was too easily obtained though the possibility of her return was left open TV Insider s Emily Hannemann stated that she is just plain cool saying Not every character can steal a scene by sitting and drinking spotchka but not every character is Fennec Shand Stating that Ming Na Wen s Fennec Shand like Din Djarin and Grogu has left a mark in the Star Wars franchise Cinemablend s Erik Swann praised Fennec Shand br Several reviewers correctly speculated that the character was still alive with some arguing this is foreshadowed by the final scene of Chapter The Gunslinger during which a mysterious stranger investigates her body Allie Gemmill called that scene one of the most tantalizing closings to a Mandalorian episode since the series premiere revealed Baby Yoda Dirk Libbey called the mysterious character s identity and his interest in Fennec one of our bigger cliffhanger moments from the series Evan Romano said he would not be surprised to see Fennec Shand turn up again in a future Star Wars film or series writing This character seems just a little too capable and a little too cool to be disarmed and killed after just a single brief appearance Stephanie Dube Dwilson of Heavy com said she so enjoyed Wen s acting that she hopes the character returns br br br br br br
