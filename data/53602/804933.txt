Holiday Special which proved to be an embarrassment Lucas assumed greater control over a planned half hour television project about Ewoks He hired Thomas G Smith to produce the film after Smith had stepped down as the manager of Industrial Light Magic ILM following his work on Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom Lucas also hired Bob Carrau a personal assistant to co write the story with him br When shopping the film around Smith discovered that none of the TV networks at the time were interested in airing a half hour special but ABC showed interest in a two hour movie of the week the project was expanded to fill the request br The producers initially conceived of the project as a cross between Hansel and Gretel and Tarzan of the Apes John Korty who had directed the Lucas produced Twice Upon a Time was selected as director br br br Crew br Working from a story written by George Lucas and a screenplay by Bob Carrau director John Korty transformed the scenic northern California redwood forests into the forest moon of Endor Joe Johnston an art director at ILM for years and one of the key concept artists of the classic Star Wars trilogy acted as production designer and second unit director Prior to the movie s release Johnston also wrote and illustrated a book about Ewoks The Adventures of Teebo A Tale of Magic and Suspense br br br Visual effects br Both Ewok films were some of the last intensive stop motion animation work ILM produced as by the early s the technique was being replaced by go motion an advanced form of animation with motorized puppets that move while the camera shutter is open However go motion was too expensive for the budgets of the Ewok films so stop motion was used to realize creatures such as the Gorax br The Ewok movies proved an opportunity for ILM to use a technique innovated for A Space Odyssey called latent image matte painting In this technique during live action photography a section of the camera lens is blocked off and remains unexposed The film is rewound the blocked areas reversed and a painting crafted to occupy the space is photographed br br br Music br br The musical score for Caravan of Courage was composed by Peter

its streaming service Disney This prompted Eric Walker to start a petition for Disney to add them In March it was announced that both films would begin streaming on Disney on April br br br Reception br br br Critical response br In his review for The New York Times John J O Connor noted the film s story as being almost aggressively simple and that Mr Lucas and crew do not come up with anything terribly astonishing With Marin County serving as the backdrop looking like some never never land east of the Sun and west of the Moon O Connor recognized most of the interactions as following well established cinematic tropes the notable ones being between Cindel looking like one of those little blond angels used to top off Christmas trees and Wicket a performance by the then year old Warwick Davis whom O Connor called the cleverest of the lot br Pointing to the main characters and plot elements one pair of writers concluded that both Caravan of Courage and its sequel are fairy tales despite occurring in a science fiction setting They point to magical phenomena in both films which is a fantasy element They argue that in a science fiction story the hero wants to disrupt or challenge the hierarchy of a supposed utopian society whereas in both Ewok films society is not challenged or disputed Additionally they argue that while the Star Wars saga also has fairy tale tropes it adhered more towards science fiction Another author agreed that the films are fairy tales wherein Science explains all magic br Colin Greenland reviewed Caravan of Courage for Imagine magazine and stated that a casual catalogue of magical folderol about various ancestral talismans carried by the questing koalas It certainly did the trick for the eight and nine year olds in the front row but seemed to make little sense to their mums and dads or to me br Modern reception has been largely negative with Aidan Mason of Pop Culture Beast calling the movie a story without a sense of urgency and a chore to sit through br br br Accolades br The Ewok Adventure was one of four films to be juried awarded Emmys for Outstanding Special Visual Effects at the th Primetime Emmy Awards The film was additionally nominated for Outstanding Children s Program but lost in this category to an episode of American Playhouse br br br Legacy br br Several elements from the film have gone on to appear in
