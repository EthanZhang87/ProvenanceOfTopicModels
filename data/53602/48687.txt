Kevin Michael Richardson a crime lord with ties to the Imperial Remnant who poses as a respectable garbage collector on Nar Shaddaa Throughout the game players fight different types of enemies including mercenaries and Imperial stormtroopers Halfway through the story lightsaber wielding enemies are introduced namely the Reborn thugs and soldiers who have been artificially infused with the Force and Shadowtroopers who sport lightsaber resistant cortosis armor that also allows them to briefly turn invisible br br br Plot br The game begins with Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors investigating a supposedly abandoned Imperial outpost on Kejim finding it to be crawling with Imperial forces They fight their way through the base discovering a research center studying crystals similar to those

Academy to reclaim his lightsaber which he had left with Luke Skywalker Luke reveals Desann s origins to Kyle and senses his anger through the Force so he requests that Kyle complete a series of trials to prove he will not succumb to the Dark Side again Kyle passes the tests and obtains his lightsaber before travelling to Nar Shaddaa where Luke told him to seek out Reelo Baruk a Rodian

reclaim control of the city Kyle finds and defeats Tavion who fearing for her life reveals that Jan is alive and onboard Galak Fyyar s Star Destroyer the Doomgiver Jan s faked death was just a ploy to trick Kyle into going to the Valley of the Jedi which allowed Desann to follow him there and tap its power Kyle spares Tavion and takes her ship to infiltrate the Doomgiver which is docked at the Cairn Installation an Imperial base hidden on an asteroid in the Lenico Belt br At the base Kyle runs into Luke who informs him that Desann has used the Valley s energy to empower an army of Reborn which could number in the thousands After fighting several Reborn together Kyle and Luke split up to find the Doomgiver Along the way the former has his first encounter with the Shadowtroopers and discovers that the base is actually an assault ship construction facility which is preparing for a full scale planetary assault As Kyle boards the Doomgiver he sees Luke fighting Desann outside the ship but can t intervene because the Star Destroyer jumps into hyperspace Kyle uses the ship s communications array to contact Rogue Squadron and finds Jan in the detention block who reveals that Desann was not specifically interested in the Valley of the Jedi but rather the Jedi Academy which he is invading just now to harvest its Force power After killing Fyyar and destroying the Doomgiver s shield reactor which leaves the ship open for attack Kyle escapes with Jan in a safe pod moments before Rogue Squadron destroy the Doomgiver br Kyle and Jan arrive on Yavin IV in the middle of the Imperial invasion and split up the latter goes to assist the New Republic starfighters while the former makes his way to the Jedi Academy on foot After helping the Jedi students and Republic soldiers fend off the assault Kyle ventures into the Academy s underground maze and confronts Desann as he tries to absorb the power from the Force nexus at the centre Kyle informs Desann of the Doomgiver s destruction and the Imperial army s defeat and offers him the chance to rejoin the Jedi but an enraged Desann refuses and attacks him Kyle kills Desann and returns to the surface where he reunites

Andrew Reiner calling it the quintessential Star Wars game and a feast for all FPS devotees He also wrote without question Jedi Outcast is the most enjoyable and accomplished Star Wars game yet He was also extremely impressed with multiplayer calling it a highly addictive over the top experience that all FPS players must see to believe Brian Gee of Game Revolution gave the game an A He praised how authentically Star Wars the game felt as well as the lightsaber interface writing I ve played a ton of Star Wars games in my time and I don t think any of them can match the excitement and fun of lightsaber play in Jedi Outcast br IGN were also impressed scoring the game out of and giving it an Editor s Choice award Reviewer Steve Butts lauded the tightly written mature plot and wrote not only is this one of the greatest Star Wars games I ve ever played it s one of the best action games period He also commended the fantastic graphics and intelligent level design although he was critical of the puzzles the lightsaber interface and complained that the game starts too slowly GameSpot also scored the game out of and like IGN also gave it an Editor s Choice award Reviewer Amer Ajami echoed IGN s criticisms of the slow start and too much puzzle solving However he was very impressed with the interface arguing never before has melee combat in a shooter been so effectively executed and he concluded by saying the game s strong points especially its combat overshadow whatever problems Jedi Outcast may have early on calling it simply one of the easiest games to recommend this year br Game Over Online gave the game calling it an intriguing juxtaposition of pieces of incredibly intense FPS action that had me on the edge of my seat combined with puzzle like sections of such opacity that they made me want to kill myself Entertainment Weekly gave it an A stating that the Force is strong with this one Maxim however gave it an eight out of ten and stated that The Force is strong with this polished first person shooter br In a negative review X Play criticized the game as a disturbance in the Force Although reviewer Jason D Aprile called the story pretty good the graphics fantastic and the audio effects just right he complained that the level design succumbs to the Dark Side citing illogical and frustrating situations He also considered the multiplayer mode not very impressive and gave the game out of stars Eurogamer were also underwhelmed scoring the game out of They criticized the slow start the lightsaber interface and the AI However they did commend the atmosphere and some of the level design They concluded that Jedi Outcast is a rather patchy game with moments of genius let down by a lack of consistency The guns are derivative and rarely used once you get hold of your lightsaber the melee combat clumsy and chaotic the AI poor and some of the locations derivative and poorly designed br In June GameTrailers s list of the best Star Wars games saw Jedi Outcast rank at number one with the editorial commenting that This was certainly not the first time players had the opportunity to play as a Jedi in a video game it was the first time you actually felt like one They also praised the lightsaber and Force combat systems a story which they felt was consistent with the films and the cameos from some key Star Wars characters namely Luke Skywalker and Lando Calrissian br Jedi Outcast was nominated for Computer Gaming World s Action Game of the Year award which ultimately went to Medal of Honor Allied Assault The editors wrote Jedi Knight II is a blast and the force powers and lightsaber control are perfectly executed However they found it too lacking in originality and consistency to win the award During the th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards

out of on Metacritic based on twenty four reviews The GameCube version holds scores of out of on Metacritic based on seventeen reviews br The Xbox version was described as truly fantastic by the Official Xbox Magazine who scored it out of IGN were also impressed scoring it out of and calling it the best Star Wars experience on the Xbox Reviewer Aaron Boudling praised how the controls had been mapped onto the Xbox Controller but was highly critical of the game s lack of support for Xbox Live and the absence of an online multiplayer mode He also felt the graphics in the cutscenes were significantly weaker than the PC version GameSpot scored it out of with reviewer Amer Ajami saying the port retains the essence of what it must feel like to be an all powerful Jedi which was so well conveyed in the original PC game without sacrificing much in the way of graphics playability or overall value In fact the game s complicated control scheme is better served on an Xbox controller than it is in the PC s typical mouse and keyboard setup However he too criticized the lack of Xbox Live support and the poor graphical quality of the cutscenes Game Revolution gave the game a B praising the controls and atmosphere but criticizing the AI and lack of Xbox Live support Eurogamer were as unimpressed with the Xbox version as they had been with the PC version scoring it out of Reviewer Kristan Reed found a lot of the problems with the game to be inherent to the original not problems with the port a slow beginning poor AI bad level design repetitive puzzles Reed called the lack of Xbox Live support plain unacceptable and concluded Jedi Outcast is certainly an entertaining package when it gets things right but it s also riddled with design flaws technical flaws and various minor irritations that conspire to detract from your overall enjoyment Given that it s also not Live or even LAN enabled Xbox owners don t even have that crumb of comfort to elevate its status br GameSpot scored the GameCube version out of As with the Xbox version Ajami was critical of the cutscene graphics but concluded that Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast makes a fine addition to the Nintendo console s gradually growing list of action games GameSpy gave the same version three and a half stars out of five Reviewer Scott Steinberg was critical of the game s slow start and the nature of some of the puzzles Of the port he wrote This game was an award winning game on a prior platform so you d be in the right to demand more But from the perspective of a GameCube owner just getting your first taste of the galactic goodie that is the Jedi Knight series things could have been a lot worse Jedi Knight II Outcast stands as a respectable effort but disappointing reminder that when you swap content from platform to platform something often gets lost in the transition IGN scored it out of with reviewer Aaron Boudling arguing that the graphics and controls were significantly poorer than in either the PC or Xbox versions Of the controls Boulding wrote While the Xbox version allows you to map your favorite moves to the black and white buttons for quick access GameCube owners are out of luck and will have to fumble around with the D Pad in the heat of battle He concluded It s obvious that no work at all went into trying to get this game to properly run on GameCube The framerate is erratic and constantly alternates between smooth and choppy further complicating the already clunky control system If you re a multi console owner get the superior Xbox version to see a better realized port Nintendo World Report scored it out of also citing the inferior controls and poorer graphics than the PC and Xbox versions Jedi Outcast ends up being a pretty terrible port of an excellent PC title The trick to enjoying the GameCube incarnation will be coming to terms with the control and graphic inadequacies in the game and then being able to make yourself get over the hump so that you can enjoy the meat and potatoes of the whole experience br It was a runner up for GameSpot s annual Best Shooter on GameCube award which went to TimeSplitters br br br Sales br In the United States Jedi
