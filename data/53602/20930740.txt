beta He praised the game s gunplay for its being strong and seeming great but heavily criticized Walker Assault one of the game s modes for its difficulty of winning it as a Rebel He compared the game s visuals to the Star Wars films realistic clashes Moreover he praised the accuracy of Stormtroopers for its being at least true to the movie and called wave one soldiers exceptionally special while pointing out the flaw that the game had an unusual balance of Star Wars heroes and villains For example Darth Vader would be splatted by any passing ship while Luke Skywalker would have far more luck on the looking epic side of things such as successfully destroying an AT ST solo Another flaw which he had pointed out is the weird and infuriating timing of ending scenes in which screens overlap the ends of matches br The game s lack of a campaign for the single player mode was criticized Steven Storm of Ars Technica praised the visuals stating DICE has at least captured the look and feel of Star
