Ahsoka Tano is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise She was introduced as the year old Togruta Jedi Padawan of Anakin Skywalker in the animated film Star Wars The Clone Wars before appearing in the subsequent animated television series the sequel series Star Wars Rebels in the live action film Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker as a voiceover cameo and in the miniseries Tales of the Jedi voiced by Ashley Eckstein In Ahsoka made her live action debut in the second season of the Disney series The Mandalorian portrayed by Rosario Dawson Dawson reprised the role in a episode of the spin off series The Book of Boba Fett and the series Ahsoka br br br Creation and development br br br Concept br Ahsoka was created by George Lucas and Dave Filoni The character was developed to illustrate how Anakin Skywalker develops from the brash undisciplined Padawan apprentice in Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones to the more reserved Jedi Knight in Episode III Revenge of the Sith Lucas who had two daughters also wanted the character to appeal to girls Early in development Ahsoka s name was Ashla Lucas renamed her after the ancient Indian emperor Ashoka the spelling was then altered by screenwriter Henry Gilroy br Filoni The Clone Wars supervising director and writer wrote a fable about Ahsoka s early childhood to help develop the character He imagined the discovery that she has the right stuff to become a Jedi would be a cause for celebration in her hometown Filoni said he is protective of the Ahsoka character br Giving Anakin responsibility for a Padawan was meant to place the character in a role that forced him to become more cautious and responsible It would also provide him with insight into his relationship with his own master Obi Wan Kenobi and depict how their relationship matured Ahsoka and Anakin s relationship was seen as an essential story arc spanning both the animated film and the Clone Wars television series br br br Writing br br Filoni initially struggled with writing Ahsoka because he had zero perspective on what it was like to be a year old girl He therefore shifted his focus and instead wrote Ahsoka primarily as a Jedi who just happens to be an adolescent female Filoni said he has always had a story in mind for Ahsoka s overall development He began thinking about the final confrontation between Ahsoka and Vader ever since he started writing material for Ahsoka different iterations had different endings including one in which Vader kills Ahsoka just as she slashes open his helmet to reveal his scarred face br Ashley Eckstein who primarily voiced Ahsoka said she and the writers were aware that audiences initially found the character annoying and that there was a fine line between Ahsoka being bratty and becoming endearing Because production was a year ahead of what was broadcast with Ahsoka developing over that time Eckstein implored fans to be patient with the character s growth br Although Ahsoka leaves the Jedi Order at the end of The Clone Wars fifth season the storyline initially had her return to the Order Filoni said this would be the normal arc and suggested to Lucas that she instead remain expelled Lucas agreed as a compromise as he believed Ahsoka didn t survive Order the mass murder of the Jedi portrayed in Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith br The Fulcrum character introduced early in Star Wars Rebels was always understood to be Ahsoka Filoni who served as executive producer and co creator of Rebels worked with Lucas on identifying what Ahsoka would know about Anakin s fate Filoni also collaborated with executive producer Simon Kinberg and season one executive producer Greg Weisman on developing Ahsoka s role as a Rebel agent br The show s writers were excited for Ahsoka s return in the second season and Filoni was anxious about Rebels instead becoming The Ahsoka Tano Show Consequently Filoni required that Ahsoka play a role in service of Rebels main characters Ezra Bridger and Kanan Jarrus he saw Ahsoka s new role as similar to the one played by Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars Although Ahsoka is more mature in Rebels Filoni wanted aspects of that kid who was there to shine through He initially envisioned Ahsoka as a more passive player not engaged in combat but later decided it was more appropriate to see Ahsoka as a warrior during a turbulent time Ahsoka s presence was necessary to allow Darth Vader to encounter the show s lead characters without the latter being destroyed Ahsoka can stand toe to toe with Vader br Filoni cites fans passion for the character as one reason for Ahsoka s prominence in Clone Wars and Rebels br br br Voice acting br Eckstein said Filoni wanted her to bring some of her personality into the Ahsoka character he said her actions and speech between audition takes had earned her the part more than the actual audition Once production on The Clone Wars began it took about six months for Eckstein and the writers to understand Ahsoka consequently much of the dialogue for the first half of season one was re recorded to depict the character better Eckstein also said the Ahsoka character was solidified by the casting of Matt Lanter as Anakin which occurred halfway through the first season br Eckstein reprised the role of Ahsoka for Rebels although she did not do all of Fulcrum s voice work She learned about Ahsoka s return about a year before the first season s finale aired and said it was hard to keep it a secret Eckstein said Ahsoka developed a quiet confidence and quiet strength the younger character doesn t possess but sometimes she played Ahsoka too seriously she pointed out that snippiness and determination are still part of Ahsoka s personality Eckstein pitched her voice down a bit but because she and Ahsoka were now much closer in age generally spoke like herself br Not knowing Ahsoka s experiences between The Clone Wars and Rebels at times presented challenges for Eckstein s performance Filoni avoids giving the actors plot details that might inappropriately affect their performance for example he did not tell Eckstein whether Ahsoka survives her duel with Darth Vader lest Eckstein telegraph something in her performance that the character would not know br br br Appearance br br Ahsoka s design evolved over three years before her introduction in the Clone Wars film Her appearance was inspired by San in Princess Mononoke Ahsoka initially appears in what Wired called a tube top and miniskirt costume In the third season Ahsoka and other characters received new costumes Filoni said the changes were meant to bring the show s aesthetic closer to that of Revenge of the Sith and were made possible by improved animation techniques For the seventh and final season of Clone Wars Ahsoka s design was once again tweaked due to improvements in animation technology Her costume was also changed to a more grayish blue color similar to her appearance in Star Wars Rebels which aired before the season br Ahsoka often uses a reverse lightsaber grip similar to that of the Japanese film character Zatoichi Along with the costume change in the third season of Clone Wars Ahsoka also received a second lightsaber In the seventh and final season she received new blue lightsabers br Ahsoka s armor in Rebels is based on a pseudo samurai look influenced by photographs of samurai women The armor is meant to appear as if she found it in an ancient Jedi temple and her lightsabers colorless blades indicate she is neither a Jedi nor a Sith Filoni said the white lightsabers appear much better than he anticipated Her facial markings were changed to show that she has aged It was new ground for the production team to shift Ahsoka s animation style to reflect her older age br br br Depiction br br br Film br br br The Clone Wars br br Ahsoka Tano was introduced in the Clone Wars animated film serving as a pilot for the television series of the same name as a year old Padawan apprentice assigned by Yoda to Anakin Skywalker to teach him responsibility Anakin is initially frustrated by this decision Their early interactions are playfully contentious with Anakin calling her Snips for her snippy attitude and Ahsoka calling him Skyguy as a play on his surname br br br The Rise of Skywalker br br Ahsoka Tano makes a vocal cameo in Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker as one of the past Jedi who help Rey fight the resurrected Emperor Palpatine Darth Sidious Eckstein returned to voice the character in the film br br br Television br br br Animated series br br br The Clone Wars br br Ahsoka is a main character in six of the seven seasons of Star Wars The Clone Wars She is a padawan commander of the st Legion in the Grand Army of the Republic and continues to learn the ways of the Jedi as Anakin s apprentice The two develop a mutual fondness at times taking great risks to protect or save one another Some of Anakin s actions taken out of concern for Ahsoka expose his darker tendencies such as his torture of prisoners who may know her location when she goes missing Ahsoka also finds mentorship from Captain Rex a clone trooper with whom she and Anakin serve throughout the war During the final arc of season five Ahsoka is framed and imprisoned for a deadly explosion and a subsequent murder both of which were committed by her friend Barriss Offee Although eventually exonerated she becomes disillusioned with the Jedi Council and leaves the Jedi Order in the season finale br Filoni said an initial finale concept for The Clone Wars would have had Rex escape Order and his and Ahsoka s presence elsewhere would have explained both characters absence from Revenge of the Sith Ahsoka returns in the seventh and final season of The Clone Wars being the focus of two of the three story arcs featured in the season which aired in on Disney The final four episodes set during the events of Revenge of the Sith sees Ahsoka briefly reuniting with Anakin and Obi Wan prior to their leaving to Coruscant to save Chancellor Palpatine secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious Before departing to Mandalore Rex is promoted to

appearance by using an altered voice and appearing as a hooded hologram Her identity is revealed in the season finale br She becomes a recurring character in the second season continuing to help lead a group of Rebel forces and working with the Ghost s crew especially with its Jedi members Ezra Bridger and Kanan Jarrus Having assumed that Anakin died like most other Jedi at the end of the Clone Wars she is overwhelmed to recognize her mentor under a layer of hate in Darth Vader Later in the season a vision of Anakin blames her for leaving him and allowing him to fall to the dark side In the season finale Ahsoka duels with Darth Vader inside a Sith temple on Malachor allowing her friends from the Ghost to escape Vader and the temple s destruction She is horrified to confirm that he is her master after damaging his mask and hearing his voice She tried to show compassion but he coldly rejected her As the episode concludes Darth Vader is shown injured and leaving the temple watched by a green and white owl The owl previously a companion to Ahsoka in the show and an avatar of the Daughter of Mortis then flies back into the temple to witness Ahsoka seemingly walking deeper inside its walls Filoni said Ahsoka s fate is ambiguous and a bit open ended though Eckstein believed the character to still be alive br In the fourth season episode A World Between Worlds Ahsoka s fate is

the Jedi br br br Critical response br After her introduction some critics called Ahsoka annoying and predicted the character would die before The Clone Wars series ended because she does not appear in Revenge of the Sith The Los Angeles Times called Ahsoka a carefully calculated to be cute character in The Clone Wars film Wired criticized Ahsoka s half naked appearance in The Clone Wars first two seasons calling her third season costume change more appropriate Blastr said Ahsoka s initial immaturity gives the character room to grow saying she becomes a well rounded and complex character in every sense Ahsoka s youth aided her in being a point of view character for younger viewers io called Ahsoka s development arc one of the best aspects of The Clone Wars highlighting the character s role in exploring the nuances of war and the flaws of the Jedi Order According to Tech Times Ahsoka s maturation and development mirror the show s and the producers chose wisely in making Ahsoka the

Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith and the publication called Ahsoka a foil for Anakin s growth Blastr commented that Anakin s interactions with Ahsoka help show that he is a powerful Jedi
