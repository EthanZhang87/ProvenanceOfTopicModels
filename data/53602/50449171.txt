feel like the movies We wanted to feel like we were hired to do the direct sequel to the original film It s very much a team book and we ve got all the main players here Luke Han Leia Chewie the droids and Darth Vader all get big moments in this first arc and that s our core cast going forward He explained that Luke s story is a main thrust of the comic considering where the character is at this point in the timeline adding br br This is all pretty new to him His world has changed completely He had this mentor for five minutes who now is dead and leaves him with all these questions about his father about his history and where he goes from here and what s his role in the grand scheme of things He s on this journey of discovery by himself and he wants to find out more about his father

of what they re chasing Luke s chasing after his dad while running away from Vader br Aaron also noted that Han is in an interesting spot at this point in the timeline We don t know how fully
