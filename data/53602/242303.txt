after winning a podracing bet with Gardulla the Hutt and he puts them both to work in his store Anakin demonstrates an incredible aptitude for equipment repair and Watto decides to profit from it by having the boy fix various broken equipment in the store He eventually loses Anakin in a podracing bet with Qui Gon Jinn when he bets on a competitor Sebulba who is defeated by Anakin br br br Concept and creation br George Lucas was specific with the concept art team about what features he envisioned for Watto Design director Doug Chiang described the character s design as this conglomeration of odd things that really didn t fit but that in the end gave him a very unique and powerful personality Lucas dismissed concepts including a pudgy parrot by Terryl Whitlatch though Whitlatch recalls one of her designs influencing the direction for the character and a four armed beast with a cigar by Iain Craig Chiang repurposed the head from one of his early Neimoidian designs featuring a hooked trunk and crooked teeth and added hummingbird wings meeting Lucas s approval Additionally Chiang gave Watto a vest and a tool belt only asking for webbed feet and pants Modeling supervisor Geoff Campell was skeptical of having a chubby alien with wings so it was imagined that the Toydarians are filled with gas with the wings propelling them instead of supporting their weight Animation supervisor Rob Coleman realized that the alien s teeth would need some modification as the craggy teeth made lip syncing difficult To solve the problem Coleman broke off one of Watto s incisors giving him a corner of the mouth vernacular His expressions were based on video footage of voice actor Andy Secombe photographs of Coleman imitating the character and modeler Steve Alpin saying Watto s lines to a mirror Alec Guinness performing as Fagin in Oliver Twist was used as an influence in the character s development The sound of his wings flapping is a looped recording of sound designer Ben Burtt

a creature so potbellied is able to stay afloat for so long They added that he was no prince for his unscrupulous deals br In the book The Holy Family and Its Legacy author Albrecht Koschorke discusses the presence of The Holy Family in The Phantom Menace stating that while there was no solicitous guardian watching over the mother and the holy child Watto acts in a similar position as a man who possesses patriarchal powers without being the father br br br Allegations of antisemitism br It has been suggested that the character is offensive because of his perceived similarities to a stereotypical Jew having a large hooked nose beady eyes unkempt facial hair speaking in a gravelly voice and being portrayed as greedy and covetous J Hoberman of The Village Voice called him the most blatant ethnic stereotype due to his hooked nose Bruce Gottlieb of Slate magazine criticized him as well comparing his character to the antisemitic notion that the Jewish race is behind the slave trade Patricia J Williams of The Nation stated that Watto was also described as a stereotype of Arabs but that he was more comprehensively anti Semitic both anti Arab and anti Jew She added that Watto reminded her of an anti Semitic caricature published in Vienna at the turn of the th century br Jane Prettyman of American Review noted that after leaving the theater she heard two young boys describe him as that weird little Jew guy with wings Prettyman described his depiction as not at all subtle and said that it can be counted on to flush out already formed Jew haters among young audiences and give them permission to continue their hatred out loud br Others have disagreed with this interpretation Andrew Howe states that Watto s nose seems less a cultural referent to Shylock or Fagin than to an elephant s trunk Others have described Watto s accent as Italian and not Jewish br br br Appearances in other media br Crazy Watto is a two minute long fan film that made its debut on the Internet
