Palpatine who later becomes Emperor After a lightsaber battle with his former mentor Obi Wan Kenobi Vader is severely injured and is transformed into a cyborg He serves Palpatine for over two decades hunting down the remaining Jedi and attempting to crush the Rebel Alliance When Palpatine tries to kill Vader s son Luke Skywalker the Sith Lord turns against his master and destroys him Vader is the husband of Padm Amidala the father of Luke and his twin sister Leia Organa and the grandfather of Ben Solo br David Prowse physically portrays Vader in the original trilogy while James Earl Jones provides his voice in all of the films and some television series Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen portray Anakin in the prequel trilogy and Christensen also plays him in the series Obi Wan Kenobi and Ahsoka In the standalone film Rogue One Vader is portrayed by Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous The character also appears in novels comics and video games He has become an iconic villain of cinema br br br Creation and development br br br Darth Vader br As part of the development for the original Star Wars film Lucas hired the artist Ralph McQuarrie to create conceptual images for the characters For Vader Lucas asked McQuarrie to depict a very tall dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind Because the script described Vader traveling between spaceships McQuarrie suggested that he should wear a space suit Lucas agreed and McQuarrie created Vader s iconic mask by combining a full face breathing mask with a samurai helmet A production painting by McQuarrie depicts Vader engaged in a lightsaber duel with Deak Starkiller who later became Luke Skywalker Vader is shown wearing black armor a flowing cape and a skull like mask and helmet This early design was similar to Vader s final appearance br Working from McQuarrie s concepts the costume designer John Mollo devised an outfit that combined clerical robes a motorcycle suit a German military helmet and a military gas mask The prop sculptor Brian Muir created the helmet and armor The sound of Vader s breathing was created by the film s sound designer Ben Burtt using modified recordings of a scuba breathing apparatus The sound effect is trademarked at the U S Patent and Trademark Office br Lucas has provided differing accounts of how the name Darth Vader originated In a interview with Rolling Stone he claimed it was a modified version of Dark Father On another occasion he said it was inspired by the phrase Dark Water It is also possible that Darth Vader originated from the name of Gary Vader a boy who went to high school with Lucas In France Darth Vader s name was changed to Dark Vador starting with Star Wars He was called Dart Fener In Italian language versions of Star Wars films until when his name was reverted to the English version In Iceland his name is Svarth f i which means black head br br br Anakin Skywalker br The films Swiss Family Robinson and Battle of the Bulge influenced the original Star Wars trilogy but Lucas s publicist has denied that Anakin Skywalker was named after Ken Annakin the director of those films The original surname of Anakin and Luke was Starkiller and it remained in the script until a few months into filming Star Wars It was dropped due to what Lucas called unpleasant connotations with Charles Manson who became a star killer in when he murdered the well known actress Sharon Tate Lucas replaced the problematic name Starkiller with Skywalker br Anakin s apprentice Ahsoka Tano was introduced in the animated film The Clone Wars Giving Anakin responsibility for a Padawan was meant to place the character in a role that forced him to become more cautious and responsible It was also meant to provide him with insight about his relationship with his own master Obi Wan Kenobi and show how their relationship matured Anakin s relationship with Ahsoka was seen as an essential story arc spanning both the film and the The Clone Wars television series br After completing principal photography for Revenge of the Sith in Lucas made changes to Anakin s character by rewriting his turn to the dark side He accomplished this through editing the principal footage and filming new scenes during pickups in London in In previous versions of the script Anakin had several reasons for turning to the dark side including his sincere belief that the Jedi were plotting to seize control of the Republic Although he retains this belief in the finished film Lucas s changes emphasized his desire to rescue Padm from death Thus in the theatrical version of Revenge of the Sith Anakin falls to the dark side primarily to save Padm br br br Portrayals br br br Darth Vader br br David Prowse a foot inch m bodybuilder and actor portrays Vader in the original trilogy Prowse was originally offered the role of Chewbacca but turned it down as he wanted to play the villain Bob Anderson a former Olympic fencer portrays Vader during lightsaber fight scenes in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi Lucas chose to have a different actor provide Vader s voice because he felt Prowse s West Country English accent was inappropriate for the character The director originally considered Orson Welles for the role but selected James Earl Jones instead after deciding that Welles s voice would be too recognizable to audiences Jones initially felt his role was too small to warrant recognition and he chose to be uncredited in Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back He was finally credited in Return of the Jedi in br When filming the scene in The Empire Strikes Back in which Vader confesses he is Luke s father Prowse was given modified dialogue to read that did not exist in the script He was known for repeatedly leaking information to the public and the filmmakers wanted to keep Vader s revelation a secret until the film was released Prowse was asked to read the line Obi Wan Kenobi is your father instead of No I am your father Only the director the producers and Mark Hamill knew the actual line which was dubbed in later by Jones Prowse did not know the real line until he viewed the finished film br
