The Rebel Alliance known formally in universe as the Alliance to Restore the Republic is an organization that features in the fictional world of the Star Wars franchise The Alliance is portrayed as a stateless coalition of rebel dissidents and defectors who oppose the Galactic Empire and its authoritarian rule Its stated goal is to restore the liberal governance of the previous Galactic Republic which had been dissolved after its leader Palpatine seized absolute power and declared himself emperor It is the main protagonistic faction of the original Star Wars trilogy br In the Star Wars universe the Rebel insurgency conducts covert operations on Imperial garrison worlds utilizing a stateless strategy in conjunction with wolfpack guerrilla warfare against the Imperial fleet throughout the galaxy Capital ships are portrayed as having no place in the Rebellion as they are described as expensive to build maintain and to keep fully crewed The Rebellion is portrayed as far too limited in both manpower and resources to justify putting so much of both into a giant target The Galactic Empire on the other hand is portrayed as capable of always fielding greater numbers and greater firepower Being able to hit high valued targets and get out is therefore depicted as being much more important to the Empire While the Empire labels all dissenters and rebels as extremists and terrorists in Imperial propaganda the Alliance is depicted and portrayed in various Star Wars media as a group of resilient freedom fighters based on tolerance self empowerment and hope for a better future using insurgency weapons and tactics br The Rebel Alliance was first featured as the main protagonistic faction in the films A New Hope The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi The faction s origins were alluded to in Revenge of the Sith and their early activities are featured in the Disney XD television series Rebels the anthology film Rogue One and the Disney series Andor br

six Senators including Padm Amidala Mon Mothma and Bail Organa meet in the latter s office to discuss ways to counter the already unjustified extraordinary powers of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine subverting the Constitution as the Clone Wars were waning with Mothma stating their goal was preserving democracy within the Republic Amidala was initially skeptical of Palpatine s evil intentions because he had supported her during the Trade Federation s occupation of Naboo The Phantom Menace BBY but Organa and Mon Mothma announced the formation of an anti Palpatine organization the six Senators agreed to a pact of silence In deleted scene titled Seeds of Rebellion in Amidala s apartment with two new Senators joining the group it is explained that the Delegation of disgruntled Senators will present a petition to the Chancellor Amidala was more willing to oppose Palpatine now but wanted to involve the Jedi at least Anakin Skywalker However aside from one Senator agreeing the

development of the rebellion against the Galactic Empire beginning five years before A New Hope BBY and fourteen years after the fall of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order in Revenge of the Sith BBY The show focuses on a motley group of rebels all of whom have been affected by the Empire in one form or another that banded together aboard a freighter starship called Ghost They called themselves the Spectres and were led by Hera Syndulla By the end of the first season it is revealed that there were various clandestine cell systems that were resisting the Empire such as Jun Sato s Phoenix Squadron Senator Bail Organa along with his wife queen Breha Organa of Alderaan and former Jedi Ahsoka Tano both play a pivotal role in coordinating these splinter cells into a legitimate threat capable of challenging Imperial rule Funded primarily by the Royal House of Alderaan the alliance began to allocate resources towards a united front against Imperial rule The Spectres and Phoenix Squadron were later integrated into the Massassi Group based on Yavin which by Rogue One BBY and A New Hope BBY was commanded by General Jan Dodonna One last important rebel cell that later

former smuggler pilot of the Millennium Falcon br br br Military br The Alliance Military and its activities were overseen by Alliance High Command who managed the logistical and strategic matters of the Rebellion s efforts against the dominant Galactic Empire Alliance Intelligence was headed by Spymaster Bail Organa and Spymaster Ahsoka Tano which proved essential for maintaining communications finding missions for the various Alliance Cells and coordinating the Alliance s highly decentralized structure At the time of the Battle of Endor its chief commanders were Gial Ackbar serving as Admiral of the Alliance Starfleet Jan Dodonna serving as General of the Alliance Grand Army Crix Madine serving as General of Alliance Pathfinders br br br Alliance Grand Army br The Alliance military could never decisively win a land war with the Empire Generally speaking the quality of Alliance infantry varied greatly by unit Due to the highly decentralized structure of the Alliance these units often operated independently with little oversight and were frequently lacking in discipline equipment intelligence and combat skills They often consisted of convicts street thugs pirates outlaws and anyone whose profession placed them at odds with the Empire These infantry were tolerated by Alliance Command both for their willingness to mount an insurgency against the Empire and for them being expendable br br br Alliance Pathfinders br Mission critical operations were carried out by few standardized special forces units dubbed pathfinders who had previous military training for infiltration asymmetrical warfare and were capable of operating without resupply Pathfinders volunteered in the Battle of Scarif under Cassian Andor and spearheaded the ground assault during the Battle of Endor br br br Alliance Starfleet br The Alliance military largely consisted of mothballed improvised repurposed or stolen civilian ships from dozens of manufacturers they lacked the means resources or shipyards to build maintain and crew thousands of military grade capital ships The Alliance constantly had to change bases and their carrier ships routinely had to escape into hyperspace before recovering their fighter complement The biggest and most powerful warship they had available were several MC star cruisers supplied to the Alliance by Mon Calamari but the Alliance Fleet kept these in reserve and never risked deploying them even when strategically critical bases in Atollon Yavin and Hoth came under siege The Alliance fleet is geared towards fabian strategy space superiority wolfpack operations hit and run tactics secret missions subterfuge and general elements of a stateless military grand strategy They used gunships and corvettes to screen Imperial starfighters Their warships carried a complement of expensive starfighters equipped with FTL hyperdrives and deflector shields that traveled alongside the fleet This was in contrast to Imperial naval doctrine whose TIE series starfighters were lightly armored and lacked hyperdrives to lower unit cost and discourage pilot defection The Alliance s focus on small light combat ships and on starfighters allowed them to effectively fight the Galactic Empire s well funded and well armed military br The Alliance Starfleet almost never become decisively engaged or placed their ships at risk they avoided pitched battles frontal assaults wars of attrition and conventional symmetric engagements with the Imperials at all costs Instead of engaging the Imperials in open firefights the Rebel Alliance largely embraced flexible non committal attack tactics utilizing mainly fast attack CR corvettes supplied to the Alliance by Alderaan The Imperial leadership considered collateral damage as acceptable margins in rooting out insurgents this contrasted against the Alliance s surgical precision to avoid civilian casualties To minimize losses the Alliance military leadership heavily favored carrier battle groups supporting starfighter strike crafts for fast attack style of warfare thereby leveraging a decisive advantage over the Galactic Empire s big powerful ships doctrine Anti Imperial operations emphasized depredation and delayed actions covertly relocating compromised bases to another secured system interdiction in slowing down the Imperials momentum and inflicting maximum damage on the enemy without in principle becoming decisively engaged br br br Alliance Starfighter Corps br The Alliance finds its strength almost entirely in the starfighter arena offering some of the most effective and versatile small strike craft within Star Wars canon The Alliance was plagued by lack of resources it was low on fighters manpower real estate Jan Dodonna believed unsupported hyperspace capable starfighters could undermine the Empire s control of space and demonstrated this to the galaxy by winning high profile victories Star Destroyers shipyards local fleets and the Death Star Despite the Corps high maintenance costs and being chronically understaffed with starfighter logistics aerospace engineers and veteran pilots being limited in numbers the Alliance doctrine raiding targets before they could mount a defense then leaving proved flawless in singling out vulnerable targets and attacking only when they had strength and only when the results were spectacular Seventy percent of sorties were reconnaissance missions finding targets for starfighter raids became the top priority of Alliance intelligence The introduction of the A wing B wing and X wing along with the former Imperial officers who piloted them only improved upon that advantage br br Gold Squadron commanded by Jon Vander was an BTL A Y wing light bomber squadron that served as part of the Rebel Alliance s elite starfighter corps during the Galactic Civil War This unit was instrumental in escorting Senator Mon Mothma safely to Dantooine participated in the Battle of Scarif and was nearly wiped out by Darth Vader in the Battle of Yavin Under the command of Lando Calrissian it succeeded in destroying the second Death Star s reactor during the Battle of Endor br Green Squadron commanded by Arvel Crynyd was a RZ A wing interceptor squadron that served as part of the Rebel Alliance s starfighter corps during the Galactic Civil War The squadron most notably participated in the Alliance s most decisive campaigns including the Battle of Atollon the Battle of Scarif and the Battle of Endor It was Arvel Cyrnyd who crashed his A wing into the bridge of the Executor thereby disabling the ship br Red Squadron commanded by Garven Dreis was a T B X wing starfighter squadron that served as part of the Rebel Alliance s starfighter corps during the Galactic Civil War The squadron most notably participated in the Alliance s most decisive campaigns including the Battle of Scarif the Battle of Vrogas Vas the Battle of Hoth and the Battle of Endor br Blue Squadron commanded by Antoc Merrick was an airspeeder and starfighter squadron that served as part of the Rebel Alliance s elite starfighter corps during the Galactic Civil War The squadron most notably participated in the Alliance s most decisive campaigns including the Battle of Scarif the Siege on Tureen VII the Battle of Hoth and the Battle of Endor br Rogue Squadron commanded by Wedge Antilles was a starfighter squadron in the Star Wars franchise The squadron appears in The Empire Strikes Back as Rogue Group In the film Rogue One Rebel fighters on a suicide mission to steal the plans for the Death Star which causes the Battle of Scarif self identify as Rogue One a possible precursor to Rogue Squadron br br br Galactic Civil War br br The fall of the Old Republic and the birth of the Empire as depicted in Revenge of the Sith marked the beginning of the bloody Galactic Civil War br br br Decisive losses and victories br The Rebels episode Zero Hour demonstrates the Imperials absolute naval supremacy when they successfully entrapped the Phoenix Fleet during the Battle of Atollon and forced them in engaging on equal footing resulting a decisive victory for the Imperials and the total decimation of the Rebel fleet br During the events of Rogue One and A New Hope the Alliance learns of the construction of the Death Star an enormous superweapon capable of obliterating entire planets intended to cement the Empire s rule of terror Intelligence gathered reveals that a Death Star engineer antipathetic to the causes of the Empire had intentionally included a design flaw that if exploited could bring down the entire station With the help of the Rogue One squad led by Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor a Rebel assault on an Imperial facility on the heavily defended planet Scarif successfully manages to capture schematics of the Death Star The Battle of Scarif was the first major engagement against the Empire and ended in a pyrrhic victory all members of Rogue One are killed in action and the Rebel fleet was decimated br After successfully capturing the Death Star plans Alderaanian soldiers aboard a Mon Calamari flagship barely manage to escape the st Legion and Death Squadron with the stolen data plans Right after the battle the Tantive IV an Alderaanian corvette carrying Princess Leia Organa is captured by Vader s flagship Imperial I class Star Destroyer Devastator while attempting to deliver the plans to Bail Organa on Alderaan All members of the Alderaanian Consular Security onboard are either killed or taken prisoner and Princess Leia Organa is held hostage for a time by Darth Vader In order to punish both her and her home planet government s central involvement in the Rebel Alliance Leia is forced to witness Alderaan s destruction by the Death Star The Princess is subsequently rescued by Luke Skywalker Han Solo Chewbacca and Obi Wan Kenobi who then deliver the station schematics to the Alliance Subsequent analysis of the schematics reveals the critical vulnerability to be an exhaust port leading directly to the station s reactor core br The Empire discovers the location of the primary Alliance headquarters on a moon of the planet Yavin through a tracking device covertly planted on Han Solo s vessel and deploys the Death Star to destroy the base and crush the insurgency once and for all During the ensuing battle of Yavin Rebel starfighter squadrons lead an assault on the Death Star in a last ditch attempt to exploit the vulnerability before it could fire upon the Rebel base Despite fighters sustaining heavy losses one pilot the Force sensitive Luke Skywalker successfully guides torpedoes down the exhaust port The Death Star is obliterated in a catastrophic explosion and the battle ends in a decisive Rebel victory br In the Star Wars comics the Rebellion wins numerous victories against the Empire after the destruction of the Death Star destroying its major weapons factory on Cymoon breaking an Imperial blockade around the Rebel world of Tureen VII by stealing the Imperial I class Star Destroyer Harbinger and recruiting the Mon Calamari trading fleet to be refitted as an assault fleet Such firepower would finally allow the Alliance to attack the Empire on a larger scale However one of the Rebellion s allies Queen Trios of Shu Torun whose world s technology had been fitted into the ships of the new Rebel fleet revealed herself as an undercover Imperial agent sent by Darth Vader to sabotage their efforts With their ships unexpectedly paralyzed by the Shu Torun technology the gathered Rebel fleet could do little as they were targeted for destruction by Vader s Imperial fleet Half the Rebel ships were destroyed in the battle before Leia found a way around the sabotage and allowed the remaining ships to escape However Generals Jan Dodonna and Davits Draven as well as several other high ranking Rebel officers were killed during the battle and the remaining Rebel ships were separated in their flight Mon Mothma instructed all Rebel cells to regroup in time while striking out at the Empire when and how they could Not until the Battle of Endor would the whole force of the Rebellion be once again united in a single place br In The Empire Strikes Back the Alliance suffers a crushing defeat on Hoth when one of their main command centers Echo Base is overrun by the Darth Vader s elite personal Imperial armed forces the Death Squadron and the st Legion The remaining forces of the Rebellion are forced to stay mobile using Admiral Ackbar s flagship Home One as their headquarters br By Return of the Jedi the Alliance has regrouped and learned that a second more powerful Death Star is being constructed and will be completed under Emperor Palpatine s personal supervision Mon Mothma has Admiral Ackbar and Lando Calrissian command the Alliance fleet and dispatches Han Solo and Princess Leia in leading Alliance s elite special forces to disable the station s defenses while Luke distracts Darth Vader The Alliance subsequently wins the Battle of Endor in which Emperor Palpatine Darth Vader the Death Squadron Imperial armada and much of the Imperial hierarchy are killed in action The loss of the second Death Star and other invaluable Imperial naval assets along with the deaths of Imperial leaders aboard marked the beginning of the end of Imperial rule over the galaxy br br br Successor br br Following their victory at the Battle of Endor a provisional New Republic was officially formed by Alliance members This combined with the Imperial power vacuum political infighting and Operation Cinder Palpatine s scorched earth contingency plan encouraged thousands of inhabited planets to either declare independence from the collapsing Empire or defect to the Alliance br The New Republic found itself with no shortage of recruits and resources the declining popularity of the Empire pushed many long time Imperial loyalists to the Rebel cause including those of Inferno Squadron who after Operation Cinder which saw the destruction of countless Imperial worlds opened the eyes of many to the atrocities of the Empire Even the most dedicated Imperials such as Inferno Squadron commander Iden Versio were moved to defect after the witnessing the destruction of her homeworld Vardos Finally realizing the Empire s propaganda had deceived them many Imperials began to feel shame over their actions in particular over the destruction of Alderaan br Despite fact that the New Republic was now winning the war had a lot more resources than before and a lot more recruits the New Republic was suffering from logistic nightmares The decentralized structure that served them well became a liability described as a ragtag force strategically ill fed and cobbled together of incompatible ships and squadrons The Alliance fleet shifted military doctrine the guerrilla warfare aspect of the grand strategy was de emphasized and conventional forces took over the primary prosecution of the war Once the New Republic became powerful enough the Alliance fleet was reorganized into the New Republic Military charged with the defense of the New Republic br About a year after the Battle of Endor the Rebellion defeated Imperial forces during the Battle of Jakku formally established the New Republic government and suspends offensive operations Thus the Galactic Civil War came to a close Three decades later by the time of The Force Awakens the New Republic backed the Resistance army a successor of the Alliance to stand against the First Order a new military power formed by hardline remnants from the Empire br br br Legends br br After Disney s acquisition of the franchise Lucasfilm announced in that previous works outside the theatrical films and The Clone Wars would no longer be considered canon but began to be republished under the Legends banner br br According to Star Wars The Roleplaying Game the Cantham House Meetings of Coruscant including the participation of Senators Mon Mothma and Bail Organa take place with the purpose of discussing the formation of a Galactic Alliance in opposition to Palpatine s Galactic Empire In addition the RPG tells that although throughout the galaxy many sectors are already fighting against Imperial interests resistance is relatively quiet until the incident on the planet Ghorman which takes place years before the Battle of Yavin The incident begins when an Imperial military cruiser commanded by Captain Wilhuff Tarkin is blocked by peaceful anti Empire protesters who refuse to move off the ship s landing pad With implied permission from the Emperor Tarkin lands the ship anyway injuring and killing many an incident that history would record as the Ghorman Massacre The myriad of civilizations which are fighting the Empire continue to grow in number and progressively coalesce into a ragtag organization known as the Resistance They intend upon removing the evil Emperor but the growing ruthlessness of the Imperial state forces them into secrecy as they are initially unable to undermine the Empire s regime The RPG tells that part of the strategy of the Rebel Alliance is the Doctrine of Space Denial wherein the Rebellion would attack Imperial shipping frigates in hit and run raids both to disrupt Imperial supplies and operations and also to loot desperately needed materials These Rebel starfighters were equipped with hyperdrive capability along prearranged routes which would allow this kind of harassment and escape before the Empire may react br The video game The Force Unleashed presents a differing view of the Alliance s beginnings hinting that the Emperor actually secretly pushed for its formation Palpatine clandestinely bids for the creation of another opposing force intent on starting yet another war in order to consolidate his power with the fledgling Empire just as he had done earlier with the Confederacy of Independent Systems The Emperor orders his apprentice Darth Vader to use his own secret apprentice Galen Marek called Starkiller as a pawn to gather together the Empire s enemies manipulating him into believing that the intention is to start a rebellion Vader quickly realizes that this is obviously a ploy by Palpatine in order to lure any significant rebels into a trap however it is unclear whether Vader or the Emperor had intended for the Rebellion to survive At the supposedly secret meeting known as the Corellian Treaty Mon Mothma Bail Organa Garm Bel Iblis Jedi General Rahm Kota and others meet to formally create the Rebellion against the Empire However the proceedings are ambushed by Vader under orders from the Emperor whom had actually secretly orchestrated the Treaty himself in order to gather all the Rebel leaders together and eliminate them Starkiller now aligned with the Rebellion after two betrayals by his former master manages to save the principal founders from the Empire though at the cost of his own life Regrouping on Kashyyyk the Senators formally proclaim an open Declaration of Rebellion which states the grievances of the Empire against the Alliance to Restore the Republic and concludes with an open threat to depose the Emperor This marks the formal founding of the Rebel Alliance and Galen Marek s family crest is chosen by Leia as its official symbol Thus the Rebel Alliance is effectively founded by Darth Vader himself and by extension Emperor Palpatine though it is clear neither had imagined that the Alliance would actually ever become a serious threat The Galactic Civil War consequently ensues during which the Rebellion confronts the Empire many times throughout the galaxy br Empire at War depicts various allies contributing secretly to the Alliance slowly making the united Rebel Force more powerful The most notable equipment contributions include the defection of the Incom Corporation staff and all relevant material involved in the development of an advanced spacefighter the X wing br A Declaration
