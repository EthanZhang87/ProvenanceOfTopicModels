id: 50801
The X wing starfighter is a name applied to a family of fictional spacecraft manufactured by the Incom Corporation and later the Incom FreiTek Corporation from the Star Wars franchise Named for the distinctive shape made when its s foils wings are in attack position the X wing was a class of starfighter used by the Rebel Alliance in their conflict with the Galactic Empire It made its theatrical debut as the T B model in Star Wars as the spacecraft piloted by Luke Skywalker and the Red Squadron when Luke destroyed the Death Star The starfighter featured extensively in the Star Wars original trilogy and in the Expanded Universe that followed and has been merchandised as a variety of toys and models br Starting with The Force Awakens a new model of X wing was introduced which has gone on to play a prominent role in the Star Wars sequel trilogy The T X wing flown by the Resistance in their fight against the First Order is depicted as the successor to the T Although described as being an improvement over the original in the expanded literature this new X wing is itself considered outdated having been replaced by the T X wing in the New Republic s defense fleet The T X wing made its first appearance in the TV series Star Wars Resistance br br br Origin and design br Colin Cantwell sketched and built models that eventually became the final X wing fighter in Star Wars The X wings were designed to appear more traditional than the Empire s TIE fighters ILM built miniatures in various scales with wing markings indicating which prop represented which pilot When ILM fell behind on generating X wing footage Star Wars creator director George Lucas and his editors temporarily used World War II dogfight footage for initial editing cuts Each X wing model was built around a hollow core made from surgical tubing which allowed lighting cooling and electrical connectors for the wing motors to be installed and maintained The cockpit windows were made from faceted glass so that accurate reflections could be filmed Although the movie s initial script and novelization describe the X wings as belonging to Blue squadron limitations in bluescreen photography led to the markings on the filming models as well as the fictional squadron affiliation being changed to red br In addition to miniatures special effects expert John Stears and his crew made a single full size X wing for scenes in the Rebels Yavin base hangar combined with cardboard cutouts and careful editing the Rebels appear to have dozens of fighters The production crew also made a full size X wing cockpit that was used for all actors the astromech droid visible behind each actor was changed for each starfighter Background noise pitch and tone also varied between X wings to further differentiate the characters piloting them br The lake in which Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill crashes his X wing in The Empire Strikes Back was only feet m deep requiring the creation of a rig resembling the starfighter sitting in the lake at an angle The rig was built in hinged sections so it could be manipulated by frogmen to sink or rise a key feature for the scene when Luke fails to levitate his ship from the water br In ILM visual effects specialist John Knoll created a proof of concept test of dogfighting X wings and TIE fighters to demonstrate the feasibility of using commercially available desktop computer software for simple animation work This resulted in numerous parts of space battle scenes being re shot as digital animations for the original trilogy s Special Edition releases The ARC starfighter seen in Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith is the ancestor of the X wing and is deliberately reminiscent of the X wing s design br br br Depiction br br The T B X wing was produced by the Incom Corporation which had previously supplied the ARC and Z Headhunter starfighters to the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars When the Galactic Empire ordered them to produce a new starfighter for the Imperial Navy Incom engineers took inspiration from their previous work to create the X wing Production was already underway however when politicking resulted in the Empire choosing instead to go with Sienar Fleet Systems TIE fighter Faced with an overproduction of expensive starfighters a new market was found when agents of the Rebel Alliance contacted Incom about acquiring their stock of X wings to which Incom eagerly agreed The X wing quickly became a symbol of the Rebellion thanks to its use in several spectacular victories and the role it played in ultimately defeating the Empire After the defeat of the Empire the X wing starfighters became a staple of the New Republic fleet and later the Resistance with Incom FreiTek supplying upgraded T and T models br Compared to the TIE fighter the X wing is said to be slower and less maneuverable in space but boasts superior firepower defenses atmospheric maneuverability and a supraluminal hyperdrive Its four laser canons can be fired singly in pairs or all at once and each launcher can carry up to three proton torpedoes In addition to deflector shields the X wing possesses a titanium alloy armored hull electronic countermeasures and armored cockpit An inertial dampener protects the pilot from high g maneuvers while an anti gravity repulsorlift provides for flight in planetary atmospheres br The T B X wing s distinctive strike foils or S foils are opened and closed by powerful servo motors in the spacecraft When in the open or attack position they provided a greater range of fire to the laser cannons mounted on the end of each wing They also serve to distribute energy to enlarge the deflector shield shed waste heat and function as stabilizer surfaces during air travel br Instead of a dedicated navigational system the X wing makes use of an astromech droid such as R D which fits in a socket behind the cockpit The droid can hold up to hyperspace coordinates make minor repairs to the craft and assume full control of the X wing if needed As with the pilot s ejection seat an explosive charge can eject the droid from the X wing in an emergency br br br In Legends br According to roleplaying and other literature prior to Disney s acquisition of Lucasfilm the origin of the X wing is somewhat different compared to later material Incom Corporation had already begun designing the X wing when the Empire s Imperial Security Bureau began to suspect the company of Rebel sympathies Before the empire could seize control of the company the designers defected to the Rebel Alliance and handed over the X wing s schematics br The Rebel Alliance adopted the military strategy of Doctrine of Space Denial wherein the Rebellion would raid Imperial boneyards and shipping frigates both to disrupt Imperial logistics and operations and also to requisition desperately needed materials X wing hyperdrive capabilities allowed for this kind of harassment and escape before the Empire could react The presence of a hyperdrive and deflector shields differentiate the X wing from the Empire s TIE fighters emphasizing the importance the Rebels place on pilots surviving their missions br Novels and roleplaying material set after Return of the Jedi showed the X wing continued to be refined and upgraded in service to the New Republic the XJ series X wings depicted in the war against the Yuuzhan Vong have a third proton torpedo launcher stronger lasers and improved engines br br br Merchandise and licensing br Kenner Toys produced an X wing toy as a complement to its action figure line in this model was made from formed plastic and had a battery operated light and buzzer in the forward fuselage The s foils were activated by depressing the molded astromech droid In a battle damaged version was released using the same mold but with damage stickers a grey fuselage blackened engine inlets and a darker canopy In countries outside the U S the electronics were removed and the R D button was chrome apart from the U S the electronic X wing was only available in Brazil Canada and France Kenner also produced a die cast miniature X wing in and a smaller scaled version with battle damage crash feature for the short lived Micro Collection line in br The X wing appeared in four Micro Machines three packs including the first Star Wars pack released a bronzed version and a pack of three battle damaged X wings with different colored markings The Micro Machines X wing has also been released in two single packs as a promotional souvenir with German video releases in a nine pack of Original Trilogy vehicles and once in clear plastic The X wing appears eight times in the Micro Machines Action Fleet toy line Luke s starfighter on its own with targeter stand with Dagobah swamp damage and in a double pack with a TIE Fighter Wedge s starfighter on its own and as a component of the Yavin Rebel Base playset a toy based on the prototype packaged with Biggs Darklighter s starfighter and Jek Porkins starfighter br Lego also released numerous X wing models including a piece miniature X wing TIE advanced kit a piece X wing a piece X wing kit with Yoda s Hut a piece X Wing a piece X wing a piece X wing and a piece Luke Skywalker s X wing Fighter A piece Ultimate Collector s model was released in A new Ultimate Collector s model with pieces was released in In the Lego Group s annual Christmas gift to employees was a piece Christmas X wing which also included Yoda s igloo and a sleigh In addition to the original T X wing Lego has released several models of the newer T X wing These include the black orange Poe s X wing Fighter the gray blue Resistance X wing Fighter and orange white Poe Dameron s X wing Fighter as well as several small mini scale versions br X wings also appear in numerous Star Wars games and Expanded Universe stories The player pilots an X wing in the Atari Star Wars game It is also a playable ship in numerous LucasArts games and is the eponymous vessel in the first of several space combat simulator games Both the Rebel Assault and Rebel Assault II rail shooters include X wing levels and X wing squadrons are controllable units in the Rebellion and Empire at War strategy games Decipher and Wizards of the Coast published X wing and X wing related cards for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game and Star Wars Trading Card Game respectively Michael A Stackpole and Aaron Allston wrote the X wing novel series that focuses on the X wing pilots of Rogue Squadron and Wraith Squadron the former expanding the story of pilots like Wedge Antilles who appear in the films Dark Horse Comics has also published an X Wing Rogue Squadron series In Fantasy Flight Games released the Star Wars X Wing Miniatures Game featuring several pilots and variations of the ship The X wing also included in its Star Wars Armada miniatures game and Star Wars Rebellion board game br br br Cultural influence br A model of Luke Skywalker s X wing was among Star Wars related items on display at the National Air and Space Museum celebrating the franchise s twentieth anniversary An original X wing filming prop sold at auction for in July In the San Diego Tripoli Rocket Association built and launched a foot m X wing model propelled by four rockets which disintegrated seconds after liftoff A life size X wing is suspended from the ceiling at the Star Trader gift shop in Disneyland in California as well as one displayed outdoors by the Star Tours attraction at Disneyland Paris A life size X wing made from Lego blocks appeared in Times Square and a size replica is on display at the Wings Over the Rockies Air Space Museum in Denver br In a number of Star Wars starfighters had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program When tested the classic T X wing design had a drag coefficient of which is only slightly better than the coefficient of a sphere The newer T X wing flown by Poe Dameron Oscar Isaac was more aerodynamically sound with a rating of but still fell short of the F E Phantom with its drag coefficient These poor results were rationalized with the in universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel and that Star Wars fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector shields to give themselves better flight profiles br br br See
