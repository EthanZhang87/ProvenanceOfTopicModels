At various points he was imagined as a Jedi or a bounty hunter possibly with a Wookiee sidekick before being depicted as a Republic military man When Oscar Isaac was offered the role Poe was supposed to die early in the film J J Abrams the director of The Force Awakens later rewrote the script so that Poe appears in the entire film Poe Dameron was named after Abrams s assistant Morgan Dameron br br br Casting and portrayal br The Force Awakens received praise for casting women and people of color including the Guatemalan born Oscar Isaac Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that giving starring roles to a black man a white woman and a Latino is quietly history making A television spot on Univision that featured Poe was targeted at Spanish speaking viewers and included an introduction by Isaac in Spanish After an initial release of promotional character posters in November a poster featuring Isaac s Poe was released the following month br Comedic lines of Poe s in The Force Awakens like those during his interrogation by Kylo Ren were added in reshoots and some were improvised by Isaac br br br Characterization br In The Force Awakens Poe is a skilled X wing fighter pilot for the Resistance The son of Rebel Alliance fighters he is a commander in the Resistance s Starfighter Corps and one of Leia Organa s most trusted operatives who is headstrong and can fly anything Isaac described Poe as the best freaking pilot in the galaxy He s been sent on a mission by a certain princess and he ends up coming up across Finn and their fates are forever intertwined br Natalie Zutter and Chris Lough of Tor com wrote Poe is that rare creature who knows exactly what he wants to do with his life Isaac said of the character in Poe s the kind of guy you want in the trenches with you He s straightforward he s honest he s incredibly loyal and he s got some swagger to him Katy Waldman wrote for Slate This is Poe Dameron star pilot heartthrob wiseass ace leather jacket bestower Finn s OTP When he grins up at Kylo Ren all rakish charm and derring do we know the movie will be OK Comic book writer Charles Soule creator of the Marvel Comics series Star Wars Poe Dameron said of the character I think it s his charisma that really defines him for me Poe Dameron is one charming fellow We ve seen great pilots before and great warriors but his ability to lead and inspire feels pretty fresh to me as is his somewhat snappy roguishness Alex Segura author of Star Wars Poe Dameron Free Fall said of Poe I love the complexities of the character he s charming a bit of a scoundrel not afraid to bend the rules but he s also driven by loyalty and legacy and friendship He s a hero but in a world where there is absolute good and absolute evil Poe is a bit gray Addressing Poe s early life as explored in Free Fall Segura said br br Poe feels a lot of responsibility to his parents legacy mainly and that doesn t always mix well with his own youthful curiosity and desire for adventure It s the core of Poe s conflict as he leaves home and sets out on this big adventure he has to basically see everything through the prism of what his parents would want him to do and I feel like that s a really universal idea that we re often trying to square the things with the idea of what s expected of us and we eventually learn that we have to create our own set of rules while still honoring what came before br After filming The Last Jedi but before its release Isaac said in br br Poe is in some ways a surrogate son for Leia But also I think she sees in him the potential for a truly great leader of the Resistance and beyond Poe s arc is one of evolving from a heroic soldier to a seasoned leader to see beyond the single mindedness of winning the battle to the larger picture of the future of the galaxy Leia with tough love wants to push Poe to be more than the badass pilot to temper his heroic impulses with wisdom and clarity br br br Appearances br br br

Poe gives the stormtrooper the name Finn Their ship is hit with missiles and crashes on Jakku Finn is ejected from the ship and presumes that Poe is dead when the destroyed craft sinks into the sand Poe later reappears leading an X wing squadron in an assault on the First Order Near the end of the film he leads an attack on Starkiller Base personally firing the shots that cause the superweapon to explode The novelization of The Force Awakens explains that Poe was thrown from the TIE fighter over Jakku and survived After encountering the Blarina scavenger Naka he helped him escape from a group

called a flat storyline He created the character Rose to challenge and contrast with Finn and made her his companion instead br br br The Rise of Skywalker br The Rise of Skywalker is set one year

Isaac is a primary asset as Poe Dameron Like Ford s Han Solo in the original three he s the guy you want on your team the one who doesn t take any guff Robbie Collin of The Telegraph called Poe a dashing dry humoured swashbuckler in short he s like Han Solo was years ago Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter described the hotshot pilot as a man very much in the Solo mold and Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that Poe suggests a next generation Han Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times noted that Isaac has more than a bit of Han Solo swagger and Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said that Isaac brings just the right amount of cocksure street smarts to his role Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone wrote that Poe s loose jazzy dialogue was the first highly welcome clue that these new films would be more human in tone than George Lucas prequels The Telegraph also listed Poe s scenes as one of their things Star Wars fans will love about The Force Awakens writing that they spark and fizz with energy and that while Han Solo will always hold the number one spot Oscar Isaac s Poe Dameron is definitely a serious contender for the title of Second Coolest Man in the Galaxy Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Isaac oozes flyboy charm Alex Brown of Tor com called Poe the greatest addition to Star Wars canon since Mara Jade a popular character from the Star Wars expanded universe Some critics believed that the revelation in The Rise of Skywalker that Poe spent time as a spice smuggler in his youth did not fit with what audiences already knew about the character from his film television novel and comics appearances br Both Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair and Scott Mendelson of Forbes noted the chemistry between Poe and Finn John Boyega with Brian Truitt of USA Today calling the relationship a bromance Their scenes in the film and Isaac s own comments during an interview with Ellen DeGeneres have sparked fan and journalistic speculation that Poe could be gay or be developed as such in future films Several media outlets reported the wave of fan fiction and fan art created by fan shippers or those with a desire to see Poe and Finn in a romantic relationship Commenting on Isaac s camaraderie with his The Force Awakens cast members Robinson wrote that the most important bond Isaac established was with John Boyega Theirs is a flirtation that launched a thousand pieces of fan fiction Despite fan support and Isaac s push for a romantic relationship between the characters such a direction was not pursued in The Rise of Skywalker Film editor Maryann Brandon who worked on both The Force Awakens and The Rise of Skywalker said she did not see a romance develop between the two characters in the footage for the films noting that she was not reading as much into it as an audience Brandon described the characters as the best of friends There is a kind of brotherhood there where they understand each other and they ve got each other s back br br br
