id: 20609646
Wookiees are fictional humanoid aliens in the Star Wars universe native to the forest planet Kashyyyk They are distinguished from humans by their gigantism hirsutism and physical strength The most prominent Wookiee in the films is Chewbacca the co pilot of the Millennium Falcon and best friend to Han Solo br br br Inspiration br According to an interview with creator George Lucas the inspiration for the Wookiee was Lucas s dog Indiana whose name is used in Lucas s Indiana Jones movies He was the prototype for the Wookiee He always sat beside me in the car He was big a big bear of a dog The species name was inspired when during the climactic chase scene in THX one of the robotic cops voiced by actor Terry McGovern improvises I think I ran over a Wookiee back there and thus the word was born Wookey was the surname of a friend Ralph Wookey and McGovern thought it would be a funny in joke to include his friend s name in the soundtrack for THX br In one episode of Animal Planet s series Animal Icons focusing on the creation of Star Wars figures it was revealed that the Wookiees were also based on orangutans and lemurs which are long haired creatures that live in a hot forest climate The net effect in terms of the Wookiees appearance is a marked resemblance to descriptions of the legendary Sasquatch of the Pacific Northwest br br br Depiction br br br Physical characteristics br In the Star Wars universe adult Wookiees are typically taller than most humans averaging meters feet inches They also possess enormous strength Han Solo states that a Wookiee can pull a man s arms out of his sockets if angered Wookiees have a keen sense of smell are fully covered with a thick coat of hair though some can be susceptible to balding have good hand eye coordination and are shown to be excellent marksmen Wookiees have been shown in many diverse environments such as those of Hoth Tatooine and Endor never wearing any protective clothing or showing any signs of discomfort Wookiees have a life span of several hundred years Chewbacca is years old during the original trilogy and is still in his prime Chewie has also appeared twenty years before at the end of the prequel trilogy and thirty years later in the sequel trilogy yet his appearance does not significantly change across this fifty year time span br br br Culture br The Wookiees of Lucas s fictional universe are usually depicted as devoted loyal friends and very distrustful of strangers br Despite a fearsome appearance and temperamental disposition Wookiees are very intelligent and are very adept at handling advanced technology Chewbacca is co pilot of and performs maintenance on the Millennium Falcon and also possesses a working knowledge of robotics managing to haphazardly reassemble C PO after he was destroyed by Imperial stormtroopers in The Empire Strikes Back Wookiees are fast learners Chewbacca commandeers an Imperial AT ST during the Battle of Endor and is shown effectively maneuvering the vehicle and operating its weapons systems He also fought during the Clone Wars alongside Jedi Grand Master Yoda Chewbacca is also shown to be an adept strategist at holo chess leading to his surprise when R D outmaneuvered him in a game br Wookiee cities on their home planet Kashyyyk as seen in Revenge of the Sith are built atop giant forest trees Their society contains a mixture of traditional almost primitive appearing woodwork and decorations intermixed with starships and energy generators br Due to their heavy coats of long fur Wookiees do not generally wear clothes though for practical purposes they will wear toolbelts etc Matching the anachronistic appearance of their cities a Wookiee such as Chewbacca resembles a primitive humanoid bear wearing only a bandolier containing energy cartridges for his blaster br Wookiees greatly value morality courage compassion and loyalty A sacred and ancient Wookiee tradition is that of the honor family An honor family is composed of a Wookiee s closest friends and companions These family members pledge a commitment to lay down their lives for one another as well as members of any honor families these individuals may have Like the similarly sacred Wookiee life debt Wookiees are willing to extend this tradition to members outside their species Chewbacca considered Han Solo Leia Organa Solo their children and Luke Skywalker part of his honor family In the Solo film Han says that the Wookiee words for tribe friends and family are so similar he has trouble distinguishing them Wookiees themselves don t recognize a significant difference between the two br Wookiees have an understanding of Star Wars universe warfare and fought alongside Republic forces during the Clone Wars Wookiees were betrayed and enslaved shortly after that conflict as well as on certain occasions during the war by the Separatist Alliance br Some Wookiees are shown to be sensitive to the Force A young Wookiee named Gungi who appeared in Star Wars The Clone Wars was a Jedi youngling br br br Language br The most common Wookiee language is Shyriiwook However other dialects used by Wookiees from Kashyyyk are Thykarann and Xaczik Wookiees are capable of understanding Galactic Basic but generally none are able to speak it because of the structure of Wookiee vocal cords In the original Star Wars trilogy it seems that Chewbacca can understand humans His human partner Han Solo also shows knowledge of Shyriiwook or can at least understand Chewbacca in Solo it is shown that Han does indeed have the ability to speak Shyriiwook at a rudimentary level In the Star Wars expanded universe novels Chewbacca builds a miniature translator droid Em Teedee for his nephew Lowbacca when he later begins training as a Jedi to facilitate communications with his fellow students br br br Weapons br In the Star Wars films Chewbacca carries a bowcaster the traditional weapon developed and used by Wookiees Bowcasters launch quarrels crossbow bolts that through magnetic propulsion appear as elongated blaster bolts due to their velocity The propulsion technique gives the quarrels extremely high stopping power Chewbacca in particular is shown to be an excellent shot killing a Stormtrooper who was attempting to escape on a speeder bike in Return of the Jedi The spring that powers the bowcaster is extremely hard to pull back humans are generally incapable of cocking a bowcaster although Han Solo was seen to do so br br br Home planet br Kashyyyk as depicted in Star Wars media is the tropical forested home world of the Wookiees br In the original scripts for Return of the Jedi the second Death Star was to be built in orbit around Kashyyyk by Wookiee slave labor with the primitive Wookiees ultimately helping the rebels to fight off the Imperial garrison However Lucas decided that since the Wookiee Chewbacca being co pilot and mechanic on the Millennium Falcon was clearly proficient with advanced technology it would be confusing to show the Wookiees with a primitive Stone Age culture Endor and the Ewoks were created instead to serve this purpose br Lucas has also said that he originally planned Yavin the location of the rebel base in Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope to be the Wookiee home planet of Kashyyyk but subsequent rewrites changed this br br br In media br Films br Kashyyyk was first seen in the Star Wars Holiday Special as the program s frame story takes place there with the backdrop of the planet being taken directly from concept art by Ralph Mcquarrie In the Holiday Special the first mention of the planet carries the pronunciation ka ZOOK br The planet was more extensively seen in Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith in which Jedi Master Yoda goes to Kashyyyk to aid the Wookiees in their battle against the Separatist Droid Army In Revenge of the Sith the Wookiees live in the lush forests and giant jungles on the planet in villages among the giant wroshyr trees Phuket Thailand was used for main photography while the backdrops for Kashyyyk were filmed in Guilin a city in southern China which is famous for its karst formations br br Books br The planet s unique biosphere was first detailed in The Wookiee Storybook The planet was revealed to be a densely forested planet on which one can encounter vast plains and island areas suitable for large sweeping battles It was in this book that the family of Chewbacca once again appears in a situation similar to that of the Holiday Special The planet appears in several other books as well Among them are br br A Forest Apart by Troy Denning br The Han Solo Trilogy by Ann C Crispin While the reader actually visits Kashyyyk for the first time in Book Three Rebel Dawn we hear about it and meet

In the millennia before the rise of the Galactic Republic Kashyyyk was a member world of the Infinite Empire Its surface was terraformed by the Rakata resulting in the abnormally large foliage which

high The dangerous and hostile animals increase closer to the forest floor Hidden on the planet s surface is a Star Map another piece in the puzzle of the location of the Star Forge br br Czerka Corporation and slavery br When Kashyyyk was discovered by the Czerka Corporation s explorers around BBY Before the Battle of Yavin it was given the catalogue name G sometimes known as Edean Czerka conducted extensive Wookiee slaving operations on Edean as well as hunting several of its species almost to extinction br To ensure a relatively peaceful presence Czerka supported the installation of friendly chieftains into power over the native tribes and would then prop them up with mercenaries and weapons shipments In response the chieftains would train their tribe to understand Galactic Basic ostensibly to know thine enemy but in reality to make them better slaves and allow Czerka to enslave a percentage of the tribe s population Eventually Czerka was driven out by Revan and rebel Wookiees br br The Clone Wars br During the Clone Wars of to years BBY Kashyyyk fought on the side of the Galactic Republic During one such battle Yoda of the Jedi Council flew to Kashyyyk to assist in the

blockade along with Tatooine in an attempt to locate Han Solo and Chewbacca It was on a day when Chewbacca was returning home to his family to celebrate the sacred Wookiee holiday of Life Day that the Empire raided Chewie s home They did not find him br Darth Vader also discovered his secret apprentice Galen Marek while raiding Kashyyyk in The Force Unleashed br On another such occasion the Rebel

ultimately stopped by the Empire Han Solo then fled in the Millennium Falcon br br The New Republic br Following the defeat of the Empire Kashyyyk joined the New Republic and its successor state the

out of their sockets when they lose Wookiees are known to do that In response C PO says I suggest a new strategy R let the Wookiee win This phrase sometimes referred to by its initialism LTWW has gained the proverbial meaning of In trivial disputes let the person who cares more have their way It can also be interpreted as advice to avoid arguments especially those with shallow motivation such as to appear more intelligent than one s opponent The phrase and the attitude it describes have been criticized as potentially justifying the enabling of an abuser br br br br br br External links br
