id: 18426653
Sheev Palpatine is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas He first appeared in the film The Empire Strikes Back as The Emperor The character is also known by his Sith name Darth Sidious which was first used in the novelization of the film The Phantom Menace br Palpatine is the main antagonist of the three film trilogies in the episodic Skywalker Saga He is portrayed by Ian McDiarmid in all five episodes in which he physically appears In the original trilogy Palpatine is the emperor of the Galactic Empire and the master of Darth Vader In the prequel trilogy which chronicles his rise from senator to emperor Palpatine orchestrates the invasion of his home planet Naboo in a plot to become Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic He then masterminds the Clone Wars to turn the Republic into the Empire Palpatine also destroys the Jedi Order and manipulates the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into becoming his apprentice Vader In The Rise of Skywalker the final film in the sequel trilogy a resurrected Palpatine is revealed to be the grandfather of Rey a Jedi in training He is also the mastermind behind Snoke whom he created to lead the First Order against the New Republic and seduce Skywalker s grandson Ben Solo into becoming Kylo Ren br The character s story was inspired by real world examples of democratic backsliding during the rise and rule of dictators such as Julius Caesar Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler Since the release of the original trilogy Palpatine has become a widely recognized symbol of evil in popular culture Since the prequel trilogy he has been a symbol of sinister deception and the subversion of democracy In addition to the films Palpatine appears in various Star Wars media including Clone Wars The Clone Wars Rebels The Bad Batch Obi Wan Kenobi and Star Wars Tales all of which take place before the original trilogy br br br Creation and development br br br Concept and writing br Lucas s conceptualization of Palpatine and the role he plays in the franchise changed over time Lucas s initial notes discuss a line of corrupt emperors not just one In the draft of Star Wars the New Galactic Empire was led by a relatively young human named Cos Dashit The name Palpatine first appears in the prologue of Alan Dean Foster s novelization of Star Wars which details the Emperor s rise to power From Return of the Jedi onwards the Emperor became the ultimate personification of evil in the series replacing his apprentice Darth Vader as the central villain Though the films of the original Star Wars trilogy do not actually state the Emperor s name the novelization of Return of the Jedi confirms his name as Palpatine The character s first name Sheev was introduced in the novel Tarkin br During the story development of The Empire Strikes Back Lucas decided that with the original having only passingly mentioned the Emperor he needed to begin to deal with him on a more concrete level Lucas realized however that the primary conflict with the Emperor would be best saved for the trilogy s third film Return of the Jedi because w hen you get rid of the Emperor the whole thing is over Discussing the character s importance to the story Lucas stated that In the end the Emperor does exactly what Obi Wan Kenobi did he can also transform himself referring to the ability to live after death through the Force Although Palpatine dies at the end of Return of the Jedi the plot point of his metamorphosis was utilized for the sequel trilogy which Lucas had no direct involvement with br br In Return of the Jedi the initial conception of Palpatine as a weak isolated figurehead was superseded by his depiction as a dictatorial ruler adept in the dark side of the Force The Emperor was inspired by the villain Ming the Merciless from the Flash Gordon comic books The characterization of Palpatine as an ambitious and ruthless politician dismantling a democratic republic to achieve supreme power was in part inspired by the real world examples of democratic backsliding during the rise and rule of Julius Caesar Napoleon Bonaparte Alberto Fujimori Ferdinand Marcos Sr and Adolf Hitler Other elements of the character come from Richard Nixon Lucas said that Nixon s presidency got me to thinking historically about how do democracies get turned into dictatorships Because the democracies aren t overthrown they re given away Lucas also said The whole point of the movies the underlying element that makes the movies work is that you whether you go backwards or forwards you start out in a democracy and democracy turns into a dictatorship and then the rebels make it back into a democracy br Lucas wanted to establish the Emperor as the true source of evil in Star Wars Screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan noted My sense of the relationship between Darth Vader and the Emperor is that the Emperor is much more powerful and that Vader is very much intimidated by him Vader has dignity but the Emperor in Jedi really has all the power He explained that the climax of the film is a confrontation between Vader and his master In the first scene that shows the Emperor he arrives at the Death Star and is greeted by a host of stormtroopers technicians and other personnel Lucas states he wanted it to look like the military parades on May Day in Russia br Lucas fleshed out the Emperor in the prequel trilogy According to Lucas Palpatine s role in The Phantom Menace is to explain how Anakin Skywalker later Vader came to be Palpatine s apprentice and the events that sparked Palpatine s rise to totalitarian power after being a senate representative The film s novelization is the first time he is called Darth Sidious His home world Naboo is also home to Anakin s romantic interest Padm Amidala who later becomes a senator of that planet br In the Lucasfilm authorized Star Wars and History Palpatine s consolidation of power is described as being similar to the first Roman emperor Augustus Both legitimized authoritarian rule by saying that corruption in the Senate was hampering the powers of the head of state both pressured the Senate to grant extraordinary powers to deal with a crisis falsely claiming that they would rescind those powers once the crisis was over and both relied on their strong control over military force br br br Portrayal br When the Emperor first appeared in The Empire Strikes Back he was portrayed by Marjorie Eaton under heavy makeup Chimpanzee eyes were superimposed into darkened eye sockets during post production The character was voiced by Clive Revill The makeup was sculpted by Phil Tippett and applied by Rick Baker who initially used his own wife Elaine for the makeup tests br With director Irvin Kershner Revill said you had to keep the reins tight you couldn t go overboard It was the perfect example of the old adage less is more the Emperor doesn t say very much But when he finally appears it s at a point in the saga when everyone s waiting to see him It s the Emperor the arch villain of all time and when he says there s a great disturbance in the Force I mean that s enough oomph Years later during production of Revenge of the Sith Lucas decided to shoot new footage for The Empire Strikes Back to create continuity between the prequels and original trilogy Thus in the DVD release of The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition the original version of the Emperor was replaced by Ian McDiarmid and the dialogue between the Emperor and Darth Vader was revised br Lucas and director Richard Marquand cast McDiarmid to play Emperor Palpatine for Return of the Jedi He was in his late s and had never played a leading role in a feature film though he had made minor appearances in films like Dragonslayer After Return of the Jedi he resumed stage acting in London In an interview with BackStage McDiarmid revealed that he never had his sights set on a film career and never auditioned for the role of Palpatine He elaborated I got called in for the interview after a Return of the Jedi casting director saw me perform in the Sam Shepard play Seduced at a studio theatre at the Royal Court I was playing a dying Howard Hughes br Palpatine s role in the prequel films required McDiarmid to portray two aspects of the same character Recalling the initial days of shooting The Phantom Menace McDiarmid stated Palpatine s an interesting character he s conventional on the outside but demonic on the inside he s on the edge trying to go beyond what s possible McDiarmid added another layer to the character in Attack of the Clones He said Palpatine is a supreme actor He has to be even more convincing than somebody who isn t behaving in a schizophrenic fashion so he s extra charming or extra professional and for those who are looking for clues that s almost where you can see them McDiarmid reflected on the scene in which Padm Amidala is almost assassinated br br There s a moment in one scene of the new film where tears almost appear in Palpatine s eye These are crocodile tears but for all those in the movie and perhaps watching the movie itself they ll see he is apparently moved and of course he is He can just do it He can as it were turn it on And I suppose for him it s also a bit of a turn on the pure exercise of power is what he s all about That s the only thing he s interested in and the only thing that can satisfy him which makes him completely fascinating to play because it is an evil soul He is more evil than the devil br In Revenge of the Sith McDiarmid plays an even darker version of the character He explained that when you re playing a character of solid blackness that in itself is very interesting in the sense that you have no other motivation other than the accumulation of power It s not so much about not having a moral center it s just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power McDiarmid asserted that everything Palpatine does is an act of pure hypocrisy br McDiarmid noticed that the script for Revenge of the Sith demanded more action from his character than in previous films Lightsaber combat was a challenge to the year old actor who like his costars took fencing lessons The close up shots and non acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid Advanced fencing and acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid s stunt doubles br In the film The Rise of Skywalker McDiarmid returned to the role of Palpatine on screen for the first time since Revenge of the Sith McDiarmid was surprised to learn of the filmmakers decision to bring back Palpatine given the character died in Return of the Jedi The film s director J J Abrams spoke of Palpatine s inclusion in the sequel trilogy when you look at this as nine chapters of a story perhaps the weirder thing would be if Palpatine didn t return You just look at what he talks about who he is how important he is what the story is strangely his absence entirely from the third trilogy would be conspicuous On Palpatine s portrayal in the film McDiarmid said he s fairly physically impaired but his mind is as sharp as ever br br br Makeup and costumes br Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine for Return of the Jedi required extensive makeup which took between two and four hours to apply Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that the Emperor looks uncannily like Death in The Seventh Seal and film historian Robin Wood compared him to the hag from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs McDiarmid remarked When my face changes in Revenge of the Sith my mind went back to the early silent movie of The Phantom of the Opera with Lon Chaney br Palpatine s wardrobe in the prequels tailored by costume designer Trisha Biggar played an important part in the development of the character In Attack of the Clones explained McDiarmid The costumes have got much more edge to them I think than the mere senator had in The Phantom Menace So we see the trappings of power McDiarmid s favorite costume in the film was a high collared jacket that resembles reptile skin He stated that it just feels reptilian which is exactly right for Palpatine Biggar explained that the character s costumes become progressively darker and more ornately decorated throughout the movie She added He wears greys and browns almost going to black taking him toward the dark side br In The Rise of Skywalker Palpatine is unable to move without the aid of a large machine to which he is attached His eyes have no pupils and his hands are rotting Costume designer Michael Kaplan opted to dress Palpatine in a utilitarian black robe which he wears for the majority of the film At the end of the film Palpatine rejuvenates himself using the Force and becomes physically mobile He dons a new costume a formal robe with red velvet which Kaplan refers to as his true Emperor s garb br br br Reception br Todd McCarthy of Variety described McDiarmid s portrayal of Palpatine in Revenge of the Sith as dominant and worth writing home about Reviewing the same film Ed Halter of The Village Voice wrote that McDiarmid s unctuous Emperor turns appropriately vampiric as he attempts to draw Anakin into the Sith fold with promises of eternal life McDiarmid was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Revenge of the Sith br According to Cory Barlog the planned but never produced Star Wars Underworld television series would have depicted Palpatine in a sympathetic way br br br Appearances br br br Film br br br Original trilogy br br The character is referred to as the Emperor in the original trilogy He is briefly mentioned in Star Wars the first film in the original trilogy which was later retitled Episode IV A New Hope On the Death Star Grand Moff Tarkin explains to his fellow Imperials that the Emperor has dissolved the Imperial Senate the last remnant of the Old Republic The Emperor does not appear on screen leaving Tarkin and Darth Vader as the film s main villains The Emperor first appears in The Empire Strikes Back the sequel to the original film He appears as a hologram to inform Vader that Luke Skywalker has become a threat to the Empire Vader persuades him that the young Jedi would be a great asset if he could be turned to the dark side of the Force br In s Return of the Jedi the Emperor appears in person to oversee the last stages of the second Death Star s construction He assures Vader that they will together turn Luke Vader s son to the dark side of the Force Unbeknownst to Vader the Emperor plans to replace him with Luke Vader meanwhile intends to overthrow the Emperor and rule the galaxy with Luke at his side When Vader brings Luke before his master the Emperor tempts Luke to join the dark side by appealing to the young Jedi s fear for his friends whom he has lured into a trap This leads to a lightsaber duel in which Luke defeats and nearly kills Vader The Emperor urges Luke to kill Vader and take his place but Luke refuses and declares himself a Jedi Enraged the Emperor attacks Luke with Force lightning Unable to bear the sight of his son in pain Vader throws the Emperor

book Star Wars The Secrets of the Sith is told from Palpatine s perspective br Palpatine appears frequently in the comic book series Darth Vader Dark Lord of the Sith written by Kieron Gillen and Charles Soule It is suggested at the end of the series that Palpatine manipulated the Force to impregnate Vader s mother Shmi Skywalker making him in essence Vader s father although this is left somewhat ambiguous This builds on the plot point of Anakin s virgin birth introduced in The Phantom Menace and the claim that a Sith lord could use the Force to influence the midi chlorians to create life as Palpatine tells Anakin in Revenge of the Sith This would seem to have incestuous implications for Rey and Ben Solo at the end of The Rise of Skywalker but Soule says that The Dark Side is not a reliable narrator and a Lucasfilm story group member who collaborated on the comic confirmed that a direct connection between Palpatine and Vader was not their intent br The character also appears
