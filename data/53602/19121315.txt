Star Wars has been expanded to media other than the original films This spin off material is licensed and moderated by Lucasfilm though during his involvement with the franchise Star Wars creator George Lucas reserved the right to both draw from and contradict it in his own works Such derivative works have been produced concurrently with between and after the original prequel and sequel trilogies as well as the spin off films and television series Commonly explored Star Wars media include books comic books and video games though other forms such as audio dramas have also been produced br With the exception of the CGI animated The Clone Wars TV series non film material produced prior to April was collectively known as the Star Wars Expanded Universe EU Lucasfilm now under Disney later rebranded the Expanded Universe as Star Wars Legends and declared it non canonical to the franchise Most works produced after April are part of the official canon as defined by Lucasfilm although a handful of Legends media has still been released after said date br br br Publication history br br br Early films and television series br The first Star Wars spinoff material was Star Wars From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker the novelization of the film Lucas later commissioned Alan Dean Foster who ghostwrote the novelization to write a sequel which resulted in Splinter of the Mind s Eye Lucas originally intended to use this as the basis for a potential low budget sequel to Star Wars but when it became one of the most successful films of all time Lucas decided to write his own story for the film sequel The Empire Strikes Back While this was in production Lucas approved the Star Wars Holiday Special with which he had limited involvement br Running from April to May the Star Wars comic book series from Marvel Comics met with such strong sales that former Marvel editor in chief Jim Shooter credited it with saving Marvel financially in and The series became one of the industry s top selling titles in and An adaptation of the third theatrical film Return of the Jedi was released as a separate four issue limited series br Two novel trilogies with original storylines were written The Han Solo Adventures by Brian Daley and s The Adventures of Lando Calrissian by L Neil Smith Daley also wrote radio dramatizations of the original trilogy which aired in and br The first Star Wars electronic game was released in by Kenner followed by a handful of Atari and Parker Brothers video games in the early s mainly adaptations of film scenes br Two spin off television films focusing on the life of the Ewoks introduced in Return of the Jedi aired in and The furry creatures were also the subject of an American Canadian animated television series produced by Nelvana which ran for two seasons between and A sister series Droids features the further adventures of R D and C PO In Marvel Comics Star Comics imprint published a bi monthly Ewoks tie in comic which ran for two years and in published an eight issue Droids series The two series featured a crossover storyline br The Star Tours ride was opened at Disney Parks in to commemorate the saga s th anniversary br br br The Dark Times br Following the series th anniversary the release of Star Wars spin off media was largely halted In the fan newsletter Bantha Tracks was absorbed by the official Lucasfilm magazine which focused on the company s projects outside of Star Wars Some fans feared that the franchise had come to an end and the period between and has been called the Dark Times br There were some bright spots in this era however In West End Games began publishing Star Wars The Roleplaying Game and the subsequent ancillary role playing game material such as sourcebooks gamebooks and adventure modules These have been called the first publications to expand greatly beyond what was known from the vintage era of the movies and would serve as a resource for a number of franchise novelists br br br Thrawn novels and Dark Empire comics br The lack of new Star Wars material ended with the release of Timothy Zahn s novel Heir to the Empire Heir to the Empire which reached on The New York Times Best Seller list began what would become a large collection of works set before between and especially after the original films StarWars com wrote in that the novel jumpstarted a publishing program that endures to this day and formalized the Expanded Universe It introduced among others the popular characters Grand Admiral Thrawn and Mara Jade and was followed by the sequels Dark Force Rising and The Last Command The Thrawn trilogy is widely credited with revitalizing the Star Wars franchise In The Secret History of Star Wars Michael Kaminski suggests this renewed interest was a factor in Lucas s decision to create the prequel trilogy br Around this same time the comics license was transferred to Dark Horse Comics who launched a number of series set after the original film trilogy including the popular Dark Empire sequence by Tom Veitch and Cam Kennedy The comic launched months after the first Thrawn novel and was a sequel to those novels it notably resurrected the film characters Emperor Palpatine and Boba Fett Zahn was critical of the concept of resurrecting Emperor Palpatine through cloned bodies feeling it undermined and contradicted the meaning of the ending of Return of the Jedi br The Jedi Prince series of young reader novels released between and depicts Luke Leia and Han about a year after Return of the Jedi The Truce at Bakura depicts the immediate aftermath of the aforementioned film In Dark Horse published Tales of the Jedi expanding the fictional universe to the time of the Old Republic approximately years before the films Later the series spawned the Knights of the Old Republic computer roleplaying games which led to many new productions set during the Old Republic era such as the Bane Trilogy and the Knights of the Old Republic comic line br In Lucas Licensing s Allan Kausch and Sue Rostoni discussed the relationship between Lucas creations and the derivative works by other authors br br Gospel or canon as we refer to it includes the screenplays the films the radio dramas and the novelizations These works spin out of George Lucas original stories the rest are written by other writers However between us we ve read everything and much of it is taken into account in the overall continuity The entire catalog of published works comprises a vast history with many off shoots variations and tangents like any other well developed mythology br br br Special Editions and Shadows of the Empire br The Steve Perry novel Shadows of the Empire set in the as yet unexplored time period between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi was part of a multimedia campaign that also included a comic book series and video game The multimedia project was largely meant to reinvigorate the franchise ahead of the prequel trilogy along with Lucas s Special Editions of the original trilogy Lucas incorporated elements of the Expanded Universe into the Special Editions for example Coruscant the New Republic capital planet created by Zahn in the Thrawn trilogy made its film debut in the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi before being featured more heavily in the prequel trilogy An eponymous comic book series later subtitled Republic launched in and introduced Ki Adi Mundi ahead of his appearance in the films br In Star Wars book publishing moved from Bantam Spectra to Del Rey Books A new series set between and years after the original films The New Jedi Order was written by multiple authors and introduced a new threat the Yuuzhan Vong a powerful alien race attempting to invade and conquer the entire galaxy The first novel in the series R A Salvatore s Vector Prime killed off popular character Chewbacca br br br Prequel film trilogy and The Clone Wars br Before the bulk of Expanded Universe storytelling explored the time periods either after Return of the Jedi or long before A New Hope e g the Tales of the Jedi series The time period shortly before the original trilogy including the rise of the Galactic Empire and the personal histories of Anakin Skywalker and Emperor Palpatine was left open for Lucas to develop in the form of a prequel trilogy which began with Episode I The Phantom Menace br The character Aayla Secura introduced in in the Republic comic book series appears in Episode II Attack of the Clones The animated series Clone Wars and various spin off books comics and video games explore the titular conflict in more detail leading up to Episode III Revenge of the Sith Ahead of the film s release Lucas announced a D continuation of Clone Wars which was released as the animated film The Clone Wars and a television series of the same name These reveal that Anakin had a Padawan learner Ahsoka Tano during this period Various characters seen only briefly in the films or in other spin off material are featured in more depth At this time Lucas denied any plans to ever make a Star Wars sequel trilogy br As of over Star Wars titles had been published including novels comics non fiction and magazines Then president of Lucas Licensing Howard Roffman estimated that there were more than million Star Wars books in print He said The books are a way of extending the fantasy of Star Wars The movies have had a really profound effect on a couple of generations Star Wars has become a cultural touchpoint and our fans are avidly interested in exploring more stories br br br Holocron database and canonicity br br Originally Lucasfilm tracked the narrative content of the Expanded Universe in story bibles alongside official reference books such as A Guide to the Star Wars Universe and the Star Wars Encyclopedia In LucasArts lead tester Leland Chee was hired as Continuity Database Administrator for Lucas Licensing and developed a database of franchise continuity based in part on s encyclopedic Star Wars Behind the Magic CD ROM The database came to be known as the Holocron a term used within the Star Wars universe for ancient repositories of knowledge and wisdom The Holocron consists of over entries for franchise characters locations species and vehicles br Lucas Licensing s managing editor Sue Rostoni said in Our goal is to present a continuous and unified history of the Star Wars galaxy insofar as that history does not conflict with or undermine the meaning of Mr Lucas s Star Wars saga of films and screenplays Lucasfilm s director of fan relations Steve Sansweet clarified br br When it comes to absolute canon the real story of Star Wars you must turn to the films themselves and only the films Even novelizations are interpretations of the film and while they are largely true to George Lucas vision he works quite closely with the novel authors the method in which they are written does allow for some minor differences The further one branches away from the movies the more interpretation and speculation come into play LucasBooks works diligently to keep the continuing Star Wars expanded universe cohesive and uniform but stylistically there is always room for variation br In August Lucas said of the Expanded Universe br br I haven t read any of the novels I don t know anything about that world But I do try to keep it consistent if I come up with a name or something else I look it up and see if it has already been used When I said other people could make their own Star Wars stories we decided that we would have two universes My universe and then this other one They try to make their universe as consistent with mine as possible but obviously they get enthusiastic and want to go off in other directions br Regarding the Holocron database in Chee said What sets Star Wars apart from other franchises is that we develop a singular continuity across all forms of media whether it be the films TV series video games novels and comics and the Holocron is a key component to Lucasfilm being able to do this The Holocron was divided into five levels of canon in order of precedence br br G canon was George Lucas canon Episodes I VI the released films at that time overrode the lower levels of canonicity even when referring to elements introduced in other media In the words of Leland Chee George s view of the universe is his view He s not beholden to what s gone before br T canon was Television canon The canonicity level comprising The Clone Wars which Lucas co created br C canon was Continuity canon Most of the material from the Expanded Universe including books comics and video games The creation of stories that introduced radical changes in the continuity like The Force Unleashed video game which introduced Darth Vader s secret apprentice Starkiller required Lucas s approval and he spent hours explaining the character relationships to the developers br S canon was Secondary canon Any element introduced in Continuity canon that was contradicted by other material The Holiday Special is an example except for elements referenced in higher levels of canon br D canon was Detours canon Elements of the unreleased show Detours though primarily intended as a parody of the franchise were to follow a serial storyline that existed in a low level of canonicity br N canon was Non canon What if stories such as the first issues of the Star Wars Tales comic anthology crossover appearances such as Star Wars character appearances in Soulcalibur IV game statistics and anything else directly contradicted by higher levels of canon br br br Disney acquisition and canon restructuring br br In October the Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm for US billion equivalent to about B in Subsequently Lucasfilm formed the Lucasfilm Story Group which was established to keep track of and define the canon and unify the films comics and other media Among its members are Chee Kiri Hart and Pablo Hidalgo To prevent the planned sequel trilogy from being beholden to and restrained by the plotlines of the Expanded Universe works the choice was made to discard that continuity br On April Lucasfilm rebranded the Expanded Universe material as Star Wars Legends and declared it non canonical to the franchise The company s focus would be shifted towards a restructured Star Wars canon based on new material Chee said in a Twitter post that a primary goal of the story group would be to replace the previous hierarchical canon of the Holocron with one cohesive one However the final season of The Clone Wars which was released in contradicted aspects of the canon novel Ahsoka The next year The Clone Wars spin off series The Bad Batch contradicted canon elements of the Kanan comic book series The Bad Batch executive producer Jennifer Corbett explained that Everything we did was for a reason and it might not match but it s sort of just wanting to honor what existed but also give another take on it in this story br br br Sequel trilogy and anthology films br In its announcement Lucasfilm explained that the only preexisting works to be considered canonical within the franchise would be the primary episodic films and the The Clone Wars film and TV series The announcement called these works the immovable objects of Star Wars history the characters and events to which all other tales must align It was also made clear that a planned Star Wars sequel trilogy and subsequent works developed within the restructured canon would not be based on Legends material but could possibly draw from it The first new canonical novel was A New Dawn by John Jackson Miller published in September acting as a prologue to the CGI animated television series Star Wars Rebels which was released a month later Marvel began publishing new Star Wars comic book series in January and the Journey to Star Wars publishing initiative included books and comics tying in to the sequel trilogy films br The first sequel trilogy film The Force Awakens was released in December There was some minor fan backlash against the restructured canon with one group successfully campaigning to buy a billboard pleading for Lucasfilm to continue the original non canonical Expanded Universe separately from the canon Rebels supervising director Dave Filoni reintroduced popular Legends character Thrawn into the canon in the third season of Rebels Timothy Zahn was hired to write new canonical novels about the character Since co creating The Clone Wars Filoni has followed Lucas who incorporated Expanded Universe elements into the Special Editions prequels and The Clone Wars in incorporating multiple spin off elements into his series Some cancelled The Clone Wars episodes were adapted into books and comics in The Clone Wars Legacy multimedia project br After The Force Awakens multiple films were released including the anthology films Rogue One and Solo A Star Wars Story as well as the second and third sequel trilogy films The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker Dozens of novels comics published by Marvel and IDW and games like Battlefront II were released Additionally the animated
