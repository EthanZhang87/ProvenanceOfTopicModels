Holdo s appearance in film Arkady Martine wrote that women who look like Holdo femme fatales even in their middle age women who like frivolous things jewels and bright hair and makeup even in the darkest moments we are primed to read women like that as women who will betray and that this old trope is eventually subverted when Holdo turns out to be a skilled strategist with impeccable military credentials who sacrifices herself for the Resistance Caitlyn Busch described Dern s character as a stern beautiful female character who audiences have never seen before she swoops in takes control of the situation and shames a favorite male character like he s an insolent child br br br br br br External links br Amilyn Holdo in the StarWars com Databank br Amilyn Holdo on Wookieepedia a Star Wars
