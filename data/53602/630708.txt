Speeder bikes also known as jumpspeeders or hover bikes and swoop bikes or just swoops are small fast transports that use repulsorlift engines in the fictional Star Wars universe Return of the Jedi includes a prominent speeder bike chase speeders and swoops also appear in Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope added in the Special Edition but absent on every earlier print the animated TV series Star Wars The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels and the Star Wars expanded universe s books comics and games br br br Origin and design br Various concept sketches came from producer George Lucas call for a rocket powered scooter in Return of the Jedi While Industrial Light Magic s ILM Nilo Rodis Jamero designed a blocky vehicle with a large engine Ralph McQuarrie s designs were more fanciful but with less of a sense of the vehicle s power source The final designs resulted in full scale Imperial speeder bikes used by the actors for film against a bluescreen along with miniatures mounted by articulated puppets ILM used a steadicam recording at frame per second to record the speeder bikes path through the forest moon of Endor in reality a California forest Playing the footage at the standard rate of frames per second caused a blurring effect which ILM used to simulate the vehicles high speed what was shot at miles per hour km h looked like miles per hour km h br The BARC speeder in Revenge of the Sith was designed to appear like a predecessor to the speeder bikes in Return of the Jedi ILM s Doug Chiang designed Darth Maul s Ray Park speeder in The Phantom Menace to resemble a scythe and Chiang s initial designs for the droid army s STAP vehicle resembled the speeder bikes from Return of the Jedi An all CGI swoop appearing in A New Hope stems from a design created for Star Wars Shadows of the Empire and the swoop also appears briefly in The Phantom Menace br br br Depiction br In the Star Wars universe speeder bikes are a type of repulsorcraft vehicles which use anti gravity devices called repulsorlifts to hover above the surface of a planet Compared to other repulsorcraft speeder bikes sacrifice unnecessary systems in order to achieve greater speed or agility Swoop bikes being little more than an engine with seats are similar but better suited for operating at higher altitudes In the Legends video game Knights of the Old Republic swoop racing is a main part of the story with the player having to work for The Hidden Beks a swoop gang by infiltrating rival swoop gang The Black Vulkars and competing against them in a swoop race in order to rescue Bastila Swoop racing is described as a dangerous fast paced competition between skilled pilots br br br Types of speeder bikes br Z Speeder Bike The Z speeder bike makes its first appearance in Return of the Jedi as Imperial scout troopers patrol the forest surrounding the shield generator on Endor during the movie s speeder bike chase Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill and Leia Organa Carrie Fisher pilot a pair of speeders to chase down scout troopers who might reveal the Rebel Alliance s presence on Endor Background material on the bike explains how the Z built by the Aratech Repulsor Company was originally used by the Republic during the Clone Wars before being adopted by the Empire The bike measures m ft long can carry one or two passengers and achieves a maximum speed of km h mph In addition to a self charging battery system sensors and communication equipment the Z is armed with a Ax blaster cannon though being stripped of all excess weight the bike offers no protection for the rider br Sith Speeder Darth Maul is seen using a speeder bike to chase down Qui Gon Jinn Liam Neeson and Anakin Skywalker Jake Lloyd in The Phantom Menace identified in Star Wars material as a Razalon FC speeder bike It is described as being a popular model with assassins and other criminals because of its ability to perform sharp turns and a compactness that makes it harder to track though the small size also requires it be more frequently recharged Darth Maul s bike the Bloodfin has been stripped of all weaponry and sensors to make his lighter and faster achieving a top speed of km h mph br Flitknot Speeder The Flitknot speeder bike is first seen in Attack of the Clones when Count Dooku Christopher Lee uses one to escape the battle of Geonosis to return to his solar sailer These bikes are of simple design with more bulk at the back in the engines than anywhere else as well as two handholds and two footholds They are fast and maneuverable able to outrun Republic gunships br BARC Speeder The BARC speeder first appears in Revenge of the Sith as Jedi Master Stass Allie is turned upon by her clone trooper escorts when Darth Sidious Ian McDiarmid initiates Order Manufactured by the Aratech Repulsor Company the speeder bike s name is explained as being derived from the specialist clone troopers Biker Advanced Recon Commandos who typically pilot these craft Armed with a pair of blaster cannons the BARC speeder is m ft long and can reach a top speed of km h mph It normally seats only one passenger but can be modified with mission specific sidecars br C PH Patrol Speeder Bike Also known as Imperial patrol speeders these bikes are used by Imperial patrol troopers to police shipyards and industrial facilities of value to the Empire Manufactured by the Aratech Repulsor Company they use a bank of forward facing repulsorfield vector guides They first appear in Solo A Star Wars Story in which a patrol trooper piloting one such speeder pursues Han Solo and Qi ra br Zephyr J The Zephyr J is a model of speeder bike used in the Outer Rim territories and manufactured by Mobquet Swoops and Speeders It makes its debut in Chapter The Gunslinger of The Mandalorian the titular character uses this type of speeder br br br Cultural impact br The speeder bike specifically the Z as seen in Return of the Jedi has been ranked as one of the top vehicles of the Star Wars universe described as the ultimate superbike and cooler than Boba Fett The speeder bike scene in Return of the Jedi has also been described as one of the top ten most thrilling chase sequences in the Star Wars saga br Many fans of the Star Wars series have also been inspired to build life size working replicas In a group of fans used Jetovator water propelled jet packs to create several Z replicas to film a recreation of the speeder bike chase scene Vintage Works of Green Bay Wisconsin built a replica Z speeder bike in using a Zero electric motorcycle Also in a team from Lithium Cycles worked with YouTube prankster Jesse to build a pair of Z bikes using their Super electric street motorcycles which they showed off on the streets of New York City In order to give the appearance the vehicles hovered the team placed mirrors underneath the bikes to shroud the wheels br Although lacking the anti gravity technology ascribed to speeder bikes real life hoverbikes utilize different principles of levitation with the goal of achieving a similar effect Mark DeRoche of Aero X maker Aerofex said it was a tribute to George Lucas team that their prototype hoverbike a low altitude tandem duct aerial vehicle resembled Star Wars speeders The HoverSurf HoverBike has also been compared to Star Wars speeder bikes though it achieves flight by the same methods as a traditional quadcopter br Since their inception speeder bikes have been included in several Star Wars product lines including Lego models and Hasbro miniatures br In real life a one person or unmanned cargo flying vehicle with four jet motors at the corners using artificial intelligence to maintain stability that has been described as a flying motorbike and named Speeder was under development in an idea that emerged from work with the US Navy By early several full size prototypes had been built Top speed was miles per hour km h and flight endurance was minutes br br br See also br Hoverbike br br br Bibliography br Barr Tricia Bray Adam Horton Cole Horton Star Wars The Visual Encyclopedia
