Luke Skywalker before his Jedi training Raised in the Lost City of the Jedi for the first twelve years of his life Ken eventually joins the Rebel Alliance where Luke discovers him Ken is the son of the mutant Triclops and therefore Emperor Palpatine s grandson br Trioculus is the self proclaimed son and heir of Palpatine As his moniker implies he has three eyes two in the same place as a normal human and a third on his forehead He attempts to procure the glove worn on the hand that Darth Vader lost in his duel with Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi This glove is rumored to bestow great power upon its holder Trioculus is killed by a droid replica of Princess Leia br Triclops is Palpatine s illegitimate son named because of his three eyes He is sent into solitary exile because the Emperor fears Triclops potential mastery of the dark side of the Force During his exile The Empire administers shock treatment therapies which eventually drove the boy insane and he is sent to an insane asylum There he meets the nurse Kendalina a Jedi Princess and the two conceive a child Kendalina is murdered and their son Ken is taken away Triclops is forced to work for the slave lord Trioculus After pledging pacifism and his desire to see the Empire s demise Triclops is taken in by the Alliance When they learn he was fitted with an implant that transmits images to Imperial Probe droids they feed him disinformation Triclops escapes before they can destroy the implant leaving only an impassioned letter to his son Ken br Grand Moff Hissa is an Imperial Moff who plots to take over the reins of the empire by using Trioculus as a puppet dictator He loses his legs during a scuffle with the Rebellion in which he falls into a vat of acid thereafter he uses a hovering wheelchair to get around br Supreme Prophet of the Dark Side Kadann is a bearded dwarf who prophesies that the next Emperor would wear the glove of Darth Vader hence Trioculus s interest in it Part of Kadann s success as a prophet is due to a network of bribe payers and other people who help his prophecies come true In the Dark Side Sourcebook it is revealed that this Kadann was once a Jedi who was secretly turned to the dark side before the Great Jedi Purge He pledged his loyalty to Palpatine and was thus spared and became one of his chief advisors Kadann foresees the Emperor s death at Endor and tries to warn him this warning went disregarded of course br br br ISBN information br The Glove of Darth Vader st edition paperback Paul Davids and Hollace Davids ISBN br The Lost City of the Jedi st
