strong but weakened as it progressed praising the multiplayer gameplay while criticizing the microtransactions loot box progression system and locking of heroes br For EGM s review Nick Plessas praised the multiplayer combat balancing and variety but criticized the game s sustained focus on loot crates Andrew Reiner of Game Informer gave the game writing Answering the call for more content

review of the game after years worth of updates In the new review David Jagneaux gave the game compared to the original review s saying After over two years of updates and changes EA and DICE have redeemed this gorgeous shooter and turned it into one of the best multiplayer adaptations of the Star Wars universe to date Jagneaux noted that the significant improvements were to the multiplayer portion of the game and that the single player story remained overly safe short and disappointing br br br Sales br In the U S Star Wars Battlefront II was the second best selling title in November behind Call of Duty WWII Within its first week on sale in Japan the PlayStation version sold copies placing it at number four on the all format sales chart By December the game had sold million copies worldwide In January EA announced that the game missed their sales target as they had hoped to sell million copies in that time and blamed the loot crate controversy br br br Accolades br br br Microtransactions controversy br During pre release beta trials the game s publisher EA was criticized by gamers and the gaming press for introducing a loot box monetization scheme that gave players substantial gameplay advantages through items purchased in game with real money Responding to the controversy developers had adjusted the number of in game items a player receives through playing the game However after the game went into pre release a number of players and journalists who received the pre release copy of the game reported various controversial gameplay features such as rewards being unrelated to the player s performance in the game The poorly weighed reward system combined with a weak inactivity detection allowed many players to use rubber bands to tightly tie their game controllers for automatically farming points during multiplayer battles ruining the experience of other active online players br br br Pride and accomplishment comment br On November a Reddit user complained that although they spent US to purchase the Deluxe Edition of the game Darth Vader remained inaccessible for play and the use of this character required a large amount of in game credits Players estimated that it would take hours of grinding to accumulate enough credits to unlock a single hero In response to the community s backlash EA s Community Team defended the controversial changes by saying their intent to make users earn credits to unlock heroes was to give users a sense of pride and accomplishment after unlocking a hero This response frustrated many Reddit users resulting in hundreds of negative replies and a comment score of negative making it the most downvoted comment in the site s history In the comment was inducted into the Guinness World Records In response to the community s outrage EA lowered the cost of credits to unlock heroes by However the credits awarded for completing the campaign were also reduced br On the day before release EA disabled microtransactions entirely citing players concerns that they gave buyers unfair advantages They stated their intent to reintroduce them at a later date after unspecified changes had been made The uproar from social media and poor press reception on its microtransactions had a negative impact on EA s share price which dropped by on the launch day of the game Analysts in Wall Street also lowered their expectations of the game s financial prospects A Wall Street analyst writing for CNBC noted how video games are still the cheapest entertainment medium per hour of use and even with the added microtransactions playing Battlefront II was still notably cheaper than paying to see the theatrical release of a film By the end of November EA had lost billion in stock value since the launch of the game On March developer DICE announced an overhaul for the progression and economic system Loot crates will only contain credits one of the in game currencies and cosmetic items while crystals the other in game currency can be bought solely for the purpose of purchasing cosmetic items for characters in the game Progression for player abilities or Star Cards is now linear as players must play a certain class or hero in order to unlock a Skill Point for that trooper or hero which can then be used to purchase a new card or upgrade one the player already owns The first part of this update was released on March which included permanently unlocking all heroes and vehicles for players regardless of progression while the second part was released in April br br br Government responses br br On November two days before its release the Belgian gambling regulator announced that it was investigating the game alongside Overwatch to determine whether loot boxes constituted unlicensed gambling In response to the investigation EA claimed that Battlefront II s loot boxes do not constitute gambling The Belgian Gaming Commission ultimately declared loot boxes to be illegal under gambling laws but found that Battlefront II was not in violation as EA had temporarily removed micro transactions from the game After the investigation reported its conclusion the Minister of Justice of Belgium Koen Geens expressed that if they prove loot boxes violate gambling laws he would start working on banning loot boxes in any future video games sold in the entire European Union br Reacting to the conclusion of the Belgian gambling regulator s investigation the head of the Dutch Gambling commission announced the start of their own investigation of Battlefront II and the issue in general and asked parents to keep an eye at the games their children play Chris Lee a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives called Star Wars Battlefront II an online casino designed to trap little kids and announced his intention to ban such practices in the state of Hawaii Another representative compared playing Battlefront II to smoking cigarettes saying We didn t allow Joe Camel to encourage your kids to smoke cigarettes and we shouldn t allow Star Wars to encourage your kids to gamble Singapore s National Council on Problem Gambling are monitoring the situation following the uproar on the game as loot boxes do not fall under the Remote Gambling Act Authorities in Australia are also investigating the situation The Parliament of the United Kingdom investigated the concerns around loot boxes and whether they constitute gambling and were later told by EA that lootboxes are quite ethical and fun and that they are the equivalent of Kinder Eggs The UK Parliament later said that loot boxes do constitute gambling and should be regulated as such br br br Notes br br br See also br Inferno Squad the single player campaign tie in novel br Iden Versio the main character of
