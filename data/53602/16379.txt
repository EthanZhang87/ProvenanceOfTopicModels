Jedi Jedi Knights or collectively the Jedi Order are fictional characters and often protagonists featured in many works within the Star Wars franchise Working symbiotically alongside the Old Galactic Republic the Jedi Order is depicted as a religious academic meritocratic and military auxiliary peacekeeping organization whose origin dates back thousands of years before the events of the first film released in the franchise The fictional organization has inspired a real world new religious movement and parody religion Jediism br Within the Star Wars galaxy the Jedi are powerful guardians of order and justice who through intuition rigorous training and intensive self discipline are able to wield a supernatural power known as the Force thus achieving the ability to move objects with the mind perform incredible feats of strength and connect to certain people s thoughts As Star Wars creator George Lucas explains the Jedi are warrior monks who keep peace in the universe avoiding the use of violence except as a last resort with a mission to use their power to keep the governments of all the planets in line so that they don t do terrible things The Jedi have the moral authority to do that since they are the most moral of anybody in the galaxy Throughout the franchise Jedi are often recognizable by their robes and tunics in various shades of brown and their use of lightsabers sword like weapons with a colorful blade made of plasma br Along with New Age elements Lucas developed the Jedi creed by adopting certain elements from Eastern religions namely Buddhism and potentially Taoism In that same vein the Jedi creed focuses on compassion for others mindfulness non attachment and meditation which are all characteristics of what Jedi characters call the light side of the Force Furthermore the Jedi view fear to be the root of suffering fear leading to anger anger leading to hate and hate leading to suffering The Jedi warn that an excess of these negative emotions can turn practitioners away from the light side of the Force towards the dark side which embraces passions aggression hate rage fear and bitterness as a way of life The Sith are followers of the dark side and the traditional enemies of the Jedi While the Sith ultimately seek violent and absolute rule over the galaxy the Jedi work to protect democracy harmony and justice br The Jedi are depicted in the franchise s Old Republic era as a monastic organization well trained in the martial arts who cooperate intimately with the galactic government and work towards bringing peace into the galaxy by being ambassadors and troubleshooters according to Lucas Jedi characters investigate certain crimes ranging from high profile murder to political corruption act as diplomats between powerful interplanetary groups protect the highest government officials of the Republic track down fugitives and are promoted as leaders in the Republic s army during the Clone Wars Still their creed demands that they defend and protect all life and use their power only for knowledge and defense With the rise of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and the Galactic Empire the Jedi Order is outlawed and most of its members killed in the ensuing political purge Later efforts are made to revive the organization br br br Etymology br The word Jedi is said to have been adapted by George Lucas from Japanese jidaigeki meaning period drama motion pictures about samurai or perhaps inspired by the words Jed Leader and Jeddak King in the Barsoom series by Edgar Rice Burroughs a series that Lucas considered adapting to film br However the origin of the word Jedi may be in the Arabic Al Jeddi meaning master of the mystic warrior way br According to the Star Wars Rogue One The Ultimate Visual Guide Jedi in universe is derived from Jedha a planet that was once home to a Jedi temple and was a source of kyber crystals Kyber crystals are used to power lightsabers and were considered sacred by the Jedi Order br In his book The Making of Star Wars The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film J W Rinzler notes that Lucas originally considered using the term Jedidiah for his knights but ultimately settled on jedi Rinzler also suggests that the word may have been influenced by the term bodhisattva which refers to a Buddhist concept of an enlightened being who chooses to remain in the world to help others br Another potential influence on the word jedi is the Hebrew term yedid which means beloved In his book The Secret History of Star Wars Michael Kaminski suggests that Lucas may have been influenced by this term when creating the name for his knights Kaminski notes that Lucas has cited Jewish mysticism as an inspiration for his work and that he may have been drawn to the idea of his heroes being beloved protectors br br br Influences br George Lucas acknowledged that the Jedi Sith and other Force concepts have been inspired by many sources These include knighthood chivalry paladinism samurai bushido Shaolin Monastery Feudalism Hinduism Qigong Greek philosophy and mythology Roman history and mythology Sufism Confucianism Shint Buddhism and Taoism and numerous cinematic precursors The works of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and mythologist Joseph Campbell especially his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces directly influenced Lucas and was what drove him to create the modern myth of Star Wars br Lucas explained that the Jedi are trained allowed and expected to love people even their enemies the Sith but they are not to form attachments because attachment leads to the dark side of the Force When one has gets or wants a person or experience and attaches to them one becomes afraid to lose them The fear of loss feeds into greed wanting to keep things thus an attached person is selfish and unable to let go The fear of loss turns into anger which will lead to hate and hate will lead into suffering mostly on the part of the one who is selfish because then one will spend their lives being afraid rather than actually living The light side is focused on compassion and giving thus it is love and the opposite of attachment it is everlasting joy devoid of fear of loss and the pain of loss As long as you love other people and treat them kindly you won t be afraid br Lucas identifying himself as Buddhist Methodist or Methodist Buddhist stated that his philosophy of non attachment depicted in his movies was influenced by the fact that he was from San Francisco the Zen Buddhism capital of the United States In he indicated that the Jedi were designed to be a Buddhist monk who happened to be very good at fighting br br br Depiction br As depicted in the canon the Jedi study and utilize the Force in order to help and protect those in need The Jedi members known as Jedi Knights respect all life by defending and protecting those who cannot do it for themselves striving for peaceful and non combative solutions to any altercations they encounter and fighting only in self defense and for the defense of those they protect By training the mind and the body the Jedi seek to improve themselves by gaining unfettered access to the Force while also seeking to improve those individuals and groups they come in contact with Like their evil counterparts the Sith the main weapon of the Jedi is the lightsaber However according to Lucas The Force really doesn t have anything to do with the lightsaber Anybody can have a lightsaber It s just a weapon like a pistol br Qui Gon Jinn gives an insight into the Force in The Phantom Menace when he tells Anakin Your focus determines your reality And later he explains Midi chlorians are microscopic lifeforms that reside within all of your cells And we are symbionts with them Lifeforms living together for mutual advantage Without the midi chlorians life could not exist and we would have no knowledge of the Force They continually speak to us telling us the will of The Force When you learn to quiet your mind you ll hear them speaking to you In A New Hope Obi Wan Kenobi tells Luke Skywalker The Force is what gives a Jedi his power It s an energy field created by all living things It surrounds us penetrates us it binds the galaxy together a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him It partially controls your actions but it also obeys your commands br br br The Skywalker Saga br br br Original trilogy

McGregor who promises to train him br The sequel Episode II Attack of the Clones establishes that the Jedi forswear attachments being in the same category of possession and striving to cultivate compassion unconditional love instead As revealed in the Clone Wars series the Jedi believed romantic feelings are natural and as such they did not prohibit them but for a Jedi Knight it was essential to make the right choice for the Order and not neglect their Jedi duties in the favor of their beloved even if that would mean the end of the relationship This proves problematic when Anakin now a

education However parents also are generally sad since they know they are unlikely to see their child again before adulthood Members of the Order progress through four educational stages at times referred to as levels br br br Initiate br Initiation is the first part of Jedi training they are mentored by Jedi Masters in rudimentary control over the Force and basic self defense techniques br Most Initiates were typically Younglings a child Jedi in training receiving an early and first class education The first ten years of a youngling s training demands segregation from outside distractions and is deliberately designed to reinforce detachment from earthly emotions including loyalty or love for their parents Initiates are taught to abandon ego and that discipline selflessness and truthfulness will lead to harmony with The Force This is why Yoda initially denied both Anakin and Luke Skywalker for being too old for training br br Abandon ego Release all your earthly attachments let go of all you ve grown to love Surrender yourself br Younglings were portrayed training under Jedi Master Yoda in a scene on Attack of the Clones and hiding during the assault on the Jedi Temple in Revenge of the Sith br The Young Jedi story arc and the episode Path of the Jedi explored the Jedi tradition called The Gathering where initiates traveled to the Crystal Caves of Ilum to harvest kyber crystals which they would use to build their first lightsabers Crystals were attuned to individual Jedi and lacked color The Force spoke to each of the younglings through their crystals To find their crystal each initiate had to learn a lesson courage hope patience trust confidence and selflessness br br br Padawan br An Initiate who successfully completes fundamental training is given a second class education and then undergoes Padawan training under the tutelage of a Mentor usually a Jedi Knight or Jedi Master They are also called Apprentices and Padawan learners In the Old Republic Padawans usually wore a hair braid or a bead string for species without hair on the right side of their head which was severed with a lightsaber by the Jedi Grand Master upon attaining knighthood They also served as Commanders in the Clone Wars br br br Knight br Disciplined and experienced Jedi Knights become so only when they have completed the trials final tests they officially graduate being eligible for specialized advance courses and may continue to pursue a third class education see below to obtain the equivalent of a habilitation or post doctoral degree As the most common and numerous rank Knights are youthful journeyman eager to travel the galaxy obtain new experiences and serve the Republic thus Knights are frequently the face of the Order with all Jedi erroneously referred to by the general public as Knights and the rank is interchangeably referred to as Jedi Jedi Knight and Master Jedi although the latter are honorifics used only by Younglings and Padawans when addressing Jedi Knights or above br The five tests are usually known as Trial of Skill the Trial of Courage the Trial of the Flesh the Trial of Spirit and the Trial of Insight or Knowledge In Return of the Jedi Master Yoda gives his apprentice Luke Skywalker the trial of confronting Darth Vader for a second time so he might become a full fledged Knight Occasionally performing an extraordinary usually heroic act can earn a Padawan learner Jedi status such as when Obi Wan Kenobi defeats the Sith Lord Darth Maul By the time of the Skywalker Saga films distinct battle classes were not necessary as the Republic had not seen war in over a thousand years and the title of Knight was simply a rank once again br br br Master br Jedi Master is a term of respect used by beings who respect the Jedi Masters are regarded as among the most accomplished and recognized polymaths in the Star Wars galaxy generally they have resigned from wanderlust ways of knighthood and instead apply their acquired years of wisdom and experience to meditative administrative and educational pursuits Upon completion of vocational or postgraduate education a Jedi Knight becomes a Jedi Master after successfully training several Padawan learners to Knight status such as when Obi Wan Kenobi became a Jedi Master after he successfully trained Anakin Skywalker to the point where he was able to complete the trials and become a Jedi Knight Though this is the most common manner there are other ways of attaining the rank Some Jedi masters include Obi Wan Kenobi Qui Gon Jinn and Yoda br br br Specializations and occupations br Various careers occupations ranks and titles were available to all Jedi Upon a Padawan s ascension to Knighthood status a Jedi pursued higher education or vocational education and training in a field of expertise choose a career based on preference personal talents and skills Before the Great Jedi Purge numerous divisions existed across the whole of the order but most personnel are represented within the three order divisions the Order of the Guardian the Order of the Consular or Order of the Sentinel In addition to their specialization in times of war the High Council could demand that the members of the Order assume military ranks in order to defend the Republic br br br Hierarchy br Grand Master of the Jedi Order The Grand Master is the oldest the most experienced the most accomplished and the best trained of all Jedi A Grand Master is voted unanimously by the Jedi High Council The Grand Master serves as the organization s figurehead in charge of ceremonial duties and dictates the organization s general policies while providing direction and guidance to the entire Jedi Order Yoda and Luke Skywalker were Jedi Grandmasters br Chief Librarian of the Jedi Archives The overseer of the Jedi Archives Holocron Vault Librarian s Assembly and the Educational Corps Second only to the Grand Master in administrative importance the Chief Librarian worked closely with the Council of First Knowledge Around the time of the Clone Wars the Chief Librarian was the elderly Jedi Master Jocasta Nu br Chief Master of the Jedi High Council or Master of the Order The Chief Master of the High Council is elected by the Jedi High Council which effectively acts as chairman Chief of staff and chief operating officer Its chief responsibilities include presiding over High Council meetings of the assembled group conducting Jedi businesses in an orderly fashion managing the executive particulars of the day to day administration of the Jedi Order acting as representative or spokesperson to the Galactic Senate and serving as the Grand Master s junior partner Jedi Master Mace Windu filled this position at the time of the Clone Wars br Jedi General A title given to those given commanding roles in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars br Jedi Commander This title was given to Jedi Padawans under the leadership of Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters with their roles as Jedi Generals in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars br br br Divisions br Jedi Guardian Jedi Guardians are the vigilant warrior class being the original most common and numerous among the Jedi easily identified by their blue lightsabers they focused all aspects of combat as an extension of their being and trained on combining and perfecting their athletic aviation and martial art skills with mastery of the Force The Force skills studied by the Guardians were typically those used for quickly disabling an opponent and aiding in agility and stamina Many were stationed within Republic planetary or sectoral government s security agencies where they worked as special peacekeepers and law enforcement agents helping to quell riots and capture terrorists The highest ranking Jedi Guardians were stationed at the Jedi academies as instructors tasked with passing down their experience to the young students of the Order Those Jedi who mastered lightsaber combat techniques such as Mace Windu were dubbed Weapon Masters and were among the greatest warriors of the Order br Jedi Consular Jedi Consulars are the contemplative scholar class being easily identified by their green lightsabers they were deep thinkers and philosophers devoted to the mental aspects of the force studied the greater inner workings of the force behind the scenes focused on further mastery of the Force the sharpening of mental faculties and wielded a lightsaber only for self defense Overseen by the Council of Reconciliation Jedi Consulars were often called upon to act as impartial advisers diplomats and arbiters Most Consulars specialized as historians archivists librarians archaeologists geologists biologists mathematicians and astronomers they contributed to the growth and preservation of the Jedi Archives as Lore Keepers directed by the Librarian s Assembly Some Consulars worked closely with the Republic bureaucrats to assist in greeting unaligned governments and helping them join the Republic and given the authority to hammer out a compromise or treaty during tense negotiations backed by the full support of the Senate and Jedi Order Some Consulars joined the Circle of Jedi Healers headquartered out of the Coruscant Temple s Halls of Healing and focused on the medical and humanitarian aspects of the Force manipulating the Living Force to perform the art of healing Those Jedi specifically predisposed to receive visions through the Force were known as Seers maintaining and updating the Order s holocrons the most perceptive of these Jedi such as Yoda were known as Prophets and foretold the future of the galaxy br Jedi Sentinel Jedi Sentinels are the pragmatic tech class being easily identified by their yellow lightsabers they blended multiple schools of teaching amplified them with a series of non force skills and focused on diverse inter disciplinary talents that were not often associated with the Jedi Sentinels applied their Force abilities as engineers technicians intelligence and security experts Interestingly they stayed away from the Jedi Temple preferring to conduct their affairs within communities throughout the Galaxy Most Sentinels tended to take a middle road approach to problems being stationed at numerous locations for decades to serve as liaison officers between the system or sector and the Republic The most loyal Sentinel join the anonymous Jedi Temple Guard charged with guarding the Jedi Temple such dedication demanded no emotional relationship or identity Some Sentinels aided police as detectives through the use of the Force Since Republic law required all newborns to undergo Force sensitivity testing Sentinels who worked as members of the Acquisition Division of the Order routinely tracked down and identified Force sensitive children to assess whether they met the qualifications to receive training in the Jedi Order The most elite Sentinels became Shadows or Watchmen the Jedi secret police who worked under the supervision of the First Knowledge Council to destroy all remnants of the Sith br br br Resources and technology br In the Star Wars universe the Jedi are usually portrayed wearing simple robes and carrying specialized field gear for their missions Their philosophical lifestyles mirror those of real world religious vows and evangelical counsels as their personal possessions are provided exclusively by the Jedi Order and are only meant to allow self sufficiency br br br Weapons br br The most notable instrument wielded by a Jedi is the lightsaber Both Jedi and Sith use lightsabers though the former regard them as a tool the latter a weapon The Jedi s lightsabers emit cool colors usually blue or green blades sometimes yellow or purple as seen in the case of Mace Windu while the Sith emit warm colors red Lightsabers can be of many different colors depending on the crystal fixture and reflective of the wielders psychological profile Most Jedi use naturally formed crystals frequently ranging between blue green and yellow whereas Sith tend to use corrupted or synthetic crystals which are usually red in color br Although rare spear like whip like and multi bladed lightsabers can exist especially among Sith such as Darth Maul s double bladed lightsaber the Inqusitors double bladed rotating ones or Kylo Ren s crossguard bladed one due to a cracked kyber crystal br br br Vehicles br br Eta Actis Jedi interceptors first appeared in Revenge of the Sith Delta B Aethersprite Jedi starfighters appear in Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones and Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith In Attack of the Clones Obi Wan Kenobi travels via Jedi starfighter to Kamino to investigate the attempted assassination of Padm Amidala he also flies a Jedi starfighter to Geonosis in an attempt to track down the bounty hunter Jango Fett Lacking a hyperdrive the starfighter relies on an external sled to propel it through hyperspace Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker Hayden Christensen fly updated Jedi starfighters called Jedi interceptors in the opening sequence of Revenge of the Sith Later Plo Koon Matt Sloan flies a Revenge of the Sith era starfighter when he is shot down by clone troopers carrying out Darth Sidious Ian McDiarmid Order br The Jedi starfighter s triangular shape in Attack of the Clones stems from the shape of Imperial Star Destroyers in the original Star Wars trilogy Industrial Light Magic designer Doug Chiang identified the Jedi starfighter as one of the first designs that bridges the aesthetic between the prequel and original trilogies Chiang noted that viewers familiarity with the Star Destroyer s appearance and Imperial affiliation gives added symbolism to the Jedi craft s appearance and foreshadows the Empire s rise to power The starfighter seen in Revenge of the Sith is a cross between the previous film s vessel and the Empire s TIE fighters from the original trilogy Hasbro s expanding wings in the Attack of the Clones Jedi starfighter toy inspired the opening wings in the Revenge of the Sith vessel The starfighter in the Revenge of the Sith is called a Jedi interceptor br br br Jedi Archives br The Jedi Archives known as The Great Library of Ossus or The Great Library of the Jedi contained the galaxy s most priceless and ancient of texts sacred to Jedi scholars and archaeologists Among these were Sith artifacts considered by the Jedi Order to be the most dangerous artifacts in the galaxy that were accessible only to those able to control the Dark Side of the Force br The Jedi archives of the Jedi Temple in the movie Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones bear a startling resemblance to the Long Room of the Trinity College Library in Dublin This resemblance resulted in controversy as permission had not been sought to use the building s likeness in the film However Lucasfilm denied that the Long Room was the basis for the Jedi archives and officials from Trinity College Library decided not to take any legal action br br br Jedi Academy br br The Jedi academies were established to train Force sensitive beings accepted into the Jedi Order in the ways of the Force Overseen by the Council of First Knowledge each academy was governed by an advisory Council appointed by their superiors on Coruscant Mainstreaming the majority of teachings at the Temple certain practices were permitted to vary from world to world However at all sanctioned academies a group of Jedi Masters would instruct Initiates to the Order in the ways of the Force The size of the school varied from world to world the smallest consisted of a single clan of younglings and the largest was the main academy housed within the Jedi Temple of Coruscant Most academies had been established during the Old Sith Wars and were located in the Galactic Rim Some were located on or near Force wellsprings or places significant to the Order like crystal caves or nexuses of dark side energies that needed constant monitoring br In addition to the traditional academies established by the Order the Exploration Corps maintained several spacefaring mobile academies such as the Chu unthor so that roaming the galaxy and exploring new worlds could be achieved while still teaching traditional doctrine br By the fall of the Galactic Republic in BBY many of the ancient academies had been shut down for decades with the Council of First Knowledge preferring the central teachings of the Coruscant Temple After the dissolution of the Order during the Great Jedi Purge all orthodox Temples and academies were routed and burned in order to prevent any more Jedi from learning the secrets of the Force However the Galactic Empire s chokehold on Force education did not last and the Order was reformed following the conclusion of the Galactic Civil War After Grand Master Luke Skywalker s New Order became a single class of twelve students including his nephew Ben Solo it was reduced to only himself when his nephew turned to the dark side and became Kylo Ren br br br Jedi Temple br In the prequel trilogy the primary Jedi Temple is located on the Republic s capital planet of Coruscant As the chief administrative headquarters the Temple served the Order in three capacities a monastery and library for the Jedi seeking enlightenment and to reflect on the will of the Force an academy and training center for Jedi younglings and Padawans who endeavored to join the ranks of the Jedi Knights and government in which the Masters of the Jedi High Council guided the Order s direction It was originally built atop an old dark side nexus shrine during the birth of the Republic so as to be symbolic to the Coruscant people that the tyrannical rule of the Sith was over br In Revenge of the Sith the Jedi Temple is attacked by clone troopers of the st Legion led by the newly christened Darth Vader who butchered the Jedi within and set the Temple alight After the fall of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic the Temple became the Palace of the Emperor and a location for his dark side artifacts It would serve as Sidious residence for over two decades until his death at the battle of Endor The Temple is visible in the celebrations on Coruscant at the end of Return of the Jedi After the destruction of the Sith Luke Skywalker the last of the Jedi recovered fragments of a Force sensitive tree that was once located at the heart of the Jedi Temple br Architects Journal rated the temple third on its top ten architecture of Star Wars list behind the second Death Star and Jabba the Hutt s palace on Tatooine and ahead of Coruscant the capital city of the Old Republic The temple is described in the article as adapting the robust typology of Mayan temples with durasteel cladding specified for the external stone walls for improved defensive strength and said to be a ziggurat that is built above a Force nexus and has ample room for training facilities accommodation and the Jedi Archive The temple has five towers the tallest being Tranquility Spire that are stylistically similar to the minarets surrounding the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul Star Wars Insider listed it as the one hundredth greatest thing about Star Wars in its one hundredth issue special br br br Legends depiction of the Jedi br br With the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non canon to the franchise in April br In novels and reference books now considered Legends the interpretation of the Jedi teaching on not forming attachments was alternating between being in line with George Lucas vision and using attachment in the sense of affection fondness and loving commitment stating that the Jedi Code prohibited these emotional bonds Furthermore the Jedi were depicted as a quasi militaristic organization with strict political alignment to the Galactic Republic br br br Je daii br br The Je daii Order precursors to the modern Jedi studied and used both the light and dark sides of the Force equally The preview issue of Dawn of the Jedi states that the Je daii originated ten thousand years before the saga takes place approximately years BBY They were more monk than warrior and their capital was Tython in the Deep Core br br br The New Jedi Order br br In novels set after the events of the film series Luke Skywalker re established the Jedi High Council as part of his New Jedi Order The most notable difference between the format of the new council and the old is that only half of the council are made up of Jedi while the other half consisted of politicians Following the war with the Yuuzhan Vong the Jedi withdrew their support from anyone political entity and relocated to Ossus where Luke had a full Jedi Council re established br The New Jedi Order was the restored and reformed Jedi organization in the wake of the Great Jedi Purge and the subsequent fall of the Galactic Empire The Jedi Knights reduced in number to only a handful were slowly restored primarily under the leadership of Grandmaster Luke Skywalker Skywalker abolished the traditional Master Padawan system He believed all Jedi should be both teachers and students that they should both learn from and mentor each other and not just from one Master br Within the Expanded Universe The New Jedi Order indicates that the Jedi Temple on Coruscant is no longer standing but it is rebuilt as a gift to Jedi for their services and achievements during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion The new temple is in the form of a massive pyramid made from stone and transparisteel that is designed to fit into the new look of Coruscant though internally it is identical to the design seen in Revenge of the Sith br br br Cultural impact and critical response br br The United States Army had a group of officers in the early s who promoted maneuver warfare tactics and who were derisively referred to as Jedi by more conventional officers who were satisfied with attrition warfare tactics and methods br br br Analysis br In Star Wars and Philosophy William Stephens compares the Jedi to Stoicism To recap the virtues the Jedi shares with the Stoic sage are patience timeliness deep commitment seriousness as opposed to frivolity calmness as opposed to anger or euphoria peacefulness as opposed to aggression caution as opposed to recklessness benevolence as opposed to hatred joy as opposed to sullenness passivity as opposed to agitation and wisdom Given all these virtues Yoda certainly resembles what the ancient Stoics described as the sage the ideal person who has perfected his reason and achieved complete wisdom br Functionally the Jedi order resembles a Praetorian Guard br br br Media br Jedi have made their way into certain areas of pop culture such as Weird Al Yankovic s song The Saga Begins a parody of American Pie In the film The Men Who Stare at Goats a reporter follows a former soldier who claimed to be a Jedi warrior a nickname for psychic spies in the US military br br br Religion br br One of the enduring influences the Star Wars saga has had in popular culture is the idea of the fictional Jedi values being interpreted as a modern philosophical path or religion spawning various movements such as the Jediism religious and the Jedi
