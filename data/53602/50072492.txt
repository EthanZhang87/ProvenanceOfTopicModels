heroines Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian noted that Jones is in the tousled yet game tradition of Star Wars female leads like Carrie Fisher or Daisy Ridley well born but determined with a sense of purpose befitting an heiress if not a princess Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Jones smashing and her Jyn a female warrior to rank with the great ones and Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times praised Jones for her sympathetic ferocity in the role IndieWire s David Ehrlich compared Jyn to Rey Ridley from The Force Awakens and described her as indistinguishable from the bland and plucky heroine of Episode VII save for her privileged disillusionment br Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly called Jyn the kind role model any moviegoing parent would want to expose their daughters and sons to adding that Jones plays her with a fiery warmth that turns her into more than just a pawn piece going through the larger storytelling paces She makes her human Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that Jones presents a convincing if monotonously self serious heroine noting the actress physical resemblance to Ridley and speculating that their characters could be related The Hollywood Reporter s Graeme McMillan criticized the character for her passive role in the film s plot calling her a void where the movie s heart should live McMillan speculated that the character was a possible casualty of Rogue One s reshoots br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Jyn Erso in the StarWars com Databank br Jyn Erso on Wookieepedia a Star Wars wiki br Jyn Erso on IMDb
