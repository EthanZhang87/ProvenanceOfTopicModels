id: 1750228
Over one hundred video games based on the Star Wars franchise have been released dating back to some of the earliest home consoles Some are based directly on films while others rely heavily on the Star Wars Expanded Universe br Star Wars games have gone through three significant development eras early licensed games games developed after the creation of LucasArts and games created after the closure of LucasArts present which are currently licensed to Electronic Arts and include an EA Star Wars logo br The first Star Wars games were developed by a variety of companies after Star Wars creator George Lucas licensed the rights to Star Wars video games several of these games were released under the Lucasfilm Games banner Early licensed games released during the bit and bit eras of gaming barely featured any kind of narrative and many were action titles that either retold the stories of the original trilogy or focused on a single scene of a film br Later on Lucas took interest in the increasing success of the video game market and decided to create his own video game development company LucasArts so he could have more creative control over the games and their narratives During this era graphics evolved enough for games to be able to tell complex narratives leading to games that featured more advanced retellings of the stories of the films with voice overs and CGI cut scenes as well as original titles with new narratives that were set in the same continuity as the films After The Walt Disney Company s purchase of Lucasfilm in and the closure of LucasArts the following year the games developed during the first two eras were discarded from the canon in and reassigned to the non canonical Star Wars Legends label br Following LucasArts closure the rights to produce Star Wars video games were reassigned solely to Electronic Arts Games published during this era are considered canonical to the franchise and have featured more influence from the Lucasfilm Story Group responsible for managing aspects of Star Wars canon The EA Star Wars license had been set to expire in but in Lucasarts announced new partnerships for others to produce Star Wars and other Lucasfilm games alongside Electronic Arts br Although many hobbyists and independent game developers have created freeware games based on the Star Wars movie series and brand this page lists only the games that have been developed or published by LucasArts or officially licensed by Lucasfilm br As of there have been over million copies of Star Wars games sold br br br Early licensed games br br In Apple Computer produced an unlicensed Star Wars game on cassette tape for its Apple II As a space pilot trainee the player destroys TIE fighters using a first person heads up display The first video game cartridge bearing the name Star Wars appeared that year on the RCA Studio II clones Sheen M and Mustang Telespiel Computer br br The first official licensed Star Wars electronic game was Kenner s table top Star Wars Electronic Battle Command The game had three levels of play basic intermediate and advanced Players took turns examining star systems with the aim of avoiding black holes locating enemies and searching for MAGNA the FORCE giving star The game was billed as the most exciting computer game you will ever play br br br The original trilogy br Licensed releases for the Atari began with The Empire Strikes Back in which the player piloted a snowspeeder during the Battle of Hoth destroying AT AT walkers Several other games appeared such as Return of the Jedi Death Star Battle where the player controlled the Millennium Falcon in a mission to destroy the second Death Star and Jedi Arena the first game to attempt to simulate a lightsaber battle in this case clearly inspired by the Star Wars scene where Luke Skywalker trains with a seeker In the Star Wars arcade game was released by Atari based on the film In this game featuring color vector graphics and the first ever digitized speech from a film the player enters the seat of Luke s Red Five X Wing fighter battles waves of TIE fighters led by Darth Vader weaves through towers across the surface of the Death Star and plummets through the battle station s trench in an attempt to destroy it The sequel for the game The Empire Strikes Back used the same technology to re create scenes from the second film including battles with AT AT walkers and an asteroid field br In UK software publisher Domark released several bit versions of the Star Wars vector arcade game followed by similar conversions in of The Empire Strikes Back machine In Namco developed a Star Wars game for the Nintendo Family Computer Famicom for the Japanese market exclusively based on the film but with several liberties taken with its storyline br In the platform game Star Wars was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System Master System Game Boy and Game Gear and one year later Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back covered the plotline of the fifth episode of the saga Also in Super Star Wars was released for the SNES followed by the remaining games in the trilogy Super Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back and Super Star Wars

game company which he named LucasArts However since Lucas had already licensed the rights to develop Star Wars games the company instead developed original adventure games and World War II flight combat games LucasArts regained the rights to develop Star Wars games in at that point the videogame company put their previous experience in flight simulators to use and released a Star Wars X Wing

Star Wars expanded universe was titled Star Wars Rebellion and broke new ground in that it incorporated ships and planets not found in the original canon such as the Rebel Assault Frigate and the Bulwark Cruiser But for all its ground breaking new looks it was not as successful as would have been hoped The second strategic title Star Wars Force Commander was also released but failed to keep up
