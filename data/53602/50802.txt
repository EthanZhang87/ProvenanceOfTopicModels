Kuat RZ A wing Interceptor are starfighters in the Star Wars franchise Designed and manufactured by the Kuat Systems Engineering they are depicted as fast but fragile interceptors of the Rebel Alliance conceived for high speed surgical strikes deep reconnaissance and escort fighter duty br A wings first appear in Return of the Jedi and later in numerous Star Wars materials and productions It gained popularity through its depiction in several video games and since the A wing has been merchandised by several companies They are the fastest vessels in the Star Wars canon with the advantage of being the smallest hyperspace drive equipped craft without relying on a carrier allowing the vessel to extricate itself from a losing battle or escape hostile territory after performing an attack br br br Appearances br RZ A wings from Green Squadron participate in the climactic Battle of Endor depicted in Return of the Jedi At Endor an A wing piloted by Arvel Crynyd Hilton McRae crashes into the bridge of the Super Star Destroyer Executor resulting in the Executor crashing out of control into the second Death Star In addition to McRae two women recorded A wing cockpit footage one of the actors was cut and the other was dubbed over by a male actor br A wings later appear in various Star Wars Expanded Universe television shows books and games Some Expanded Universe material says Jan Dodonna created the A wing based on his analysis of the role of speed in the Battle of Yavin the climactic battle in Star Wars Later material such as the Star Wars Rebels television series depicts the starfighters in use before the events of Star Wars br The A wings of Phoenix Squadron play an important role in Rebels second season Rebels producers used the A wing in part because the ship was not used much in Return of the Jedi The fighter s presence in the cartoon was meant to show that different groups used different craft to fight the Empire The series s episodes The Holocrons of Fate and Twin Suns also feature the two seater RZ T trainer a training spacecraft used by the rebels to train recruits The RZ T also appears in the novel Battlefront II Inferno Squad br The RZ A Wing is based on the R A Wing also made by Kuat Systems Engineering br A later variant the RZ A wing features in Star Wars Battlefront II and in Star Wars The Last Jedi It is a bigger spacecraft used by the Resistance against the First Order br br br Concept and design br br The A wing was one of two new Rebel Alliance starfighters created for Return of the Jedi It was dubbed the A fighter because it was the first of the two designs created Ralph McQuarrie s production paintings of A wing starfighters were completed after filming and displayed alternative blue markings br Joe Johnston designed the ship Wesley Seeds and Lorne Peterson of Industrial Light Magic built the model and its pilot figure is based on a World War I German airman A battle damaged engine wing was snapped into place to represent Arvel Crynyd s damaged fighter as it crashed into the Executor br McQuarrie s alternative blue and white coloring was used for the craft s appearance in Rebels Photographs from the filming of Star Wars The Last Jedi show an A wing on the film set Screen Rant suggests the A wing seen in the photographs evokes some of McQuarrie s interpretation of the design such as the blaster cannon shape and the presence of additional ports in the cockpit br br br Depiction br According to Star Wars canon the A wing was first produced by Kuat Systems Engineering which had built the Delta starfighter for the Jedi Order With the Jedi eradicated as depicted in Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith and the Delta nearly impossible for non Jedi to pilot Kuat designed a new starfighter the R A wing in hopes the Galactic Empire would purchase it While impressed with prototypes of the R the Empire instead went with the TIE fighter and forbade Kuat from mass producing the A wing The prototypes were sold to the kingdom of Tammuz an which over a decade later were eventually sold to the Rebel Alliance br Rebel engineers made many alterations to the original R design to produce the RZ model as seen in Return of the Jedi The original engines were swapped out for more powerful ones while other major components were replaced with lightweight versions so a supraluminal hyperdrive could be added The resulting fighter is faster than even the Empire s TIE interceptor and perfect for hit and run attacks long range patrols and reconnaissance missions Its two laser cannons mounted on special swivel mounts can elevate or depress vertically some were modified for full rotation but these had a greater chance to jam However engineers could not fit the A wing with an astromech droid which limited how many hyperspace coordinates it could carry The lack of droid assistance also makes it challenging even for a being with Jedi like reflexes to control a fighter so fast and maneuverable Consequently only the best Rebel pilots are allowed to fly the A wing br After the Empire was defeated background material explains how Kuat Systems Engineering made a number of improvements to the design to create the RZ A wing for the New Republic Defense Fleet Even faster than the original the RZ requires less maintenance than the RZ and the swivel mounts that allow its laser cannons to rotate were no longer at risk of jamming Thanks to the New Republic s disarmament campaign RZ s found their way into the Resistance which like the Rebellion before allows only the best pilots to fly the A wing br br br Impact br br CinemaBlend said the A wing received little attention after Return of the Jedi because no prominent characters pilot the craft Kenner in released an A wing pilot figure as part of its Power of the Force line and it released a magnificent A wing toy as part of the Star Wars Droids line Since then the A wing has been recreated as various other toys models and collectibles by companies that include Galoob Hasbro Model Products Corporation Estes Industries Lego and Fantasy Flight Games br Screen Rant said the A wing gained popularity as a playable craft in the Star Wars X Wing space combat simulator which The Escapist said depicted the ship as an excellent dogfighter Subsequent video games that allowed players to pilot the A wing also contributed to the ship s popularity Blastr ranked the A wing th on its list of the best Star Wars vehicles br Prince Harry was photographed sitting in an A wing cockpit during his and the Duke of Cambridge s April visit to the Star Wars Episode VIII set Responding to the photographs various publications called the A wing iconic an unsung hero woefully underappreciated and a classic br In a number of Star Wars starfighters including the A wing had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program Of those starfighters tested the A wing was among the most aerodynamic designs of all with a drag coefficient of though it was still worse than the real life example of the F E Phantom with a rating These poor results were rationalized with the in universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel and that Star Wars fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector shields to give themselves better flight profiles br br br
