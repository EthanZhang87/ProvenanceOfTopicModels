to help foreign fans of manga and anime visit sites across the country associated with particular manga stories The federation seeks on quadrupling the sales of Japanese content in overseas markets within the upcoming years br Manga stories are typically printed in black and white due to time constraints artistic reasons as coloring could lessen the impact of the artwork and to keep printing costs low although some full color manga exist e g Colorful In Japan manga are usually serialized in large manga magazines often containing many stories each presented in a single episode to be continued in the next issue A single manga story is almost always longer than a single issue from a Western comic Collected chapters are usually republished in tank bon volumes frequently but not exclusively paperback books A manga artist mangaka in Japanese typically works with a few assistants in a small studio and is associated with a creative editor from a commercial publishing company If a manga series is popular enough it may be animated after or during its run Sometimes manga are based on previous live action or animated films br Manga influenced comics among original works exist in other parts of the world particularly in those places that speak Chinese manhua Korean manhwa English OEL manga and French manfra as well as in the nation of Algeria DZ manga br br br Etymology br br The word manga comes from the Japanese word katakana hiragana composed of the two kanji man meaning whimsical or impromptu and ga meaning pictures The same term is the root of the Korean word for comics manhwa and the Chinese word manhua br The word first came into common usage in the late th century with the publication of such works as Sant Ky den s picturebook Shiji no yukikai and in the early th century with such works as Aikawa Minwa s Manga hyakujo and the celebrated Hokusai Manga books containing assorted drawings from the sketchbooks of the famous ukiyo e artist Hokusai Rakuten Kitazawa first used the word manga in the modern sense br In Japanese manga refers to all kinds of cartooning comics and animation Among English speakers manga has the stricter meaning of Japanese comics in parallel to the usage of anime in and outside Japan The term ani manga is used to describe comics produced from animation cels br br br History and characteristics br br Manga originated from emakimono scrolls Ch j jinbutsu giga dating back to the th century During the Edo period a book of drawings titled Toba Ehon further developed what would later be called manga The word itself first came into common usage in with the publication of works such as Sant Ky den s picturebook Shiji no yukikai and in the early th century with such works as Aikawa Minwa s Manga hyakujo and the Hokusai Manga books Adam L Kern has suggested that kibyoshi picture books from the late th century may have been the world s first comic books These graphical narratives share with modern manga humorous satirical and romantic themes Some works were mass produced as serials using woodblock printing however Eastern comics are generally held separate from the evolution of Western comics and Western comic art probably originated in th century Italy br Writers on manga history have described two broad and complementary processes shaping modern manga One view represented by other writers such as Frederik L Schodt Kinko Ito and Adam L Kern stress continuity of Japanese cultural and aesthetic traditions including pre war Meiji and pre Meiji culture and art The other view emphasizes events occurring during and after the Allied occupation of Japan and stresses U S cultural influences including U S comics brought to Japan by the GIs and images and themes from U S television film and cartoons especially Disney br Regardless of its source an explosion of artistic creativity occurred in the post war period involving manga artists such as Osamu Tezuka Astro Boy and Machiko Hasegawa Sazae san Astro Boy quickly became and remains immensely popular in Japan and elsewhere and the anime adaptation of Sazae san drew more viewers than any other anime on Japanese television in Tezuka and Hasegawa both made stylistic innovations In Tezuka s cinematographic technique the panels are like a motion picture that reveals details of action bordering on slow motion as well as rapid zooms from distance to close up shots This kind of visual dynamism was widely adopted by later manga artists Hasegawa s focus on daily life and women s experience also came to characterize later sh jo manga Between and an increasingly large readership for manga emerged in Japan with the solidification of its two main marketing genres sh nen manga aimed at boys and sh jo manga aimed at girls br In a group of female manga artists later called the Year Group also known as Magnificent s made their sh jo manga debut year comes from the Japanese name for the year the birth year of many of these artists The group included Moto Hagio Riyoko Ikeda Yumiko shima Keiko Takemiya and Ryoko Yamagishi Thereafter primarily female manga artists would draw sh jo for a readership of girls and young women In the following decades present sh jo manga continued to develop stylistically while simultaneously evolving different but overlapping subgenres Major subgenres include romance superheroines and Ladies Comics in Japanese redisu redikomi and josei br Modern sh jo manga romance features love as a major theme set into emotionally intense narratives of self realization With the superheroines sh jo manga saw releases such as Pink Hanamori s Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Reiko Yoshida s Tokyo Mew Mew and Naoko Takeuchi s Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon which became internationally popular in both manga and anime formats Groups or sentais of girls working together have also been popular within this genre Like Lucia Hanon and Rina singing together and Sailor Moon Sailor Mercury Sailor Mars Sailor Jupiter and Sailor Venus working together br Manga for male readers sub divides according to the age of its intended readership boys up to years old sh nen manga and young men to years old seinen manga as well as by content including action adventure often involving male heroes slapstick humor themes of honor and sometimes explicit sex The Japanese use different kanji for two closely allied meanings of seinen for youth young man and for adult majority the second referring to pornographic manga aimed at grown men and also called seijin adult manga Sh nen seinen and seijin manga share a number of features in common br Boys and young men became some of the earliest readers of manga after World War II From the s on sh nen manga focused on topics thought to interest the archetypal boy including subjects like robots space travel and heroic action adventure Popular themes include science fiction technology sports and supernatural settings Manga with solitary costumed superheroes like Superman Batman and Spider Man generally did not become as popular br The role of girls and women in manga produced for male readers has evolved considerably over time to include those featuring single pretty girls bish jo such as Belldandy from Oh My Goddess stories where such girls and women surround the hero as in Negima and Hanaukyo Maid Team or groups of heavily armed female warriors sent bish jo br By the turn of the st century manga achieved worldwide popularity br With the relaxation of censorship in Japan in the s an assortment of explicit sexual material appeared in manga intended for male readers and correspondingly continued into the English translations In the Tokyo Metropolitan Government considered a bill to restrict minors access to such content br The gekiga style of storytelling thematically somber adult oriented and sometimes deeply violent focuses on the day in day out grim realities of life often drawn in a gritty and unvarnished fashion Gekiga such as Sampei Shirato s Chronicles of a Ninja s Military Accomplishments Ninja Bugeich arose in the late s and s partly from left wing student and working class political activism and partly from the aesthetic dissatisfaction of young manga artists like Yoshihiro Tatsumi with existing manga br br br Publications and exhibition br br In Japan manga constituted an annual billion yen approximately US million publication industry by In sales of manga books made up for about of total book sales and sale of manga magazines for of total magazine sales The manga industry has expanded worldwide where distribution companies license and reprint manga into their native languages br Marketeers primarily classify manga by the age and gender of the target readership In particular books and magazines sold to boys sh nen and girls sh jo have distinctive cover art and most bookstores place them on different shelves Due to cross readership consumer response is not limited by demographics For example male readers may subscribe to a series intended for female readers and so on Japan has manga caf s or manga kissa kissa is an abbreviation of kissaten At a manga kissa people drink coffee read manga and sometimes stay overnight br The Kyoto International Manga Museum maintains a very large website listing manga published in Japanese br br br Magazines br br E shimbun Nippon chi published by Kanagaki Robun and Kawanabe Kyosai is credited as the first manga magazine ever made br Manga magazines or anthologies manga zasshi usually have many series running concurrently with approximately pages allocated to each series per issue Other magazines such as the anime fandom magazine Newtype featured single chapters within their monthly periodicals Other magazines like Nakayoshi feature many stories written by many different artists these magazines or anthology magazines as they are also known colloquially phone books are usually printed on low quality newsprint and can be anywhere from to more than pages thick Manga magazines also contain one shot comics and various four panel yonkoma equivalent to comic strips Manga series can run for many years if they are successful Popular shonen magazines include Weekly Sh nen Jump Weekly Sh nen Magazine and Weekly Sh nen Sunday Popular shoujo manga include Ciao Nakayoshi and Ribon Manga artists sometimes start out with a few one shot manga projects just to try to get their name out If these are successful and receive good reviews they are continued Magazines often have a short life br br br Collected volumes br br After a series has run for a while publishers often collect the chapters and print them in dedicated book sized volumes called tank bon These can be hardcover or more usually softcover books and are the equivalent of U S trade paperbacks or graphic novels These volumes often use higher quality paper and are useful to those who want to catch up with a series so they can follow it in the magazines or if they find the cost of the weeklies or monthlies to be prohibitive Deluxe versions have also been printed as readers have gotten older and the need for something special grew Old manga have also been reprinted using somewhat lesser quality paper and sold for yen about U S dollar each to compete with the used book market br br br History br Kanagaki Robun and Kawanabe Ky sai created the first manga magazine in Eshinbun Nipponchi The magazine was heavily influenced by Japan Punch founded in by Charles Wirgman a British cartoonist Eshinbun Nipponchi had a very simple style of drawings and did not become popular with many people Eshinbun Nipponchi ended after three issues The magazine Kisho Shimbun in was inspired by Eshinbun Nipponchi which was followed by Marumaru Chinbun in and then Garakuta Chinpo in Sh nen Sekai was the first sh nen magazine created in by Iwaya Sazanami a famous writer of Japanese children s literature back then Sh nen Sekai had a strong focus on the First Sino Japanese War br In the manga magazine publishing boom started with the Russo Japanese War Tokyo Pakku was created and became a huge hit After Tokyo Pakku in a female version of Sh nen Sekai was created and named Sh jo Sekai considered the first sh jo magazine Sh nen Pakku was made and is considered the first children s manga magazine The children s demographic was in an early stage of development in the Meiji period Sh nen Pakku was influenced from foreign children s magazines such as Puck which an employee of Jitsugy no Nihon publisher of the magazine saw and decided to emulate In Kodomo Pakku was launched as another children s manga magazine after Sh nen Pakku During the boom Poten derived from the French potin was published in All the pages were in full color with influences from Tokyo Pakku and Osaka Puck It is unknown if there were any more issues besides the first one Kodomo Pakku was launched May by Tokyosha and featured high quality art by many members of the manga artistry like Takei Takeo Takehisa Yumeji and Aso Yutaka Some of the manga featured speech balloons where other manga from the previous eras did not use speech balloons and were silent br Published from May to January Manga no Kuni coincided with the period of the Second Sino Japanese War Manga no Kuni featured information on becoming a mangaka and on other comics industries around the world Manga no Kuni handed its title to Sashie Manga Kenky in August br br br D jinshi br br D jinshi produced by small publishers outside of the mainstream commercial market resemble in their publishing small press independently published comic books in the United States Comiket the largest comic book convention in the world with around visitors gathering over three days is devoted to d jinshi While they most often contain original stories many are parodies of or include characters from popular manga and anime series Some d jinshi continue with a series story or write an entirely new one using its characters much like fan fiction In d jinshi sales amounted to billion yen US million In they represented about a tenth of manga books and magazines sales br br br Digital manga br Thanks to the advent of the internet there have been new ways for aspiring mangaka to upload and sell their manga online Before there were two main ways in which a mangaka s work could be published taking their manga drawn on paper to a publisher themselves or submitting their work to competitions run by magazines br br br Web manga br In recent years there has been a rise in manga released digitally Web manga as it is known in Japan has seen an increase thanks in part to image hosting websites where anyone can upload pages from their works for free Although released digitally almost all web manga sticks to the conventional black and white format despite some never getting physical publication Pixiv is the most popular site where amateur and professional work gets published on the site It has grown to be the most visited site for artwork in Japan Twitter has also become a popular place for web manga with many artists releasing pages weekly on their accounts in the hope of their work getting picked up or published professionally One of the best examples of an amateur work becoming professional is One Punch Man which was released online and later received a professional remake released digitally and an anime adaptation soon thereafter br Many of the big print publishers have also released digital only magazines and websites where web manga get published alongside their serialized magazines Shogakukan for instance has two websites Sunday Webry and Ura Sunday that release weekly chapters for web manga and even offer contests for mangaka to submit their work Both Sunday Webry and Ura Sunday have become one of the top web manga sites in Japan Some have even released apps that teach how to draw professional manga and learn how to create them Weekly Sh nen Jump released Jump Paint an app that guides users on how to make their own manga from making storyboards to digitally inking lines It also offers more than types of pen tips and more than screentones for artists to practice Kodansha has also used the popularity of web manga to launch more series and also offer better distribution of their officially translated works under Kodansha Comics thanks in part to the titles being released digitally first before being published physically br The rise web manga has also been credited to smartphones and computers as more and more readers read manga on their phones rather than from a print publication While paper manga has seen a decrease over time digital manga have been growing in sales each year The Research Institute for Publications reports that sales of digital manga books excluding magazines jumped percent to billion in from the year before while sales of paper manga saw a record year on year decline of percent to billion They have also said that if the digital and paper keep the same growth and drop rates web manga would exceed their paper counterparts In manga sales topped the billion mark for the first time in history beating the peak due to a fast growth of the digital manga market which rose by billion from a previous year surpassing print manga sales which have also increased br br br Webtoons br While webtoons have caught on in popularity as a new medium for comics in Asia Japan has been slow to adopt webtoons as the traditional format and print publication still dominate the way manga is created and consumed although this is beginning to change Despite this one of the biggest webtoon publishers in the world Comico has had success in the traditional Japanese manga market Comico was launched by NHN Japan the Japanese subsidiary of Korean company NHN Entertainment As of now there are only two webtoon publishers that publish Japanese webtoons Comico and Naver Webtoon under the name XOY in Japan Kakao has also had success by offering licensed manga and translated Korean webtoons with their service Piccoma All three companies credit their success to the webtoon pay model where users can purchase each chapter individually instead of having to buy the whole book while also offering some chapters for free for a period of time allowing anyone to read a whole series for free if they wait long enough The added benefit of having all of their titles in color and some with special animations and effects have also helped them succeed Some popular Japanese webtoons have also gotten anime adaptations and print releases the most notable being ReLIFE and Recovery of an MMO Junkie br br br International markets br br By the influence of manga on international comics had grown considerably over the past two decades Influence is used here to refer to effects on the comics markets outside Japan and to aesthetic effects on comics artists internationally br br Traditionally manga stories flow from top to bottom and from right to left Some publishers of translated manga keep to this original format Other publishers mirror the pages horizontally before printing the translation changing the reading direction to a more Western left to right so as not to confuse foreign readers or traditional comics consumers This practice is known as flipping For the most part criticism suggests that flipping goes against the original intentions of the creator for example if a person wears a shirt that reads MAY on it and gets flipped then the word is altered to YAM who may be ignorant of how awkward it is to read comics when the eyes must flow through the pages and text in opposite directions resulting in an experience that s quite distinct from reading something that flows homogeneously If the translation is not adapted to the flipped artwork carefully enough it is also possible for the text to go against the picture such as a person referring to something on their left in the text while pointing to their right in the graphic Characters shown writing with their right hands the majority of them would become left handed when a series is flipped Flipping may also cause oddities with familiar asymmetrical objects or layouts such as a car being depicted with the gas pedal on the left and the brake on the right or a shirt with the buttons on the wrong side however these issues are minor when compared to the unnatural reading flow and some of them could be solved with an adaptation work that goes beyond just translation and blind flipping br br br Asia br br Manga has highly influenced the art styles of manhwa and manhua Manga in Indonesia is published by Elex Media Komputindo Level Comic M C and Gramedia Manga has influenced Indonesia s original comic industry Manga in the Philippines were imported from the US and were sold only in specialty stores and in limited copies The first manga in Filipino language is Doraemon which was published by J

Love manga have become a popular mainstream with Thai consumers leading to television series adapted from BL manga stories since Manga piracy is an increasing problem in Asia which effects many publishers This has led to the Japanese government taking legal action against multiple operators of pirate websites br br br Europe br br Manga has influenced European cartooning in a way that is somewhat different from in the U S Broadcast anime in France and Italy opened the European market to manga during the s French art has borrowed from Japan since the th century Japonism and has its own highly developed tradition of bande dessin e cartooning Manga was introduced to France in the late s where Japanese pop culture became massively popular in of comics sold in the country were manga and

association with anime and then independently Some U S fans became aware of manga in the s and early s However anime was initially more accessible than manga to U S fans many of whom were college age young people who found it easier to obtain subtitle and exhibit video tapes of anime than translate reproduce and distribute tank bon style manga books One of the first manga translated into English

entrepreneur Toren Smith founded Studio Proteus in Smith and Studio Proteus acted as an agent and translator of many Japanese manga including Masamune Shirow s Appleseed and K suke Fujishima s Oh My Goddess for Dark Horse and Eros Comix eliminating the need for these publishers to seek their own contacts in Japan br Simultaneously the Japanese publisher Shogakukan opened a U S market initiative with their U S subsidiary Viz enabling Viz to draw directly on Shogakukan s catalogue and translation skills br br Japanese publishers began pursuing a U S market in the mid s due to a stagnation in
