Clone troopers are fictional characters from the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas First introduced in the live action film Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones they have since appeared in various other Star Wars media including Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith and the animated series Star Wars The Clone Wars Star Wars Rebels Star Wars The Bad Batch and Tales of the Jedi present as well as comics novels and video games set in both the Star Wars Legends expanded universe and the current canon br The clone troopers were soldiers who fought for the Galactic Republic during the Fall of the Jedi era All clone troopers are artificially produced soldiers created at special cloning facilities on the planet Kamino from the DNA of bounty hunter Jango Fett to serve as the military of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars which takes its name from the troopers They are genetically engineered to age at twice the rate of a normal human in order to be ready for deployment much quicker and be unquestionably loyal to the higher chain of command During the Clone Wars the clone troopers serve under the command of the Jedi Order as they fight against the droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems CIS a movement organized by numerous planets that sought to secede from the Republic At the end of the war Palpatine the Republic s leader and secretly a Sith Lord who orchestrated the conflict to gain political power issues Order which brands the Jedi as traitors and causes the clone troopers under the influence of an inhibitor chip implanted in their brains to execute them Following the formation of the Galactic Empire and the destruction of the cloning facilities on Kamino clone troopers are slowly replaced by Imperial stormtroopers non clone human recruits br During the development of The Empire Strikes Back Lucas initially conceived a planet of clones which is why the Clone Wars was mentioned for the first time in the original Star Wars film The clone trooper armor was designed to suggest an evolution into the stormtroopers of the original trilogy and it incorporated features from both the armor of stormtroopers and Boba Fett revealed in Attack of the Clones to be an unaltered clone of Jango Fett The armored troopers in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith are computer generated images voiced by Temuera Morrison who played Jango Fett Younger clones were played by Bodie Taylor and Daniel Logan who played the younger Boba Clones not wearing helmets were played by both Morrison and Taylor who wore chroma key body suits to isolate their heads and some clone troopers featured a blend of the actors features Beginning with The Clone Wars film that launched the animated series of the same name adult clone troopers are voiced by Dee Bradley Baker and young clone troopers are voiced by Logan In Star Wars Clone Wars all clones were voiced by Andr Sogiluzzo br Upon their debut in the Star Wars prequel trilogy clone troopers received a mixed response from critics and audiences due to their limited screen time and the films never explicitly stating that they were distinct from the originally trilogy s stormtroopers some felt that the implication of stormtroopers being soldiers created solely for war took away from the impact of the conflict Reception of the clone troopers improved significantly with their portrayal in The Clone Wars which introduced numerous clones with distinctive traits and personalities and made an effort to humanize them exploring their relationships with the Jedi and fellow clones and their thoughts and feelings about the Clone Wars and their own existence Since then numerous Star Wars works set during the Clone Wars era have featured clone troopers as main characters with many going on to become fan favorites Clone troopers have become cultural icons and a widely recognized element of the Star Wars franchise br br br Concept and creation br br br Development and design br br In writing The Empire Strikes Back Leigh Brackett s first draft of the film initially developed Lando Calrissian as a clone from a planet of clones involved in the Clone Wars mentioned in A New Hope and were nearly made extinct by the war but this concept was not featured in the final film George Lucas later came up with the alternate concept of an army of clone shock troops from a remote planet used by the Republic in the war that followed Lucas intended for the prequel trilogy to depict the evolution of the galaxy s fighting forces and the clone troopers were the step after flawed battle droids br Clone troopers were designed to strongly suggest the army s evolution into the Empire s stormtrooper army Concept artist Jay Shuster said of the armor design It follows the formula for a lot of the prequel trilogy Take something pre conceived in the existing trilogy and de generate it Design Director Doug Chiang incorporated both features of the Boba Fett and stormtrooper armor into the design acknowledging the vague assertion in Star Wars lore that Fett s armor was connected to those of the stormtroopers Initial concept models implied that the first generation armor was thicker and bulkier than stormtrooper armor and this characteristic was retained by the art department for Revenge of the Sith Lucas expressed a desire for individualized trooper armor from the beginning of art development for Revenge of the Sith Several variations were largely dictated by environmental needs but others were influenced of the Clone Wars animated series and the desert stormtroopers of A New Hope The clone trooper designs progressed closer toward the stormtrooper designs and the film included variant designs similar to the sandtrooper scout trooper and snowtrooper armor of the original trilogy br The designs of clone trooper in snow and cold weather gear seen in season one of The Clone Wars are heavily inspired by early concept and costume by Ralph McQuarrie Joe Johnston and John Mollo for The Empire Strikes Back br br br Portrayal br In Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith all clone troopers are computer generated images and are voiced by Temuera Morrison who played the clone template Jango Fett The child clone troopers were played by Daniel Logan who also played Jango s clone son Boba Fett and the clone troopers as young men were played by Bodie Taylor who was cast for his resemblance to a younger Morrison Taylor was filmed multiple times and composited to fill out crowded shots set in Tipoca City and in some cases such as for distant shots he was entirely digital br Commander Cody seen in armor without his helmet in Revenge of the Sith was played by Morrison He wore a blue bodysuit and only footage of his head was used for Cody he held a stormtrooper helmet to approximate the digital clone trooper helmet Cody carries Like Morrison Taylor also played armored and clones without helmets in Revenge of the Sith wearing a blue bodysuit that isolated his head Some clone troopers were entirely digital and featured a digital blend of Morrison s and Taylor s facial features The armor was match animated to the actors bodies br The clone troopers are voiced by Dee Bradley Baker in the animated film The Clone Wars and its related animated television series of the same name Baker attempted to give each clone trooper a unique voice taking into account personality age and position within the unit sometimes describing the clone in a single adjective and focusing on that descriptor for the voice work Each clone was voiced individually with all the clone s lines for the episode recorded at one time before moving to another character and the dialogue was edited together br Logan voiced the young clone troopers in seasons two and three of the television series Baker reprises his role in the Rebels and The Bad Batch animated series br br br Appearances br br br Film br In Attack of the Clones Jedi Master Obi Wan Kenobi discovers the clone army on Kamino He is told by the Kaminoans that Jedi Master Sifo Dyas ordered the army on the Republic s behalf ten years prior however Sifo Dyas apparent death shortly before that timeframe leads the Jedi Order to doubt this The clone troopers are cloned from Jango Fett a bounty hunter hired by a man named Tyranus later revealed to be Sith Lord Count Dooku The clone troopers genetics are altered so that they age at twice the normal rate and are more loyal and easier to command The clone army is deployed to Geonosis under the command of the Jedi to rescue Obi Wan Anakin Skywalker and Padm Amidala from execution by the Separatists The ensuing battle becomes the first one in the Clone Wars Although the clone army emerges victorious Dooku and many other Separatist leaders escape meaning that the war has only just begun br In Revenge of the Sith set three years later the clone army continues to fight in the Clone Wars against the Separatist battle droid armies However just as it appears that the Republic will win the war Chancellor Palpatine secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious orders the clone army to execute Order turning them against the Jedi The clone troopers kill their Jedi commanders although a few manage to escape Meanwhile the st Legion led by the newly christened Darth Vader storms the Jedi Temple burning it and killing the vast majority of the Jedi inside This effectively ending the Jedi Order Following Vader s assassination of the remaining Separatist leaders Palpatine transforms the Republic into the Galactic Empire and the clone army becomes the basis of the Imperial Army br Clone troopers are referenced in The Force Awakens when Kylo Ren chides General Hux for the betrayal of rogue stormtrooper FN and suggests that Supreme Leader Snoke should consider a clone army br br br Animation br br br The Clone Wars br Clone troopers are heavily featured in the animated film The Clone Wars which spawned an animated series of the same name that lasted until with a final season released in Many named clone troopers are introduced and given individual personalities serving as the focus of several story arcs In the th season more of the nature of Order is revealed when a clone trooper named Fives discovers that he and his brothers have chips implanted into their brains that would compel them to kill Jedi when Order is uttered Ultimately the Jedi remained unaware of this as Fives was executed by a clone shock trooper ordered by Palpatine to conceal the existence of the contingency order br br br Rebels br The animated series Star Wars Rebels features a group of former clone troopers including Rex from the preceding cartoon who had their chips removed and therefore did not carry out Order They are first introduced in the second season about years after Revenge of the Sith These clones help the crew of the Ghost in their fight against the Empire and eventually join the Rebel Alliance Rebels established that in the years after the Clone Wars the Empire gradually replaced the aging clones with the less effective but more numerous stormtroopers The clones were not purged but simply cast aside over time and without familial or social networks to fall back onto it was difficult for them to integrate into civilian life br In a behind the scenes Q A for episode when asked what happened to the clone troopers after the Clone Wars ended producer Pablo Hidalgo explained A lot of different things happened to them Some of them had pretty sad situations In many ways the Clone Troopers are sort of this lost generation of unappreciated veterans who helped save the galaxy and were then discarded He went on to explain that a small handful of clone troopers were kept in service as instructors at Imperial academies across the galaxy training up the next generation of non clone soldiers as the new stormtroopers br br br The Bad Batch br The animated series Star Wars The Bad Batch focuses on Clone Force named for a clone trooper who was disfigured and couldn t fight so he was part of the maintenance crew nicknamed The Bad Batch a squad of clone commandos with deliberately modified genetic traits granting them mildly superhuman abilities The first season begins during Order and its aftermath as the Republic transitions into the Empire Most of the squad evades the effects of Order due to their unique genetic alterations that prevent their inhibitor chips from functioning except for Crosshair who is reprogrammed by Admiral Tarkin to serve the Empire The Bad Batch also ends up taking in a young female clone named Omega who is like them a genetic deviant and therefore feels a kinship with them In the first season Tarkin directly explains the switchover from clone troopers to stormtroopers citing that a recruitment based army of non clones costs half as much as the clones While recruits are not as well trained there is a vast supply of them and they are meant more for pacification duty than wartime combat In the second season a defense recruitment bill enacts the transition from clone troopers to stormtroopers for good and much of the new Imperial personnel is shown taking a dislike to the clone troopers Clone troopers themselves react negatively towards the change as they were bred and raised to fight in combat but now are forced to defend isolated bases or retire indefinitely br br br In other media br In the live action TV series Obi Wan Kenobi during the first season Obi Wan played by Ewan McGregor reprising his role is walking through a city on the planet Daiyu where he encounters a former clone trooper again played by Temuera Morrison now a disheveled homeless veteran begging on the streets This is in keeping with Pablo Hidalgo s explanation during his Star Wars Rebels of what happened to most clone troopers after the Clone Wars ended br In a flashback sequence in the first season of the live action TV series Andor a regiment of clone troopers is sent to enforce Imperial authority over Ferrix quelling angry protesters demanding the Imperials leave and for the return of the former Galactic Republic br In the novels Lords of the Sith by Paul S Kemp and Tarkin by James Luceno several clone troopers are still in active service during the early years of the Empire s reign such as among stormtroopers serving Darth Vader and even among the Emperor s elite Imperial Guard br In the Legends game Star Wars Battlefront II clone troopers were fitted with new armour and weapons after the end of the Clone Wars and became the Imperial Deathtroopers Purge Troopers and Royal Elite Guards of the Empire Later a combination of natural born humans and clones from different donor templates would be incorporated into the Stormtrooper Corps br br br Individual clone troopers br br br Coruscant Guard br The Coruscant Guard is a division of the Grand Army of the Republic tasked with internal security and peacekeeping operations on Coruscant protecting soft target public spaces and important hard target buildings and serving as escorts and guards on diplomatic missions They first appear in

hostage Fox led a company of the Coruscant Guard to cut off his escape Unfortunately Bane had rigged the chamber and the hostages with explosives Seeing this Fox ordered his men to stand down and allowed the bounty hunter and his team to leave the Senate building br Like every other clone trooper in the Guard Fox was bound by honor and duty to protect and serve the Supreme Chancellor and the members of the Galactic Senate Utterly fearless he was always the first to lead the charge into battle even in the most perilous combat situations His unquestionable loyalty meant he would carry out his orders without question even if it meant killing a Jedi or another brother an example of this devotion to orders is seen as he shot ARC Trooper Fives with his DC His exemplary performance has made him one of the most highly decorated soldiers in the Republic army Additional sources state that Fox continued his duty on Coruscant until an error on his part led Darth Vader to execute him by force snapping his neck br br br Commander Thire br Commander Thire CC is a Coruscant Guard clone shock trooper who served as a commander br in the Coruscant Guard of the Grand Army of the Republic During the Clone Wars he accompanied Grand Master Yoda of the Jedi Order on a diplomatic assignment to meet with King Katuunko of Toydaria In the course of their mission Yoda inspired his clone troopers to take strength from their individual traits such as Thire s patience br Following the initiation of Order and the subsequent confrontation between Yoda and Darth Sidious in BBY Thire and his troopers were ordered to hunt the Jedi Master The failure to locate his body convinced Mas Amedda that Yoda was still alive leading the Emperor to order Thire to resume the search However Yoda succeeded in

class ARC troopers were the very first soldiers created by the Kaminoans br br br Reception br Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt the decision to make an army of clones is a softening of the Star Wars own mythology though the article later corrected that not all troopers in the franchise were clones Noting that the films never specify that the clone troopers are replaced by regular soldiers by the original trilogy he believed that the idea of soldiers who are created solely for war and are little more than machines sanitizes the war of the franchise s title He praised the decision of The Force Awakens to explicitly move away from clone troopers as bringing much needed moral complexity to the film s conflict The story arcs and character development of various clone trooper characters in the animated series Star Wars The Clone Wars Star Wars Rebels and Star Wars The Bad Batch was met with praise from both fans and critics alike with many clones such as Captain Rex becoming fan favorite characters br br br See also br Mandalorians br Spartiate br br br br br br Citations br br br Sources br br br External links br Media related to Clone troopers at Wikimedia
