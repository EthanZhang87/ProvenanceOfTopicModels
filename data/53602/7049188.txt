the films and TV Series with the exception of a few special characters It was first announced in February at the North American International Toy Fair serving as a tie in to Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace that would be released in May br br br Development br The Lego Star Wars designers have revealed how they have changed strategy to get popular minifigures into cheaper and more accessible sets Lego Star Wars Creative Lead Jens Kronvold Frederiksen explained We have changed our strategy a little bit over the years and continued Where in the past we often kept some of them the most important especially for the higher prices we are now thinking young kids maybe newcomers to Star Wars want to get into it br The designers revealed the Force Ghost minifigures as a result of changes to the company s transparent plastic Creative Lead Jens Kronvold Frederiksen The reason for not doing it was that the minifigures are made out of many different types of plastic because they need to have different abilities and characteristics Design Director Michael Lee Stockwell explained Some have to be flexible some need to use clutch power and whatnot and continued So the hands are different material than the heads for example br Stockwell explained how coming up with playsets based on new shows and movies is trickier than creating vehicles Referring to a Lego set based on The Mandalorian Stockwell explained We were interested in the Armourer s forge already from the first season but we didn t know enough about the context and continued We didn t know enough of what was happening around this That s one of the major differences between designing a ship and a playset like this because it s sometimes easier to understand a ship br br The designers explained the Mandalorian Starfighter set number is a great example of how they decide which sets to produce Frederiksen explained If it s something that s exposed in more places then there s a high chance that it s popular and continued We did the same thing when creating stuff from The Clone Wars We always thought the best set was vehicles that were both from the prequel movies but also in The Clone Wars because then we make more people happy br The designers explained the design process of a minifigures and how they feel responsible for their accuracy Lego Star Wars designer Madison O Neil explained Part of that is just trying to fit these details in The leg print the arm print wherever we can that s a new thing that we re starting to be able to do a little bit more of which is great to have the capacity to do that We work within these frames that we have within the company that everyone has and we just try to do the absolute best we can br br br Construction sets br According to the Lego
