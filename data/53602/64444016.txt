I ve really grown to love He also stated It s such a privilege to be able to play something that has a storied history behind it but also something that I m a fan of and have always wanted to be part of since I was a kid The actor didn t want to model Cal on any specific Star Wars character adding I wanted Cal s personality and demeanor and everything to come out of his own experiences and his own stories and to build it from an inward place br During his audition process for the game Monaghan wasn t told that he was auditioning for a Star Wars game At that point I didn t know I was auditioning for a Star Wars game but I kinda knew They made these fake audition pages and stuff and I was kinda reading it like hmmm This is Star Wars isn t it They were like No of course not So when I got into the room and they gave me the toy lightsaber I was like I knew it br Before the developers knew who Cal Kestis was going to be there were several different concepts The director of the game Stig Asmussen revealed We talked about doing an alien character we talked about doing a different gender but we arrived at where we were because at the time Rey was kind of the thing for Star Wars so it made a lot more sense for us to have a male protagonist br br br Appearances br br br Video games br br br Jedi Fallen Order br br Cal is the protagonist of the video game Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order

character was generic or dorky Elijah Beahm from The Escapist criticized the depiction of Cal s reactions to the deaths of key characters as well as Cal s role in the wiping out of an ethnic tribe of Dathomirians arguing that his more muted response makes him unsympathetic as a heroic protagonist Beahm argued For all the ancient temples Cal visits and the other Force sensitives he speaks to the best he can do is murder Stormtroopers He s not a keeper of the peace he s a soldier and a betrayer of what the Jedi should be This sentiment was also expressed by Jack Packard from The Escapist Conversely Nick Calandra from The Escapist defended Cal Kestis saying Cal learning to control his emotions and work through his trauma provides an infinitely more interesting character than he would have been had he just followed the Jedi way without truly understanding what it means Once Cal finally stops fighting the past sheathes his lightsaber and promises to honor the teachings of his former master only then does he become knighted as a Jedi br Alani Vargas from CheatSheet also stated that Cal Kestis is a great choice for the main character Some reviewers noted that while he does not
