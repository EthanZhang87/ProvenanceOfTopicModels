begins years after the Rebel Alliance destroyed the Second Death Star The New Republic is facing internal conflict while trying to maintain peace A new powerful enemy known as the Yuuzhan Vong emerges from the outer galaxy beginning what will be known as the Yuuzhan Vong invasion The Jedi along with the New Republic struggle to resist this new alien race while it steadily pushes forward annihilating or occupying different parts of the galaxy br br br Character arcs br As the longest continuous series of novels in the Expanded Universe the NJO was able to establish several long term character arcs Many new or previously underused characters were put into the spotlight and were developed extensively over the course of the series br br Ganner Rhysode Rhysode began the series as an arrogant young Jedi a trait best shown when on assignment with Corran Horn he mocked Horn s inability to use telekinesis claiming that this made him a lesser Jedi Rhysode gradually became more humble over the course of the series especially after watching many of his friends die on the mission to Myrkr After Jacen Solo was captured during this mission Rhysode went searching for him even though in Jacen s words we weren t even friends Rhysode died fighting thousands of Yuuzhan Vong warriors so that Jacen and Vergere could escape It was foreseen that in the future the Yuuzhan Vong would eventually worship a new god called the Ganner who guarded the entrance of the Yuuzhan Vong realm of the dead referring admiringly to Rhysode s last stand br Tahiri Veila Not fully developed in her original role Anakin Solo s friend from Junior Jedi Knights Tahiri was pushed to a starring role in the NJO When the Yuuzhan Vong captured Yavin a new Jedi training base she was taken prisoner and subjected to experiments designed to create a Vong human hybrid Anakin eventually rescued her which stirred the romantic feelings they had had for years When Anakin died above Myrkr Tahiri was devastated At this time the Yuuzhan Vong personality implanted in her began to periodically take control and Tahiri would wrestle with this for the duration of the series Unlike most of the other Jedi she had a peculiar empathy with the Yuuzhan Vong At the end of the series she chose to stay on Zonama Sekot to continue learning about the Yuuzhan Vong and help them build a better society br Jacen Solo Jacen underwent perhaps the most complete and controversial arc of the NJO He began the series as someone who actively questioned whether it was right to use the Force as a weapon After being captured by the Yuuzhan Vong he withstood weeks of torture at the hands of Vergere an Old Republic Jedi and Vong familiar He emerged with a new view of the Force including a willingness to use it offensively During the battle to retake Coruscant Jacen achieved a state of oneness with the Force that gave him a perfect mastery br Many major characters die within the series In several New Jedi Order books the characters who die seem to be important in the novels The books also revealed the death of some major characters in the Star Wars universe that were not introduced in the movie trilogies br In Vector Prime Chewbacca dies saving Anakin on the planet Sernpidal which causes some friction between Anakin and his father Han br br br Development br In Sue Rostoni managing editor for Lucas Licensing and Shelly Shapiro editorial director for Del Rey Books joined with novelist James Luceno to plot The New Jedi Order series Spanning novels it became the longest running Star Wars book series We created a series bible that coordinated the story arcs a database for new characters and continuity that was passed out to writers who were hired to do the work said Luceno We are mindful that we re playing in George Lucas backyard but everyone who has written for the franchise has contributed something br The Yuuzhan Vong species was based on the character Nom Anor introduced in the Dark Horse Comics series Crimson Empire he subsequently appeared in several New Jedi Order titles br br br Media br br br Vector Prime br Star Wars The New Jedi Order Vector Prime was written by American writer R A Salvatore and published in Upon its release the book was featured on the New York Times Hardcover Bestseller List The book received much controversy for the death of Chewbacca the first and only time a major film character has been killed off in the now non canon Star Wars Expanded Universe despite George Lucas s approval The concept of killing such a character was the decision of the book editors said to include Randy Stradley then an editor at Dark Horse Comics who sent a list of characters they would like to kill to Lucas with Luke Skywalker at the top of the list The response was what characters they could not kill and Chewbacca was not on the list hence his selection Opinion was sharply divided as to whether this death of a beloved character was an effort to boost sales and interest in the new series or if it served the dramatic purpose of declaring that not even the core characters were necessarily safe anymore Either way it was this book with this plot point that was a key factor in Disney s decision to revoke the canonical status of the Expanded Universe br Mark Hamill reprised his role as Luke Skywalker for a commercial for the book He had a speaking role in which he as Luke recalled his previous struggles and talks of how he was unsure he could defeat this new threat the Yuuzhan Vong br The alien race known as the Yuuzhan Vong are preparing for their invasion on the Star Wars galaxy by covertly disrupting the peace established by that of the New Republic ever since the fall of the Galactic Empire years previously These

noticed nevertheless by the members of the ExGal base on the nearby world of Belkaden which is also infiltrated by a Yuuzhan Vong agent named Yomin Carr Three ExGal members go to Helska IV to investigate and two are killed by the Praetorite Vong while the remaining one Danni Quee is captured and tortured for experimentation Back on Belkaden Yomin Carr readies the planet for Vong habitation

Praetorite Vong have made a target of the planet by pulling its moon Dobido down Meanwhile at Helska IV the Dozen and Two Avengers get into a battle with the Praetorite Vong which marks the first ever

they can aboard the Millennium Falcon but Chewbacca is accidentally left behind and dies as Dobido crashes into Sernpidal destroying the world As the Solos and Skywalkers fall into grief over

sacrifices himself again to make sure that Jacen and Danni escape br With Jacen and Danni returned the New Republic plans to destroy Helska IV by using heat concentrating ships to blow the world up

the ritual Vong implants He knows however that the shaper which is the equivalent of a scientist in the Yuuzhan Vong intentionally Shamed him as punishment for turning her down as a mate So Rapuung teams up with Anakin so that they can accomplish their respective goals Anakin will get to save Tahiri while Rapuung will seek vengeance on the shaper who shamed him Meanwhile Tahiri is tortured and shaped by Master Shaper Mezhan Kwaad and her assistant Nen Yim in a secret heretical practice meant to brainwash Tahiri into believing that she is a Yuuzhan Vong warrior This way she will become the first Jedi Vong hybrid br Anakin and Rapuung later arrive at the shaper damutek that replaced the Jedi praxeum in the wake of the Yuuzhan Vong s occupation With the both of them disguised in order to infiltrate the compound Anakin is able to replace the destroyed crystal of his lightsaber the lightsaber s crystal was damaged in a previous confrontation with the Yuuzhan Vong with one of the Vong s own lambents light creatures With this Anakin is now able to sense the Yuuzhan Vong in a whole new way that exists outside the Force albeit this new sense only gives Anakin a rather fuzzy look at the Vong br When Mezhan Kwaad and Nen Yim s heretical experiments on Tahiri is discovered the three of them are taken to a ship to be transported off of Yavin Anakin and Rapuung make their move to accomplish their goals and Rapuung is able to coerce Kwaad into revealing the heresy she performed by intentionally Shaming him Not only does Kwaad admit to this but she even expresses her atheism

guides Tahiri back to her senses by reminding her of who she is and expressing his true feelings of love for her Rapuung meanwhile offers to sacrifice his own life against the nearby Vong warriors in order to allow Anakin and Tahiri to escape as a token of his gratitude of helping him accomplish his goal of exposing Kwaad Rapuung dies against the attacking warriors while Anakin and Tahiri escape They along with the other non Vong occupants of Yavin are soon rescued from the moon and transported out of the system thanks to the help of Talon Karrde br The novel ends with Nen Yim secretly

in helping him Nu dies but before he does he is able to whisper to Anakin Yag Dhul For their trouble Anakin and Tahiri are arrested by the pro Vong police of Eriadu but escape and manage to leave the planet in time with Corran However they can t make it back to the Errant Venture in time for it has to respond to a call from Luke Skywalker himself br Luke and his wife Mara meanwhile are declared by the New Republic to be wanted fugitives in response to the pressure that the Yuuzhan Vong put on the Jedi What s worse is that as Mara carries her and Luke s baby the deadly coomb spore virus that had previously affected her returns and threatens to kill her and the child With the help of some of their fellow Jedi and the Errant Venture they are able to escape Coruscant Afterwards Luke sends Jaina Solo to find and meet up with Kyp Durron in order to tell him that Luke has finally made a decision regarding the stance that the Jedi overall should take in the Yuuzhan Vong War br Back with Anakin Tahiri and Corran they are left to escape from the Eriadu system by themselves and when they revert from a hyperspace corridor they end up in the midst of a Yuuzhan Vong fleet They manage to infiltrate one of the Vong s ships as the fleet prepares to go into darkspace They end up in the Yag Dhul system and after a brief battle Anakin Tahiri and Corran escape from the Vong s midst in order to rendezvous with the indigenous population The attacking Vong fleet quickly pulls back and it becomes obvious that they were merely but a recon force for a much larger invasion of Yag Dhul That invasion soon comes as infiltrating Yuuzhan Vong led by Nom Anor make their move but despite their actions the invasion fails in light of the overall Vong fleet going into darkspace to deal with another problem elsewhere br That other problem came as a result of Jaina Solo s meeting with Kyp Durron Kyp tells Jaina that he has scouted the Sernpidal for some months now and has discovered the Yuuzhan Vong have been using the time offered to them in the wake of the galactic invasion s halt in order to build a giant superweapon that could threaten the stability of the New Republic They take it to the Republic military where the likes of General Wedge Antilles and Admiral Traest Kre fey take a minimum number of ships to help Kyp s forces in taking on the apparent superweapon in Sernpidal In the wake of the Republic s attack in the Julevian system it prompted the invasion fleet at Yag Dhul to pull back in order to help the defending forces at Sernpidal But their response to the call for help comes too late as their enemies manage to destroy the apparent superweapon But in the midst of the supposed superweapon s destruction Jaina discovers that it was merely a developing worldship that had no Yuuzhan Vong warriors but civilians Kyp justifies this by saying that it was meant to get back at the Vong for attacking the New Republic s people Jaina slaps him for this and vows to never help him again br The fourth story of the novel focuses on Nen Yim now Master Shaper in the wake of Mezhan Kwaad s death in the previous novel trying vainly to save a dying worldship by using even heretical protocols Her efforts are further hindered when another Master Shaper named Kae Kwaad obviously within the same domain as the late Mezhan forces Nen Yim to concoct rather ridiculous experiments that do nothing to forward the progress of repairing the dying worldship Desperate to save the worldship Yim accesses the Shaper Qahsa in order to find out what further protocols can help her in her goal by reaching the legendary eighth cortex of the Qahsa But it turns out that there is no eighth cortex and that the Yuuzhan Vong have already reached the pinnacle of their biological technology Yim also reaches the conclusion that the Yuuzhan Vong s gods also don t exist just as Mezhan Kwaad herself proclaimed before her death Kae Kwaad then reveals himself to be the Shamed One Onimi who is the familiar of the Yuuzhan Vong s Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane himself Shimrra reveals that he knows of Yim s heresy but rather than proceeding to punish her he allows her to continue her heretical protocols in order to further the Vong s war efforts against the New Republic Thus Yim drops her efforts in trying to save the doomed worldship br The fifth story of the novel focuses on Jacen Solo traveling throughout the galaxy trying to avoid Yuuzhan Vong and their supporters considering the special bounty that Warmaster Tsavong Lah put on his head Through the Solos adventures in averting death from their enemies Jacen learns to reconcile with his father Han since their different ideals were what separated them from each other emotionally in the first place br As Mara starts to die from the coomb spore virus Luke is able to reach out to her in the Force as well as reaching out to his and Mara s child s presence and they are able to banish the virus from her system as their son Ben Skywalker is born Their friends and allies including Anakin Tahiri both of whom shared a kiss at Yag Dhul that will prove to further their relationship in the future Corran the

dangerous plan He will lead a strike force made of his Force adept friends into the core of an enemy worldship over Myrkr in attempt to kill the original voxyn There he will come into contact with evil sorrow the destiny of the New Republic and himself The book also saw the creation of the deadly YVH Droids that were built as a response to the Yuuzhan Vong invasion and the Fall of Coruscant br The Jedi find themselves in considerable danger when the Yuuzhan Vong unleash feral creatures called voxyn on them These voxyn are aggressive intelligent and extremely difficult to kill and worst of all for the Jedi they can hunt through the Force and have been engineered specifically to hunt down Jedi Leia Organa Solo captures one such beast but not before she is severely wounded It is then discovered that all voxyn are clones of an original genetically modified beast native to Myrkr the location of the Yuuzhan Vong voxyn cloning facility In order to foil the threat posed by the voxyn Anakin Solo and the Jedi Council consider sending a specialized all Jedi strike team to take out the cloning facility The idea faced some resistance mainly from Han Solo who rightly believed that the mission was dangerous and was unwilling to send all three of his children right into Yuuzhan Vong territory Ultimately the choice was Luke Skywalker s who is currently leading the Jedi who thought that it was their only chance and volunteered himself for the mission Anakin rejected his offer on the grounds that he was too valuable to the New Republic and the Jedi as well as being too important and strong for the Yuuzhan Vong to consider taking alive Instead Anakin volunteers himself and others follow his lead The final group comprises Anakin Ulaha Kore Jacen Solo Jaina Solo Tenel Ka Djo Zekk Tahiri Veila and Alema Rar among others br While the initial part of the mission goes smoothly things begin to get out of hand once the team landed on the worldship orbiting Myrkr While they are there they are repeatedly ambushed by voxyn and Yuuzhan Vong warriors commanded by Nom Anor and Vergere They also run into Nightsister Lomi Plo and her Shadow Academy apprentice Welk After some debate Anakin decides that Lomi Plo and Welk should join them although Zekk predicts that they will be double crossed by the Dark Jedi br There are several casualties along the way to the original or queen voxyn but the biggest blow falls when Anakin is injured Already weary and injured the Jedi soon come under attack once again and although they escape the damage to Anakin has already been done They soon learn that Welk and Lomi Plo have made off with the spacecraft Anakin had intended to use for their getaway taking with them Raynar Thul an old friend of Jaina and Jacen This effectively means that the group are stranded aboard the worldship with a worsening Anakin Anakin soon realizes that his condition would result in the entire group s death He dies later fighting off many Yuuzhan Vong destroying all of the voxyn cloning samples and buying the time his comrades needed in order to escape the Yuuzhan Vong His death is felt by his uncle Luke Skywalker and his mother Leia Solo the former noting that before his death Anakin had already become one with the Force Before his death he leaves his brother Jacen in charge of their group br After a brief period of mourning during which tensions within the group rise Jacen and Jaina decided to split up Jaina wants to retrieve her brother s body while Jacen decides to finish off their original mission the killing of the voxyn queen On his way there he meets the mysterious Vergere who shows him the way to the voxyn queen whom he fights and defeats After this she turns on him and delivers him right into the waiting hands of the Yuuzhan Vong br Jaina meanwhile has successfully retrieved her brother s body and reluctantly leads what is left of their group off of the Myrkr worldship via a stolen Vong frigate leaving Jacen behind with the Yuuzhan Vong Before her departure she has already begun to show signs of dark side tendencies that rose from the loss of Anakin br The Yuuzhan Vong warfleet attacks Coruscant from the OboRin Comet Cluster having assembled at such staging positions like Borleias They use refugee ships containing prisoners from earlier battles to shield the Vong fleet Even with the efforts of legendary leaders such as General Garm Bel Iblis commanding Fleet Group Two Admiral Traest Kre fey commanding Fleet Group One General Wedge Antilles commanding Fleet Group Three Supreme Commander Sien Sovv and Jedi Master Luke Skywalker the Yuuzhan Vong are too plentiful to be thwarted It was said that the Vong fleet numbered tens of thousands and that half of the New Republic space navy was

to her her family and her friends and allies in the past After Mara gives him a severe beating Nom Anor pleads for his life which Mara grudgingly spares so that he would be properly convicted for his crimes in the end br Meanwhile the Millennium Falcon goes on a mission with Harrar to convince the World Brain to cease its destruction of Yuuzhan tar which was intended by Shimrra to completely destroy the world so no one could have it just to spite the Galactic Alliance With the help of Nom Anor and his Shamed Ones and other allies including turncoat Vong warriors the crew of the Falcon and Harrar avert death from the Yuuzhan Vong sent to protect the World Brain Then the Falcon s crew and Harrar make it to the dhuryam and they try to coerce Master Shaper Qelah Kwaad into convincing the brain to cease its destructive activities before they consider killing it In the end though Jacen telepathically tells the World Brain to ignore Shimrra s commands which stops Yuuzhan tar s apocalypse br As Page and his remaining commandos storm the lower levels of Shimrra s Citadel Luke Jaina and Jacen after killing and wounding every Yuuzhan Vong warrior in their path eventually confront Shimrra and his fifteen special Slayer guards inside Shimrra s private coffer at the top of the Citadel The three Jedi are able to kill all of the Slayers whilst Jaina follows Shimrra s Shamed companion Onimi to the control level of Shimrra s coffer There Onimi easily overpowers Jaina and renders her unconscious with a toxin from his fang Jaina notes as she falls unconscious that she was able to sense Onimi through the Force Meanwhile with all of his Slayers dead Shimrra fights Luke and traps him with his royal amphistaff the Scepter of Power before taking out the late Anakin Solo s lightsaber as a mind game to Luke Shimrra wants Luke to know what it feels like to fight something that is part of his order just as the Yuuzhan Vong have to fight Zonama Sekot something that Shimrra believes should have been part of the Vong s order due to its living nature Though Luke is poisoned by the Scepter of Power he is able to take Anakin s lightsaber from Shimrra s grasp and he uses both his own and his late nephew s weapons to decapitate Shimrra With Jacen s own lightsaber lost in the conflict Luke throws him Anakin s lightsaber which Jacen misses and sees it fly away echoing the vision he had on Duro three years earlier and again on Zonama Sekot before the Battle of Yuuzhan tar began Regardless Jacen goes up to the control level of Shimrra s coffer in order to collect Jaina br As Onimi readies Shimrra s coffer to launch into space an awakened but still weakened Jaina is told by the Shamed One who believes that she is the human avatar of the Vong Trickster goddess Yun Harla that he had attained his Force powers by grafting yammosk DNA to his own neural tissue in order to emulate the gods works in creating the universe This was done after Onimi being a Shaper at the time discovered that there was no eighth cortex in the Shaper Qahsa Although he was Shamed as a result he was able to use his powers to not only concoct deadly toxins that he could control in his body but he also manipulated Shimrra into convincing the rest of the Yuuzhan Vong into invading the galaxy therefore throughout Shimrra s reign it was Onimi who had really been controlling the Yuuzhan Vong as its true Supreme Overlord With Shimrra now dead he plans to kill everyone and every living thing in the galaxy so that he could become a new god and fashion a new universe in his image br As the Alliance and their Yuuzhan Vong allies take hold of Shimrra s Citadel Luke is carried away and Han and Leia follow Nom Anor s lead in order to find Jaina and Jacen at the control level of the Supreme Overlord s coffer As they do that the coffer launches for space and the Millennium Falcon piloted by Mara Jade Skywalker with an ailing Luke aboard and Jagged Fel in his commandeered X wing follow the coffer Meanwhile as word of Shimrra s death spreads Nas Choka and his forces refuse to believe it especially after his coffer appears rising up from Yuuzhan tar In the coffer however Jacen confronts Onimi and then hears the voice of his late grandfather Anakin Skywalker telling him to stand firm like he did on Duro So as Jacen fights Onimi he manages to achieve oneness with the Force knowing that he ll never achieve this state again while simultaneously knowing that he ll spend the rest of his life trying to do so As a result Jacen defeats Supreme Overlord Onimi br Han Leia and Nom Anor arrive just in time to watch Jacen s amazing victory as he appears to age five years Onimi meanwhile is reverted of his Shamed deformities but because his deformities were the result of his gaining the Force he loses control of the toxins in his body and dies melting into a puddle of foul hydrocarbons that is absorbed by the coffer s yorik coral floor like a stain br The coffer begins to die off due its now lost connection with Onimi and Nom Anor tries to trick the Solos into going into a garbage chute while he escapes alive With his Vongsense Jacen thwarts his plan and when Nom Anor tries one more time to evade the Solos his hand is cut off by Leia via her lightsaber Nevertheless Nom Anor opens up the entry into the coffer s yorik trema landing craft and simply allows the Solos to leave without him due to his atheism which makes him undesirable in the Yuuzhan Vong s society and his contempt for the Force which makes him undesirable in the Galactic Alliance s society Nom Anor elects to die aboard the coffer despite his earlier vows of surviving the war br The coffer s explosion is viewed by Warmaster Nas Choka and his fleet He announces to all of his forces that the war is over and that

the ground The Vong s weapons become docile and harmless as the invaders are welcomed home br Aboard the Millennium Falcon the Solos are saved from the dying yorik trema and Jacen is able to use Mara s tears and his own to concoct a chemical as the late Vergere has done to cure Luke of Shimrra s amphistaff poison It works and the Skywalkers and Solos collapse into one big embrace glad that they survived and that the war is over C PO and R D watch this scene and lament how at times like these they envy how humans must feel br Following the Yuuzhan Vong War s end with most of the Peace Brigade

throughout the galaxy so that they will be deposited on Zonama Sekot and be taken away into the Unknown Regions where they will be safe and learn to acclimate their culture to peace and also reclaim their connection to the Force To counter those who wish to see the Yuuzhan Vong totally exterminated such as the Bothans among others Galactic Alliance Chief of State Cal Omas saw to it that each and every remaining sample of Alpha Red has been destroyed Meanwhile Zonama Sekot discovers that it is the offspring of the original Yuuzhan tar thus explaining the biological connection that it has with the Yuuzhan Vong br Amidst all of this Luke declares that the Jedi shouldn t be the police force of the galaxy like it once was and that the Order should allow individuals to find their own way in serving the galaxy and more importantly themselves and the Force Jacen for one plans to go on a galactic sojourn so that he could broaden his view of the Force following his battle with Onimi br
