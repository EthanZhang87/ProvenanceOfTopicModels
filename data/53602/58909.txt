Naboo is a fictional planet in the Star Wars universe A bountiful Earth like planet with a mostly green terrain the planet was the homeworld of two independent societies the native Gungans who dwelt in underwater cities and the human Naboo who lived in colonies dispersed across the surface The human denizens of Naboo known simply as the Naboo were governed under an elective monarchy and maintained a peaceful culture that promoted education the arts environmental protection and scientific achievements The primary Naboo city was Theed the planetary capital and the primary Gungan city was Otoh Gunga Naboo is known to be orbited by three moons within the current canon Naboo s moons are known as Ohma D un Onoam and Veruna while in Legends Naboo was known to be orbited by the moons Ohma D un home to a Gungan colony Rori home to a Naboo colony and the icy moon Tasia named for Queen Elsinor den Tasia of Grizmallt br Located in the Chommell sector Naboo is the home planet of Senator Padm Amidala and Representative Jar Jar Binks as well as Senator later Supreme Chancellor and then Emperor Palpatine In Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace it was the site of a blockade by the Trade Federation and the Battle of Naboo between the Federation and the native inhabitants Naboo is seen in four films in the Star Wars series having a prominent role in the first two prequels and glimpsed briefly in Revenge of the Sith and the DVD release of Return of the Jedi br Theed s architecture while referencing Ancient Rome and other classical traditions was heavily inspired by the Frank Lloyd Wright designed Marin County Civic Center in California located near Skywalker Ranch and Industrial Light Magic The swamps of Naboo are home to many species of creatures including the massive Opee Sea Killer in Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace br br br Naboo system br The Naboo system is located in the Chommell sector a region in the galactic Mid Rim Naboo is the third planet of the star system of the same name which orbits the star Naboo The Naboo system comprises five planets Moth Venus type Erep Venus type Naboo Earth type Widow Mars type and Storm Jupiter type The planet Naboo has three moons known throughout various media as Ohma D un Onoam and Veruna br br br Geographic features br Naboo is described as having a porous plasma rich interior without a molten core a rare phenomenon among the planets in the Star Wars universe The surface of Naboo features dense swamps rolling grass plains and verdant hills The Gallo Mountains the largest mountain chain divide the great grass plains of the north from the Lianorm Swamp in the south To the south of the Lianorm Swamp is the Paonga Sea housing the main Gungan settlement of Otoh Gunga the Gungan city visited by Jar Jar Binks Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jinn Underneath the planet s surface is a tremendous maze of underwater passages and caves that are so deep that they go right through the planet The caverns are home to immense aquatic animals and creatures that are never seen on the surface Gungans dominate these under waterways using them as a highway of sorts between their surface Holy Places and their underwater cities br br br History br The aquatic Gungans are native to Naboo though it is not known if they are the original inhabitants but they may have evolved in the interior underground seas or the swamplands br A pre Gungan humanoid civilization inhabited Naboo s surface tens of thousands of years ago leaving behind monuments and ruins scattered throughout the planet The Gungan Sacred Place the largest of these ruins is situated on the northern edge of the Lianorm Swamp Gungans view these ruins as sacred and their builders as the Elders of the planet Eventually both Gungan and Human Naboo scientists agree that the end of the Elder civilization may be the result of the Elders not living in harmony with nature br br br Human colonization br Gungans dominated Naboo for a great time though largely keeping to the swamps and waterways the mountains and grasslands they considered desert like In BBY Before the Battle of Yavin human refugees began fleeing violent revolution on their core world planet of Grizmallt The Grizmallt leader Queen Elsinore den Tasia sponsored a fleet of three ships Beneficent Tasia Mother Vima and Constant to colonize new worlds commanded by the explorer Kwilaan Elsinore den Tasia was honored by having the Naboo moon of Tasia named after her Kwilaan s fleet eventually discovered and crash landed on the planet Naboo around BBY They settled permanently in the mountains and great grass plains There is a belief that Naboo originated from a Gungan word meaning plainsfolk While there were cultural differences leading to tension between humans and Gungans direct conflicts were rare with more disputes arising between different human settlements over time br Naboo s human culture retained a pastoral and nomadic character even as urban centers began to emerge Deeja Peak in the Gallo Mountains became one of the initial human settlements holding political significance Keren and Theed evolved as farming communities with surplus food production supporting a large leisure class Keren later became a commercial hub while Theed developed aristocratic tendencies Kaadara served as a coastal town for the few Nabooan fishermen and Moenia was established as the sole human colony in the traditional Gungan homelands of the Lianorm Swamps br The Naboo developed into a classic feudal society with a hereditary noble class and common folk though unlike most feudal societies there is no record of a subservient serf class Naboo city states traded with each other and with the Gungans Generally the city states acknowledged a ceremonial High King a position that at times rotated between the city state princes though at other times was vested in a royal house This ceremonial position was largely powerless and a form of peerage democracy evolved br King Narmele the Explorer colonized Naboo s swampy moon of Rori sometime around BBY A city there still bears his name Some scientists contend that earlier colonists settled Rori before the Narmele colony but if this is true no trace of them has been found Naboo has two other moons the water moon Ohma D un later colonized jointly by both Naboo humans and Gungans after the Battle of Naboo and the barren grey ice moon of Tasia named after the Grizmallt Queen who sponsored the original colonial mission br Naboo s culture places a significant emphasis on family extending from commoners to the royal family Wives exhibit intense loyalty to their husbands and those convicted of adultery may face execution br br br Naboo during the Old Republic and the Rise of the Empire br In BBY a crisis led to a large scale conflict engulfing all the human Naboo city states though there was no evidence of Gungan participation Theed s King Jafan ended the conflict uniting all Nabooans under his leadership by BBY Jafan ushered in the Great Time of Peace and Theed became the Royal Capital eclipsing Deeja Peak Still provincial and little populated the Naboo remained wary of off world influences Under the Jafan dynasty Theed became a showplace of decorative architecture and dazzling craftsmanship such as the Naboo Royal Starship and the royal palace at Theed Note the Theed royal palace in the films is a detailed physical miniature model and sometimes computer generated exterior but the interior was filmed at Caserta Palace in Italy The forecourt to the palace features statues of Naboo philosophers The Jafan Dynasty reigned as hereditary rulers until the last of their line expired circa BBY Since then the position of monarch has been an elected post with a fluid constitution that would allow for hereditary rulership to be vested in a noble dynasty if the people so desired br By King Veruna s reign BBY Naboo had become a major player in the galactic plasma energy trade market Long known as a source of plasma the energy source that powers everything from simple lights on Queen Amidala s robes to great Gungan underwater cities and capital starships high grade plasma veins were discovered below the streets of Theed This led King Veruna BBY and then Senator Palpatine to build a great plasma mining and refining facility in the heart of the capital The Banking Guild financed the construction As the Naboo traditionally held an aversion to off world trade they agreed to have the powerful Trade Federation buy the plasma at a fixed price The Federation however took advantage of the Naboo s lack of interstellar commercial experience and sold the plasma for greatly marked up prices selling the Naboo short br King Veruna recognizing the impending military conflict expanded the Space Fighter Corps and organized the N starfighter squadron The Theed Hangar was constructed next to the refining station to accommodate the new military forces Despite being perceived as a provocative measure especially by Senator Palpatine this decision was made in response to the Naboo s protests against the trade agreement with the Federation With the people and the senator unhappy with his military expansion Veruna was forced to abdicate in favor of the Princess Padm Naberrie Later Veruna would be assassinated while in exile Taking Amidala as her Name of State the young Queen Padm promised to end the conflict without violence br Once in power Queen Amidala opened negotiations with the Trade Federation However the Federation was scandalized by Naboo s resistance to its authority which coincided with a Galactic Republic Senate tax on interstellar trade Both actions were perceived by Federation leadership as threatening to their commercial interests and power The Federation answered with a military blockade of Naboo with the aim of forcing Naboo into subservience and to hopefully intimidate the Senate into repealing the taxation measure The Federation leadership was secretly advised and manipulated by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious br The Jedi Knights Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi were sent to mediate but were unsuccessful Naboo fell quickly though they had a powerful Armed Corps the Royal Advisory Council held off action until all negotiations failed The Naboo government and citizens were captured and were to be held in detention camps outside the cities Soon rescued by Jinn and Kenobi Queen Amidala left Naboo to personally seek aid in the Galactic Senate Captain Panaka and others were to organize a resistance movement in the meantime br Once on Coruscant Queen Amidala addressed the senate The Federation had powerful and rich allies and all the Queen could do was to call for a Vote of No Confidence in the senate leadership of Supreme Chancellor Valorum In this she hoped to force a change for a more favorable chancellorship The Queen returned to her homeworld to lead the resistance herself Upon returning home Queen Amidala sought the help of the reclusive Gungans urging joint action against the common enemy The Gungans agreed to form an alliance and led an army against the Federation s mechanical forces Captain Panaka organized the Space Fighter Corps launching a final effort against the Federation capital ship The Fighter Corps successfully destroyed the Trade Federation capital ship deactivating all B Battle Droids and capturing Trade Federation leaders Nute Gunray and Rune Haako Qui Gon Jinn lost his life during the battle but the Naboo and Gungan Alliance ultimately triumphed over the Federation In recognition of her heroic efforts the Naboo people proposed amending the constitution to allow Padm Amidala and possibly her heirs to reign for life Padm Amidala declined the honor br After serving the maximum two year terms Padm Amidala was replaced by Queen Jamillia BBY Jamillia asked for Padm Amidala to continue serving Naboo as its Senator Padm Amidala couldn t refuse the Queen and returned to politics after a brief respite Jar Jar Binks was also appointed as the alternate Senator becoming the first Gungan to represent the planet of Naboo Most of the prejudices of both species disappeared when Amidala and Boss Nass managed to unite both species during the Battle of Naboo br Galactic Republic Senate politics was a new forum for Padm Amidala In the meantime Palpatine a Nabooan himself remained Supreme Chancellor of the Republic and his hard line stances were generally supported by a Naboo still rebuilding after occupation Many on Naboo and in the Galactic Senate desired a centralized executive but Padm Amidala consistently voted against the Military Creation Act This act would have empowered the Senate to establish a standing military to serve under the discretion of the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic Padm Amidala however was outmaneuvered and after a proposal by Representative Jar Jar Binks for the granting of emergency powers to the Chancellor a military was created to counter the Separatist movement During the Clone Wars the Confederacy of Independent Systems including the Trade Federation launched an unsuccessful campaign of invasion and conquest against Naboo br br br Imperial Naboo br After the rise of the Empire Queen Apailana openly opposed the new regime When diplomatic negotiations between Naboo and the Empire proved unsuccessful Apailana considered military options and provided refuge to Jedi violating Order Subsequently she was assassinated by the elite st Legion also known as Vader s Fist solidifying Imperial control over the planet br In years to come the Naboo would generally support the positions of Chancellor and later Emperor Palpatine including the establishment of the Empire thus becoming an Imperial satellite state Many Naboo would serve in the Imperial Services and Captain Panaka would become an aide to the Emperor and later it would become Imperial Naboo br Popular Queen Kylantha would reign throughout the Imperial years Kylantha appointed Padm Amidala s niece Pooja Naberrie to the Imperial Senate There Pooja would be a contemporary of her cousin Princess Leia of Alderaan but they would not know of each other s biological relationship until years after the Battle of Yavin Kylantha was not a supporter of the old Republic but neither was she an Imperial proponent Kylantha refused to alter the democratic structure of the Naboo constitution It is believed Kylantha was secretly pro Rebellion despite being appointed by the Empire after Apailana s assassination br Star Wars Shattered Empire reveals that shortly after the Battle of Endor the Empire used a superweapon to negatively affect the planet s weather Leia was visiting her mother s home world at the time of the attack br br br Royal traditions br br br Names of state br Often when a Nabooan enters into political life he or she adopts a Name of State This name is used for public occasions and represents the honor and dignity of the office one chooses Padm Naberrie adopted the anonymous Name of State Amidala when she became Princess of Theed BBY and later Queen of the Naboo BBY Padm retained the name Amidala when she became Naboo s Senator for the Galactic Republic BBY br br br Scar of Remembrance br The Scar of Remembrance is used as part of the ruler of the planet Naboo s make up It is a symbol of remembrance of the days before the Great Time of Peace which had been brought about by King Jafan the ruler who united Naboo Also worn by Naboo s monarchs as part of their makeup are the coloured
