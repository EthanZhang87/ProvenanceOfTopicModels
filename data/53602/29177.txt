title: Spaghetti Western
id: 29177
The spaghetti Western is a broad subgenre of Western films produced in Europe It emerged in the mid s in the wake of Sergio Leone s filmmaking style and international box office success The term was used by foreign critics because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians br Leone s films and other core spaghetti Westerns are often described as having eschewed criticized or even demythologized many of the conventions of traditional U S Westerns This was partly intentional and partly the context of a different cultural background br br br Terminology br According to veteran spaghetti Western actor Aldo Sambrell the phrase spaghetti Western was coined by Spanish journalist Alfonso S nchez in reference to the Italian food spaghetti Spaghetti Westerns are also known as Italian Westerns or primarily in Japan Macaroni Westerns In Italy the genre is typically referred to as western all italiana Italian style Western Italo Western is also used especially in Germany br br br Similar concepts br The term Eurowesterns has been used to broadly refer to all non Italian Western movies from Europe including the West German Winnetou films and the Eastern Bloc Red Western films Taking its name from the Spanish rice dish Paella Western has been used to refer to Western films produced in Spain The Japanese film Tampopo was promoted as a Ramen Western br br br Production br The majority of the films in the spaghetti Western genre were actually international coproductions by Italy and Spain and sometimes France West Germany Britain Portugal Greece Israel Yugoslavia and the United States Over six hundred European Westerns were made between and br These movies were originally released in Italian or with Italian dubbing but as most of the films featured multilingual casts and sound was post synched most western all italiana do not have an official dominant language br The typical spaghetti Western team was made up of an Italian director an Italo Spanish technical staff and a cast of Italian Spanish and sometimes West German and American actors br br br Filming locations br br Most spaghetti Westerns filmed between and were made on low budgets and shot at Cinecitt studios and at various locations around southern Italy and Spain Many of the stories take place in the dry landscapes of the American Southwest and Northern Mexico thus common filming locations were the Tabernas Desert and the Cabo de Gata N jar Natural Park an area of volcanic origin known for its wide sandy beaches both of which are in the Province of Almer a in Southeastern Spain Some sets and studios built for spaghetti Westerns survived as theme parks such as Texas Hollywood Mini Hollywood and Western Leone and continue to be used as film sets Other filming locations used were in central and southern Italy such as the parks of Valle del Treja between Rome and Viterbo the area of Camposecco next to Camerata Nuova characterized by a karst topography the hills around Castelluccio the area around the Gran Sasso mountain and the Tivoli s quarries and Sardinia God s Gun was filmed in Israel br br br Context and origins br br br Early European Westerns br European Westerns are as old as filmmaking itself The Lumi re brothers had their first public screening of films in and already in Gabriel Veyre shot Repas d Indien Indian Banquet for them Joe Hamman starred as Arizona Bill in films made in the French horse country of Camargue br In Italy the American West as a dramatic setting for spectacles goes back at least as far as Giacomo Puccini s opera La fanciulla del West The Girl of the West which is sometimes considered to be the first spaghetti Western br The first Western movie made in Italy was La voce del sangue produced by the Turin film studio Itala Film In La vampira Indiana was released a combination of Western and vampire film It was directed by Vincenzo Leone father of Sergio Leone and starred his mother Bice Valerian in the title role as the Indian princess Fatale The Italians also made Wild Bill Hickok films while the Germans released backwoods Westerns featuring Bela Lugosi as Uncas br Of the Western related European films before the one that attracted the most attention is arguably Luis Trenker s Der Kaiser von Kalifornien about John Sutter Another Italian Western is Girl of the Golden West The film s title alludes to the opera The Girl of the Golden West by Giacomo Puccini but is not an adaptation of it It was one of a handful of Westerns to be made during the silent film and Fascist Italy eras Forerunners of the genre were also Giorgio Ferroni s Il fanciullo del West The Boy in the West and Fernando Cerchio s Il bandolero stanco starring Erminio Macario and Renato Rascel respectively br After World War II there were scattered European uses of Western settings mostly for comedy musical or otherwise A cycle of Western comedies was initiated in with La sceriffa and Il terrore dell Oklahoma followed by other films starring comedy specialists such as Walter Chiari Ugo Tognazzi Raimondo Vianello and Fernandel An Italian critic has compared these comedies to American Bob Hope vehicles br br br Origins of the genre br br The first American British Western filmed in Spain was The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw directed by Raoul Walsh It was followed by Savage Guns a British Spanish Western again filmed in Spain It marked the beginning of Spain as a suitable film shooting location for any kind of European Western In an Italian company coproduced the French Taste of Violence with a Mexican Revolution theme In three non comedy Italo Spanish Westerns were produced Gunfight at Red Sands Implacable Three and Gunfight at High Noon br In Bruno Bozzetto released his traditionally animated feature film West and Soda a Western parody with a marked spaghetti Western theme despite having been released a year after Sergio Leone s seminal spaghetti Western A Fistful of Dollars development of West and Soda actually began a year earlier than Fistful s and lasted longer mainly because of the use of more time demanding animation over regular acting For this reason Bozzetto claims to have invented the spaghetti Western genre br Because there is no real consensus about where to draw the exact line between spaghetti Westerns and other Eurowesterns or other Westerns in general it cannot be said which film is definitively the first spaghetti Western However saw the breakthrough of this genre with more than twenty productions or coproductions from Italian companies and more than half a dozen Westerns by Spanish or Spanish American companies Furthermore by far the most commercially successful of this lot was Sergio Leone s A Fistful of Dollars It was the innovations in cinematic style music acting and story of Leone s first Western that decided that spaghetti Westerns became a distinct subgenre and not just a number of films looking like American Westerns br br br A Fistful of Dollars and its impact br In this seminal film Leone used a distinct visual style with large face close ups to tell the story of a hero entering a town that is ruled by two outlaw gangs and ordinary social relations are nonexistent The hero betrays and plays the gangs against each other to make money He uses his cunning and exceptional weapons skill to assist a family threatened by both gangs His treachery is exposed and he is severely beaten but in the end he defeats the remaining gang The interactions in this story range between cunning and irony the tricks deceits unexpected actions and sarcasm of the hero and pathos terror and brutality against defenseless people and against the hero after his doublecross has been revealed Ennio Morricone s innovative score expresses a similar duality between quirky and unusual sounds and instruments and sacral dramatizing for the big confrontation scenes Another important novelty was Clint Eastwood s performance as the man with no name an unshaven sarcastic insolent Western antihero with personal goals in mind and with distinct visuals to boot the squint the cigarillo the poncho etc br The spaghetti Western was born flourished and faded in a highly commercial production environment The Italian low popular film production was usually low budget and low profit and the easiest way to success was imitating a proven success When the typically low budget production A Fistful of Dollars turned into a remarkable box office success the industry eagerly lapped up its innovations Most subsequent spaghetti Westerns tried to get a ragged laconic hero with superhuman weapon skill preferably one who looked like Clint Eastwood Franco Nero John Garko and Terence Hill started out that way Anthony Steffen and others stayed that way throughout their spaghetti Western careers br br Whoever the hero was he would join an outlaw gang to further his own secret agenda as in A Pistol for Ringo Blood for a Silver Dollar Vengeance Is a Dish Served Cold Renegade Riders and others while Beyond the Law has a bandit infiltrate society and become a sheriff There would be a flamboyant Mexican bandit Gian Maria Volont from A Fistful of Dollars otherwise Tomas Milian or most often Fernando Sancho and a grumpy old man often an undertaker to serve as sidekick for the hero For the love interest ranchers daughters schoolmarms and barroom maidens were overshadowed by young Latin women desired by dangerous men for which actresses such as Nicoletta Machiavelli or Rosalba Neri carried on Marianne Koch s role of Marisol in the Leone film The terror of the villains against their defenseless victims became just as ruthless as in A Fistful of Dollars or more and their brutalization of the hero when his treachery is disclosed became just as merciless or more similar to securing the latter s retribution br In the beginning some films mixed some of these new devices with the borrowed U S Western devices typical for most of the spaghetti Westerns For example in Sergio Corbucci s Minnesota Clay that appeared two months after A Fistful of Dollars an American style tragic gunfighter hero who confronts two evil gangs one Mexican and one Anglo with as in A Fistful of Dollars the leader of the latter being the town sheriff br In Johnny Oro a traditional Western sheriff and a mixed race bounty killer are forced into an uneasy alliance when Mexican bandits and Native Americans assault the town In A Pistol for Ringo a traditional sheriff commissions a money oriented hero played by Giuliano Gemma as deadly but with more pleasing manners than Eastwood s character to infiltrate a gang of Mexican bandits whose leader is played typically by Fernando Sancho br br br Further developments of the genre br As with Leone s first Western the Dollars Trilogy strongly influenced the further developments of the genre as did Sergio Corbucci s Django and Enzo Barboni s two Trinity films as well as some other successful spaghetti Westerns br br br For a Few Dollars More and unstable partnerships br br After when Leone s second Western For a Few Dollars More brought a larger box office success the profession of bounty hunter became the choice of occupation of spaghetti Western heroes in films such as Arizona Colt Vengeance Is Mine Ten Thousand Dollars for a Massacre The Ugly Ones Dead Men Don t Count and Any Gun Can Play In The Great Silence and A Minute to Pray a Second to Die the heroes instead fight bounty killers During this era many heroes and villains in spaghetti Westerns began carrying a musical watch after its ingenious use in For a Few Dollars More br Spaghetti Westerns also began featuring a pair of different heroes In Leone s film Eastwood s character is an unshaven bounty hunter dressed similarly to his character in A Fistful of Dollars who enters an unstable partnership with Colonel Mortimer Lee Van Cleef an older bounty killer who uses more sophisticated weaponry and wears a suit and in the end turns out to also be an avenger In the following years there was a deluge of spaghetti Westerns with a pair of heroes with most often conflicting motives Examples include a lawman and an outlaw And the Crows Will Dig Your Grave an army officer and an outlaw Bury Them Deep an avenger and a covert army officer The Hills Run Red an avenger and a covert guilty party Viva Django aka W Django an avenger and a con man The Dirty Outlaws an outlaw posing as a sheriff and a bounty hunter Man With the Golden Pistol aka Doc Hands of Steel and an outlaw posing as his twin and a bounty hunter posing as a sheriff A Few Dollars for Django br The theme of age in For a Few Dollars More in which the younger bounty killer learns valuable lessons from his more experienced colleague and eventually becomes his equal is taken up in Day of Anger and Death Rides a Horse In both cases Lee Van Cleef carries on as the older hero versus Giuliano Gemma and John Phillip Law respectively br br br Zapata Westerns br br One variant of the hero pair was a revolutionary Mexican bandit and a mostly money oriented American from the United States frontier These films are sometimes called Zapata Westerns The first was Damiano Damiani s A Bullet for the General and then followed Sergio Sollima s trilogy The Big Gundown Face to Face and Run Man Run br Sergio Corbucci s The Mercenary and Compa eros and Tepepa by Giulio Petroni are also considered Zapata Westerns Many of these films enjoyed both good takes at the box office and attention from critics They are often interpreted as a leftist critique of the typical Hollywood handling of the Mexican Revolution and of imperialism in general br br br The Good the Bad and the Ugly and universal betrayal br br In Leone s The Good the Bad and the Ugly there is still the scheme of a pair of heroes vs a villain but it is somewhat relaxed as here all three parties were driven by a money motive In subsequent films like Any Gun Can Play whose Italian title Vado l ammazzo e torno is itself a quote from Leone s film One Dollar Too Many and Kill Them All and Come Back Alone several main characters repeatedly form alliances and betray each other for monetary gain br Sabata and If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death directed by Gianfranco Parolini introduce into similar betrayal environments a kind of hero molded on the Mortimer character from For a Few Dollars More only without any vengeance motive and with more outrageous trick weapons Fittingly enough Sabata is portrayed by Lee Van Cleef himself while John Garko plays the very similar Sartana protagonist Parolini made some more Sabata movies while Giuliano Carnimeo made a whole series of Sartana films with Garko br br br Django and the tragic hero br Beside the first three spaghetti Westerns by Leone a most influential film was Sergio Corbucci s Django starring Franco Nero Django was one of the most violent spaghetti Westerns The titular character is torn between several motives money or revenge and his choices bring misery to him and to a woman close to him Indicative of this film s influence on the spaghetti Western style Django is the hero s name in a plenitude of subsequent Westerns br Although his character is not named Django Franco Nero brings a similar ambience to Texas Adios and Massacre Time in which the hero must confront surprising and dangerous family relations Similar prodigal son stories followed including Chuck Moll Keoma The Return of Ringo The Forgotten Pistolero One Thousand Dollars on the Black Johnny Hamlet and also Seven Dollars on the Red br Another type of wronged hero is set up and must clear himself from accusations Giuliano Gemma starred in a series of successful films carrying this theme Adi s gringo For a Few Extra Dollars Long Days of Vengeance Wanted and to some extent Blood for a Silver Dollar in which his character is most often called Gary br The wronged hero who becomes an avenger appears in many spaghetti Westerns Among the more commercially successful films with a hero dedicated to vengeance For a Few Dollars More Once Upon a Time in the West Today We Kill Tomorrow We Die A Reason to Live a Reason to Die Death Rides a Horse Django Prepare a Coffin The Deserter Hate for Hate Halleluja for Django those with whom he cooperates typically have conflicting motivations br br br Trinity films and the triumph of comedy br br In the wave of spaghetti Westerns reached its crest comprising one third of the Italian film production only to collapse to one tenth in However the considerable box office success of Enzo Barboni s They Call Me Trinity and its pyramidal follow up Trinity Is Still My Name gave Italian filmmakers a new model to emulate The main characters were played by Terence Hill and Bud Spencer who had already cooperated as a pair of heroes in three earlier spaghetti Westerns God Forgives I Don t Boot Hill and Ace High directed by Giuseppe Colizzi The humor started in those movies with scenes with comedy fighting but the Barboni films became burlesque comedies They feature the quick but lazy Trinity Hill and his big strong and irritable brother Bambino Spencer br The stories lampoon stereotypical Western characters such as diligent farmers lawmen and bounty hunters There was a wave of Trinity inspired films with quick and strong heroes the former often called Trinity or coming from a place called Trinity and with few or no killings Because the two model stories contained religious pacifists to account for the absence of gunplay all of the successors contained religious groups or at least priests sometimes as one of the heroes br The music for the two Trinity Westerns composed by Franco Micalizzi and Guido Maurizio De Angelis respectively also reflected the change to a lighter and more sentimental mood The Trinity inspired films also adopted this less serious and often maligned style br Some critics deplore these post Trinity films and their soundtracks as a degeneration of the real spaghetti Westerns Indeed Hill s and Spencer s skillful use of body language was a hard act to follow and it is significant that the most successful of the post Trinity films featured Hill Man of the East A Genius Two Partners and a Dupe Spencer It Can Be Done Amigo and a pair of Hill Spencer lookalikes in Carambola A spaghetti Western old hand Franco Nero also worked in this subgenre with Cipolla Colt and Tomas Milian plays an outrageous quick bounty hunter modeled on Charlie Chaplin s Little Tramp in Sometimes Life Is Hard Eh Providence and Here We Go Again Eh Providence br br br Twilight of the genre br Terence Hill could still draw large audiences in a post Trinity Western My Name Is Nobody with Henry Fonda and a caper story Western A Genius Two Partners and a Dupe The following year Franco Nero achieved a similar draw as a Django style hero in Keoma However by the end of the s the different types of spaghetti Westerns had lost their following among mainstream cinema audiences and the production ground to a virtual halt Belated attempts to revive the genre included the comedy film Buddy Goes West and a Spanish American coproduction Comin at Ya which was shot in D and Django Strikes Again br br br Other notable themes br br br Cult spaghetti Westerns br Some movies that were not very successful at the box office still earn a cult status in some segment of the audience because of certain extraordinary features in story and or presentation One cult spaghetti Western that has also drawn attention from critics is Giulio Questi s Django Kill Other cult items are Cesare Canevari s Matalo Tony Anthony s Blindman and Joaqu n Luis Romero Marchent s Cut Throats Nine the latter among gore film audiences br br br Historical backgrounds br The few spaghetti Westerns containing historical characters like Buffalo Bill Wyatt Earp Billy the Kid etc appear mainly before A Fistful of Dollars had put its mark on the genre Likewise and in contrast to the contemporary German Westerns few films feature Native Americans When they appear they are more often portrayed as victims of discrimination than as dangerous foes The only fairly successful spaghetti Western with a Native American main character played by Burt Reynolds in his only European Western outing is Sergio Corbucci s Navajo Joe in which the supposedly Navajo village is wiped out by bandits during the first minutes and the avenger hero spends the rest of the film dealing mostly with Anglos and Mexicans until the final showdown at a Native American burial ground br br br Ancient myths and classic literature br br Several spaghetti Westerns are inspired by classical myths and dramas Titles such as Fedra West also called Ballad of a Bounty Hunter and Johnny Hamlet signify the connection to Greek myth the plays by Euripides and Racine and the play by William Shakespeare respectively The latter also inspired s Dust in the Sun which follows the original more closely than Johnny Hamlet in which the hero survives The Forgotten Pistolero is based on the vengeance of Orestes There are similarities between the story of The Return of Ringo and the last canto of Homer s Odyssey Fury of Johnny Kid follows Shakespeare s Romeo and Juliet but again with a different ending the loving couple leave together while their families annihilate each other br br br Musicals br Some Italian Western films were made as vehicles for musical stars like Ferdinando Baldi s Rita of the West featuring Rita Pavone and Terence Hill In non singing roles were Ringo Starr as a villain in Blindman and French rock n roll veteran Johnny Hallyday as the gunfighter and avenger hero in Sergio Corbucci s The Specialists br br br East Asian connections br The story of A Fistful of Dollars was closely based on Akira Kurosawa s Yojimbo Kurosawa sued Sergio Leone for plagiarism and was compensated with the exclusive distribution rights to the movie in Japan where its hero Clint Eastwood was already a huge star due to the popularity of the TV series Rawhide Leone would have done far better financially by obtaining Kurosawa s advance permission to use Yojimbo s script Requiem for a Gringo shows many traces from another well known Japanese film Masaki Kobayashi s Harakiri br When Asian martial arts films started to draw crowds in European cinema houses the producers of spaghetti Westerns tried to hang on this time not by adapting storylines but rather by directly including martial arts in the films performed by Eastern actors for example Chen Lee in My Name Is Shanghai Joe or Lo Lieh teaming up with Lee Van Cleef in The Stranger and the Gunfighter br br br Political allegories br br Some spaghetti Westerns incorporate political overtones particularly from the political left An example is Requiescant featuring Italian author and film director Pier Paolo Pasolini as a major supporting character Pasolini s character is a priest who espouses Liberation theology The film concerns oppression of poor Mexicans by rich Anglos and ends on a call for arms but it does not fit easily as a Zapata Western for it lacks the typical hero pair of a flamboyant Latin revolutionary and an Anglo specialist The Price of Power serves a political allegory about the assassination of John F Kennedy and racism The movie concerns the assassination of an American president in Dallas Texas by a group of Southern white supremacists who frame an innocent African American They are opposed by an unstable partnership between a whistleblower Giuliano Gemma and a political aide br br br Sexuality br Although it is intimated in some films such as Django Kill and Requiescant open homosexuality plays a marginal part in spaghetti Westerns An exception is Giorgio Capitani s The Ruthless Four in effect a gay version of John Huston s The Treasure of the Sierra Madre in which the explicit homosexual relation between two of its male main characters and some gay cueing scenes are embedded with other forms of man to man relations through the story br br br Reception br In the s critics recognized that the American genres were rapidly changing The genre most identifiably American the Western seemed to be evolving into a new rougher form For many critics Sergio Leone s films were part of the problem Leone s Dollars Trilogy was not the beginning of the spaghetti Western cycle in Italy but for some Americans Leone s films represented the true beginning of the Italian invasion of an American genre br Christopher Frayling in his noted book on the Italian Western describes American critical reception of the spaghetti Western cycle as to a large extent confined to a sterile debate about the cultural roots of the American Hollywood Western He remarked that few critics dared admit that they were in fact bored with an exhausted Hollywood genre br Frayling noted that Pauline Kael was willing to acknowledge this critical ennui and thus appreciate how a film like Akira Kurosawa s Yojimbo could exploit the conventions of the Western genre while debunking its morality Frayling and other film scholars such as Bondanella argue that this revisionism was the key to Leone s success and to some degree to that of the spaghetti Western genre as a whole br br br Legacy br br Spaghetti Westerns have left their mark on popular culture strongly influencing numerous works produced in and outside of Italy In later years there were the return of stories films Django Strikes Again with Franco Nero and Troublemakers with Terence Hill and Bud Spencer Clint Eastwood s first American Western film Hang Em High incorporates elements of spaghetti Westerns br American director Quentin Tarantino has utilized elements of spaghetti Westerns in his films Kill Bill combined with kung fu movies Inglourious Basterds set in Nazi occupied France Django Unchained set in the American South during the time of slavery The Hateful Eight set in Wyoming post US Civil War and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood about fictional American actor Rick Dalton sometimes working in spaghetti Westerns br The Back to the Future trilogy pays homage to spaghetti Westerns especially Sergio Leone s Dollars Trilogy on a variety of occasions most notably in the third film The American animated film Rango incorporates elements of spaghetti Westerns including a character the mystical Spirit of the West regarded as a sort of deity among the characters appearing to the protagonist as an elderly Man with No Name The Japanese film Tampopo was promoted as a ramen Western Japanese director Takashi Miike paid tribute to the genre with Sukiyaki Western Django a Western set in Japan that derives influence from both Django and the Dollars Trilogy br The Bollywood film Sholay was often referred to as a Curry Western A more accurate genre label for the film is the Dacoit Western as it combined the conventions of Indian dacoit films such as Mother India and Gunga Jumna with that of spaghetti Westerns Sholay spawned its own genre of Dacoit Western films in Bollywood during the s br In the Soviet Union the spaghetti Western was adapted into the Ostern Eastern genre of Soviet films The Wild West setting was replaced by an Eastern setting in the steppes of the Caucasus while Western stock characters such as cowboys and Indians were replaced by Caucasian stock characters such as bandits and harems A famous example of the genre was White Sun of the Desert which was popular in the Soviet Union br American heavy metal band Metallica has used a Ennio Morricone s composition The Ecstasy of Gold from The Good the Bad and the Ugly to open several of their concerts An Australian band the Tango Saloon combined elements of tango music with influences from spaghetti Western scores The band Ghoultown also derives influence from spaghetti Westerns The music video for the song Knights of Cydonia by the English rock band Muse is influenced by spaghetti Westerns The band Big Audio Dynamite used music samples from spaghetti Westerns when mixing their song Medicine Show Within the song there are samples from spaghetti Western movies such as A Fistful of Dollars The Good the Bad and the Ugly and Duck You Sucker br Video game studio Rockstar Games utilized aspects of the spaghetti Western and paid homage to it in their Red Dead Redemption series as well as in its predecessor Red Dead Revolver br br br Retrospective of the Venice Film Festival br br In a retrospective took place as part of
