which humans and many species of aliens often humanoid co exist with robots typically referred to in the films as droids which may be programmed for personal assistance or battle Space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology The planets range from wealthy planet wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes Virtually any Earth biome along with many fictional ones has its counterpart as a Star Wars planet which in most cases teem with sentient and non sentient alien life The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae Spacecraft range from small starfighters to large capital ships such as the Star Destroyers as well as space stations such as the moon sized Death Stars Telecommunication includes two way audio and audiovisual screens holographic projections and hyperspace transmission br The universe of Star Wars is generally similar to the real universe but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative stories One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which is described in the original film as an energy field created by all living things that binds the galaxy together The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god Through training and meditation those whom the Force is strong with exhibit various superpowers such as telekinesis precognition telepathy and manipulation of physical energy It is believed nothing is impossible for the Force The mentioned powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other the Jedi peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non attachment and arbitration and the Sith who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression While Jedi Knights can be numerous the Dark Lords of the Sith or Darths are intended to be limited to two a master and their apprentice br The franchise is set against a backdrop of galactic conflict involving republics and empires such as the evil Galactic Empire The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called the lightsaber a blade of plasma that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts The rest of the population as well as renegades and soldiers use plasma powered blaster firearms In the outer reaches of the galaxy crime syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments while illicit activities include smuggling and slavery br The combination of science fiction and fantasy elements makes Star Wars a

chivalry and Jungian archetypes such as the shadow br There are also many references to Christianity such as in the appearance of Darth Maul whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil Anakin was conceived of a virgin birth and is assumed to be the Chosen One a messianic individual However unlike Jesus Anakin falls from grace remaining evil as Darth Vader until Return of the Jedi According to Adam Driver sequel trilogy villain Kylo Ren who idolizes Vader believes he is doing what he thinks is right George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption br The saga draws heavily from the hero s journey an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell Each character primarily Anakin Luke and Rey follows the steps of the cycle or undergoes its reversal becoming the villain A defining step of the journey is Atonement with the Father Obi Wan s loss of a father figure could have impacted his relationship with Anakin whom both Obi Wan and Palpatine are fatherlike mentors to Luke s discovery that Vader is his father has strong repercussions on the saga and is regarded as one of the most influential plot twists in cinema Supreme Leader Snoke encourages Kylo Ren to kill his father Han Solo Kylo uses the fact that Rey is an orphan to tempt her into joining the dark side According to Inverse the final scene in The Last Jedi which depicts servant children playing with a toy of Luke and one boy using the Force symbolizes that the Force can be found in people with humble beginnings br br br Historical influences br Political science has been an important element of Star Wars since the franchise launched in focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship Battles featuring the Ewoks and Gungans against the Empire and Trade Federation respectively represent the clash between a primitive society and a more advanced one similar to the Vietnam American War Darth Vader s design was initially inspired by Samurai armor and also incorporated a German military helmet Originally Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the Schutzstaffel served Adolf Hitler this was condensed into one character in the form of Vader Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I German shock troopers Imperial officers wear uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II and political and security officers resemble the black clad SS down to the stylized silver death s head on their caps World War II terms were used for names in the films e g the planets Kessel a term that refers to a group of encircled forces and Hoth after a German general who served on the snow laden Eastern Front Shots of the commanders looking through AT AT walker viewscreens in The Empire Strikes Back resemble tank interiors and space battles in the original film were based on World War I and World War II dogfights br Palpatine being a chancellor before becoming the Emperor in the prequel trilogy alludes to Hitler s role before appointing himself F hrer Lucas has also drawn parallels to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar Napoleon Bonaparte and politicians like Richard Nixon The Great Jedi Purge mirrors the events of the Night of the Long Knives The corruption of the Galactic Republic is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman Republic and the formation of an empire br On the inspiration for the First Order formed from the ashes of the Empire The Force Awakens director J J Abrams spoke of conversations the writers had about how the Nazis could have escaped to Argentina after WWII and started working together again br br br br br br br br br br br br Cultural impact br br The Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on popular culture with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life Phrases like evil empire and May the Force be with you have become part of the popular lexicon The first Star Wars film in was a cultural unifier enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people The film can be said to have helped launch the science fiction boom of the late s and early s making science fiction films a mainstream genre The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages with popular examples including Hardware Wars Spaceballs The Family Guy Trilogy and Robot Chicken Star Wars br In the Library of Congress selected the original Star Wars film for preservation in the U S National Film Registry as being culturally historically or aesthetically significant The Empire Strikes Back was selected in and Return of the Jedi was selected in mm reels of the Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints but it was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases br br br Industry br The original Star Wars film was a huge success for th Century Fox and was credited for reinvigorating the company Within three weeks of the film s release the studio s stock price doubled to a record high Prior to th Century Fox s greatest annual profits were million while in the company broke that record by posting a profit of million The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate With over billion in worldwide box office receipts Star Wars is the second highest grossing film franchise of all time br Star Wars fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films switching the focus of Hollywood made films from deep meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict themes and irony to sprawling special effects laden blockbusters as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways Before Star Wars special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the s The commercial success of Star Wars created a boom in state of the art special effects in the late s Along with Jaws Star Wars started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did br Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book The Great Movies Like The Birth of a Nation and Citizen Kane Star Wars was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after It began a new generation of special effects and high energy motion pictures The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new high concept genre for filmmakers to build upon Finally along with Steven Spielberg s Jaws it shifted the film industry s focus away from personal filmmaking of the s and towards fast paced big budget blockbusters for younger audiences br Some critics have blamed Star Wars and Jaws for ruining Hollywood by shifting its focus from sophisticated films such as The Godfather Taxi Driver and Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy and for the industry shift from stand alone one and done films towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels One such critic Peter Biskind complained When all was said and done Lucas and Spielberg returned the s audience grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films to the simplicities of the pre s Golden Age of movies They marched backward through the looking glass In an opposing view Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws Lucas and Spielberg didn t betray cinema at all they plugged it back into the grid returning the medium to its roots as a

to create their own non canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy In recent years this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films In Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star

so well known educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource For example a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio visual scenery to enhance their performance Others have used the films to encourage second level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers Similarly psychiatrists in New Zealand and the U S have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of
