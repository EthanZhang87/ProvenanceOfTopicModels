of personality and ideas In Sight Sound s otherwise critical review of the film Tim Hayes wrote Apart from Ben Mendelsohn s weaselly Orson Krennic and perhaps Donnie Yen as a blind samurai the faces are unmemorable and the characters unexceptional Meredith Woerner of Los Angeles Times called the white cape which Krennic wears the standout piece of the film writing that it unfolds a world of menace by simply gliding over a bloody beach or whipping through the rain without ever showing even the tiniest speck of dirt br Conversely Joshua Starnes wrote that Krennic s failures against the Rebels and pursuit of praise do not make him a particularly sinister or effective villain and the film continually weakens him as a threatening presence br br br br br br External links br Director
