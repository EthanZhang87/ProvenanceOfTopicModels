Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra or simply Doctor Aphra is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise Created by writer Kieron Gillen artist Salvador Larroca and editors Jordan D White and Heather Antos she first appeared in Marvel Comics Darth Vader comic book series Aphra became a breakout character and began appearing in her own ongoing spin off comic series Star Wars Doctor Aphra from to before relaunching in br Aphra is a morally questionable criminal archaeologist initially employed by Darth Vader in his efforts to replace Palpatine as leader of the Galactic Empire who later goes into hiding from the former after betraying him to the latter and faking her death briefly establishing a love hate relationship with Imperial officer Magna Tolvan Supported by droids and BT and later by her former partner Sana Starros she is considered a war criminal by the Rebel Alliance Aphra is the first original Star Wars character not from the films to lead a Marvel comic series br br br Character br Doctor Aphra is a criminal archaeologist with an expert knowledge of droid and weapons technologies with a particular interest in ancient weapons and Jedi artifacts She travels in a unique starship called the Ark Angel which features a custom white and blue paint job StarWars com describes Aphra as a mostly morally bankrupt in over her head archaeologist with an Asian appearance Slate calls her driven selfish decisive and wildly unpredictable SyFy Wire calls the character an anti hero who shares the snark of Han Solo and sexual charisma of Lando Calrissian but toes the line between right and wrong far more regularly than these two characters and more often than not steps over it into the downright naughty IGN explains Aphra has all of Han s swaggery scoundrel y charm but little of his noble streak Creator Kieron Gillen notes that the character s main interest is this weird obsession she has with uncovering old stuff br Noting that Aphra s sarcasm and the careful way she codes her words are a vital part of her character StarWars com also explains that though she is somewhat of a genius Aphra s ability to think on her toes is what has kept her alive in situations where her genius fails her Gillen notes that readers can never be sure what the character will or will not do Doctor Aphra writer Si Spurrier explains that despite the expectation that Star Wars characters will always do the right thing Aphra makes mistakes and sometimes chooses the unexpected Sarah Kuhn the author of Doctor Aphra An Audiobook Original agreed that Aphra is the definition of chaos You never really know exactly what she s going to do which means that personally I think she s having the most fun of anyone in the Star Wars galaxy br In creating the character Gillen looked to what he called The Indiana Jones archaeologist archetype which he believed fit well into Star Wars His original concept for Aphra was Indiana Jones and his ramshackle problem solving but with inverted ethics He said that Aphra falls somewhere between a hero and a villain in that You do see her do good things and bad things Gillen further states She s kind of fun but at the same time there s a really dark heart to her He explains She has this very fun loving attitude she s very fun to be around but she s really bad as a person He added br br Aphra was designed to be Darth Vader s foil she has to do a lot of the talking when Darth Vader doesn t Darth Vader will not make jokes To be even a fun book to read you need her to lighten it But when you introduce her as a lead that kind of changes the dynamic entirely A she becomes slightly more serious and B everyone else around her becomes a lot more deadly br Spurrier states that Aphra knows that Vader is probably not a nice person She s aware that space fascism is not necessarily a good thing but it may be the right thing for a chaotic universe Gillen compares Aphra to Darth Vader in that fans root for both as anti heroes but explains that while Aphra is a bad person in many ways Vader is on another level as one of the greatest villains of all time Gillen further explains you can root for her because she makes really bad life decisions and sort of rolls with them She doesn t like killing people She s not like a random murderer He noted that Aphra is complex in that she is adamantly pro Empire but tends not to obey its rules br SyFy Wire describes Aphra as a queer woman of color Slate notes She aches for two different women who have claims to her heart two women whom inevitably she must betray to survive Gillen has confirmed Aphra s sexuality saying he has written her primarily romantically interested in women and as flirting with Luke Skywalker but noted that real world attitudes towards homosexuality don t really exist in the Star Wars universe Of Aphra s doomed relationship with female Imperial captain Magna Tolvan Gillen said he imagined This hard bitten kind of very serious kind of person chasing down this more whimsical person and the sexual tension the flip of it is Aphra s the person who s also pursuing Tolvan br br br Appearances br br br Comics br br br Darth Vader br Aphra first appeared in issue of Star Wars Darth Vader March which is set after the original Star Wars film and was created by writer Kieron Gillen and artist Salvador Larroca Aphra s appearance in the comic was adapted as an audiobook released on July In the story she is recruited by Darth Vader to aid in his schemes At the end of the series Vader attempts to kill Aphra after she betrays him to Palpatine but she escapes leaving him thinking he succeeded Gillen had originally planned to have Vader kill Aphra during the story but realized a way that she could escape and still keep the integrity of both characters br From to Aphra appeared in Star Wars Vader Down a six issue crossover comic miniseries which includes its own debut issue issues of Darth Vader and issues of the Star Wars comic series

She is in hiding so that Vader will not discover that she is alive but needs to get back into her life as an archaeologist so she can repay her enormous debts to the Wookiee Black Krrsantan and fulfill her promise to help locate the people who tortured him in the past Gillen said he wanted to write the series to explore what makes her tick and why she s doing what she s doing Gillen wrote issues to and then cowrote to with Simon Spurrier br Spurrier took over for a departing Gillen as of Larroca and Kev Walker shared the artwork for issue with Walker doing it alone for and followed by Walker and various other artists rotating in and out of the series Spurrier refocused the series to expand Aphra s adventures past the known Star Wars universe and attempt to tell stories that would be unique to Aphra s character br The series was nominated for Outstanding Comic Book at the th GLAAD Media Awards Alan Scherstuhl of Slate wrote of the series The stories like Death Stars tend to explode but unpredictably so with escalating twists striking moral quandaries and only occasionally anything like a truly happy ending He explains Besides the vigorous storytelling and startling twists the Doctor Aphra comics fill in shades of gray that are otherwise missing from Star Wars moral spectrum Jesse Schedeen of IGN called Doctor Aphra Marvel s riskiest Star Wars project to date but noted that the distance from the movies gives Doctor Aphra a greater sense of freedom in terms of tone style and plot possibilities Schedeen described the series as very much like a Bizarro Han Solo story with a dash of Indiana Jones thrown in and noted that it thrives on its dark sense of humor br In Aphra appeared in the five issue crossover miniseries The Screaming Citadel which is made up of its own debut issue issues of Star Wars and issues of Doctor Aphra The initial Doctor Aphra series ended in December with issue She is also the main subject of in the short comic Epilogue also

July Written by Sarah Kuhn the audio drama added new scenes and featured a full voice cast with Emily Woo Zeller voicing Doctor Aphra The script was released in book form on April br br br Short story br br br The Trigger br The Trigger is a short story written by Gillen published in the Star Wars anthology From a Certain Point of View Set during the Star Wars film on the day that the Empire destroys the planet Alderaan with the Death Star the story finds Aphra captured by Imperial troops and reacting to the news of Alderaan s destruction Slate noted br br Her reaction to the news is complex She s awed even a little turned on at the thought of such destructive might She annoys the Imperials by excitedly gaming out what tech could have possibly achieved it She wonders aloud whether the Death Star has a trigger whether any one person flipped the switch that murdered billions She wonders if killing that many from a distance is easier than killing one person in front of you br Gillen said he wrote the story with the intent of working out a fairly logical reason why with her background she thinks the Empire is bad to the alternative If you grew up in a galactic civil war I think peace by any means might be better than war That s kind of Aphra s take Aphra can handle everything She lies to herself But normal people Normal people would probably like to live under a fascist regime rather than actually people just killing each other in a war And that s a really dark hole to think about but I can buy someone believing that with Aphra s background br br br Video game br Doctor Aphra is a playable character in the collectible RPG game Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes released on mobile devices by Electronic Arts br Doctor Aphra was a playable character in the player versus player real time strategy mobile game Star Wars Force Arena developed by Netmarble Games and published by Lucasfilm br br br Impact and reception br Increased sales of Darth Vader convinced Gillen of Doctor Aphra s instant popularity and he called the character a big part of the unexpected success of the Darth Vader series Aphra became a breakout character and was placed in her own series Doctor Aphra which is the first ongoing Marvel Star Wars comic focused on an original character not from the films Gillen said in April Doctor Aphra was the number two trade in February A completely new character selling that well is shocking in comics That kind of response is enormously impressive as it doesn t happen often He added Sal vador Larroca and I cooked her up but enough people have written her now to make her bigger than me She definitely feels like she s outgrown me essentially So I quite like giving her away to other people who ll get to play with her Aphra has also become a popular cosplay Gillen said of Aphra s popularity br br Of all the characters I ve created for other people s universes she s by far the most successful one She s kind of fun but at the same time there s a really dark heart to her All those weird kind of contradictions to her I think they re quite appealing At the same time she s got a very core thing people can get She s quite complicated and not complicated at all With Luke or Leia they ve got that core archetype you get you get what they re like You get that with Aphra but at the same time there s an underlying all this weird twisted stuff in there that kind of gets under people s skin br Spurrier added br br Most of what we ve seen so far in Star Wars is goodies versus baddies And Aphra ain t that And I would suggest that the reason people respond more to Han Solo than they respond to Luke Skywalker is because he s not just playing the goodie He s a little more complicated than that And Aphra is the same but from the other direction br Trent Moore of SyFy Wire deemed Aphra arguably the best thing about the Darth Vader series and Catrina Dennis of StarWars com calls her the type of character that steals every scene she s in Hanna Flint of SyFy Wire describes Aphra as an edgy cool and refreshingly diverse character and Bria Lavorgna of StarWars com calls her one of the coolest characters in Star Wars right now Noting that Aphra s first appearance was an homage to Indiana Jones Alan Scherstuhl of Slate states that she subsequently gains a depth that Indiana Jones never quite did and praised the fact that Gillen has never exploited or exoticized her sexuality Citing Aphra s feats of technological prowess coupled with her unpredictable personality as the characteristics which make her a character worth watching Dennis writes Aphra has stolen the hearts of fans everywhere with her unpredictable humor and a complicated backstory that has unfolded into something much more than her introduction to the saga may have let on br Black Krrsantan introduced in the same Darth Vader comic as Aphra and returning in Doctor Aphra was introduced to the live action Star Wars universe in the second episode of the streaming series The Book of Boba Fett br br br Merchandising br In Hasbro released an action figure set of Doctor Aphra and her two killer droids and BT br Doctor Aphra and her
