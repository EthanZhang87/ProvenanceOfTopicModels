various characterizations for the protagonist of the original Star Wars film The possibilities included a year old grizzled war hero a Jedi Master a dwarf and a woman Luke s original surname was Starkiller and it remained in the script until a few months into filming It was dropped due to what Lucas called unpleasant connotations with Charles Manson who became a star killer in when he murdered the well known actress Sharon Tate Lucas replaced the problematic name Starkiller with Skywalker br br br Return of the Jedi br An alternate ending to the film reportedly featured Luke disappearing into the wilderness like Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti Westerns br br br The Force Awakens br Luke s lack of screen time in The Force Awakens was due to concerns by screenwriter Michael Arndt that his presence would distract from Rey leading to an agreement that he be removed from the screen and instead become a plot device Hamill attended meetings for script readings and helped conceal Luke s role in the film instead of dialogue he read stage directions According to director and co writer J J Abrams this allowed Hamill to remain involved and his reading helped make a better
