Kreia is a character and party member in Obsidian Entertainment s video game Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II The Sith Lords She is a blind Force sensitive who forms a bond with the player character the Jedi Exile through the Force Kreia sets herself up as the Exile s mentor and rejects the divide of the light and dark side of the Force as well as the predestination the Force entails By the game s end it is revealed she is the Sith Lord Darth Traya and is planning on destroying the Force and she becomes the final boss of The Sith Lords Kreia makes no more appearances in Star Wars fiction though a miniature by Wizards of the Coast was released in August and she appears as an obtainable character in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes br Written by Chris Avellone the character was created as a sounding board for the game s theme of the role of the Jedi and the nature of the Force and was heavily influenced by Planescape Torment s Ravel Puzzlewell She served both to test the player and to act as a mouthpiece for any questions Avellone thought should be asked about the Star Wars universe Sara Kestelman voiced the character with Kreia s casting being considered the most important of all the characters Her name references Princess Leia of the original Star Wars trilogy while her character design draws both on Palpatine s hood and Obi Wan Kenobi s robes br She was positively received and is often pointed to as the highlight of The Sith Lords Praise went to the questions and dialogue she provided as well as her voice acting The character has appeared in numerous top lists often commending her as a Star Wars character Attention was drawn to one moment where Kreia lectures about the dangers of charity Despite this Avellone felt he failed in creating a sympathetic Sith Lord though he has called her one of his favorite characters in the game br br br Conception and creation br The first draft of the game placed a figurehead similar to Kreia as the leader of matriarchs ruling the Handmaiden s world which the player was sent to free This draft was made before Obsidian had played the first game and after they had played it the draft was discarded However some of Kreia s characteristics were salvaged though little else was br In the game proper Kreia was written by Chris Avellone who was also lead designer of The Sith Lords and created most of the party Avellone was initially unsure about working on Star Wars but after beginning became more excited about it Avellone decided to attempt to create a sympathetic Sith Lord The character was highly influenced by Ravel Puzzlewell a Planescape Torment character which Avellone also wrote and was intended to tell stories with her he had been unable to do in Torment Avellone felt it would be cool to be in a party with Ravel Despite Ravel s influence the Star Wars setting and its elements resulted in Kreia changing heavily br A multi page biography was created for narrative reference art and audio When making characters Avellone prefers to focus on their role in the story their name their visual signature discussed with the concept artist and in Kreia s case the character s ability to serve as his voice Her name is inspired by Princess Leia of the original Star Wars films and serves a similar role as ally but Kreia has darker past demonstrated by a harsher prefix Her visuals meanwhile combine elements of both the wise mentor like Obi Wan s robes and dark side elements like Palpatine s hood Brian Menze lead concept artist and modeller for the characters designed Kreia br Narratively Kreia had several roles in The Sith Lords acting as a party member a foil and a sounding board for the theme of the game which concerned the Jedi s role and the Force s nature in a living galaxy As an extension of Avellone s voice Kreia became his way of expressing all his problems with the Force Despite her view of the Force it was important to avoid causing continuity problems with the rest of the Star Wars series and her views were presented within the context of the original Force in the Star Wars world Kreia is intended to test the player on the basic philosophical issues of the Star Wars universe She is rude and dismissive to everyone but the player character something intended to help make the player feel special br br English actress Sara Kestelman voiced the character in the game In voice directors Will Beckman and Darragh O Farrell s Designer Diary the character was considered the most critical character to cast though a challenging one as few games cast women of her age group Obsidian worked hard in finding Kreia s voice which had to match with her model without being witchy or grating due to her lengthy amount of dialogue br Developers tried to give each companion a unique ability to make them distinct from any other companion Originally throughout The Sith Lords Kreia would be seen through cutscenes recruiting certain characters such as Hanharr to side with her and seducing them to the dark side though her exact purpose was not made overt At the end of the game they would then be used as cannon fodder before the fight with her began Ultimately this was cut br br br Character br Kreia is shown as an elderly blind woman whose eyes have atrophied from lack of use in preference of viewing things through the Force viewing normal sight as a distraction Dialogue in The Sith Lords establishes her past as a Jedi historian and one of the teachers of Revan who became a Sith Lord and was the player character of the first game and how her teachings were blamed for his fall The Sith Lords reveals she has trained two Sith antagonists of the game Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus before they cast her out She is initially depicted in earth brown hooded Jedi robes with empty white eyes though after the revelation of her identity as Darth Traya both a Sith and a being of betrayal both her robes and eyes are changed to black and her skin becomes paler br br Kreia was the personification of Avellone s frustrations with the concept of the Force He called her one redeeming feature her love of the player character and what they represent a way of destroying the Force and its predestination in favor of giving freedom to the galaxy She shuns the light side and the dark side divide of the Force as well as blanket good and evil favoring choices that emphasise personal strength for the player The A V Club s Julie Muncy described her philosophy as a pessimistic and borderline Randian way of thinking focused on the importance of power and strife br She is initially presented as an ally and a teacher and acts a mentor from the start of the game Alexander Gambotto Burke of Eurogamer commented that she has a genuine albeit twisted maternal love for the player her student In contrast to Darth Malak the clear villain of the first game Avellone called Kreia neither necessarily good or evil instead she merely wants the Exile to grow as a person Kreia is deliberately complicated in her goals and motivations giving the character a feel of mystery IGN s Hilary Goldstein noted this mystery commenting both on her seemingly dark motives and yet how she appears as the player s staunchest defender and a true protector br br br Appearances br br br In The Sith Lords br br The game was first released in December on Xbox marking the character s debut Kreia initially seems dead when introduced but after the player character an exile of the Jedi Order enters the morgue of the mining station they ve woken in she begins conversation She informs the player that while they slept they both formed a Force bond tying the Exile and Kreia together It is revealed that Kreia and the Exile both came in aboard the Ebon Hawk after the Exile s original ship was attacked by the Sith and the Exile rescued while unconscious During their escape Kreia encounters Darth Sion and loses her hand during the battle which in turn causes the Exile tremendous pain due to their bond After she rejoins the party and they escape the station on the Ebon Hawk Kreia then appoints herself the Exile s teacher br Kreia serves as a party member throughout the game and may interject at certain points of it to offer her perspective Depending on each decision the player makes Kreia may gain or lose Influence which measures how much trust confidence or control the player has with a party member Unlike other party members Kreia s alignment is not affected by the player s Influence level with her and is instead set at neutral though Influence will unlock new conversations with her In gameplay she may only equip one hand and is a Jedi Consular focused on using the game s Force powers Having her in the party grants the player extra experience and any Force effects the player character or Kreia use on themselves will also affect the other br After the player finds all the in hiding Jedi Masters Kreia will retake her mantle as a Sith Lord If the player does not kill the Jedi she will intervene when they attempt to cut the Exile off from the Force draining the Jedi of the Force herself and killing them If the player chooses to kill the Jedi she will renounce the Exile Either way she will leave and the player must hunt her to Malachor V the site of such great atrocities and death that they caused a wound in the Force Kreia seemingly plans on creating another wound in the Force there deafening all to the Force and causing its death as well as potentially killing all those touched by it The player faces Kreia now Darth Traya as the final boss and after she is defeated she offers to describe the future she foresees before dying br br br Later appearances br The character would make no more future appearances in Star Wars fiction However Kreia is mentioned in several Star Wars reference books such as Jedi vs Sith The Essential Guide to the Force and the second volume of The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia In addition Wizards of the Coast created a miniature for the character along with other characters in the Knights of the Old Republic series which was released August In February Darth Traya and select other Sith Lords characters were announced as playable characters and raid bosses for the mobile game Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes br br br Reception br Kreia has been positively received Alexander Gambotto Burke for Eurogamer considered Kreia to be the greatest villain in video gaming praising her dialogue Kestelman s intelligent and subtle voice acting and the way she forced the player into making choices and considering their decisions IGN s Hilary Goldstein offered similar praise to her dialogue When looking at morality in games Gamasutra s Katherine Cross noted how Kreia s comments affected her more than many of the dark side light side choices in the game Her practical philosophy was also complimented by Kotaku s Phil Owen who noted its ties to reality over the traditional moral extremes of the Sith and the Jedi Eurogamer s Richard Cobbett considered her the most famous of The Sith Lords subversion of Star Wars and the first Knights of the Old Republic commenting Whether you agree or think she s crazy she s a fresh breath of air for the series and easily one of the best RPG characters ever br The character is often considered The Sith Lord s greatest or most important character Julie Muncy of The A V Club said she was the greatest part of the game and called her the game s most captivating character which she credited to her cold charisma Muncy found herself genuinely changing her character based on her opinions overly caring about how Kreia viewed her character Similarly PC Gamer credited Kreia with The Sith Lords s success calling her clearly haunted bitter manipulative and yet right in so many ways By looking at the Star Wars world through the view of her philosophy they felt Obsidian made the most thoughtful take on Star Wars we ll ever get Robert Purchese writing for Eurogamer called her the strongest and most memorable character in the game praising her writing and how she embodied The Sith Lords s gray areas Allen Rausch of GameSpy described her as the game s most compelling character commending Kreia for her challenges to his choices and noting how one example concerning the importance of lightsabers changed his view of the game br The character has appeared in numerous lists often reflecting her good reception as a Star Wars character IGN placed her at in The Top Star Wars Characters noting her crypticness She along with the other Sith Lords in the game came second place in a modified list of the best Star Wars villains based on reader requests for characters left out of the original list The Lords of both the first and second Knights of the Old Republic were similarly grouped as some of gaming s best Star Wars characters by Joe Juba of Game Informer calling most of them cooler and better developed than the Sith Lords in the actual Star Wars films The character was ranked seventh among Game Informer s Top Ten Female Villains in Video Games by Liz Lanier saying that Kreia is one of the few female Sith Lords of the Star Wars universe but she represents women of the dark side relatively ruthlessly The struggle against her was called one of greatest Star Wars moments in Xbox history by Edwin Evans Thirlwell writing for GamesRadar who called her reveal of her agenda compelling despite being exposition br Not all reception of the character was positive Adam Rosenburg of UGO Networks listed Kreia as one of the worst Star Wars expanded universe characters considering her at the center of Knights of the Old Republic II s stupidity and criticizing her Sith name Gamasutra s Christopher Buecheler the Resident Cynic found Kreia s comments a bit trite and condescending Buecheler also faulted how gaining Influence with Kreia was essential in understanding the main plot of the game br In a moment described as in famous by Cross on Nar Shaddaa the player may give a beggar money or leave him if he is given the money Kreia shows how he is made a target of and attacked and if he is refused Kreia reveals he attacks others Owen called this moment the crystallization of the game s gray areas Anthony Brock of Gamers Hell noted how it led to him passionately arguing with a game character complimenting Obsidian for how involved he felt Cobbett similarly highlighted the moment when praising the character Buecheler however criticized the scene for using an unlikely chance event to make its point br Kreia won Best Character in GameSpy s game of the year awards They called her a deeply unpleasant highly disturbing and incredibly hateful person but also easily the most intriguing complicated enigmatic well designed and nuanced character in a video game in She was also nominated for GameSpot s Best New Character award though lost to The Boss in Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater br br br Avellone retrospective br Avellone has said he felt he failed in creating a sympathetic Sith Lord recalling buglists by QA testers referring to her as that crusty annoying lady and he considered the ending s explanations of her motivations more hamfisted than sympathetic However in an interview with UP com he called Kreia along with the Handmaiden his favorite character after T M citing the mystery surrounding her He called his favorite unexpected turn in the game the revelation of Kreia being neither fully good nor evil In another interview this time with Star Wars fansite EU Cantina he called his favorite character either Kreia or T and called her scene where she explains her relationship with the Force one of his favorites in the game br br br Analysis br br Alexander Gambotto Burke felt the character was a presentation of Avellone s criticisms of the Star Wars mythos and the morality presented in most post Garriott video games and called her a tutorial an incentive to explore moral avenues you might have otherwise ignored Gambotto Burke considered her not purely evil and felt even at the end of the game you can t help but see her as a flawed visionary GameSpot considered her point to be for the player to move on from self defeating nihilism and realize the act of choice is what gives form and pattern to the universe br In her piece analysing game morality Katherine Cross highlighted the beggar scene on Nar Shaddaa Cross noted how it illustrated Kreia s morality shed doubt on tokenist moral acts and highlighted the player s own powerlessness Hilary Goldstein noted how her philosophical points questioned the roles of the Jedi and the Sith br br br See also br Blindness in literature br Will to power br br br br Game br br Other sources br br br
