Yavin or Yavin IV is a natural satellite in the Star Wars fictional universe Located in the Outer Rim this moon orbits the gas giant Yavin br It appears mainly in the films Rogue One and A New Hope for which the exterior scenes are mostly shot on the Guatemalan site of Tikal br Yavin can also be seen in the Rebels TV series video games and comic books It is also mentioned in the novelizations of the films in which it appears and in other novels br br br Context br The Star Wars universe is set in a galaxy that is the scene of clashes between the Jedi Knights and the Dark Lords of the Sith characters who are sensitive to the Force a mysterious energy field that gives them psychic powers The Jedi master the Light Side of the Force a beneficial and defensive power to maintain peace in the galaxy The Sith use the Dark Side a harmful and destructive power for their own purposes and to dominate the galaxy br br br Geography br br br Spatial situation br The Yavin system is located in the Gordian Expanse sector of the Outer Rim The star of this system is also called Yavin as is the third and final planet from the centre This planet a gas giant has natural satellites The fourth is Yavin br br br Topography br The land above Yavin is covered by forest marshes and jungle Pyramidal temples built by the Massassis stand within this environment The largest of these the Great Temple became the main base of the Rebel Alliance br This natural satellite is covered by oceans over a third of its surface The remaining two thirds are shared between four continents On Yavin there is no continental drift The tectonic plates do not move in relation to each other No ocean is isolated from the others There are mountain ranges and volcanoes on this moon These volcanoes are at the origin of a dynamic that allows the creation of very fast flowing rivers br br br Ways of life br The planet has a high level of bio diversity Massassis trees with their purple bark surrounded by climbing ferns pomegranate mushrooms and bio luminescent orchids are an important part of the local flora Among the tree dwelling animals the most notable are woolamanders frugivores and stindaril rodents carnivores that feed on golden muralbirds in particular On land there are runyips herbivores and swarms of piranha beetles The marshes of this satellite are home to lizard crabs pursued by caparisoned eels The waters are also home to aquatic gundarks mucous salamanders crystalline snakes and thyrsls Finally underground leviathan worms feed on the roots of massive trees br br br Official universe br br br Before the Battle of Yavin br During the Galactic Civil War military leader Jan Dodonna founded a rebel cell on Yavin He called it the Massassi Group in reference to the intelligent species that inhabited the planet This rebel group became one of the largest in the Galaxy taking part in the battles of Scarif and Yavin br As a result Yavin is the main base of the Rebel Alliance Galen Erso s daughter Jyn was brought there by the Rebels The leader of the Alliance Mon Mothma explains to her that her father developed the Death Star space combat station and that she is best placed to find her father Galen and the plans for this Imperial weapon that the Rebels want to destroy Cassian Andor who is accompanying Jyn Erso has been given a secret mission to kill Galen br When the Rebels had to retrieve the Death Star plans from Scarif several Rebel leaders including General Syndulla were called away from Yavin The Tantive IV with Princess Leia Organa aboard leaves Yavin to witness the battle br Captured by the Empire Leia Organa refused to divulge the location of the Rebel base To gain time she gave the location of an abandoned site on the planet Dantooine She then managed to escape aboard the Millennium Falcon with the smuggler Han Solo The Death Star pursues the ship to the Yavin system While the Imperial ships are on their way General Dodonna prepares the defence of the Rebel Alliance br br br Battle of Yavin br The Rebels launch several squadrons of fighters in the hope of taking advantage of a weakness in the Death Star s design to destroy it The torpedo sent by a new recruit to the Red squadron Luke Skywalker destroyed the space station giving the Alliance a major victory over the Empire Shortly after celebrating this victory with a ceremony the Rebels abandoned Yavin fearing a counter attack br br br After the Battle of Yavin br Once the Death Star is destroyed two Rebels in particular are rewarded for their significant part in the battle They were Luke Skywalker who shot the rift that allowed the space station to explode and Han Solo who saved it from Imperial Darth Vader during the battle Leia Organa presented them with a medal at Yavin during a ceremony to celebrate this military victory br After retiring pilot Shara Bey and sergeant Kes Dameron two former rebels settled on Yavin to live There they planted a fragment of a Force sensitive tree given to them by Luke Skywalker br br br Legends Universe br Following the takeover of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company all elements narrated in derivative products dating prior to April were declared to be outside of canon and were then grouped together as Star Wars Legends br br br Sith Wars br Around BC the Massassis species were living on Yavin when the Sith Lord Naga Sadow fled Korriban after losing the Great Hyperspace War br Naga Sadow left his mark on Yavin with his temples The Massassis built the Great Temple in homage to Naga Sadow despite the persecution he suffered Faced with his defeat at the hands of the Jedi Naga Sadow partially resisted death by plunging into a century long sleep on Yavin Finally a certain Freedon Nadd came in BC found the temple and became Naga Sadow s apprentice br Exar Kun later arrived at Yavin There he kills Naga Sadow once and for all then enslaves the Massassis having them build enormous temples focal points of great power He gradually gained strength by absorbing the energy of Massassi children in particular At the same time he carried out genetic experiments to create fighting animals Unable to repel the Jedi s victory over him he found a way to survive for several millennia by transferring his spirit to a temple in the natural satellite br br br Fall and rebirth of the Republic br Much later during the Clone Wars the Jedi Anakin Skywalker confronts the separatist Asajj Ventress Their duel takes place in the Great Massassian Temple During the battle Anakin seems to move particularly close to the Dark Side in the run up to his total overthrow in the final moments of the Clone Wars br After the rise of the New Republic against the Galactic Empire Luke Skywalker chose the moon as the place to found the New Jedi Order and took Mara Jade with him The planet was ravaged by the Yuuzhan Vong during the Vong invasion of the Galaxy The Jedi Order moved to Ossus br br br Concept and creation br Scenes from A New Hope set on Yavin were filmed near the ruins of the ancient Mayan city of Tikal in Guatemala Two years after filming the site was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site br br The idea of using these ruins as a film location came to George Lucas when in England he noticed the pre Columbian site on a travel agency poster br Yavin and the Rebel base appeared again in Rogue One the first film in the Star Wars Story spin off series Jyn Erso is captured by the Rebel Alliance The appearance of Yavin is one of the elements that link this episode to the first Star Wars In this film the introductory scene is similar to that of the first scene on Yavin in A New Hope A Rebel soldier standing sentry watches a fighter in the sky br Scenes from Rogue One taking place on Yavin were shot on a set approximately metres ft long and metres ft wide rather than in a live environment Others combine matte painting and live action shooting They were made at a Royal Air Force base in Bedfordshire England br Actor Oscar Isaac who plays Poe Dameron in the third trilogy was born in Guatemala where Yavin was filmed He asked that the character he plays be from Yavin so that he would feel closer to him The satellite was therefore chosen as the birthplace of Poe Dameron in the Star Wars universe This information was revealed even before the release of the film The Force Awakens in which Poe appears for the first time br br br Adaptations br br br Video games br Yavin appears in Star Wars The Old Republic released in The planet is home to Sith spirits such as Naga Sadow br In Star Wars Battlefront II has different playgrounds including Yavin It is the only one to appear in Rogue One and the only one along with Mos Eisley to come from A New Hope br Yavin also features in the Star Wars Squadrons game It is one of the locations in which the player can take part in a battle aboard a fighter br br br Figurines br In Lego produced spherical figurines of a number of Star Wars planets separable into two hemispheres Although Yavin is not a planet but a satellite it is also part of the collection under number X wing Starfighter Yavin It is sold with an X Wing and its pilot br In addition figurines of the characters in their Yavin appearance were put on sale From November Funko marketed the Pop figure under number Princess Leia Yavin Ceremony Note It depicts Leia Organa holding a medal which in the film she gives to Luke Skywalker or Han Solo br A few months later in the spring of Hasbro released a similar figure in its Black Series for Lucasfilm s th anniversary under the name Princess Leia Organa Yavin This is Leia in ceremonial dress with the film s medal br br br Information br Yavin regularly appears in the Star Wars saga star charts The Vulture website puts it in tenth place It explains that this natural satellite has two main qualities its history linked to the Sith and its appearance due to the temples used as starship hangars by the rebels The Comic Book Resources website ranked Yavin fourth behind Naboo Bespin and the forest moon of Endor It emphasises its perfect topography but points out that it lacks natural mineral resources br In its ranking of the best locations in A New Hope the Screen Rant website puts Yavin in tenth place ahead of five locations on Tatooine two on the Death Star and two starships Among the qualities of the natural satellite the site mainly mentions the medal ceremony room and the outward appearance of the Rebel base However it points out that the film does not dwell much on this important location br The duel between Asajj Ventress and Anakin Skywalker on Yavin in particular is one of the most popular moments in the Clone Wars animated series mainly for the visual effect br br br Analysis br br br Literary analysis br The choice of Yavin a jungle world as the base for the rebels the heroes of A New Hope can be explained by the fact that the worlds in the saga that are home to the characters from the side of good are wild natural and verdant such as the saga s other notable satellite the forest moon of Endor and the planets Naboo and Kashyyyk The characters in the evil camp live in an artificial base the Death Star as opposed to the verdant Yavin The lush jungle of this planet contrasts with the artificial black and white habitat of evil br br br Scientific analysis br Like several other Star Wars stars Yavin has been studied using a scientific approach to determine whether the concept seems realistic enough First of all the gas giant of the natural satellite in question would have to be well placed in its system within the system s habitability zone The diversity of ecosystems on Yavin also seems more likely than a natural satellite covered entirely in forest like the forest moon of Endor if only because the polar regions are colder than the tropical regions br br br Posterity br The planet D Qar in the third trilogy of the saga is sometimes seen as a replay of Yavin these planets are covered in jungle and uninhabited due to their isolation from hyperspace routes In addition the Resistance heir to the Rebel Alliance set up its command base there br A scene set on Yavin in particular continues to leave its mark on fans of the saga and the specialist press several decades after its presence in A New Hope The Last with the medal ceremony Indeed of the three heroes of the battle present at the time only two were awarded medals Han Solo and Luke Skywalker Fans are looking for several explanations as to why Chewbacca doesn t get a medal Firstly some fans believe that this means that the Rebel Alliance considers humans including Han and Luke to be superior to other species Some fans speculate that since Chewbacca has been secretly working for the Rebels since Revenge of the Sith there is no need to give him a medal Others from outside the saga universe think that the film crew simply forgot br However George Lucas claims that for the Wookiees Chewbacca s species a medal is not of symbolic importance and that Chewbacca has already been honoured by a Wookiee ceremony after the Battle of Yavin br Peter Mayhew Chewbacca s actor offers a more pragmatic explanation According to him the production of A New Hope lacked the money to make this first film and had to make savings on certain elements For example buying a third medal for the shoot would have been too expensive br Finally Chewbacca receives a medal in the episode The Rise of Skywalker from the hands of Maz Kanata This scene seems to provide a conclusion to the Yavin ceremony scene The scene s symbolism can also be explained by the fact that in Skywalker Ascending after the deaths of Han Solo Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Chewbacca is the only survivor among the heroes of the Battle of Yavin in A New Hope It may also be a way for J J Abrams to satisfy the fans who have been complaining about this lack of recognition for over years br br br Notes and references br br br
