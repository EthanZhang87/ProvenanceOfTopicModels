Rose Tico is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise first appearing in the simultaneously released Star Wars The Last Jedi and Cobalt Squadron both A mechanic with the Resistance she befriends Finn John Boyega and works with him to try to help Resistance forces escape from the First Order Rose is portrayed by Kelly Marie Tran br Rose was created by The Last Jedi writer and director Rian Johnson after he decided a subplot originally involving Finn and Poe Dameron needed a different dynamic The Last Jedi marked Kelly Marie Tran s first film role and she had never watched a Star Wars film before auditioning for the part As a struggling actress who had contemplated quitting the profession Tran underwent an intense five month audition process successfully competing against hundreds of other actresses for the role br Rose s backstory is revealed in the novel Star Wars The Last Jedi Cobalt Squadron where she is the protagonist alongside her sister Paige a minor character in the film The novel establishes that Rose and Paige joined the Resistance after their impoverished home planet was devastated by the First Order The character of Rose serves as a relatable audience surrogate an everywoman a positive influence on Finn and the personification of real life Star Wars fandom Johnson originally planned for Rose to be sarcastic and irritable but the character was changed to match Tran s personality after she was cast becoming more positive Tran felt a connection between Rose s past experiences and those of her own family during the Vietnam War and she researched the conflict and her family s past to help get into Rose s mindset br The character and Tran s portrayal received largely positive reactions from critics though fan reactions were more divided and she became the subject of racist and sexist attacks over the Internet Multiple fans and celebrities came to Tran s defense and she directly responded to the harassment with an essay in The New York Times For her performance in The Last Jedi Tran was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress br Rose returned in Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker the final installment in the sequel trilogy in which she has risen in the ranks of the Resistance and has taken on a greater leadership role The character s reduced role in the film was a major point of criticism for many who saw it as giving in to online racist and sexist attacks against Kelly Marie Tran br br br Appearances br br br Cobalt Squadron br Although Rose Tico was first conceived for the film Star Wars The Last Jedi her backstory is established in the mid grade canon novel Star Wars The Last Jedi Cobalt Squadron by Elizabeth Wein The novel and film were both released on December and Cobalt Squadron is set just before and during the events of Star Wars The Force Awakens the first film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy Dialogue that referred to parts of the novel s backstory was included in the original The Last Jedi script but was cut from the final film Rose is the primary protagonist of the novel along with her older sister Paige Tico who was portrayed by Veronica Ngo during a brief appearance in the film Although their parents are not featured as characters in the novel the reference book Star Wars The Last Jedi The Visual Dictionary establishes that the Tico sisters had a close relationship with their parents Hue and Thanya who raised them to have a strong sense of right and wrong Rose and Paige were raised on the planet Hays Minor the impoverished mining planet in the Otomok star system far beyond the policing efforts of the New Republic government Hays Minor is one of the first places to be victimized by the First Order an autocratic military dictatorship seeking to control the galaxy The First Order used the planet to test its weapons and kidnap children to indoctrinate as stormtroopers As a result Rose developed a hatred of the First Order starting in her early childhood The Tico sisters joined the Resistance a paramilitary organization led by General Leia Organa fighting against the First Order The two worked together on a bomber spacecraft called the Cobalt Hammer where Paige was a gunner and Rose was a mechanical engineer Despite her lack of formal training Rose received the post due to her extensive mechanical knowledge Rose and Paige each wear matching medallions resembling the insignia of their home system of Otomok br At the beginning of Cobalt Squadron Rose and Paige are on a mission to test new stealth technology when they encounter and rescue a fugitive fleeing from First Order TIE fighters They later learn the fugitives were from a planet in the Atterra System which like Rose s and Paige s home planet has been devastated by the First Order Leia authorizes a team of bombers including Rose and Paige aboard the Cobalt Hammer to gather reconnaissance in the Atterra System and run supplies to the citizens there Leia also asks Rose to devise a technique to allow the bombers to escape First Order detection leading her to invent a device called a baffler which reduces the ship s ion emissions and makes its energy signature harder to detect thus making the bombers more difficult for enemy sensors to locate Though they sustain casualties from First Order defenders Rose and the team successfully deliver the supplies and then escape Upon returning to the Resistance they learn that the entire Hosnian star system which had housed the capital of the New Republic was destroyed by the First Order superweapon Starkiller Base which itself was subsequently destroyed by the Resistance Rose and Paige prepare to assist with the evacuation of the Resistance base on the planet D Qar which leads directly into the events in the first scene of Star Wars The Last Jedi As a result of the success of Rose s baffler system Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo orders that it be adopted throughout the Resistance fleet br br br The Last Jedi br In an early scene in Star Wars The Last Jedi Paige Tico is killed during the evacuation of D Qar when the Cobalt Hammer is destroyed during an operation in which Paige helps destroy the Mandator IV class Siege Dreadnought Fulminatrix Rose mourns her sister s death aboard the MC Star Cruiser Raddus a Resistance Mon Calamari cruiser She is guarding the escape pods against potential Resistance deserters when she finds Finn a Resistance hero she greatly admires attempting to flee in one of the pods After Rose stops him by stunning him with an electro shock prod Finn tells her the First Order had found a way to track the Resistance fleet through hyperspace The two formulate a plan to disable the tracking device on the First Order s flagship the Mega class Star Dreadnought Supremacy which will allow the Raddus to escape With help from Resistance droid BB Rose and Finn set off on an unauthorized mission to the casino city of Canto Bight to find a master codebreaker to assist them br Although Finn is impressed by the superficial beauty and debauchery of Canto Bight Rose reveals to him the dark underpinnings of the lavish casino city pointing out the fortunes of the city s rich inhabitants are supported by child slavery weapons dealing and other immoral activities that result in the suffering of others Rose and Finn are arrested for their illegal entry into Canto Bight and in prison they meet an unnamed slicer who along with BB helps them escape and agrees to assist them in disabling the Supremacy s tracking device The four escape Canto Bight with the help of some of the enslaved children there Rose gives one of them Paige s Rebel Alliance ring to inspire his trust Rose and the others return to the Supremacy and infiltrate the Mega Destroyer disguised as First Order officers but are captured by General Hux and Captain Phasma before they can disable the tracking device The slicer betrays Rose and Finn informing the First Order of their plan and providing information about the Resistance in exchange for his release and a monetary reward br Phasma attempts to execute Rose and Finn but BB helps them escape and fight their way to freedom Meanwhile the surviving Resistance forces escape to an old Rebel Alliance base on the nearby planet Crait according to The Last Jedi novelization the baffler technology developed by Rose helps the Resistance ships in their escape Rose Finn and BB board a stolen First Order light shuttle and fly to Crait Along with Finn and Poe Rose pilots a ski speeder in a defensive battle against First Order forces during which they try to destroy a super laser siege cannon before it can destroy the door to the base Finn attempts a suicide attack against the cannon but Rose saves his life by crashing her speeder into his knocking him off course and seriously injuring herself in the process Rose tells Finn the only way they will defeat the First Order is by fighting for what they love rather than fighting what they hate she then kisses him before passing out Finn brings Rose back to the base and her unconscious body is taken aboard the Millennium Falcon along with the other Resistance survivors Rose receives medical attention as they flee Crait and escape from the First Order br br br The Rise of Skywalker br Rose returns in a smaller role in The Rise of Skywalker the final film of the Star Wars sequel trilogy In the year following the events of The Last Jedi Rose has risen in the ranks of the Resistance and has taken on a greater leadership role serving as head of the Engineering Corps She is stationed on the Resistance s secret base on the jungle moon of Ajan Kloss throughout the film When Rey Finn Poe Dameron Chewbacca C PO and BB embark on a mission to help track down the revived Palpatine and the Sith Eternal s fleet of Xyston class Star Destroyers the Final Order Finn invites Rose to come along She declines because General Leia Organa has asked her to study the specifications of Imperial Star Destroyers She later participates in the climactic battle scene between the Resistance and the Sith Eternal at the planet of Exegol Rose communicates with Finn and his ally Jannah during the battle and expresses concern for their safety as the fighting intensifies She survives the battle and is present with the Resistance when they celebrate their victory later on Ajan Kloss br br br Other media br Rose Tico has been featured in several Star Wars comic books She was the protagonist of Rose Knows a story in the sixth issue of the Star Wars Adventures comic book series which was released on January Rose Knows portrays Rose as an extremely dedicated mechanic who after first becoming stationed on the Raddus just prior to the events of The Last Jedi continues working well after her shift ends to study the ship s manuals and learn more about the vessel The comic also included the first meeting of Rose and Resistance pilot and officer Poe Dameron to whom she responded with an excitement similar to that when she met Finn in The Last Jedi The knowledge Rose obtains from her research of the Raddus ultimately helps her in assisting Poe when his squadron is attacked by First Order TIE fighters br Rose and Paige Tico were the protagonists of the final issue of Star Wars Forces of Destiny a five issue comic book miniseries based on an animated web series of the same name The issue entitled Rose Paige was released on January and was set before the events of The Force Awakens when the Resistance was still based on D Qar General Leia Organa is seeking methods to collect natural resources and Rose conceives an idea to build rechargeable vehicles from junk parts Lacking confidence Rose is reluctant to volunteer the idea but Paige insists that she do so Despite some opposition from the base s engineers Leia receives the idea warmly and Rose gets two vehicles working with support from Paige and Leia The issue illustrated Rose s deep respect and admiration for Leia she admitted to Paige Every time she talks to me I can barely function Paige later becomes lost in the D Qar jungles during a scouting mission and Rose helps find and rescue her br Rose was the protagonist of one of four announced installments in Age of Resistance a comic book miniseries that chronicled different characters and time periods from the Star Wars chronology The issue entitled Age of Resistance Rose was released in September and focused on Rose s relationship with her sister Paige during the First Order s invasion of Hays Minor This includes Rose and Paige working covertly to sabotage the First Order on the planet as well as them fleeing Hays Minor to join the Resistance at the insistence of their parents The comic was the first to directly show interaction between the Tico sisters and their parents and particularly illustrates how they teach the sisters skills that will later serve them in the Resistance such as piloting starfighters It also includes a scene in which Rose and Paige upon learning of the destruction of Hays Minor seek to take a ship and fly back to the planet for a suicidal revenge attack against First Order but are stopped by Leia and urged to stay and serve the Resistance instead br Rose appeared in Shuttle Shock a second season episode of the Star Wars Forces of Destiny animated web series created by Lucasfilm Animation and released through Disney s YouTube channel The series depicted two or three minute stories from various points in the Star Wars chronology Shuttle Shock was released on March with Kelly Marie Tran reprising her role as the voice of Rose Tico The episode was set before Rose Finn and BB reached Canto Bight in The Last Jedi Their space shuttle is attacked by huge jellyfish like creatures and Rose repairs a shorted out BB while Finn attempts to fly to safety In early Rose was added as a playable character in the mobile collectible RPG game Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes Her character had special moves such as Courageous Shot and Dauntless Idealism and was able to stun characters with her shock prod just as she did to Finn in The Last Jedi br Rose Tico played a supporting role in the four issue comic book miniseries Star Wars Allegiance the first issue of which was released on October Written by Ethan Sacks and illustrated by Luke Ross and Lee Loughridge Allegiance is set shortly after The Last Jedi and in the story Leia asks Rose to accompany her on a mission to the planet Mon Cala to help secure allies for the Resistance When Leia and her party are threatened by potential enemies Rose is

Quarren species When Rey is coerced into a duel with a massive combat droid Rose and Chewbacca interfere in the fight and help Rey defeat it In the final issue of the series Rose works with Rey to track down a terrorist who attacked the group due to opposition to Mon Cala allying itself with the Resistance br Rose also appeared in Lego Star Wars All Stars a series of Lego Star Wars animated short films set in different time periods of the Star Wars chronology The series launched on October with Tran once again providing the voice of Rose A profile about Rose Tico was featured in Star Wars Women of the Galaxy a book by Amy Ratcliffe highlighting female characters from the Star Wars franchise The book was released on October br In the weeks approaching the release of The Rise of Skywalker Rose was featured in the novels Star Wars Spark of the Resistance and Star Wars Resistance Reborn both of which were released as part of a multimedia project called Journey to Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker Spark of the Resistance a junior novel by Justina Ireland released on October tells the story of Rose Rey Poe and BB as they travel to an isolated planet called Minfar to investigate a distress signal There they discover the First Order has invaded the planet and threatened the indigenous population in an attempt to find secret laboratories and discover a legendary weapon called the Echo Horn which has the ability to control the minds of its victims Rose and the others successfully repel the First Order and keep the weapon out of their hands The novel features illustrations of Rose and the other characters by artist Phil Noto Rose has a smaller part of in Resistance Reborn a novel by Rebecca Roanhorse released on November which details the efforts by General Leia Organa and the other Resistance members to rebuild their forces immediately following the defeats sustained in The Last Jedi In the novel Rose has recovered quickly from the injuries she suffered in The Last Jedi and is actively working to help restore the Resistance The book also includes a scene where Poe asks Finn about any romantic feelings for Rose Finn responds by stating that although they shared a moment with a kiss on Crait they are just friends br br br Characterization br br Various Star Wars media portrayed the character of Rose Tico as an excellent and highly imaginative mechanic with a methodical technical mind being largely self taught a unique background that implied her resourceful inventive and prone to outside the box thinking For example most characters in The Last Jedi reacted with shock that the First Order was tracking the Resistance through hyperspace because it was believed to be impossible but Rose deduced the problem and helped develop a solution Rose has been described as passionate loyal and committed with a great deal of enthusiasm and intelligence and a strong moral code Idealistic and energetic the character maintained a sense of optimism despite her difficult past and the challenge the Resistance faces against the First Order She was portrayed as tough stubborn and blunt as well as intensely focused and determined But she was also kind and understood the value of protecting what is good rather than just fighting what is bad Rose also had a great deal of fascination with the galaxy around her and a sense of awe about the Resistance and the heroes that serve it She was hard working resilient and brave though The Daily Telegraph noted her courage is subtle and not flashy in a dashing daring Poe Dameron style way br The Rose character strongly believed in the cause of the Resistance to which she dedicated her life and she placed that cause ahead of all things including herself In this way she differed from Finn at the start of The Last Jedi who was more concerned about himself and his friends than with helping the Resistance or stopping the First Order However the example Rose set for Finn inspired him leading him to capture some of her idealism and place the mission of the Resistance ahead of himself The Last Jedi writer and director Rian Johnson has described Rose as the angel on Finn s shoulder serving as his conscience and trying to steer him in the right direction while the unnamed slicer they encountered serves the opposite function Rose s willingness without hesitation to give her precious medallion to the unnamed slicer in exchange for his help showed her unflinching demonstration to the Resistance cause However she could also be rebellious and was willing to disobey orders to do what she thinks is right as shown by her willingness to work with Finn and Poe on a secret plan to help the Resistance in The Last Jedi br Rose was very close with her family and a strong sense of right and wrong was instilled in her by her late parents and her sister Paige Rose particularly looked up to Paige and the two had an extremely strong emotional connection according to the Cobalt Squadron novel the two had never been apart for more than a couple of days and they shared a bond that would have been extraordinary even between twins That bond along with their shared tragic history helped propel them to do the right thing in the face of danger Prior to the events of The Last Jedi Rose was more shy and self conscious but Paige had faith in Rose s abilities and encouraged her even when Rose herself lacked confidence Paige often forced her younger sister to step forward and be more forthcoming about her ideas and thoughts This was particularly illustrated in the Rose Paige issue of the Star Wars Forces of Destiny comic book during which Rose hesitated to share an idea with General Leia Organa until Paige pushed her to do so In writing about Rose s past in Forces of Destiny and the Star Wars Adventures comic books writer Delilah S Dawson said she believed the example Paige set for Rose gave her context for her increased confidence and strength in The Last Jedi When Paige died Rose felt a void in her own identity according to Tran but ultimately Paige s love for Rose helped her become more confident and carry on after her sister was gone Paige s death also drove Rose that much harder to fight against the First Order so her sister s death would not be in vain br Rose s rage toward the First Order was informed not only by Paige s death but also because she personally witnessed the brutality and devastation it unleashed on her home planet of Hays Minor As a result her dedication to the Resistance was not tied to a noble abstract idea of heroism but a firsthand knowledge of the threat they are fighting which gave her a deeper understanding of the war than even some of the soldiers around her Rose s past experiences also made her feel anger at the mistreatment of others particularly vulnerable populations as seen by her contempt for Canto Bight and her sympathy for both the enslaved children and the abused creatures there Rose s feelings occasionally manifested in anger such as her reaction when she discovered Finn attempting to flee the Raddus or when she said of Canto Bight that she wished she could put her first through this whole lousy beautiful town However Rose was also very empathetic as demonstrated by the kindness she showed the children on Canto Bight and the way she rescued Finn at the end of The Last Jedi br Rose also served the role of everywoman in The Last Jedi Her idealistic nature was something the viewer is meant to identify with Johnson said in creating the character he wanted to make someone who could inspire his year old self Both Johnson and Tran have described Rose as an unlikely hero who preferred to work in the background but was pulled into a prominent position in the conflict by the circumstances around her While the Star Wars franchise often focused on particularly strong or powerful heroes Rose was a very low ranking member of the Resistance and she demonstrated that every position matters and anyone no matter their status or position can make a difference She also illustrated how war affects the average person Despite her talents and abilities Rose did not consider herself a hero nor was she seeking to become one Tran said of the character It s such a huge deal to me the idea that she s not necessarily special in the way that we have defined special before in other movies or in other stories br Rose has also been described as the personification of real life Star Wars fandom with Tran herself saying I definitely believe that Rose embodies the idea of a fan being pulled into something that s kind of crazy This was particularly illustrated in Rose s excitement about meeting Finn for the first time during which she trips over her words excitedly calling him The Finn and nervously said doing talking sic with Resistance heroes isn t really my forte She had similar reactions upon meeting other Resistance figures in other works of Star Wars media including Poe Dameron and Leia Organa br br br Concept and creation br br br Conception br br Rose Tico was created by Rian Johnson for the film Star Wars The Last Jedi which he wrote and directed While working on the script he originally had the characters Poe Dameron and Finn go to Canto Bight together but he decided having a female character accompany Finn would make for a more interesting dynamic because otherwise it was just these two dudes on an adventure Johnson said in the original versions of the script with Poe and Finn together their dialogue could have been interchangeable and there was no conflict between them This led him to conceive the Rose Tico character who in Johnson s words could actually challenge Finn and push him and contrast with him was where Rose came from br Johnson conceived Rose Tico as a relatable audience surrogate and said he wanted someone who year old me would truly be able to relate to someone who was a genuine nerd someone who it would be a little surprising that they were front and forward in a Star Wars movie Details about the character were first discussed at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Orlando Florida on April At the time she was only referenced by her first name Rose her last name Tico was not revealed until a Vanity Fair article on May Johnson described Rose Tico as the biggest new part in the movie and his favorite new character introduced in the film Johnson said of the character She s not a soldier She s not looking to be a hero and she gets pulled a very big way into an adventure in this movie with Finn She s pretty rad Rose has the most screen time of any new character introduced in The Last Jedi br The name Rose was originally used for the character Maz Kanata during the pre production of Star Wars The Force Awakens The name is a tribute to Rose Gilbert the late high school English teacher who instructed both Force Awakens director J J Abrams and production designer Rick Carter Several scenes featuring Rose in the initial scripts of The Last Jedi were either cut or altered in later drafts One notable change was Finn originally being a gunner alongside Paige during her bombing run witnessing her death This element was removed in subsequent drafts as director Rian Johnson found it challenging to reconcile with Finn s later relationship with Rose Additionally the master codebreaker Rose and Finn sought was originally planned to be an insectoid warlord who involved Rose and Finn in an effort to rob a rival This led to an extended sequence of Finn Rose and the codebreaker s crew climbing atop the casino rooftop during an attempted robbery which ended with Finn and Rose getting arrested br br br Casting br br Kelly Marie Tran spent years struggling to find work and doing temporary jobs on the side and had considered quitting acting altogether before auditioning for The Last Jedi Tran was not a Star Wars fan and had never seen a film in the franchise before seeking the role She believed that ultimately helped her in her audition because she didn t have pre established expectations or attempt to model Rose on characters from the previous films Hundreds of actresses auditioned for the part of Rose Tico Tran a Harry Potter fan wore her lucky Ravenclaw tie to the audition but later became concerned when the other actresses were wearing more serious attire Nevertheless she wore the tie again during her first callback Tran went through five intense rounds of auditions over five months between the summer and fall of with one month spanning between each audition Johnson observed her during her second audition and immediately liked her he said watching her felt like seeing the character he pictured in his mind during the writing process During one of the auditions Tran did one on one reads alongside John Boyega the actor who portrays Finn to determine whether the two actors had chemistry and worked well together Boyega said it was clear from the start of their readings together that Tran was the best actress for the part The final audition took place in London with full hair makeup and costuming Three weeks later in November Johnson met with Tran and offered her the role br Johnson said of the audition process We saw a lot of talented actresses of a very broad range but honestly it was more about finding Kelly Johnson said Tran had an oddball nature and genuine sweetness to her and he knew audiences would want her character to succeed He said of the actress She has the most open heart of anyone I ve ever met and I knew that was going to shine through onscreen Johnson said her chemistry with Boyega was another main reason she got the part J J Abrams the producer co writer and director of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi has said of Tran s casting I was grateful to Rian Johnson for so many things that he did but the greatest for me was casting Kelly Marie Boyega felt Tran s background in improv comedy and numerous Internet videos ultimately helped Tran bring to the role a light tone necessary for The Last Jedi despite the seriousness of the narrative After receiving the part Kelly Tran watched all the Star Wars films read several books and listened to podcasts about it becoming a fan of the franchise The casting of Tran was first announced on the official Star Wars website on February which described the actress as a talented newcomer Tran discussed the character for the first time publicly at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Orlando where she said She s part of the Resistance and she works in maintenance I can t wait for you to meet her In later interviews Tran said she hopes the character will show viewers that even if you are not born a princess or into a position of privilege if you are a background player and aren t a frontrunner like a star pilot you can still make a difference br br The Last Jedi was Tran s first film role A Vietnamese American she was the first woman of color to play a leading character in a Star Wars film Tran said she believes it was important to have a strong female Asian American character in Star Wars because she knows from her own childhood how important it is for young people to see characters like themselves represented in film television and books She said A lot of Star Wars fans who are specifically Asian never had a character they could dress up like I get very emotional when I see people who are able to identify with this character That means a lot to me and I don t think it will ever get old Tran said she felt it was a major responsibility to portray someone viewers would look up to and she wanted to do the character justice Johnson was not specifically seeking an Asian American actress for the role and audition notices indicated they were open to actresses from any ethnicity In May Tran posed as Rose on the cover of Vanity Fair becoming the first Asian American cover to appear on the magazine s cover In December Disney arranged for Tran to embark on a press tour in Singapore and her parents home country of Vietnam to publicize The Last Jedi br br br Costume design br The costume design for Rose Tico was being developed for The Last Jedi before the actress was cast The crew knew from the early stages that her primary costume would be a basic coverall Johnson requested that it be pretty shapeless and something that either a man or woman could wear The costume is a variation of the uniform members of the Resistance ground crew wear in The Force Awakens with minor modifications to give it a slightly different look The same color from the original uniforms which costume supervisor David Crossman called acidy green was kept for Rose s costume The original script called for Rose to wear a beautiful gown during the Canto Bight scenes so she would blend in with the other wealthy clientele Costume designer Michael Kaplan said the scene was going to be a big reveal for Rose going from this frumpy dumpy coverall to a beautiful gown This idea was ultimately abandoned and it was decided that Rose would wear the coverall costume throughout the entire Canto Bight subplot which had the effect of making Rose and Finn stick out among the crowd Costume designer Michael Kaplan said of the coverall costume br br It s in her character She s not someone that has to look good for work Rose is a no nonsense character She just plugs along and she s spunky So it does work br Tran wore a form fitting First Order uniform as a disguise during her The Last Jedi scenes with Finn and the unnamed slicer aboard the Supremacy Kaplan said the costume crew wanted to choose a color for the costume that would enhance Rose but they were limited to the First Order colors of black gray or teal They chose teal because they wanted to establish her as the highest ranking officer of the trio br The idea of the medallions worn by Rose and Paige Tico came from Carrie Fisher the actress who portrayed General Leia Organa She insisted to Rian Johnson that the movie needed space jewelry with which he agreed The original script called for the medallions worn by Rose and Paige to be a two part pendant that could be placed together to form a single image This was later changed so that both Rose and Paige had identical medallions but concept artist Matthew Savage said they still have a yin and yang quality about them Various designs were created for the medallions but Johnson s favorite was one based on a Celtic reference suggested by set decorator Richard Roberts That version was ultimately used in the film Johnson and Kaplan spent a great deal of time debating Rose s hair style spending days of hair tests and trying multiple wigs In the end Tran s real hair was cut into a shape that would look good in a ponytail but resulted in a mushroom like shape when taken down br br br Filming br In January Tran moved to London to begin filming She was bound by confidentiality agreements not to discuss the character and could not tell anyone that she was working on a Star Wars film even her own family Tran told them she was filming an independent movie in Canada she sent them photos of Canada that she downloaded from Google and purchased Canadian maple syrup for them as a gift to make the ruse more convincing To prevent secrets about the film from leaking during filming Tran and the other actors were driven around the sets in cars with tinted windows and made to wear black robes so people would not recognize them On her first day on the Last Jedi set Tran saw Anthony Daniels performing as C PO and hugged him which she called the best experience ever She said it could be difficult at times maintaining her composure and managing her excitement working on a Star Wars set especially as a fairly new actress Tran said You have to find a way to just do the work and kind of block everything else out But then C PO comes up and you re like Oh You re constantly figuring out How can I work in this environment but also This is awesome br br Tran was not used to living without her established support system and often felt scared and lonely during filming occasionally crying because she wished her friends could be part of the experience To combat the isolation she joined an improvisational theatre class in London kept journals and sought companionship from her fellow cast members especially John Boyega Tran shared more scenes with Boyega than any other cast member and she said it was very easy to work with him and that she learned a lot from him The two laughed and joked regularly on the set and occasionally improvised during filming Tran said of Boyega John is someone who I feel like I immediately was able to mesh with We connect on different levels because our parents are immigrants we re both people of color nerds and he s just hilarious At one point after filming a scene together Boyega said to Tran Kelly we are making history which helped the actress realize the magnitude of appearing in the film She said of Boyega He was the best partner I could have had on a massive movie like this br Tran said director Rian Johnson made her feel very comfortable on the set and collaborated with her seeking her thoughts and suggestions about the character She said Rian was so good at inspiring that trust and I think everyone on set felt as comfortable as me In early versions of the script Tran said Rose Tico was more sarcastic and grumpy and Johnson compared her to the Winnie the Pooh character Eeyore However once Tran was cast the character s personality gradually changed to match that of the actress herself This is particularly reflected in the excitement and enthusiasm Rose showed during the scene in which she met Finn In the original script Rose was immediately suspicious of Finn but because of the way the character had changed to match Tran s personality Johnson realized she should admire Finn initially and be excited to meet him It was one of the few scenes in The Last Jedi that Johnson rewrote during the production Tran said of developing the character Sometimes I think Kelly informed Rose and sometimes I think Rose informed me It s such a messy tangled relationship which I think is kind of beautiful She s always going to be part of me and I m always going to be part of her br Tran called filming The Last Jedi the ultimate acting class She was particularly excited to work with Laura Dern of whom she was a strong admirer and Carrie Fisher who inspired Tran with her confidence and honesty Tran said she felt Fisher was indirectly protecting her just by virtue of her strong personality Tran and Boyega were also particularly impressed by Benicio Del Toro who plays the unnamed slicer that they share multiple scenes with she said they were obsessed with Del Toro adding Every time he did anything we would just turn to each other and say He s such a legend Tran enjoyed playing the augmented reality mobile game Pok mon Go on the set of The Last Jedi and got others on the cast and crew to play it as well including Johnson and Boyega Tran shared a physical trainer with Daisy Ridley the actress who played Rey and had to follow a difficult fitness regimen becoming so strong she learned how to push a car The film s stunt crew taught Tran styles of fighting and how to use various weapons as well as different types of falls and jumps including according to Tran how to take a bullet Tran was so impressed with the work that went into making The Last Jedi that she often visited the set on days when she wasn t performing herself visiting the art creature production design and costume departments br Director Rian Johnson expressed nervousness about filming the scene immediately after Rose and Finn first met in The Last Jedi In this scene Rose was dragging a stunned Finn away on a cart and Johnson was concerned about the extensive exposition in the dialogue fearing it might be challenging to make it effective However he credited the acting abilities of Kelly Marie Tran and John Boyega for ultimately making the scene work The scenes in which Rose and Finn escaped from Canto Bight by riding giant creatures were shot during the final two weeks of filming The sequence was created by visual effects company Industrial Light Magic who planned the animation then created a motion base that Tran and Boyega rode atop The base and a motion controlled camera were programmed to move at a speed and route that matched the planned animation A handful of scenes involving Rose were filmed but cut from the final version of The Last Jedi In one after Rose and Finn were captured on the Supremacy General Hux mocked Rose after seeing her medallion and she responds by biting his finger Johnson thought it was a good character moment for Rose but it was cut due to pacing issues In another deleted scene after escaping from the Supremacy on a shuttle Rose and Finn discussed their next destination and ultimately decided to rejoin the Resistance forces on Crait Dialogue that involved Rose chastising Finn for being too emotionally attached to Rey was also cut from the film br To understand the mindset of Rose s traumatic past experiences with war Tran researched her own family s experiences during the Vietnam War her parents had to flee the country during the conflict and she had other relatives who tried to escape at the time but could not She also listened to podcasts about the Vietnam War to learn more about the conflict Tran felt a connection between Rose s past experiences and those of Tran s own family particularly the fact that both suffered losses and experienced poverty due to war Tran said A lot of the things Rose is dealing with are things that I already had inside me Tran also listened to podcasts and read books about engineers and how they think which helped her better understand Tico s role as a mechanic and maintenance worker Tran did not share any screen time with Veronica Ngo who played Rose s sister Paige but they spent time together off camera and would go to restaurants together and regularly send text messages to each other Tran felt a connection with Ngo who is from Vietnam like Tran s family and Tran helped her with taped auditions for roles Ngo was seeking br Kelly Marie Tran who portrayed Rose considered the moment when Rose kissed Finn as one of her character s bravest moments She noted that while it s one thing to believe in a cause and fight for it expressing oneself romantically and being emotionally vulnerable is a different type of courage Tran acknowledged that portraying a romantic moment was challenging for her but co star John Boyega s openness and generosity made the experience easier especially since it was Tran s first on screen kiss Rose s arguably most important and famous line in The Last Jedi was delivered to Finn at the end of the film That s how we re going win Not fighting what we hate Saving what we love The line written by Johnson was partially inspired by a similar statement made by Irvin Kershner the director of The Empire Strikes Back the second film in the original Star Wars trilogy Describing the

Before writing the stories Dawson read the script for The Last Jedi in November as well as an early draft of the Cobalt Squadron novel This gave her an understanding of the personalities and speech patterns of Rose and Paige Tico for her own writing Dawson was excited to write about the Tico sisters because she was a huge fan of the characters and she considered them a strong role model for children as well as a study in finding people who lift you up and believe in you and in using that belief to do what you can t do alone She said of Rose and Paige To me they re the heart of what the

performance winning and the Rose Tico character an immediate fan favorite Alistair Harkness of The Scotsman called Kelly Marie Tran the heart of The Last Jedi much like John Boyega was for The Force Awakens and that the two characters are more interesting to hang out with than some of the more established characters whose adventures we ve seen in their prime Annlee Ellingson of L A Biz wrote The first Asian American woman to play a major role in a Star Wars film Tran is a welcome addition both culturally and narratively bringing much appreciated representation to the cinematic universe She s also a gosh darn delight Michael Sragow of Film Comment praised Tran s energetic and emotional performance which he said made Rose the most rousing figure among the film s heroes Sragow said the character blows into the movie with a fan s enthusiasm a can do spirit and bracing undercurrents of proletarian rebellion br Variety s Meredith Woerner said Tran s performance had an energy and passion that energized Star Wars fans Woerner wrote Stealing the spotlight from The Force Awakens favorites Tran injected the galaxy far far away with a dose of pure enthusiasm Anna Menta of Newsweek said Rose Tico has quickly become a favorite addition to the Star Wars universe and that Tran s off camera personality and enthusiasm has helped endeared her even more to fans Los Angeles Times writer

City Times writer Linda Cook called Rose one of her favorite new Star Wars characters praising her compelling background and relationship with Finn Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood called Rose a great new character and welcome addition to the franchise The Week culture critic Lili Loofbourow called Rose Tico one of my favorite additions to the franchise Metro Silicon Valley writer Richard von

included Tran s performance as Rose Tico in its list of great screen performers from with writer Sean Strangland calling the character a delight Film director Jon M Chu has praised the character and publicly urged the streaming service Disney to let him create a television series about Rose br Richard Trenholm of CNET called Rose delightful to watch praising her chemistry with Finn and saying she represented the indomitable moral spirit of Star Wars with her clear eyed determination to do the right thing The Stranger writer Andrew Wright said Rose Tico makes a strong bid for MVP among the new Star Wars characters introduced in The Last Jedi David Sims of The Atlantic called Rose a wonderfully sneaky character because she initially appears to be a sidekick for Finn but instead becomes an equal partner who teaches him important lessons John W Allman of Creative Loafing called Rose a strong addition with a solid backstory who elevated and brought a renewed focus to Finn s character Nerdist writer Rosie Knight called Rose a much needed addition to the Star Wars universe and Lindsey Romain also of Nerdist said she represents hope and positivity in a fandom that can often feel overwhelmingly negative Dominic Griffin of Spectrum Culture wrote that Rose emerges as a compelling lead equal to the others in emotional resonance Pam Powell of the San Francisco Daily Journal said Rose shines with personality with a wonderful sense of humor and timing and that she pleasantly anticipated seeing her with each scene The Daily Beast senior entertainment editor Marlow Stern called Tran s performance a breath of fresh air Ruben Rosario of MiamiArtzine called Tran s performance charming and relatable Molly Templeton called Rose an excellent addition to the Star Wars universe Kirk Baird of The Blade said Tran delivered an honestly sweet performance The Atlantic writer Christopher Orr was critical of the Canto Bight sequence but said Tran s performance helped to enliven it br Some critics who disliked The Last Jedi were still complimentary toward aspects of Rose Tico s character or Tran s performance Salon writer Matthew Rozsa who disliked the film and particularly criticized the Canto Bight sequence nevertheless noted the chemistry between Finn and Rose makes them easily the most likable and sympathetic characters in the film Similarly Ryan Syrek of The Reader felt the first half of The Last Jedi was clunky and the subplot involving Finn and Rose s efforts to shut down the tracking device worked poorly but he said the character dynamics between the two were strong and described Rose his favorite character from the new trilogy Alyssa Rosenberg an opinion writer for The Washington Post who was critical of The Last Jedi said of Kelly Marie Tran like nearly everyone in this movie she deserved better writing than she was given Tor com writer Emmet Asher Perrin said the character deserves more attention than the film is capable of giving her Chris Gore of Film Threat said he very much liked the Rose character but found the Canto Bight scenes to be an unnecessary diversion br Several critics responded negatively to the Canto Bight subplot with Rose and Finn calling it filler and an unnecessary and distracting element of the film that contributed little to the overall storyline Other critics were more negative about the Rose Tico character Gulf News writer Shyama Krishna Kumar called Rose a welcome addition overall but said she could have benefited from additional depth Cinevue writer Christopher Machell described the character as woefully underwritten Kyle Pinion of The Beat called the character basically a non entity saying she never seems to grow beyond earnest and her relationship with Finn felt rushed Armond White of the National Review calls the relationship between Finn and Rose a politically correct multi culti play Aine O Connor of the Irish Independent called the Rose and Finn pairing and subplot weak A writer for The New York Observer felt Finn and Rose had bad chemistry and called their storyline a misguided side quest br br br Backlash br The casting of Asian American actress Kelly Marie Tran as Rose spurred both a racial and misogynistic backlash including sexist and racist commentary about both Tran and her character along with insults about her weight which began immediately after her casting was announced In a March interview Tran said she had been receiving really acidic misogynistic racist comments regarding her role as Rose Tico Tran was accused of representing forced diversity imposed by social justice warriors because of her race She has been the target of racist trolling on Twitter In one example right wing Internet personality Paul Ray Ramsey mocked Tran s weight Rose Tico s entry on Wookieepedia an online encyclopedia about the Star Wars universe was edited to include racist and vulgar comments in December which drew national media attention The wiki s administrators removed the offensive edits and protected the page from editing Fandom the wiki hosting service that operated the domain publicly condemned the vandalism The character of Rose Tico was defended by the official Star Wars page on Facebook In response to complaints about the character s actions in The Last Jedi the Facebook page responded with a list of positive and significant actions done by the character and wrote Personal growth is inherent to every Star Wars story Without the detour to Canto Bight Finn wouldn t have grown past only caring about himself and his immediate circle of friends And Rose wouldn t have discovered her own ability to be the type of hero she idolized br In June Tran deleted all of her Instagram posts in response to online harassment and replaced the account bio with Afraid but doing it anyway She also pursued therapy following the harassment Salon writer Nicole Karlis suggested many of the discriminatory attacks came from white privileged men afraid of a strong female character who is not hypersexualized in a film writing I can t help but wonder if Tran s character aligned with the misogynistic and racist stereotype of Asian women as submissive and seductive would the trolls have still come out Esquire writer Dom Nero called the bullying of Tran another example of the rising current of hatred and discrimination in our culture and said it came from a very vocal minority of Star Wars fans who do not agree with the progressive ideals set forth in the refreshingly inclusive emotionally nuanced film A study released in October found that up to of the attacks Tran received on social media may have come from Russian bots instead of Star Wars fans br Several cast and crew members of The Last Jedi condemned the attacks and spoke out in defense of Tran including Rian Johnson John Boyega and actors Domhnall Gleeson and Mark Hamill who posted a picture of himself with Tran and wrote the caption What s not to love GetALifeNerds Johnson branded the attackers as manbabies and said they represent a few unhealthy people and not the vast majority of Star Wars fans Claudia Gray an author who had written several Star Wars books said the attacks against Tran ran counter to the principles of the franchise and people who did not understand that were never a Star Wars fan to begin with Other celebrities have expressed support for Tran as well including Josh Gad Kumail Nanjiani Gabrielle Union Elijah Wood and Edgar Wright Stephen Colbert condemned Tran s attackers during a segment on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert during which he presented a mock trailer for The Last Jedi specifically designed to make racist misogynist nerds angry In less than one day more than fans retweeted a message of support for Tran from a fan on Twitter that sought to drown out the manbabies Star Wars fans began circulating fan art of Rose Tico on Twitter to show support for Tran along with the hashtag FanArtForRose She was also shown support at the San Diego Comic Con during a Rally for Rose during which fans appeared in cosplay attire as Rose Tico or wore Rose for Hope T shirts Fans posted about the event on social media using the hashtags ForceOutHate and RallyForRose br In response to the harassment Tran penned an essay titled Kelly Marie Tran I Won t Be Marginalized by Online Harassment published in The New York Times on August She wrote that the attacks reinforced microaggressions she had long faced as a Vietnamese American and which sought to reinforce a narrative that Asians should be marginalized and treated only as minor characters both in stories and in real life Tran said she even began to believe the negative statements made about her and that they had sent her down a spiral of self hate into the darkest recesses of my mind places where I tore myself apart where I put their words above my own self worth She wrote Their words reinforced a narrative I had heard my whole life that I was other that I didn t belong that I wasn t good enough simply because I wasn t like them And that feeling I realize now was and is shame a shame for the things that made me different a shame for the culture from which I came from She concluded with You might know me as Kelly I am the first woman of color to have a leading role in a Star Wars movie I am the first Asian woman to appear on the cover of Vanity Fair My real name is Loan And I am just getting started Tran later said the New York Times essay was difficult to write but also probably one of the proudest moments of her career thus far br When Tran appeared during a panel about The Rise of Skywalker at the Star Wars Celebration in Chicago on April she received a swell of support from the crowd who chanted her name and gave her a standing ovation causing the actress to tear up onstage Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent called it the unexpected highlight of the panel and wrote Tran s reception was not only heartening it was a moment of pure relief for so many fans of the franchise worried that the well had finally been poisoned beyond repair br br br The Rise of Skywalker br Prior to the release of The Rise of Skywalker fans and writers expressed concern about how little Rose Tico had been featured in the film s marketing and merchandising including her omission from film trailers as well as her exclusion from posters clothing and action figure sets that featured the other Resistance heroes Several examples of shirts trading cards and other memorabilia surfaced in which Rose was not only excluded but was originally included and later removed Fans began using the hashtag WheresRose in protest of her absence with some calling the move part of a larger trend of erasing women of color from such merchandising Some writers suggested the decision could be a response to the discriminatory attacks to the Rose Tico character and Tran s performance Lindsey Romain of Nerdist wrote It s also hard not to feel like the racist misogynists are being catered to in these decisions A set of individual The Rise of Skywalker character posters released on November initially did not include Rose but a poster featuring her was released the following day br Following the release of The Rise of Skywalker Rose s minor role in the film became a major point of criticism among fans and reviewers alike Rose received one minute and sixteen seconds of screen time in the minute film much shorter than the ten minutes and fifty three seconds she received in The Last Jedi and a shorter amount of time than Rose s sister Paige received in her single scene in The Last Jedi An early scene in which Rose opts to stay on the Resistance base while Rey Finn and Poe go on adventure together was taken by many as a direct response to the audience reception of The Last Jedi and Rose s arc within the film Tran said in interviews prior to the film s release that she was looking forward to scenes with Rose and Rey together in The Rise of Skywalker but fans and critics noted that no such scenes appeared in the final cut Fans expressed disappointment and anger on social media with the hashtags JusticeForRose and RoseTicoDeservedBetter trending on Twitter in the week after the film s release br Several critics in their reviews of the finished film criticized Rose s minor role with some calling it a validation of the people who attacked and harassed Tran online Critics said she was sidelined and commented on how she was written out without any explanation and her minor role was considered by one critic to be one of the film s biggest disappointments Paul Tassi of Forbes called it a cowardly response to two years of constant abuse of Tran and sent a negative message that film writers and directors could be influenced by people who express enough hatred and vitriol on the Internet Vivian Kane of The Mary Sue wrote of J J Abrams With his treatment of Rose it s hard to believe he wasn t listening to even the most toxic corners of the internet Slate writer Violet Kim argued that even if Rose s reduced role was not a response to the harassment it showed the filmmakers did not understand how deeply her exclusion would hit those to whom she meant so much Comic Book Resources writer Anthony Gramuglia stated that Rose s screen time comes across as a failure to support an actor who was put in a rough situation as if Disney were throwing her to the wolves Actor Jimmy Wong tweeted that he was livid with the treatment of Rose pointing out that newly introduced background characters received more dialogue than her br Mike Reyes of CinemaBlend suggested that other factors could have accounted for Rose s minor role such as scenes getting cut for pacing purposes or revisions to the script after screenwriting duties were transferred from original writers Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly to J J Abrams and Chris Terrio In an interview Terrio said the filmmakers were not trying to deliberately sideline Rose in the film stressing that he and Abrams adore Tran He stated that they wanted Rose to stay behind with Leia while the other characters were away because they wanted one of the principal characters to be an anchor for those scenes which he described as an indication of Rose s importance Her screen time was cut Terrio said because some of the repurposed footage featuring Carrie Fisher did not meet the standard of realism they had hoped for so they were deleted from the film When asked on the red carpet of the Academy Awards about her much shorter role in the film Tran said she was impressed by how Abrams resolved so many different storylines adding that at the end of the day I got to be part of something bigger than me and that s really special br br br Notes br br br br br br Bibliography br
