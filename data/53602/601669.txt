Mon Mothma is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise primarily portrayed by Genevieve O Reilly Introduced as the leader of the Rebel Alliance in Return of the Jedi in which she is played by Caroline Blakiston Mon has become a prominent character in subsequent prequel media including the anthology film Rogue One the animated series The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels and the live action television series Andor present The character also appeared in the live action television series Ahsoka again portrayed by O Reilly her first time playing the character in sequel media set after Return of the Jedi br O Reilly s portrayal of Mon Mothma has received a universally positive critical reception and Blakiston s initial cameo appearance as the character has become an Internet meme br br br Character br br br Portrayals br One of only four female characters with dialogue in the original three Star Wars films Mon Mothma was portrayed by Caroline Blakiston in Return of the Jedi In Blakiston said of the supporting role Certainly people are always very envious of me When I join a new theater company the other actors look down the program see my Return of the Jedi credit and say Oh you were part of Star Wars I smile and say Yes but only for twenty six and a half seconds br Star Wars creator George Lucas cast Genevieve O Reilly as Mon in the prequel film Revenge of the Sith but most of her scenes were ultimately cut from the theatrical release of the film In advance of the role O Reilly studied Blakiston s performance She said I remember studying the scene really trying to work on capturing her voice her syntax so that fans could see a connectedness between me playing her and Caroline playing her O Reilly reprised the role in the prequel film Rogue One and voiced the character in five episodes of the animated series Star Wars Rebels She portrayed Mon again this time as a lead character in the live action television series Andor O Reilly noted in that Blakiston s performance continually influences her own She said I was always interested in her and each time I go to play her I go back to that scene You can see when Caroline does that in that scene for me there was always a pain at the heart of it You could see that she was carrying a pain and I was really curious about what that was What has happened in this woman s life What has it cost to be her What are the sacrifices that she has had to make along the way to be that leader of a rebellion In expanding the character for Andor O Reilly drew from various real life female politicians including Liz Cheney Alexandria Ocasio Cortez Jacinda Ardern and Angela Merkel br Kath Soucie voiced Mon Mothma in three episodes of the animated series The Clone Wars br br br Description br Initially Mon Mothma is the senator from the planet Chandrila during the last years before the fall of the Galactic Republic A leader and outspoken voice of the Galactic Senate s Loyalist faction she pushes back against the increasing overreach of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine s policies and the subtle subjugation of the galaxy s citizens Finding herself fighting a losing battle Mon ultimately leaves the Senate and founds the Rebel Alliance against Palpatine s rising Galactic Empire ultimately uniting the emerging Rebel factions into a singular unit Under her leadership as the Chancellor and Commander in Chief of the Rebel Alliance the Rebels destroy both iterations of the Empire s planet destroying weapon known as the Death Star and eventually bring down the Empire itself Mon subsequently serves as Chancellor of the New Republic moving the seat of government from Coruscant to Chandrila She later advocates that it be periodically rotated among different worlds Mon s policies spark the rise of two opposing factions within the Senate the Populists who support the autonomy of individual planets and systems and the Centrists who believe a stronger central government is necessary She later steps down as Chancellor due to illness br Amy Ratcliffe of Nerdist News described the character as continually a beacon of serenity Calm and measured Mon Mothma is a steady hand that the entire Rebel Alliance and later the New Republic can grasp for support She has a hard edge to her she has to in order to carry the weight she does But she only shows it when necessary O Reilly said that Mon is a genuine humanitarian has a strong moral compass and is a critical thinker and a considered decision maker O Reilly added Early on when we met her when she was much younger we didn t really see her taking action We see her listening a lot we see her gathering a lot of information these were foundation moments for that character and it informed her behavior with the rebels group Ratcliffe wrote that Mon s appearances prior to Star Wars Rebels have painted a quiet portrait of the character She s careful She listens She has strength to be sure but we don t see it outwardly illustrated like we do in Rebels In that series Mon realizes that she cannot effectively fight the Emperor from the Senate and boldly calls him a lying executioner in public The comic Star Wars October set after the events of The Empire Strikes Back shows Mon s unflinching reaction to the news that the Empire is building a second Death Star Her confidence that the Rebels can destroy this one as they did the first makes Mon a character that Adrian Quidilla of Screen Rant called the beacon of hope that guides the Rebel Alliance O Reilly said The iterations that we found her in both in Rebels and in Rogue One were similar a leader of a rebellion with a tough decision It requires a dignity and a strength which is at the heart I think of Mon Mothma br Andor creator Tony Gilroy noted that in previous appearances Mon is presented as very proper and sober and perfectly put together all the time He called Mon sort of a Nancy Pelosi character She s kind of trying to do good and she s losing He noted She a powerful presence in the Senate but she s facing defeat after defeat after defeat as the Empire is taking over O Reilly said I think she has been a woman who really believes in diplomacy really believes in the power of a democratic chamber for everyone to have a voice I believe with the encroachment of Empire and Palpatine she has believed that she could still affect change from within That she could make a difference that chambers of parliament for want of a better word can breed allies and can create effective opposition diplomatically I think when we meet her in Andor she s at the end of that line O Reilly explained She s been fighting this fight for a long time And I feel like she s been getting nowhere It is a wall of power and oppression in front of her that she is tired of fighting Zosha Millan of Polygon compared Mon to series hero Cassian Andor Diego Luna in that they are both fighting against the Empire to give regular people better lives but in different ways While he pushes back against any authority figure she has been trying to effect change from within the very power structures he resists with little success O Reilly explained Now she has to go outside structure She has to risk she has to enter a dangerous environment And she really has to put her own beliefs on the line You see a woman put her life on the line in a very different way than Cassian is putting his life on the line br In Andor Mon s efforts to finance and build the Rebel Alliance are paramount even at the expense of her family After some resistance she agrees to commence the Chandrilan courtship process between her daughter and the son of shady banker Davo Sculdun Richard Dillane in exchange for his assistance with her financial machinations Mon also sets up her husband to take the fall should the Empire notice the discrepancies in her accounts br br br Appearances br br br Film br br br Return of the Jedi br br Mon Mothma is introduced in Return of the Jedi as the leader of the Rebel Alliance against the Empire portrayed by Caroline Blakiston As the Rebels prepare to assault the Empire s second iteration of the Death Star Mon notes that many Bothans died to bring information about the Death Star to the Rebel Alliance In Genevieve O Reilly said Star Wars creator George Lucas wrote this female leader back in the s That is to be respected and to be celebrated She added I think that was as ambitious then perhaps even more ambitious than it is now br br br Revenge of the Sith br A younger Mon is featured in scenes shot with O Reilly for the prequel film Revenge of the Sith but most were ultimately cut from the theatrical release of the film Corey Larson of Screen Rant argued that this was done because the movie s political aspects needed to be shaved down considerably in order to make the film more palatable in the theater O Reilly said br br George Lucas and Rick McCallum who was the producer they re such pros they wrote to me and told me the scenes had been cut so I knew way before And they were so beautiful about that and kind to me as a very young actor And it made complete sense to me because of course it was all about Darth Vader becoming Darth Vader Cinema has to have a singular focus for it to drive you know Cinema doesn t have a lot of time to tell the story So I respected their decision and when I watched it it made total sense br In a deleted scene from the film Mon secretly meets with senators Bail Organa of Alderaan Jimmy Smits and Padm Amidala of Naboo Natalie Portman during the last days of the Galactic Republic Mon explains We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic We are loyalists trying to preserve democracy in the Republic The group discusses Palpatine s growing authoritarianism and how to counter it in what would be the seed of the rebellion against the Empire br br br Rogue One br In Rogue One Mon Mothma O Reilly and senator Bail Organa Smits are Rebel leaders who enlist Jyn Erso Felicity Jones a young renegade woman sent to a work camp for her crimes against the Empire to help identify and extract her father scientist Galen Erso Mads Mikkelsen from Imperial confinement Mon intends Galen to testify before the Senate and confirm the existence of the Death Star He is killed during the extraction but Jyn joins the dangerous mission to acquire the plans to the Death Star from the Imperial archive on Scarif The success of this mission leads directly to the events of the originating film Star Wars br br br Animated series br br br The Clone Wars br Kath Soucie voiced Mon Mothma in three episodes of the animated series The Clone Wars In Senate Murders Heroes on Both Sides and Pursuit of Peace supporting character Mon is an ally of fellow senators Bail Organa Phil LaMarr and Padm Amidala Catherine Taber She makes her opposition to the war with the Separatists her defining campaign promise and even attempts to reach out to the Separatist Senate in Heroes on Both Sides br br br Star Wars Rebels br O Reilly voiced Mon Mothma in five episodes of the animated series Star Wars Rebels set a couple of years before the events of Rogue One She said I had finished filming Rogue One and they rang and asked if I would I like to be involved in Rebels I was thrilled It was such an extraordinary thing to be a part of and to work with the team at Lucasfilm I would meet them via satellite link up from wherever I was It was such a treat to step in at a different point in their storytelling O Reilly explained that Mon comes into the series in a highly charged time in which the stakes are high for everybody and noted that the character really shows the traits of a true leader in very difficult very heightened dangerous times br In Secret Cargo the crew of the Rebel ship Ghost finds themselves secretly transporting Mon Mothma who is being hunted by the Empire after speaking out publicly against Palpatine She resigns from the Senate calling for those who oppose the Emperor to join her in opposition Ships begin to appear over Dantooine as the Rebel Alliance is formed Rebel fighter Ezra Bridger petitions Mon Mothma to send reinforcements to thwart Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn s assault on the rebel base on Atollon in Zero Hour Part Refusing Mon points out that it is too soon for the Rebels to openly battle the Empire and doing so would as Thrawn surely intends decimate their growing forces In In the Name of the Rebellion Part the Rebel Alliance receives valuable intel from extremist Saw Gerrera but Mon makes it clear she does not condone Saw s unscrupulous methods He later confronts Mon via hologram accusing the Rebel Alliance of being too spineless to win against the Empire Mon insists that Saw s tendency to target civilians kill surrendering enemies and break every rule of engagement are things the Empire would do In The Occupation Mon informs the Ghost crew that the Empire is testing a new kind of TIE Defender and sends the team to Lothal for reconnaissance In Crawler Commandeers Mon approves a plan for Hera Syndulla and her team to attack an Imperial TIE Defender factory on Lothal br br br Live action television br br br Andor br In O Reilly reprised the role of Mon Mothma in the live action television series Andor set five years before the events of the film Rogue One Andor is centered on smuggler and future rebel Cassian Andor Diego Luna and Mon Mothma first appears in the fourth episode Aldhani Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly wrote of Mon s inclusion We are finally seeing this classic original trilogy character fleshed out beyond mere Rebellion briefings and interviews in Return of the Jedi and Rogue One Larson called her appearance in Andor by far the most demanding role of the character seen yet and noted that almost none of what Mothma does in Andor is what it seems br br br Development br O Reilly said of Andor s portrayal of Mon We really get to develop her as a character and we get to learn about her not just as a senator but as a woman We learn what her life is like what she has to wrestle with what are the dangers to her life what it costs to be her Gilroy said of the character She s always presented as very proper and sober and perfectly put together all the time in canon and it just seemed like that was such a perfect opportunity to say Well what s really going on behind here It was very exciting to take a sort of still portrait of someone and throw it away and build a real life behind it She has a much much much more complicated life than anybody was ever aware O Reilly said it has been an extraordinary gift from Gilroy to be able to explore not just the role of the senator or the leader but the woman behind that who she is what that is what she has to sacrifice what she has to risk what the cost is to her what this rebellion is to her She explained We meet a woman who looks different than we ve seen her before who feels different who certainly dresses different When she walks in you can see the power that she wields But within a couple of minutes it shifts dramatically to reveal a private face that we ve not encountered before You see that she s under threat You see that she s in danger You see that she s taking risks br O Reilly added We meet a woman steeped in empire navigating a very male dominated empire with a very powerful Emperor Palpatine at the top of it We ve seen her surrounded by people maybe with different opinions but like minded rebels We find her in Andor very alone living in a world of orthodoxy and construct We see a woman who has had to navigate her ideals and beliefs within systems of oppression O Reilly said that Gilroy wanted to explore the rules and constructs that Mon who has been married and a senator since she was years old has had to navigate within during the intervening years She asked What is that cage O Reilly explained that Andor presents Mon as a deeply complicated woman who might make compromising choices that we haven t seen before Being set five years before the events of Rogue One allows the series to discover where this woman goes and how she navigates the dangers and the risks that is her life and how she ends up in a world where she introduces Cassian Andor to Jyn Erso br In the series Mon has an elevated wardrobe and hairstyle from previous appearances O Reilly said We wanted to meet her at a new stage a stage we hadn t seen before And so you meet a very successful political woman she is successful she is sophisticated she is a political mover she is living within a world of high society So we wanted her look to reflect that It s five years before she s in a bunker you know She added What Tony Gilroy has done is write a character in a polar opposite moment of their life to Rogue One so we have somewhere to go So why not meet her in an art gallery in beautiful clothes flown in on this extraordinary car and navigating this sophisticated but deceptive life br br br Storylines br In Andor Mon is an embattled senator from Chandrila fighting against the increased overreach of the Imperial regime Watched closely by agents of the Imperial Security Bureau ISB she is secretly raising funds for the nascent Rebel Alliance Andor also introduces Mon s disaffected husband Perrin Fertha Alastair Mackenzie and daughter Leida Mothma Bronte Carmichael Vel Sartha Faye Marsay an active member of the Rebel Alliance in the field is revealed to be Mon s cousin in Nobody s Listening Gilroy said Of all the people that walk through this show and face all kinds of decisions and problems and pressures and the hiding and chasing and betrayal Mon has to stand out almost in the open for the whole show in a really dangerous position In many ways her story is the most tense story in the whole show because she has to do everything in the open br In Aldhani Senator Mon Mothma meets with antiques dealer Luthen Rael Stellan Skarsg rd on Coruscant ostensibly looking for a gift for her husband Luthen

opponents in the Senate to their dinner party He does not share her sense of urgency regarding the Empire s rising power and is dismissive of how seriously she takes it O Reilly said that the episode exposes how much of Empire is also within the marriage and how far she has to go to fight for what she really believes in She has to lose a lot because her husband is Empire Perhaps her life is Empire She has to escape it right Or she has to risk stuff And she ends up in that rebel bunker She noted that though Mon s passions are expressed in her encounter with Luthen at home she must put on the
