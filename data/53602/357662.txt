be the weakest link of the original trilogy According to Tami Katzoff of MTV News a prevailing theory among Ewok haters is that the creatures were originally conceived as a sure way to appeal to small children and sell plush toys to their parents The Ewoks have some defenders and have proven to be very popular with children from their introduction in the s to the present day br br br br br br
