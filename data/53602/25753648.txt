game from being a simple shooter in outer space such as the ability to zoom through the forests of Endor on a speeder bike but added that these are just minor distractions that just hide the fact that this game is just way too repetitive Zacarias enjoyed the amount of detail in background of locations such as the forests of Endor but criticized the vehicle graphics for looking like bad imitations
