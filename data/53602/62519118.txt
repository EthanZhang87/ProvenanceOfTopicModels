Mandalorian s lack of forward momentum is starting to feel like narrative wheel spinning br Alan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone praises the show for keeping things simple telling a clear story and focusing on the strengths of your actors and your production And The Mandalorian like its title character pretty consistently hits its targets The Gunslinger continues this straightforward streak Keith Phipps of Vulture gave the episode out of and wrote Part of what makes the Mandalorian such a compelling character is that he s great at his job but he s never superhumanly great at his job Katie Rife of The A V Club gave the episode a B grade She was excited at the prospect of seeing Mos Eisley and other callbacks to the original trilogy but critical of the episode for being just more setup for the larger story arc I m starting to wonder when we re going to get to the main course Erik Kain while reviewing for Forbes praised the show for bringing back the franchise to the planet of Tatooine and for using the fan service very intelligently In a positive review for the TVLine Matt Webb Mitovich commented that the episode manages to bring back the Star Wars franchise to Tattoine as well as a very familiar face to the Marvel series Agents of Shield fans Bryan Young from Film deemed that the episode might be controversial for the fans as actress Ming Na Wen was used on the marketing of the show only to be killed in the episode and considered that this might upset fans as they would consider that she was only used for ensuring that the show wanted to assure us it was diverse br In a negative review Tyler Hersko of IndieWire stated that Nostalgia is one thing but the utter dearth of new ideas here just makes the bountiful references a glaring reminder that this has all been done much better before While making a negative review for Decider Walter Chaw considered that the episode wasn t following the storyline of the episode and stated that there s nowhere to go with a Baby Yoda that s only used for cooing reaction shots adorable misbehavior and being a hostage Paul Bradshaw who wrote for NME considered that the series was starting to depart from the series though he stated that Filoni loves a good standalone episode and praised the episode as an improvement for the previous one Charlie Hall from Polygon stated that the episode barely makes up for the cringes induced by the lead up stating that unless the series follows a new path that deviates from the previous Star Wars projects it will be risking the chance of losing a second season While making a review for IGN Joe Skrebels stated that the series has expanded the Star Wars universe but it has shown shown restraint in letting that reference material take up too much of the limelight and criticized the episode for not adding new to the plot He gave out a out of for the episode br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Chapter The Gunslinger at IMDb br Chapter The Gunslinger
