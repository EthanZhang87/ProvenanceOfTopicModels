Lego Star Wars Holiday Special was announced to be in development in August The special serves as an homage and satire to the infamous The Star Wars Holiday Special The concept for the special was conceived by director Ken Cunningham when he was requested by The Lego Group and Lucasfilm Animation to help develop content based on the Star Wars franchise Lucasfilm wanted to expand their Lego productions since they began to develop projects for Disney After a reunion between the executives where they reminisced of holiday specials they watched in their childhoods they decided to develop a holiday special based on Lego Star Wars br br br Writing br The writers drew inspiration from several Christmas specials such as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Planes Trains and Automobiles as they felt their storytelling and lessons about family were inherent to the Star Wars franchise and choose to explore Rey s burden as the last Jedi and how that isolates her from her friends The producers ultimately conceived a time travel plot that allows Rey to reflect on her own mistakes her own teachings and what it means to be a mentor according to executive producer James Waugh the concept of a time travel story through several Star Wars projects was inspired by how children do not regulate themselves with a particular era while playing with their Lego Star Wars sets br Though the original Holiday Special served as an inspiration for the writers they did not want it to be a remake instead creating an original story while honoring certain elements from the original special that were canonized in other Star Wars media most prominently the Life Day The writers gave the character of Rose Tico a prominent role in the story after her reduced role in Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker br br br Casting br Voice actors from previous Star Wars media who reprise their roles in the special include Billy Dee Williams Kelly Marie Tran Anthony Daniels Matt Lanter Tom Kane James
