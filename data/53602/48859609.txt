Rey is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise She was created by Lawrence Kasdan J J Abrams and Michael Arndt for The Force Awakens the first installment of the sequel film trilogy and is primarily portrayed by Daisy Ridley Rey also appears in the film s sequels The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker and related Star Wars media br Rey is introduced as a scavenger who was abandoned as a child on the desert planet Jakku She becomes an ally of the Resistance in its conflict with the First Order Powerfully Force sensitive Rey trains to be a Jedi under the siblings Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa She faces adversaries such as Kylo Ren Supreme Leader Snoke and the resurrected Emperor Palpatine who is revealed to be her grandfather in The Rise of Skywalker Despite being enemies Rey and Ren share a connection called a Force dyad and eventually join forces Following Palpatine s defeat Rey adopts the name Rey Skywalker to honor her mentors br br br Development br br br Creation and casting br In Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy invited Michael Arndt to write three screenplays for the Star Wars sequel trilogy Intimidated by the scale of the project Arndt at first turned down the offer He accepted the writing position however after Kennedy explained that the films would tell the origin story of a female Jedi The character Rey was known as Kira in the early stages of production and Arndt described her as a loner hothead gear head badass Arndt struggled with introducing the young woman as the main character while keeping her from being overshadowed by Luke Skywalker whose role in the film was eventually minimized br On creating a female lead for the new trilogy Abrams stated that from his initial discussions with writer Lawrence Kasdan he was excited at the concept of having a woman at the center of the story He said that We always wanted to write Rey as the central character and that other female representation in the story was also important Kennedy stated that Rey is the new generation s Luke Skywalker Rey s background as a scavenger was part of the developers attempting to portray her as the ultimate outsider and the ultimate disenfranchised person due to their belief that a person of that nature would likely experience a prolonged journey compared to other types of people br Daisy Ridley was largely unknown before being cast as Rey She auditioned many times for the role over the course of seven months and had to keep her casting a secret for three months She was announced as part of the cast at the end of April She only had experience with small parts in TV shows Her inexperience and lack of exposure were a crucial part of what convinced Abrams to give Ridley the role as the previous installments had featured relatively unknown talent that would not experience heightened degrees of scrutiny Abrams stated that Ridley was so funny and had a great spark as well as having her act out an emotional scene proclaiming that she nailed it on the first take Abrams went on to praise Ridley saying She was born with this gift to be in a moment and make it her own She simultaneously works from the inside out and the outside in Kennedy proclaimed Daisy had a physicality and a self confidence that was so important to the character we were looking for She epitomizes that optimism where anything is possible Director Dusan Lazarevic who was present at the casting of Ridley for a role in British drama series Silent Witness in addition to praising her acting range stated She showed a combination of vulnerability and strength which gave her a complexity and there was an intelligence in her eyes that was an indicator she could play quite a complicated part Cailey Fleming was additionally cast to portray a young Rey br Although Ridley said she was riddled with doubts and insecurities she said that Rey s hopefulness is what she related to most it was something driving me through the auditions even though it felt so insanely out of anything that I could ve imagined Ridley recalled her shooting experience as starting off bumpy with Abrams telling her that her first few takes were wooden But Ridley and Abrams had an incredibly collaborative process creating Rey Ridley recalled that the character changed from when we first began she became softer And I think that s probably me because Americans tend not to understand me so it helped slowing down the speech and everything just made it softer than I am Ridley has said that Rey will have some impact in a girl power y way adding that the character doesn t have to be one thing to embody a woman in a film It just so happens she s a woman but she transcends gender She s going to speak to men and women In an interview with Elle Ridley said She s so strong She s cool and smart and she can look after herself adding Young girls can look at her and know that they can wear trousers if they want to That they don t have to show off their bodies br Composer John Williams said he loved Ridley s presence in the film and found composing her musical theme an interesting challenge He said her mature and thoughtful motif suggests a strong female adventurer infused with the Force He added that the musical grammar of her theme is not heroic but conveys an adventurous tone that needs to illustrate empathy br br br Characterization br Rey is introduced as a year old woman in The Force Awakens She is stubborn headstrong brave optimistic and maintains fierce loyalty to her friends Matthew Yglesias of Vox wrote Rey is considerably less callow than Luke Ridley says of the character It s not because Rey is strong that she s amazing It s all the complexities of a human It s because she is a well drawn person who is struggling with things and you re with her br Rey is highly Force sensitive which is revealed when she is presented with the lightsaber first owned by Anakin Skywalker then his son Luke Without training she is able to use the Force and defeat the powerful Kylo Ren in a duel br On the mirror invoking vision Rey experiences in The Last Jedi writer and director Rian Johnson said that it represents the character learning that she has to connect with herself br In The Last Jedi Rey also discovers she has a connection in the Force with Kylo Ren in which Rian Johnson claims that it was used as a way to make Rey engage with him and get the two characters to talk without fighting each other to further develop their relationship Johnson explains that Rey seeing Kylo shirtless during one of these connections shows the increasing intimacy between them during their interactions In The Rise of Skywalker it is revealed that this connection makes them two halves of a dyad in the Force and the co writer of the film Chris Terrio explains this relationship as being sort of soulmate s in the Force and twins of fate twins of destiny br Both Johnson and director J J Abrams described their relationship as a romance br br br Appearances br br br The Force Awakens br Rey is introduced in the film The Force Awakens as a young adult who lives on the desert planet Jakku and survives by scavenging machine

The Skywalker Saga The character was also introduced as an outfit in the game Fortnite br br br Reception br br br General br The character and Ridley s portrayal have received critical acclaim Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal proclaims that Rey is a woman warrior with the stylish ferocity of a kung fu star praising the verve Ridley must have been born with plus the skill she must have acquired as a young actress coming up in England and stating It s hard to imagine what the movie and the sequels to come might have been if they d cast the wrong person but here Daisy Ridley is in all her unassuming glory and all s right with the galaxy Adam Howard of MSNBC states that one of the most pleasant surprises of the film has been the strength of its lead female character adding that some have likened Rey to a new feminist icon br Megan Garber of The Atlantic writes that Rey proves herself to be in extremely short order extremely adept as a fighter Emily Rome of HitFix describes Rey as more strong female character than strongly written saying the speed with which Rey mastered Jedi mind tricks and lightsaber fighting with zero training is the stuff of fan fiction Rey is geek feminist wish fulfillment Rome says Rey is everything we wanted in a Star Wars female character praising her for being a character that is independent skilled scrappy tough and doesn t need saving br Twitter users have debated whether Rey is a Mary Sue an unrealistically perfect idealized character on the basis of her seemingly natural skills as a mechanic a fighter a pilot and a user of The Force which draw admiration from other characters Screenwriter Max Landis posted a series of tweets in derisively referring to The Force Awakens as a fanfic movie with a Mary Sue as the main character Tasha Robinson of The Verge writes that Rey keeps falling into standard issue damsel in distress situations then capably rescuing herself She s a fantasy wish fulfillment character with outsized skills an inhuman reaction time and a clever answer to every question but so are the other major Star Wars heroes Robinson suggests viewers enjoy Rey s Mary Sue flawlessness saying We wouldn t be worrying about Rey s excessive coolness if she were Ray standard issue white male hero br Other outlets including Ridley herself have argued that the term Mary Sue carries an inherent gender bias and that the male characters from the original trilogy did not face comparable criticism Media critic Caroline Framke argues that Rey s abilities are not necessarily any more impressive than those of the character of Luke Skywalker and that fans instinctive criticism of characters like Rey reflects a double standard in that seemingly perfect male heroes are rarely so criticized J J Abrams stated that the people who are getting freaked out are the people who are accustomed to male privilege and this is not oppression this is about fairness He elaborated You can probably look at the first Star Wars movie that George Lucas did and say that Leia was too outspoken or she was too tough Anyone who wants to find a problem with anything can find the problem The internet seems to be made for that Adrienne Tyler of Screen Rant argued that Rey s abilities are explained in The Rise of Skywalker as resulting from the pair forming a dyad in the Force sharing the same fighting capabilities br Rey s unique hairstyle attracted attention before and after The Force Awakens was released being compared to Leia s hairdo from the original film with debate over whether it would become as popular Rey has also been compared to the titular character from the Hayao Miyazaki anime film Nausica of the Valley of the Wind br Richard Roeper described Ridley s portrayal of Rey as a breakout performance continuing by calling the character tough and resourceful and smart and brave Ridley was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress for her portrayal The first Reel Women in Technology Award for a fictional character was awarded to the character Rey br Some fans criticized Rey s trilogy wide character arc as insufficient Fan fiction author Ricca said that tension that was built in the first two films never gets resolved in the last film She wanted a moment at the end of The Rise of Skywalker in which Rey reacts to and reflects on everything that has happened to her br Some critics and fans have noted a visual resemblance between Rey s character design to that of Bastila Shan from the video game Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic and that her character arc shares thematic similarities with that of Bastila s br br br Parentage br The question of Rey s parentage was a significant point of discussion before The Rise of Skywalker was released Many fan theories arose such as Rey being the daughter of Luke or Han or being Obi Wan Kenobi s granddaughter The view that she is Luke s daughter was especially prominent with fans and critics highlighting their story arc similarities Star Wars being a Skywalker saga Rey having a strong attachment to Luke s lightsaber and being exceptionally strong with the Force without any training Some fan theories about Rey s parentage pointed to Rey s Theme featured in John Williams score of The Force Awakens as the theme shared similarities with the themes for Darth Vader and Luke br Abrams stated that he intentionally withheld Rey s last name and background in The Force Awakens He said that he felt that the origin of Kylo Ren was the only thing that could be revealed in his film and that he knew quite a bit about Rey s origin but would give courtesy to The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson by not saying any more br In The Last Jedi Rey is coaxed by Ren into admitting that her parents were nobodies Emily VanDerWerff of Vox equated this scene with Luke finding out that Darth Vader is his father which was his greatest nightmare To VanDerWerff Rey s greatest nightmare is being no one She added that while Ren has every reason to be lying about this to her mind it is a good thing that Rey is the child of nobody of particular importance to the story so far Josh Spiegel of The Hollywood Reporter stated that although some fans might be disappointed by Ren s revelation it fits in perfectly with the film s through line that one can be both exceptionally gifted in the Force and also not a Skywalker because the spirit of the Jedi extends to anyone with a gift and the power to believe br Before the release of The Rise of Skywalker Abrams said that there s more to the story than you ve seen though according to Ridley the facts presented in The Last Jedi would not change Rey being revealed as a Palpatine in The Rise of Skywalker received a mixed reception Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair interprets the twist as a rebuttal to the themes presented in Episode VIII calling it a blow to those fans who eagerly devoured Rian Johnson s message that anyone from anywhere can be a Force wielding hero Contrarily Ryan Britt of Fatherly wrote that the revelation may be resonant for those with a Dark Side inclined family because Rey decides not to play Palpatine s stupid game and when Palpatine s face melts off and the dark side disappears into the ether a lot of emotional family bullshit goes with it Inverse similarly argued that the end of the film sees Rey reject any power her grandfather held over her and bury the past in a completion of the hero s journey br Following the release of The Rise of Skywalker Daisy Ridley revealed that the identity of Rey s parents had been in constant flux over the course of the production of the sequel trilogy According to Ridley during early production Lucasfilm had been toying with an Obi Wan connection before settling on the idea of her character being a nobody J J Abrams then pitched the idea of Palpatine being Rey s grandfather to Ridley during pre production on Episode IX although this aspect of her character kept changing even into production James Hunt of Screen Rant argued that the idea of an Obi Wan connection would ve been an equally bad decision because it would still mean the character is powerful because of her lineage rather than Rey simply being powerful because the Force chose her It would have continued the focus on nostalgia and trying to connect everything rather than letting Rey be wholly new Kathleen Kennedy later clarified that there were a lot of ideas being thrown around but that Obi Wan having offspring was pretty much off the table br br br Merchandizing controversy br When The Force Awakens was released fans noticed a lack of licensed toys featuring Rey despite her being the film s main protagonist For example Hasbro released a version of Monopoly based on The Force Awakens that did not feature Rey After receiving criticism Hasbro stated that Rey was withheld to avoid revealing spoilers and that she would be featured in future toy releases Paul Southern the head of Lucasfilm Licensing said that they wanted to protect the secrets that the Force awakens in Rey and that her character carries a lightsaber He said that demand for Rey products was underestimated Abrams said it was preposterous and wrong that Rey was not well represented in merchandizing The CBBC presenter and voice actor Christopher Johnson stated It still baffles me to this day that some toy manufacturers don t think that girls want to play with superhero toys and that boys aren t interested in female characters br br br See also br Skywalker family br br br Notes br br br br br br Citations br br br Works cited br br br Further reading
