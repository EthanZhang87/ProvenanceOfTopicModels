Supporting Actress br br br Character br br br Concept and creation br The Force Awakens writer director J J Abrams told Entertainment Weekly in November I wanted to do Maz as a puppet originally but once we figured out the things that she was required to do it felt like performance capture was the way to go With most of the other creatures in her scenes being practical effects Abrams noted br br Maz needed to look and feel and be just like one of those creatures And given her mobility and given the role that she played it became clear that that was one creature where we should use the tool of

Andy Serkis who portrays CGI character Supreme Leader Snoke and had previously portrayed numerous other motion capture roles in other films She said The biggest advice he gave me that was so important
