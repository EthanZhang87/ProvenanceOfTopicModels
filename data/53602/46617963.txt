Disney Infinity features similar gameplay mechanics to Disney Infinity and Disney Infinity Although sharing many key elements the game s combat system has been redesigned to become more in depth and complex The game s combat system is influenced by the Star Wars The Force Unleashed and its sequel Kingdom Hearts and most of the Spider Man s aerial combat themed video game series except Ultimate Spider Man Lightsabers have been integrated into combat due to the inclusion of Star Wars characters Characters who use lightsabers in combat can utilize additional weapons For instance playable character Luke Skywalker has the ability to use a blaster and a lightsaber which used together can juggle enemies in the air Full combos have been integrated which allows the player to pause mid combo and branch off into another variation of the combo Playable characters with the ability to use the Force in Star Wars mythology have the ability to push and pull enemies during combat Special attacks which were introduced in Disney Infinity Marvel Super Heroes have returned Only the bearer of a close ranged weapon such as lightsabers and other blade or staff weapons including the characters who have their own primary close ranged weapons like Mulan whose primary weapon is a staff similar to the Jedi and Sith s own primary lightsaber and characters who can fly are able to perform an aerial combo Instead of waiting for a progress bar to fill up for a special attack to be performed a new feature allows the attack to be released early but the effects of the attack are not as strong Auto
