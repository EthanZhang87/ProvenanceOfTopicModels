May Trank was no longer working on the film A Boba Fett film was still being considered by Lucasfilm as of August and James Mangold was set to write and direct it in May with Kinberg co writing and producing Mangold described his take as being a borderline R rated single planet spaghetti Western and he listened to the music of Ennio Morricone while working on the script Following the financial failure of the film Solo A Star Wars Story Disney reconsidered their Star Wars film output By October the Boba Fett film was no longer moving forward and Lucasfilm was prioritizing the Disney

humane antihero keeps you endeared to Boba s story NME s Jesse Hassenger said the show was really season of The Mandalorian and that it had a baffling structure with poorly integrated flashbacks that halted abruptly halfway through the season and an equally sudden swerve away from Boba Fett himself shortly thereafter Nick Wanserski of The A V Club said that the show was very watchable but that it ended the same way it started a mess The Ringer staff opined that excluding Fett from the series penultimate two episodes negatively impacted the finale with general praise for the tie in to The

rad while Rohan Nahaar of The Indian Express criticized it Flint stated that the decision to kill off the Tuskens was an obvious and lazy one The cyborg gang was negatively compared to the Power Rangers The digitally de aged Luke was considered an improvement from his appearance on The Mandalorian but some considered the special effect off putting Lex Pryor from The Ringer considered that the show failed to deliver its potential and the series will never actually have to focus on anything other than the lives of a select few characters and their closest relatives br br br Accolades br br
