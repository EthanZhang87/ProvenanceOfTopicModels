Gary Kurtz loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films In Lucas confirmed that he had the nine film series plotted but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy and pressure from his wife Marcia Lucas to settle down he had decided to cancel further sequels by br However technical advances in the late s and early s including the ability to create computer generated imagery CGI inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga In Lucas stated that the prequel trilogy would be unbelievably expensive After viewing an early CGI test created by Industrial Light Magic for Jurassic Park Lucas said br br We did a test for Steven Spielberg and when we put them up on the screen I had tears in my eyes It was like one of those moments in history like the invention of the lightbulb or the first telephone call A major gap had been crossed and things were never going to be the same br In Lucas acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy in the Lucasfilm Fan Club magazine and announced this to Variety in late Producer Rick McCallum reached out to Frank Darabont who had previously written The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and The Shawshank Redemption for possible future writing duties He was considered until at least but as time went on Lucas continued writing the screenplays himself Before Lucas chose to direct the prequels Return of the Jedi director Richard Marquand expressed interest in directing one of the prequel films up until his death in The popularity of the franchise had been prolonged by the Star Wars Expanded Universe so that it still had a large audience A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in updated the year old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new episodes br br br Films br Having been significantly anticipated by fans Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace was released on May It sees the Jedi coming into contact with the young Anakin Skywalker and the corruption of the Galactic Senate by Darth Sidious Episode II Attack of the Clones was released on May The story jumps ahead years and finds Anakin now a Jedi apprentice of Obi Wan Kenobi pursuing a forbidden romance as well as the outbreak of the Clone Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith the first PG film in the franchise was released on May It picks up three years following Attack of the Clones and depicts the Jedi Order being annihilated via Order the Galactic Republic coming to an end and the Galactic Empire forming in its place and Anakin falling to the dark side of the Force and being reborn as Darth Vader all under the machinations of Palpatine br br br Episode I The Phantom Menace br br years before the events of the original film years before the creation of the Galactic Empire two Jedi Knights Qui Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi Wan Kenobi are sent to negotiate with the corrupt Trade Federation who has formed a blockade around the planet Naboo Naboo s senator Palpatine who is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious has covertly engineered the blockade as a pretext to become Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic With the help of Naboo s fourteen year old queen Padm Amidala and accompanied by a clumsy native named Jar Jar Binks Qui Gon and Obi Wan escape the blockade They land on Tatooine to repair their starship and meet a nine year old slave named Anakin Skywalker Believing him to be the prophesied Chosen One Qui Gon takes Anakin to be trained as a Jedi br The prequels were originally planned to fill in history tangential to the original trilogy but Lucas realized that they could form the first half of one long story focusing on Anakin This would shape the film series into a self contained saga In Lucas began writing the screenplay for the first prequel initially titled Episode I The Beginning Following the film s release Lucas announced that he would be directing the next two br br br Episode II Attack of the Clones br br years later an assassination attempt is made on Padm Amidala who is now serving as Naboo s senator after finishing her term as queen Jedi Knight Obi Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin are assigned to protect her Obi Wan tracks the assassin while Anakin and Padm secretly fall in love Meanwhile Chancellor Palpatine schemes to draw the galaxy into the Clone Wars between the Republic army of clone troopers led by the Jedi and the Confederacy of Independent Systems led by Darth Sidious Sith apprentice Count Dooku br The first draft of Episode II was completed just weeks before principal photography and Lucas hired Jonathan Hales a writer from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles to polish it Unsure of a title Lucas had jokingly called the film Jar Jar s Great Adventure In writing The Empire Strikes Back Lucas initially considered that Lando Calrissian was a clone from a planet of clones which caused the Clone Wars mentioned in A New Hope He later came up with the concept of an army of clone shock troopers from a remote planet which attacked the Republic and was resisted by the Jedi br br br Episode III Revenge of the Sith br br Three years into the Clone Wars Anakin becomes disillusioned with the Jedi Council and begins to have visions of Padm dying in childbirth Palpatine reveals himself as Darth Sidious and convinces Anakin that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save Padm s life Desperate Anakin submits to Sidious and assumes the Sith moniker Darth Vader Sidious then orders the Jedi s extermination while declaring the former Republic an Empire Vader engages in a lightsaber duel with Obi Wan on the volcanic planet Mustafar which results in Vader getting disfigured and losing both his legs and his left arm while Padm dies after giving birth to twins br Work on Episode III began before Episode II was released with one scene shot during the earlier film s production Lucas originally told concept artists that the film would open with a montage of the Clone Wars and included a scene of Palpatine revealing to Anakin that he had willed his conception through the Force Lucas reviewed and radically reorganized the plot having Anakin execute Dooku in the first act to foreshadow his fall to the dark side After principal photography was completed in Lucas made more changes rewriting Anakin s arc He would now primarily turn to the dark side in a quest to save Padm rather than just believing that the Jedi are plotting to take over the Republic The rewrite was accomplished both through editing principal footage and filming new and revised scenes during pick ups in br br br Themes br Lucas made a conscious effort to parallel scenes and dialogue between the prequel and original trilogy especially concerning the journey of Anakin Skywalker in the prequels and that of his son Luke in the older films Together with the original trilogy Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as the tragedy of Darth Vader According to Lucas the correct order to watch the films is by episode order br There are many references to Christianity in the prequel trilogy such as the appearance of Darth Maul whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil complete with red skin and horns The Star Wars film cycle features a similar Christian narrative involving Anakin Skywalker he is the Chosen One the individual prophesied to bring balance to the Force who was conceived of a virgin birth However unlike Jesus Anakin falls from grace and seemingly fails to fulfill his destiny until the prophecy comes true in Return of the Jedi The saga draws heavily from the hero s journey an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell br Political science has been an important element of Star Wars since the franchise launched in focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship br Palpatine being a chancellor before becoming the Emperor in the prequel trilogy alludes to Adolf Hitler s role as chancellor before appointing himself F hrer Lucas has also drawn parallels between Palpatine and historical dictators such as Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte as well as former president of the United States Richard Nixon The Great Jedi Purge depicted in Revenge of the Sith mirrors the events of the Night of the Long Knives The corruption of the Galactic Republic is modeled after the fall of the Roman Republic and the formation of an empire br br br Re releases br The films have been made available on many home video formats most notably on DVD and Blu ray Like the Special Edition re issue of the original trilogy Lucasfilm has altered the films with each release although these additional changes are minor br A D theatrical re release was planned for the then six film franchise beginning with The Phantom Menace in February However following Disney s purchase of Lucasfilm the subsequent releases were canceled to focus on the sequel trilogy br The trilogy was made available for streaming on Disney upon the service s launch in late br br br Reception br br br Box office performance br br br Critical response br br The prequel trilogy received mixed reviews generally improving in critical reception with each installment Common criticisms surrounded the over reliance on computer generated imagery wooden dialogue including scenes of romance between Anakin and Padm slow paced political scenes and the comic relief character of Jar Jar Binks whose role was reduced after the first film Several alien characters introduced in The Phantom Menace have been subject to accusations of racial stereotypes Jar Jar is asserted to caricature a stereotyped Jamaican while the Gungan species at large has been said to suggest a primitive African tribe The greedy Neimoidians of the Trade Federation have been noted as resembling East Asian stereotypes with some deliberately given Thai accents and Watto s mannerisms and hooked nose appearance were based on footage of Alec Guinness as the Jewish character Fagin in the film Oliver Twist leading some to assert that the slave owning character is a Jewish stereotype Lucas denied all accusations of racial stereotypes br Many expressed their disappointment with the trilogy s portrayal of Anakin Skywalker particularly calling the writing weak and the dialogue wooden although Hayden Christensen s performance in the third film was more well received Contrarily Ewan McGregor s portrayal of Obi Wan Kenobi following in the footsteps of Alec Guinness has been generally praised Natalie Portman has expressed her disappointment with the trilogy s negative reception saying that When something has that much anticipation it can almost only disappoint She also acknowledged that With the perspective of time it s been re evaluated by a lot of people who actually really love them now br The trilogy has also received some criticism for clashing aesthetically with the original trilogy While the older films feature rough and aged technology the prequels depict relatively sleek and new industrial designs Some have criticized this design choice by saying that it makes the earlier time period appear to depict a more advanced civilization although Revenge of the Sith brings the design closer to that of the original trilogy Lucas has called the choice clever as it illustrates the halt of technological innovation in a time period of civil war br Conversely some argue for the prequel trilogy s positive elements including its handling of political issues especially involving the rise of fascism This includes Star Wars The Last Jedi director and writer Rian Johnson who also praised its visual effects innovations Jar Jar Binks has been regarded as the first fully CGI character in a live action film and perceived as paving the way for Gollum in The Lord of the Rings KING TV s Kelly Lawler complimented the lightsaber battles as sleeker affairs with better choreography and more athleticism compared to the original trilogy J J Abrams praised the acting of Ian McDiarmid as Darth Sidious stating that the scene where he recounts the tragedy of Darth Plagueis is the best of the trilogy br George Lucas has responded to the negative criticism by saying that like the original films they were intended for year olds while acknowledging that fans who saw the originals when they were young had different expectations as adults The prequels have been noted as retaining a dedicated fanbase primarily composed of Millennials and Gen Zers who were children at the time of their release Since the late s the prequels have amassed a cult following via memes on social media with Neel Patel of Syfy Wire attributing this to the internet being a paradise of irreverence just like George Lucas scripts Additionally both the animated series Star Wars The Clone Wars and Disney s sequel trilogy has been noted to have retroactively improved the perception of the prequel trilogy among fans br Screen Rant favorably compared the way the prequels ended the saga compared to the sequels writing Amidst the bad execution of the story the fact of the matter is the prequel movies tell one coherent narrative with a clear through line between movies this is something sorely lacking in the sequel trilogy Similarly Den of Geek s Andrew Blair wrote that the prequels were enjoying a deserved reappraisal following vocal discourse surrounding the sequels He considered the prequels to be the superior trilogy as in contrast to its successors the films had consistency and the product of a singular vision br br br Accolades br br br Academy Awards br br br br Footnotes br br Citations br br br
