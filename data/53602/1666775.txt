title: List of Star Wars planets and moons
id: 1666775
The fictional universe of the Star Wars franchise features multiple planets and moons While only the feature films and selected other works are considered canon to the franchise since the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company some canon planets were first named or explored in works from the non canon Star Wars expanded universe now rebranded Star Wars Legends br In the theatrical Star Wars films many scenes set on these planets and moons were filmed on location rather than on a sound stage For example the resort city of Canto Bight located on the planet Cantonica seen in Star Wars The Last Jedi was filmed in Dubrovnik Croatia br br br Star Wars canon astrography br br The Star Wars galaxy contains several broad sub regions Their exact definitions fluctuated somewhat during the Legends continuity but were later formally updated by the new canon continuity when Disney purchased Lucasfilm The new canon map is broadly similar to the later versions of the Legends galactic map br As a general rule most of the galaxy s wealth power and population are concentrated near the middle of the galactic circle the Core Worlds The first major interstellar powers in the core are stated to have risen many millennia ago gradually coalescing into the early Galactic Republic with its capital at Coruscant Waves of colonization and conquest by the Republic gradually spread outward from the Core into the sparser systems at the galaxy s edge such as Tatooine Worlds of the Outer Rim are rich in raw resources but lack the population infrastructure or political power of the Core Major galactic sub regions are further divided into quadrants sectors etc down to individual star systems and planets br The galaxy has at least two companion satellite dwarf galaxies one of which is known as the Rishi Maze but they are very lightly settled or explored br The canon map depicts a top down view of the galactic disk with north as the side of the galactic center that Coruscant is located on As the capital planet of the Republic and later the Empire Coruscant is used as the reference point for galactic astronomy set at XYZ coordinates Standardized galactic time measurements are also based on Coruscant s local solar day and year br According to the updated Visual Dictionary series made by Pablo Hidalgo for the Sequel Trilogy these are the general regions of the galaxy spreading outward from the Core br br Deep Core the innermost brightly lit region of space with a supermassive black hole at the center which binds the galaxy together Densely packed with stars nebulae and other anomalies it is therefore thinly settled due to the resulting high radiation levels and lack of stable hyperspace routes br Core Worlds powerful and wealthy planets with millennia long histories many of them founding members of the Galactic Republic On screen examples include Coruscant Corellia Alderaan and Hosnian Prime br The Colonies the first colonies founded by the nascent Galactic Republic in ancient times The name is somewhat anachronistic as they have grown nearly as powerful as the Core Worlds themselves though their histories aren t quite as long or prestigious i e comparable to how the United States or Canada could be called the colonies of Great Britain Mentioned by name in The Rise of Skywalker br Inner Rim the original edge of the Galactic Republic where expansion waves stopped for many generations br Expansion Region nestled between the Inner Rim and the Mid Rim anachronistically named due to a new colonization wave starting again br Mid Rim Generally industrialized though not very important planets but more developed than the true frontier in the Outer Rim On screen examples include Naboo and Kashyyyk br Outer Rim a vast region including all of the last major star systems up to the galaxy s edge As the last region that the Republic expanded into it is relatively the least developed a frontier more often than not exploited by the central galactic government for its resources On screen examples include Tatooine Yavin Hoth Bespin Endor Geonosis Utapau Mustafar and Kessel br Wild Space star systems located beyond the Outer Rim because a galaxy s edge is not a fixed border line but a concentration of stars tapering off in frequency Unlike the Outer Rim these sparse few systems around the galaxy s circumference were never formally charted More broadly Attack of the Clones established that the Star Wars galaxy actually possesses at least three small satellite galaxies never colonized and considered largely inhospitable The secret cloner world Kamino however is located in one of these minor galactic clusters beyond the Outer Rim br Unknown Regions the new Canon map establishes that due to the stability of hyperspace lanes inhabited planets are weighted toward the eastern quadrant of the galactic plane with the western one being mostly unexplored These Unknown Regions are home to the first Jedi temple on Ahch To and the Chiss Ascendancy into which Grand Admiral Thrawn was born The remnants of the Empire retreated here after their defeat at Endor reforming into the First Order as well as secret even to the First Order Darth Sidious Sith forces reconstituting on Exegol br Western Reaches the sectors once controlled by the Republic that border the Unknown Regions of the galactic west Essentially similar to the Outer Rim in terms of their history and economic development the only difference being that instead of being located at the galaxy s physical edge they are located at the edge of galactic exploration in the western side of the Republic In The Force Awakens it is stated in dialogue that Jakku is in the Western Reaches br Apart from these broad regions radiating out from the galactic core there are also several major galactic sub regions of note br br Mandalorian space technically located in the Outer Rim but relatively close to the border with the Mid Rim near Kashyyyk in the galactic northeast The planet Mandalore had its own regional space empire in ancient times led by their formidable warrior culture The Mandalorians were the most difficult enemies the Jedi ever faced short of the Sith they were not Force wielders but were a culture of regular humans who had honed themselves to possess the pinnacle of combat training equipment and battle tactics During a series of long wars with the Republic however many centuries before the Clone Wars the Jedi were eventually able to fight them into submission though with heavy losses In the Star Wars Clone Wars animated series both the Republic and the Separatists compete for support from rival Mandalorian factions and in the later Star Wars Rebels animated series Mandalorians again divide into a proxy war between pro Imperial and pro Rebel forces According to The Mandalorian TV series this eventually resulted in the devastation of Mandalorian space by the Empire with surviving enclaves scattering across the Outer Rim br Hutt Space a fairly large swath of space along the eastern quadrant of the galactic plane loosely straddling the border between the Mid Rim and Outer Rim The Hutts are a kleptocratic Mafia state derided as gangsters composed of several rival clans The Hutts resources and power are formidable enough that both the Republic and the Empire never bothered to conquer them while the Hutts were too divided by their own internal politics to seriously challenge the Republic unlike the Mandalorians br This official galactic astrography was later re confirmed for the first time in on screen live action dialogue in The Mandalorian In the second season s fourth episode The Siege a classroom is briefly shown on a planet in the Outer Rim in which a lesson on galactic astrography is being taught by a protocol droid The teacher not only lists off each of these major regions from the Visual Dictionary but lists them in the exact same order from the Outer Rim to the Core br br Who can name one of the five major trade routes in the galaxy The Hydian Way runs from the Outer Rim to as far away as the Core Worlds However there are several other regions within our galaxy They are the Mid Rim the Expansion Region the Inner Rim the Colonies the Core and the Deep Core br br br Star Wars canon planets and moons br The following list names prominent planets and moons from the Star Wars films or other canon media br br br Star Wars Legends planets and moons br These are planets with multiple appearances in the Star Wars Expanded Universe now rebranded as Star Wars Legends The accompanying works were declared non canon by Lucasfilm in April following its acquisition by The Walt Disney Company in October br br br Similarities to real world planets br br The discovery of exoplanets in the real world universe gained pace in the early st century In the US space agency NASA published an article which stated that many of the newly discovered astronomical bodies possessed scientifically confirmed properties that are similar to planets in the fictional Star Wars universe br Kepler b a rocky super Earth type planet is said to be similar to the Star Wars planet Coruscant Likewise the planets Kepler b and Kepler b planets discovered orbitting binary stars probably resemble the desert world Tatooine The hot molten worlds of Kepler b and Kepler b are comparable to the volcanic planet Mustafar OGLE BLG Lb a cold remote exoplanet is like the ice planet Hoth Kepler b thought by scientists to be an ocean planet is compared to the planet Kamino According to NASA there are also similarities to Alderaan and Endor in the real world universe br br br Solar System br Two non canonical works also feature the real life Solar System s planets Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas contains a feature presented as a clip from a gossip column in which a pair of Duros are abducted by humans and taken to Urthha Earth where they create havoc by misunderstanding terrestrial objects and food In issue of the comic series Star Wars Tales the story Into the Great Unknown finds Han Solo and Chewbacca in the Millennium Falcon fleeing the Imperial Navy They jump to hyperspace without doing calculations and find themselves in the middle of our Solar System overpassing Saturn Jupiter and Mars while decelerating and landing in Northern America Han is killed by Native Americans and a mourning Chewbacca leaves the Falcon to live in the trees where the natives believe him to be a sasquatch In an epilogue set years later archaeologist Dr Jones and his sidekick Short Round searching for the sasquatch find the Falcon and Han s remains br br br See also br br List of Star Wars filming locations br Planets in science fiction br br br br br br Sources br Content
