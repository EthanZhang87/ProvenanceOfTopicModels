Jabba Desilijic Tiure more commonly known as Jabba the Hutt is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas He is a large slug like crime lord of the Hutt species Jabba first appeared in the film Return of the Jedi in which he is portrayed by a one ton puppet operated by several puppeteers He subsequently appeared in the Special Edition of the original Star Wars film and the prequel film The Phantom Menace Jabba is voiced by Larry Ward in Return of the Jedi and by Scott Schumann in Star Wars and The Phantom Menace br Jabba lives in a palace on the desert planet Tatooine He places a bounty on the smuggler Han Solo and sends bounty hunters to capture him After Darth Vader freezes Solo in carbonite the bounty hunter Boba Fett delivers the frozen Solo to Jabba who puts him on display in his palace A group of Solo s friends attempt to rescue him but Jabba captures them he enslaves Princess Leia and decrees that Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca will be fed to a Sarlacc Luke orchestrates an escape and during the chaos Leia strangles Jabba to death br Jabba has received generally positive reviews from critics and his name has entered common parlance as being synonymous with negative qualities such as morbid obesity corruption and corporate greed br br br Concept creation and portrayal br br br Episode IV A New Hope br The original script to Star Wars describes Jabba as a fat slug like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth but Lucas stated in an interview that the initial character he had in mind was much furrier and resembled a Wookiee When filming the scene between Han Solo and Jabba in Lucas employed Irish actor Declan Mulholland to stand in for Jabba the Hutt wearing a shaggy brown costume Lucas planned to replace Mulholland in post production with a stop motion creature The scene was meant to connect Star Wars to Return of the Jedi to motivate Han Solo to take a risk and carry dangerous passengers and explain why Han Solo was imprisoned at the end of The Empire Strikes Back Nevertheless Lucas decided to leave the scene out of the final film on account of budget time constraints and because he felt that it did not enhance the film s plot br Lucas revisited the scene in the Special Edition release of A New Hope restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt He also replaced the English dialogue with Huttese a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt Joseph Letteri the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford who portrayed Solo with the crew looking like they had merely photographed it Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete The scene was polished further for the release on DVD improving Jabba s appearance with advancements in CGI techniques br br At one point of the original scene Ford walks behind Mulholland This became a problem when adding the CGI Jabba since his tail would be in the way The solution was to have Solo step on Jabba s tail causing him to yelp in pain In the DVD release Jabba reacts more strongly winding up as if to punch Solo In this version shadows of Solo can be seen on Jabba s body to make the CGI more convincing br Lucas confessed that people were disappointed with the CGI of Jabba s appearance complaining that the character looked fake Lucas dismisses this stating that whether a character is ultimately portrayed as a puppet or as CGI it will always be fake since the character is ultimately not real He says he sees no difference between a puppet made of latex and one generated by a computer According to Paul Blake who portrayed the bounty hunter Greedo in A New Hope his own character s scene was created in response to Lucas having to cut the Jabba scene br br br Episode VI Return of the Jedi br br Lucas based the CGI on the character as he originally appeared in Return of the Jedi In this film Jabba the Hutt is an immense slug like creature designed by Lucas Industrial Light Magic Creature Shop Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed In my sketches Jabba was huge agile sort of an apelike figure But then the design went into another direction and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature According to the documentary From Star Wars to Jedi Lucas rejected initial designs of the character One made Jabba appear too human almost like a Fu Manchu character while a second made him look too snail like Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two drawing for further inspiration on an O Galop cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of the Michelin Man Return of the Jedi costume designer Nilo Rodis Jamero commented My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when he was older I saw him as a very refined man Most of the villains we like are very smart people But Phil Tippett kept imagining him as some kind of slug almost like in Alice in Wonderland At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that s smoking I kept thinking I must be really off but eventually that s where it led up to br br br Production and design br Designed by visual effects artist Phil Tippett Jabba the Hutt was inspired by the anatomy of several animal species His body structure and reproductive processes were based on annelid worms which are hermaphroditic hairless worms with no skeleton Jabba s head was modeled after that of a snake complete with bulbous slit pupilled eyes and a mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large prey Moist amphibian qualities were given to his skin Jabba s design would come to represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent Star Wars fiction br In Return of the Jedi Jabba is portrayed by a one ton puppet that took three months and half a million dollars to construct While filming the movie the puppet had its own makeup artist The puppet required three puppeteers to operate making it one of the largest ever used in a motion picture Stuart Freeborn designed the puppet while John Coppinger sculpted its latex clay and foam pieces The puppeteers included David Alan Barclay Toby Philpott and Mike Edmonds who were members of Jim Henson s Muppet group Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character s English dialogue while Philpott controlled the left arm head and tongue The tongue was a light beige color and came out of Jabba s mouth several times When he encountered Leia Organa for the first time and enslaved her he extended his tongue and licked at her face Leia reacted with such disgust upon seeing the tongue because in one take Philpott moved the tongue closer than what Carrie Fisher was comfortable with and it licked her unintentionally Edmonds the shortest of the three men who also played the Ewok Logray in later scenes was responsible for the movement of Jabba s tail Tony Cox who also played an Ewok would assist as well The eyes and facial expressions were operated by radio control br br Lucas voiced displeasure in the puppet s appearance and immobility complaining that the puppet had to be moved around the set to film different scenes In the DVD commentary to the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi Lucas notes that if the technology had been available in Jabba the Hutt would have been a CGI character similar to the one that appears in the Special Edition scene of A New Hope br Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film but his lines are subtitled in English His voice and Huttese language dialogue were performed by the uncredited voice of Larry Ward A heavy booming quality was given to Ward s voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal and processing it through a subharmonic generator A soundtrack of wet slimy sound effects was recorded to accompany the movement of the puppet s limbs and mouth br Jabba the Hutt s musical theme throughout the film composed by John Williams is played on a tuba The theme is very similar to one which Williams wrote for a heavyset character in Fitzwilly though the theme does not appear on that film s soundtrack album Williams later turned the theme into a symphonic piece performed by the Boston Pops Orchestra featuring a tuba solo by Chester Schmitz The role of the piece in film and popular culture has become a focus of study by musicologists such as Gerald Sloan who says that Williams piece blends the monstrous and the lyrical br According to film historian Laurent Bouzereau Jabba the Hutt s death in Return of the Jedi was suggested by script writer Lawrence Kasdan Lucas decided that Leia should strangle him with her slave chain He was inspired by a scene from The Godfather where an obese character named Luca Brasi Lenny Montana is garroted by an assassin br br br Other portrayals br Jabba is voiced by Scott Schumann in post editions of Star Wars and in The Phantom Menace In The Phantom Menace s end credits Jabba was jokingly credited as playing himself In the radio drama adaption of the original trilogy

reinforces his personality as a criminal deviant In Return of the Jedi Han Solo calls Jabba a slimy piece of worm ridden filth Film critic Roger Ebert described him as a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat Incidentally the word for toad or frog in Slavic languages zhaba sounds very close to Jabba while in Arabic t means fish whale Science fiction writer Jeanne Cavelos wrote that Jabba deserved the award for most disgusting alien Science fiction authors Tom and Martha Veitch wrote that Jabba s body is a miasmic mass and that t he Hutt s lardaceous body seemed to periodically release
