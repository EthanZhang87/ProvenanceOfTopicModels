the best until last He lauded McGregor s performance highlighting the scene between Kenobi and Princess Leia Commenting on Darth Vader and Kenobi s duel Cardy thought it to be their best duel so far feeling the set design choreography and Holt s music had complemented the scene well However he expressed minor complaints with how the editing had distracted from Vader and Kenobi s duel with Reva s pursuit for Luke Skywalker desiring the series to focus more on the latter Grading the episode an A Maggie Lovitt from Collider felt that Chow and Harold s direction and writing had concluded the narrative threads well She also cited the scenes Kenobi has between Leia and Luke as being good ones and felt Reva s decision to not kill Luke had provided her with a nice story albeit being far from complete Lovvitt also praised McGregor and Christensen s performances saying they were able to breathe new life into the characters with the backing of Harold s strong storytelling and Chow s keen ability to deliver visually stunning and dynamic scene work In a star out of review Bradley Russell s review for Total Film summarized the episode as being a rousing concluding episode one packed with an abundance of fan service well earned emotional interactions and a lightsaber battle that will live long in the memory Russell opined that the final duel between Vader and Kenobi was worth the wait deeply enjoying the choreography and its emotional weight and felt its quality to be augmented by Chow s direction However he felt that the episode also contained elements of fan service with Emperor Palpatine s cameo Kenobi saying Hello there to Luke and Qui Gonn Jinn s cameo the latter of which he enjoyed br Megan Crouse s review for Den of Geek rated the episode out of stars She felt that the episode was repetitive and contrived opining that the episode didn t effectively conclude its narrative as it was trying to connect to other elements of the Star Wars franchise and indulged in too much fan service However she enjoyed that Reva s redemption deeming it to be a subversion from the same old trope where the hero steps in to save the villain cited McGregor s performance as being an improvement to the prequel trilogy and found Kenobi and Vader s duel to contain dramatic moments With a C grade Manuel Betancourt for The A V Club noted that many narrative elements would remain the same including certain characters surviving and Luke and Leia not being aware of their parentage He also conceded to enjoying Kenobi and Vader s duel like Crouse but did not enjoy Reva s characterization in the episode He summarized the episode as being a rerun of Star Wars hits and felt the series did not justify its existence Writing for Screen Rant Graeme Guttmann also agreed with Betancourt s sentiment that the series did not justify its existence enjoying the duel between Kenobi and Vader but also feeling that something was missing and did not enjoy how the overall series had handled dealing with issues regarding Kenobi s character and how its narrative had led up to their collective duel Contrary to some other reviewers he felt that Reva s pursuit of Luke was more exciting than the duel as he had enjoyed her mysterious characterization br br br br br br External links br Part VI at IMDb br Part VI on Wookieepedia a Star Wars wiki
