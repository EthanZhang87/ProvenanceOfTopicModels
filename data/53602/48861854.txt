example he said that Finn might suddenly snatch a weapon and then run away In The Last Jedi Finn was originally going to travel to Canto Bight with Poe The film s director Rian Johnson realized the dialogue of the two characters was interchangeable which resulted in what he called a flat storyline He created the character Rose to challenge and contrast with Finn and made her his companion instead br br br Reception br Both the character Finn and Boyega s portrayal were praised by a number of critics Brian Truitt of USA Today lauded the dynamic between Finn and Rey and praised the seriously clever dialogue between Finn and Han Drew McWeeny of HitFix said Boyega has a great combination of self interested fear and reluctant heroism that he plays beautifully and that he expertly charts Finn s evolution as a person Robbie Collin wrote in The Telegraph that Boyega has a would be heroic schtick that is half brave half anxious and very funny Collin said that Finn wants to be a daring freedom fighter but is uncertain about his aptitude Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described Finn as bracingly comic and cunning Ty Burr of The Boston Globe offered a critical appraisal calling Finn a weak link who vacillates between noble impulses and cowardice until our interest drops away He added The performance is fine but it s just fine with little of the iconic bite a Wagnerian cartoon like this needs br Finn s introduction was met with some racist reactions online to which Boyega responded I m not going to lose sleep over people After the first trailer premiered Boyega responded to critics with To whom it may concern Get used to it and further commented that All the films I ve done have had a secret commentary on stereotypical mentalities It s about getting people to drop a prejudiced state of mind and realise Oh shit we re just watching normal people In response to those who desired to boycott the film over their disagreements with the existence of a black stormtrooper Boyega replied I m proud of my heritage and no man can take that away from me I wasn t raised to fear people with a difference of opinion They are merely victims of a disease in their mind br Some criticized The Rise of Skywalker for its treatment of characters of color including Finn In January an abandoned script for Episode IX was leaked titled Star Wars Duel of the Fates and written by Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly Some media sources argued that it gave characters like Finn more to do In the script Finn convinces stormtroopers to defect from the First Order and leads them into battle against it Concept art of Finn s speech while holding a flag as well as dialogue from the unmade film were shared on social media and compared very positively and paralleling a speech given by Boyega during the Black Lives Matter protests In September John Boyega publicly criticized The Last Jedi for sidelining characters played by people of color In November he revealed that this led him to have a very honest conversation with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy who supported his claims br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Finn in the StarWars com Databank
