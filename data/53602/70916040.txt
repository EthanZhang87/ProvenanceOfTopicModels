the project s cancellation due to the financial failure of Solo A Star Wars Story McGregor entered negotiations to star in a six episode Disney limited series centered around Kenobi The series was officially announced by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy at the D event Deborah Chow was hired to direct all episodes for the series by September while Joby Harold became the head writer and showrunner in April following Kennedy s disapproval with the scripts and subsequent rewrites The series is executive produced by Harold Chow McGregor Kennedy and Michelle Rejwan Chow and Harold wanted the series to be a character study for Kenobi and worked to connect elements from the prequel trilogy and original trilogy Harold wanted to further explore Kenobi s character following the events of Order and wanted him to deal with issues from his past Chow also took inspirations from gritty poetic westerns including The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford The Proposition and the works of Akira Kurosawa br br br Writing br Head writer Joby Harold wrote the scene where Kenobi discovers the Jedi vault in the Fortress Inquisitorius with the intention of making Kenobi confront the reality of what has happened to the galaxy and also what s happened to the Jedi as he was originally a recluse living on a cave in Tatooine somewhat cut off from reality He also added that Kenobi s confrontation of reality and being faced with this harsh horror was an important part in Kenobi s overall journey He conceived of showing the Jedi corpses within the vault in the Fortress Inquisitorius as he wanted to include something within the bowels of that facility that would be shocking and consistent with Star Wars He wanted it to be something that really felt like a gut punch for Obi Wan in that moment and compared the Jedi corpses in the vault to being pinned butterflies on the wall While writing Reva s interrogation of Leia for information on the Path network Harold was aware that Leia had Force powers but did not want to be very overt with Leia s Force sensitivity and instead wrote the scene to be a reference for the audience He also added that the scene revolved around the two characters and we didn t want to step out of the scene and start to say Here she is in her journey towards Force sensitivity Furthermore Harold also felt the episode marked a turning point in Kenobi s overall character arc as he had begun to recover his powers stating that he is starting to need to find that part of himself again in order to rescue Leia Chow also wanted to emphasize that the Rebellion movement had not begun to form yet despite opposition to the Galactic Empire Harold had described it as people doing the best they can rather than being freedom fighters and ultimately felt Tala epitomized that particular concept br br br Casting br The episode stars Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi and features co stars Indira Varma as Tala Durith Vivien Lyra Blair as

Rotten Tomatoes reports a approval rating with an average rating of based on reviews The site s critical consensus reads Obi Wan Kenobi Part IV is a slick caper in a space vacuum but there is an anxious sense that this saga is spinning its wheels when it can t afford to waste its limited runtime br Bradley Russell from Total Film gave the episode out of stars calling it a a so so episode that counts as the series first real minor disappointment He felt the episode s plot of Kenobi and Tala Durith rescuing Princess Leia was derivative of The Mandalorian episodes Chapter The Prisoner and Chapter The Believer He felt Reva had too much screen time in the episode though he praised Blair s performance He also highlighted Chow s direction praising the visuals of the action scenes in the episode and additionally opined that the episode was a treat for Jedi Fallen Order sic fans He also praised the production design for the Fortress Inquisitorius but criticized the visuals and design of the escape sequence negatively comparing it to The Mandalorian and a then released Andor trailer He liked Vader s scene writing that it provides the episode with a much needed jolt of energy though he criticized Vader s decision for keeping Reva alive and ultimately concluded by stating it s likely that this episode will feel like an anomaly an episode that doesn t quite match up to what s come before it Megan Crouse at Den of Geek gave the episode a out of stars also highlighting the production design for Fortress Inquisitorius She also praised the cinematography and direction in particular commending the lighting during scenes featuring Kenobi s lightsabers and lauded both Blair and McGregor s performance However she criticized the writing for Reva s character some of the visual effects for the water and felt that towards the end of the episode it focused more on the action sequences rather than its characterization writing that it excels at bringing different characters action heavy plot threads together into a whole that progresses both plot and character beats But when it has to drop something it drops the latter Giving the episode a B grade Manuel Betancourt of The A V Club heavily praised Kenobi s gradual improvement in his Force abilities and highlighted the beginning scene in which both Kenobi and Vader were in bacta tanks which he felt a lovely mirrored moment when Master and Padawan are connected yet again making their trajectories feel even more intertwined than they once were and compared it to Revenge of the Sith He also praised Ingram s performance in the episode writing she is slowly emerging as the MVP of the series noting Reva s characterization and her determination in completing her objectives He also praised the overall plot of the episode saying that it successfully pulls off a grade A heist rescue and Chow s direction of her action scenes br At IGN Matt Purslow described the episode as being devoid of the emotion and character development that has previously made Kenobi such a great watch episode four is the season s first misstep He felt the episode s plot was too derivative from the Death Star infiltration in A New Hope and perceived it as being a overly straight and simple rollout of events He also opined that there was not any emotional depth in the episode as there were no meaningful advancement on these emotions this week and thus no complex problems for Obi Wan to contend with and rated the episode a out of Meanwhile Vulture s Jesse Hassenger gave the episode a out of He also criticized the plot of the episode perceiving it to be too straightforward and labelling the episode overall as being a murky stew of regret occasional badassery and self seriousness He felt that Reva s general character was improved during the interrogation scene with Leia but criticized some of the dialogue in the scene and felt was derivative of other movies and shows Additionally he praised the Jedi tomb vault scene and concluded his review by stating The shared pain of Obi Wan and Reva is there somewhere hinting at something more complicated and regretful But the show only has two episodes left to dig a little deeper and turn those old Jedi reflexes into something new Germain Lussier writing for Gizmodo gave the episode a mixed review He negatively labelled the episode as being a mix of A New Hope and Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order and was disappointed as the episodes focused on Kenobi rescuing Leia which he thought was already explored in the series and was in favor of an original plot However he also praised the Jedi tomb vault scene action sequences Kenobi and Leia s chemistry and both Ingram and Varma s performance in the scene where Reva finds out that Tala was a member of the Path network br br br br br br
