the film three stars out of four writing that it rarely comes close to touching greatness but it s a solid visually dazzling and warmhearted victory for quality filmmaking The A V Club s A A Dowd gave the film a C stating that the film is so freighted with obligation that it almost groans under the weight flashing a weak smile as it vaguely approximates the appearance of a zippy good time Michael Phillips for Chicago Tribune wrote that the film does the job It wraps up the trio of trilogies begun in in a confident soothingly predictable way doing all that is cinematically possible to avoid upsetting the tradition minded quadrants of the Star Wars fan base br Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described the film as a disappointment and wrote For all the movie s faults it s likely that most people will consider The Rise of Skywalker and accept the trade Sit through a so so minutes to get to a strong half hour Owen Gleiberman of Variety called the film the most elegant emotionally rounded and gratifying Star Wars adventure since the glory days of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back but given the last eight films the bar isn t that high The BBC s Nicholas Barber praised the film s acting and wrote The Rise of Skywalker has been lovingly crafted by a host of talented people and yet the best they can do is pay tribute to everything George Lucas did several decades ago br Scott Mendelson for Forbes described the film as possibly worse compared to the previous Skywalker saga films while ending the main saga and denying this new trilogy its artistic reason for existence He also criticized the film for retconning The Last Jedi and for its conventional plot twists writing that the film is full of patronizing reversals in the name of mollifying the fans who merely want to be reminded of the first three movies Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times described the film as a Last Jedi corrective which is the more accurate way to describe it and represents an epic failure of nerve He further wrote it feels more like a retreat a return to a zone of emotional and thematic safety from a filmmaker with a gift for packaging nostalgia as subversion Writing for The New Yorker Richard Brody wrote that the film s faults are those of the franchise over all as the film s director J J Abrams is mainly a distiller and a magnifier and brings virtually no originality to it Brody said that it would have been better if a boldly imaginative vulgarian such as Michael Bay had instead created a derisive wreckage of Star Wars Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert com criticized the film giving it stars faulting it for Terrible dialogue disinterested performances and an unconvincing phony CGI aesthetic and criticizing it for its misdirection and calling it A movie

Marie Tran had around ten minutes of screen time in The Last Jedi she appears for about a minute in The Rise of Skywalker The reduced role was interpreted by some critics as a concession to fans who disliked her character Tran had been a target of racist fatphobic and misogynistic online harassment following the release of The Last Jedi Multiple cast members involved on the previous film defended her such as Boyega Critics said she was sidelined into a minor character and commented on how she was written out without any explanation and her minor role was considered by one critic to be one of the film s biggest disappointments With regard to the criticism towards the character s reduced screen time screenwriter Chris Terrio said it was due to the difficulty of including the deceased Carrie Fisher archive footage in scenes planned to feature both characters br br br Audience response br Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale the lowest
