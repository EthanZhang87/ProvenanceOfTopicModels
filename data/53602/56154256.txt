Sean Keane of New York Daily News wrote that We get POV sections from all four members of the squad but Iden is by far the most developed She s a great lead and the novel highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the idealized Imperial upbringing She is a talented soldier but struggles with emotion and attachment In his review of Star Wars Battlefront II Bryan Bishop of The Verge praised Janina Gavankar s performance opining that she delivers some real pathos with her performance Bishop added Iden may be an Imperial but she s also a hero in the classic Star Wars tradition she fights for the ideals that have been instilled in her from birth and carries with her the kind of devil may care swagger that made Han Solo a household name Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph wrote that Gavankar joined an exclusive club of women leading Star Wars stories with Iden Versio standing alongside Daisy Ridley s Rey and Felicity Jones Jyn Erso from Rogue One br In a negative review of Resurrection Hayden Dingman of PCWorld opines that the setup to the DLC is promising due to the believability of Iden s stakes in comparison with the main campaign and the built in emotional hook of Del Meeko s death compounded by Iden fighting alongside her daughter Zay Dingman however added that Battlefront II s campaign proper ending included is anemic start to finish Just so much wasted potential I don t know whether blame lies with Disney or with EA and DICE but the developers had an amazing character in Iden Versio and did nothing with her Samuel Roberts of PC Gamer had similar sentiments commenting that most of the tension is removed from the story once Iden Versio and her comrade Del basically join the Rebellion Roberts criticized the lack of exploration of Iden s Imperial perspective commenting that in the opening the player gets the sense that Iden and company believe in the sense of order that the Empire brings but their perspective isn t explored with much greater depth than that When they turn against the Empire as the Empire turns on its own people they make the snap decision to change sides with very little ambiguity br br br br br br Further reading br Video Game Heroine of the
