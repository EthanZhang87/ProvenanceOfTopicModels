The Clone Wars is a fictional conflict in the Star Wars franchise by George Lucas Though mentioned briefly in the first Star Wars film A New Hope the war itself was not depicted until Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith The Clone Wars are also the setting for three eponymous projects a D animated series a D film and a D animated series They have featured in numerous Star Wars books and games br Within the Star Wars narrative the Clone Wars involve a three year war fought to prevent thousands of planetary systems from seceding from the Galactic Republic and forming their Confederacy of Independent Systems often referred to as Separatists The Republic uses an army of clone troopers led by the Jedi Order against the Separatist battle droid army The conflict was a scheme by the Republic s Supreme Chancellor Palpatine secretly the evil Sith Lord Darth Sidious seeking to implement the Sith s long term plans to wipe out all Jedi and take over the galaxy Palpatine intended this by giving the clone troopers a secret command known as Order embedded in their brains instantly making clones perceive their Jedi officers as traitors and kill them He succeeded in issuing the command in Revenge of the Sith promptly leading to the deaths of numerous Jedi around the galaxy allowing Palpatine to gain total power and ultimately convert the democratic Galactic Republic into the autocratic Galactic Empire a reign controlled through a military industrial complex and featured in the original trilogy br Lucas used the Clone Wars narrative to answer questions about the original trilogy such as how the Empire originated and how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader The political and military events of the Clone Wars draw inspiration from such real world conflicts and historical events as transition of the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire the American Civil War the First and Second World Wars as well as contemporary events such as the War on Terror and the Bush administration during the early st century br br br Concept and development br The first reference to the Clone Wars is in Star Wars creator George Lucas third draft of the first film which mentions the grizzled cyborg General Kenobi s diary of the Clone Wars The wars were mentioned twice briefly in the final version of the film referring to Obi Wan Kenobi as a general who served Leia Organa s then unnamed father Bail Organa during the conflict In drafting The Empire Strikes Back Lucas considered introducing a clone character who had been involved with the Clone Wars Leigh Brackett s first draft of the film initially developed Lando Calrissian as a clone from a planet of clones involved in the Clone Wars mentioned in A New Hope and were nearly made extinct by the war Boba Fett was also initially considered as being from a group of shocktroopers nearly wiped out by Jedi during the Clone Wars However these concepts were not included in the final version of the film Lucas was more guarded about the details of the Clone Wars than any other element of Star Wars even making them off limits to licensed products and books br Lucas has noted that Palpatine s rise to power is similar to that of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany as Chancellor of Germany the latter was granted emergency powers as is Palpatine Lucas has also said that one of the primary influences for the political backdrop behind the Clone Wars and all of Star Wars was the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal era when leaders embraced corruption for what they thought was the best course of action In Lucas said br br All democracies turn into dictatorships but not by coup The people give their democracy to a dictator whether it s Julius Caesar or Napoleon or Adolf Hitler Ultimately the general population goes along with the idea What kinds of things push people and institutions in this direction That s the issue I ve been exploring how did the Republic turn into the Empire How does a good person go bad and how does a democracy become a dictatorship br The clone forces shown at the conclusion of Attack of the Clones comprised the largest digital army created for a film at that point Lucas proposed to concept artists that Revenge of the Sith would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets Lucas then radically re organized the plot instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin Skywalker The absence of the seven battles on seven planets in part led to Lucas s decision to launch the CGI animated Clone Wars television series

Comparisons have been made between the political aspects of the Clone Wars and the events leading up to World War II Radio host Clyde Lewis article on historical similarities in Star Wars claims that Palpatine s tactics parallel those of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany both leaders used wars and scapegoats to manipulate society s emotional state thus providing the leadership with support and power Another writer compares the Clone Wars with World War II in general basing his argument on the fact that Lucas was a baby boomer and the dark times featured in the original trilogy rival the dark uncertain Cold War Referring to Lucas s statements that the conflict in Star Wars was inspired by the cultural backdrop of the Vietnam War journalist Chris Taylor said the Clone Wars are a parallel to World War II Anne Lancashire from the University of Toronto also points out some similar nomenclature between the Clone Wars and the American Civil War br Several publications compared the political context of the Clone Wars to the Iraq War In claiming that the Star Wars galaxy under the deceitful Palpatine parallels the modern issues of the United States an editorial on Antiwar com states that Star Wars establishes first the generally agreeable premise that it s right to overthrow oppressive government before bringing into focus something more discomforting that the corrupt tyranny referred to is our own Additionally an article from Wiretap claims that like Palpatine the Bush administration has been able to feed on people s fears to gain more power Lucas stated that the Iraq war didn t exist when he developed the Clone Wars but he did see parallels between the Vietnam War that inspired Star Wars and the war in Iraq Star Wars producer Rick McCallum corroborated that the Clone Wars was developed before the Iraq War adding that Lucas is a product of Vietnam br br br Impact and critical response br The author of How Star Wars Conquered the Universe Chris Taylor calls the Clone
