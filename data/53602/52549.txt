film in the vein of Flash Gordon around the time he completed his first film THX and he began working on a treatment after the release of American Graffiti After numerous rewrites filming took place throughout and in locations including Tunisia and Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire England Lucas formed the visual effects company Industrial Light Magic to help create the film s visual effects Star Wars suffered production difficulties the cast and crew believed the film would be a failure and it went million over budget due to delays br Few were confident in the film s box office prospects It

reviews with praise for its special effects It grossed million worldwide during its initial run surpassing Jaws to become the highest grossing film until the release of E T the Extra Terrestrial

the Force but he is left with no choice after Imperial stormtroopers murder his family while searching for the droids Seeking a way off the planet Luke and Obi Wan travel to the city of Mos Eisley and hire Han Solo and Chewbacca pilots of the starship Millennium Falcon br Before the Falcon reaches Alderaan the Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin has the planet obliterated by the station s superlaser Upon arrival the Falcon is captured by the Death Star s tractor beam but the passengers avoid detection and infiltrate the station As Obi Wan leaves to deactivate the tractor beam Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help him rescue Leia who is scheduled for execution after refusing to reveal the location of the Rebel base After disabling the tractor beam Obi Wan sacrifices himself in a lightsaber duel against Vader which allows the rest of the group to escape the Death Star Using a tracking device placed on the Falcon the Empire locates the Rebel base on the moon Yavin br

earlier films were used for the voice of Garindan an Imperial spy br br br Production br br br Development br br Lucas had the idea for a space opera prior to According to Mark Hamill he wanted to make it before his coming of age film American Graffiti His original plan was to adapt the Flash Gordon space adventure comics and serials into films having been fascinated by them since he was young Lucas attempted to purchase the rights but they had already been acquired by producer Dino De Laurentiis Lucas then discovered that Flash Gordon was inspired by the John Carter of Mars book series by Edgar Rice Burroughs the author of Tarzan Burroughs in turn had been influenced by Gulliver on Mars a science fantasy written by Edwin Arnold Lucas took the science fantasy concept and began developing what he would later call a space fantasy br In May Lucas persuaded the head of United Artists David Picker to take a chance on two of his film ideas American Graffiti and the space opera Although Lucas signed a two picture deal the studio ultimately declined to produce Graffiti Universal Pictures picked it up and Lucas spent the next two years making the coming of age film which was immensely successful In January he began working on the space opera full time He began the process by inventing odd names for characters and places By the time the screenplay was finalized he had discarded many of the names but several made it into the final script and later sequels He used his early notes to compile a two page synopsis titled Journal of the Whills which chronicled the tale of CJ Thorpe an apprentice Jedi Bendu who was being trained by the legendary Mace Windy He felt that this story was too difficult to understand however br Lucas began writing a page treatment called The Star Wars on April which had narrative parallels with Kurosawa s film The Hidden Fortress He later explained that Star Wars is not a story about the future but rather a fantasy that has more in common with the Brothers Grimm than A Space Odyssey He said his motivation for making the film was to give young people an honest wholesome fantasy life of the kind his generation had He hoped it would offer the romance the adventure and the fun that used to be in practically every movie br While impressed with the innocence of the story and the sophistication of Lucas s fictional world United Artists declined to fund the project Lucas and Kurtz then presented the treatment to Universal Pictures the studio that financed American Graffiti Universal agreed it could be a successful venture but had doubts about Lucas s ability to execute his vision Kurtz has claimed the studio s rejection was primarily due to Universal head Lew Wasserman s low opinion of science fiction and the generally low popularity of the genre at the time Francis Ford Coppola subsequently brought the project to a division of Paramount Pictures he ran with fellow directors Peter Bogdanovich and William Friedkin but Friedkin questioned Lucas s ability to direct the film and both directors declined to finance it Walt Disney Productions also turned down the project br Star Wars was accepted by Twentieth Century Fox in June Studio president Alan Ladd Jr did not grasp the technical side of the project but believed in Lucas s talent Lucas later stated that Ladd invested in him not in the film The Fox deal gave Lucas to write and direct the film In August American Graffiti opened to massive success which afforded Lucas the necessary leverage to renegotiate the deal and gain control of merchandising and sequel rights br br br Writing br br Since commencing the writing process in January Lucas wrote four different screenplays for Star Wars searching for just the right ingredients characters and storyline By May he had expanded the original treatment into a full page rough draft which included elements such as the Sith the Death Star and a general named Annikin Starkiller He then changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy and shifted the general who came from a family of dwarfs into a supporting role Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler Han Solo as a large green skinned monster with gills He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog Indiana who often acted as his co pilot by sitting in the passenger seat of his car The dog s name would later be given to the character Indiana Jones br Lucas completed a second draft in January entitled Adventures of the Starkiller Episode One The Star Wars He had made substantial simplifications and introduced the young farm dwelling hero as Luke Starkiller In this draft Luke had several brothers Annikin became Luke s father a wise Jedi Knight who played a minor role at the end of the story Early versions of the characters Han Solo and Chewbacca were present and closely resemble those seen in the finished film This draft introduced a mystical energy field called The Force the concept of a Jedi turning to the dark side and a historical Jedi who was the first to turn and who subsequently trained the Sith The script also included a Jedi Master with a son who trains to be a Jedi under his father s friend this would ultimately form the basis for the finished film and later the original trilogy This version was more a fairy tale quest than the action filled adventure story of the previous draft and ended with a text crawl that previewed the next story in the series According to Lucas the second draft was over pages long which led him to split up the story into multiple films spanning multiple trilogies br While writing a third draft Lucas claims to have been influenced by comics J R R Tolkien s The Hobbit Joseph Campbell s The Hero with a Thousand Faces James George Frazer s The Golden Bough and Bruno Bettelheim s The Uses of Enchantment Author Michael Kaminski has objected to Lucas s claim regarding the Bettelheim book arguing that it was not released until after Star Wars was filmed J W Rinzler speculates that Lucas may have obtained an advance copy Kaminski also writes that Campbell s influence on Star Wars has been exaggerated by Lucas and others and that Lucas s second draft was even closer to Campbell s structure than the third br Lucas has claimed he wrote a version of the screenplay that was pages long which outlined the plot of the entire original trilogy Realizing it was too lengthy for a single film he decided to spread the story over three films This division caused problems with the first episode Lucas had to use the ending of Episode VI for Star Wars which resulted in a Death Star being included in both films In Lucas envisioned a trilogy which would end with the destruction of the Empire and possibly a prequel about Obi Wan as a young man After Star Wars became tremendously successful Lucasfilm announced that Lucas had already written twelve more Luke Skywalker stories which according to Kurtz were separate adventures rather than traditional sequels br On February Fox granted the film a budget of million which was later increased to million Lucas then started writing with a budget in mind conceiving the cheap used look of much of the film and with Fox having just shut down its special effects department reducing the number of complex special effects shots called for by the script The finalized third draft dated August was titled The Star Wars From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller This version had most of the elements of the final plot with only some differences in the characters and settings It presented Luke as an only child whose father was already dead and who was cared for by a man named Ben Kenobi This script would be rewritten for the fourth and final draft dated January and titled The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills Saga I The Star Wars Lucas s friends Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck helped him revise the fourth draft into the final pre production script br Lucas finished the screenplay in March when the crew started filming During production he changed Luke s surname from Starkiller to Skywalker and changed the title first to The Star Wars and then finally to Star Wars For the film s opening crawl Lucas originally wrote a composition of six paragraphs with four sentences each He showed the draft to his friend director Brian De Palma who called it gibberish that goes on forever De Palma and screenwriter Jay Cocks helped edit the crawl into its final form which contains only four sentences br br br Casting br br Lucas had a preference for casting unknown or relatively unknown actors which led him to select Hamill and Fisher for leading roles Hamill was cast as Luke over Robby Benson William Katt Kurt Russell and Charles Martin Smith while Fisher was cast as Leia over Karen Allen Amy Irving Terri Nunn Cindy Williams and Linda Purl Jodie Foster was offered the role but turned it down because she was under contract with Disney Koo Stark was also considered for Leia but was instead cast as Luke s friend Camie Marstrap a character that did not make the final cut of the film br Lucas initially resisted casting Ford as Han since Ford had previously worked with Lucas on American Graffiti and was therefore not unknown Instead the director asked Ford to assist with auditions by reading lines with other actors However Lucas was eventually won over by Ford and cast him as Han over many other actors who auditioned br Lucas recognized that he needed an established star to play Obi Wan He considered Cushing for the role but decided the actor s lean features would be better employed as the villainous Tarkin The film s producer Gary Kurtz felt a strong character actor was required to convey the stability and gravitas of Obi Wan Before Guinness was cast the Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune who stars in many Akira Kurosawa films was considered for the role His daughter Mika Kitagawa said her father had a lot of samurai pride and turned down the roles of Obi Wan and Vader because he thought Star Wars would employ cheap special effects and would therefore cheapen the image of samurai Lucas credited Guinness with inspiring the cast and crew to work harder which contributed significantly to the completion of filming Ford said he admired Guinness s preparation professionalism and kindness towards the other actors He recalled Guinness having a very clear head about how to serve the story On top of his salary Guinness received of the film s backend grosses which made him wealthy later in life br Daniels said he wanted the role of C PO after he saw a Ralph McQuarrie concept painting of the character and was struck by the vulnerability in the droid s face After casting Daniels for the physical performance Lucas intended to hire another actor for the droid s voice According to Daniels thirty well established actors auditioned including Richard Dreyfuss and Mel Blanc but Daniels received the voice role after one of the actors suggested the idea to Lucas br Baker R D and Mayhew Chewbacca were cast largely due to their height At feet inches m Baker was offered the role of the dimunitive droid immediately after meeting Lucas He turned it down multiple times however before finally accepting it R D s beeps and squeaks were made by sound designer Ben Burtt by imitating baby noises recording his voice over an intercom and finally mixing the sounds together using a synthesizer Mayhew initially auditioned for Vader but Prowse was cast instead However when Lucas and Kurtz saw Mayhew s foot inch m stature they quickly cast him as Chewbacca Mayhew modeled his performance on the mannerisms of animals he observed in public zoos br Prowse was originally offered the role of Chewbacca but turned it down as he wanted to play the villain Prowse portrayed Vader physically but Lucas felt his West Country English accent was inappropriate for the character and selected James Earl Jones for Vader s voice Lucas considered Orson Welles for the voice role but was concerned his voice would be too familiar to audiences Jones was uncredited until br br br Design br During pre production Lucas recruited several conceptual designers Colin Cantwell who visualized the initial spacecraft models Alex Tavoularis who created storyboard sketches from early scripts and Ralph McQuarrie who created conceptual images of characters costumes props and scenery McQuarrie s paintings helped the studio visualize the film which positively influenced their decision to fund the project His artwork also set the visual tone for Star Wars and the rest of the original trilogy br br Lucas wanted to create props and sets based on McQuarrie s paintings that had never before been used in science fiction films He hired as production designers John Barry and Roger Christian who were then working on the film Lucky Lady Christian remembers that Lucas did not want anything in Star Wars to stand out and wanted it to look all real and used In this used future aesthetic all devices ships and buildings related to Tatooine and the Rebels look aged and dirty and the Rebel ships look cobbled together in contrast to the Empire s sleeker designs Lucas believed this aesthetic would lend credibility to the film s fictional places and Christian was enthusiastic about this approach br Barry and Christian started working with Lucas before Star Wars was funded by Fox For several months in a studio in Kensal Rise England they planned the creation of props and sets with very little money According to Christian the Millennium Falcon set was the most difficult to build He wanted the interior of the ship to look like a submarine and used inexpensive airplane scrap metal to achieve the desired effect Set construction later moved to Elstree Studios where Barry created thirty sets All nine sound stages at Elstree were needed to house the fabricated planets starships caves control rooms cantinas and Death Star corridors The Rebel hangar was so massive it had to be built at nearby Shepperton Studios which contained Europe s largest sound stage at the time br br br Filming br br In Lucas founded the visual effects company Industrial Light Magic ILM after discovering that Fox s visual effects department had been shut down ILM began its work on Star Wars in a warehouse in Van Nuys California Most of the visual effects used pioneering digital motion control photography developed by John Dykstra and his team which created the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras The technology is now known as the Dykstraflex system br Visually Lucas wanted Star Wars to have the ethereal quality of a fairy tale but also an alien look He hoped to achieve the seeming contradiction of the strange graphics of fantasy combined with the feel of a documentary His first choice for cinematographer was Geoffrey Unsworth who had worked on A Space Odyssey Unsworth initially accepted the job but eventually withdrew to work on the Vincente Minnelli directed A Matter of Time Unsworth was replaced by Gilbert Taylor who had overseen photography for Dr Strangelove and A Hard Day s Night both Lucas admired Taylor s work on both films describing them as eccentrically photographed pictures with a strong documentary flavor br Once photography was under way Lucas and Taylor had many disputes Lucas s lighting suggestions were rejected by Taylor who believed Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself After Fox executives complained about the soft focus visual style of the film Taylor changed his approach which infuriated Lucas Kurtz said that Lucas s inability to delegate tasks resulted from his history directing low budget films which required him to be involved with all aspects of the production Taylor claims that Lucas avoided contact with him which motivated the cinematographer to make his own decisions about how to shoot the film br br Originally Lucas envisioned Tatooine as a jungle planet and Kurtz traveled to the Philippines to scout locations However the thought of spending months filming in the jungle made Lucas uncomfortable so he made Tatooine a desert planet instead Kurtz then researched various desert locales around the globe He ultimately decided that Southern Tunisia on the edge of the Sahara would make an ideal Tatooine Principal photography began in Chott el Djerid on March Meanwhile a construction crew in nearby Tozeur spent eight weeks creating additional Tatooine locations The scenes of Luke s Tatooine home were filmed at the Hotel Sidi Driss in Matmata Additional Tatooine scenes were shot at Death Valley in the United States br The filmmakers experienced many problems in Tunisia Production fell behind schedule in the first week due to malfunctioning props and electronic breakdowns The radio controlled R D models functioned poorly The left leg of Anthony Daniels s C PO costume shattered injuring his foot A rare winter rainstorm struck the country which further disrupted filming After two and a half weeks in Tunisia production moved to Elstree Studios in London for interior scenes br Kurtz has described Lucas as a shy loner who does not enjoy working with a large cast and crew According to Carrie Fisher he gave very little direction to the actors and when he did it usually consisted of the words faster and more intense Laws in Britain stipulated that filming had to finish by pm unless Lucas was in the middle of a shot in which case he could ask the crew to stay an extra minutes However his requests were usually turned down Most of the British crew considered Star Wars a children s film and the actors sometimes did not take the project seriously Kenny Baker later confessed that he thought the film would be a failure br br According to Taylor it was impossible to light the Elstree sets in the conventional way He was forced to break open the walls ceilings and floors placing quartz lamps inside the openings he created This lighting system gave Lucas the ability to shoot in almost any direction without extensive relighting In total filming in Britain took fourteen and a half weeks While visiting an English travel agency Lucas saw a poster depicting Tikal Guatemala and decided to use the location for the moon Yavin The scenes of the Rebel base on Yavin were filmed in the local Mayan temples The animation of the Death Star plans shown at the base were created by computer programmer Larry Cuba using the GRASS programming language It is the only digital computer animation utilized in the original version of Star Wars The visual simulation of Yavin orbiting its mother planet was created on the Scanimate analog computer All the other computer monitors and targeting displays in the film featured simulated computer graphics which were generated using pre digital animation methods such as hand drawn backlight animation br Although Obi Wan did not die in the final version of the script Alec Guinness disliked the character s dialogue and said he begged Lucas to kill him off Lucas however claimed he added Obi Wan s death because the character served no purpose after his duel with Vader br At Fox Alan Ladd endured scrutiny from board members over the film s complex screenplay and rising budget After the filmmakers requested more than the original million budget Kurtz said the executives got a bit scared According to Kurtz the filmmaking team spent two weeks drafting a new budget With the project behind schedule Ladd told Lucas he had to finish production within a week or it would be shut down The crew split into three units led by Lucas Kurtz and production supervisor Robert Watts Under the new system they met the studio s deadline br The screenplay originally featured a human Jabba the Hutt but the character was removed due to budget and time constraints The idea of Jabba being an alien did not arise until work began on the Star Wars re release Lucas would later claim he had wanted to superimpose a stop motion creature over a human actor he accomplished a similar effect with computer generated imagery CGI in the Special Edition According to Greedo actor Paul Blake his character was created as a result of Lucas having to cut the Jabba scene br During production the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile as he often appeared depressed At one point the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level Post production was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from the studio Another obstacle arose when Hamill s face became visibly scarred after a car accident which restricted re shoots featuring Luke br br br Post production br Star Wars was originally slated for release on December but production delays pushed it back to mid Editor John Jympson began cutting the film while Lucas was still filming in Tunisia as Lucas noted the editor was in an impossible position because Lucas had not explained any of the film s material to him When Lucas viewed Jympson s rough cut he felt the editor s selection of takes was questionable He felt Jympson did not fully understand the film nor Lucas s style of filmmaking and he continued to disapprove of Jympson s editing as time went by Halfway through production Lucas fired Jympson and replaced him with Paul Hirsch Richard Chew and his then wife Marcia Lucas The new editing team felt Jympson s cut lacked excitement and they sought to inject more dynamism into the film br Jympson s rough cut of Star Wars often called the Lost Cut differed significantly from the final version Author David West Reynolds describes Jympson s version as more leisurely paced and estimates that it contained different footage from the final cut Although most of the differences relate to extended scenes or alternate takes there were also scenes which were completely removed to accelerate the pace of the narrative The most notable of these were a series from Tatooine when Luke is first introduced Set in the city of Anchorhead the scenes depicted Luke s everyday life among his friends and showed how their lives are affected by the space battle above the planet These scenes also introduced Biggs Darklighter Luke s closest friend who leaves to join the Rebellion Hirsch said the scenes were removed because they presented too much information in the first few minutes of the film and they created too many storylines for the audience to follow The removal of the Anchorhead scenes also helped distinguish Star Wars from Lucas s previous film Alan Ladd called the deleted scenes American Graffiti in outer space Lucas also wanted to shift the narrative focus to C PO and R D at the beginning of the film He explained that having the first half hour of the film be mainly about robots was a bold idea br Meanwhile ILM was struggling to achieve unprecedented special effects The company had spent half its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable With hundreds of shots remaining ILM was forced to finish a year s work in six months To inspire the visual effects team Lucas spliced together clips of aerial dogfights from old war films These kinetic segments helped the team understand his vision for scenes in Star Wars br Sound designer Ben Burtt had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an organic soundtrack Blaster sounds were created by modifying the noise of a steel cable being struck while under tension Lightsaber sound effects were a combination of the hum of movie projector motors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless microphone Burtt discovered the latter accidentally while searching for a buzzing sparking sound to add to the projector motor hum For Chewbacca s speech Burtt combined the sounds of four bears a badger a lion a seal and a walrus Burtt achieved Vader s breathing noise by breathing through the mask of a scuba regulator this process inspired the idea of Vader being a burn victim br In February Lucas screened an early cut of the film for Fox executives several director friends and Roy Thomas and Howard Chaykin of Marvel Comics who were preparing a Star Wars comic book The cut had a different crawl from the finished version and used Prowse s voice for Vader It also lacked most special effects hand drawn arrows took the place of blaster beams and footage of World War II dogfights replaced space battles between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon Several of Lucas s friends failed to understand the film and their reactions disappointed Lucas Steven Spielberg enjoyed it however and believed the lack of enthusiasm from others was due to the absence of finished special effects In contrast Ladd and the other studio executives loved the film production executive Gareth Wigan described the experience as the most extraordinary day of his life Lucas who was accustomed to negative reactions from executives found the experience shocking and rewarding br With the film million over budget Lucas was forced to make artistic compromises to complete it Ladd reluctantly agreed to release an extra in funding and in early the second unit finished filming at a number of locations including Death Valley and China Lake Acres in California for Tatooine and Guatemala for Yavin The unit also completed additional studio footage for the Mos Eisley cantina sequence br Star Wars was completed less than a week before its May release date With all of the film s elements coming together just in time Lucas described the work as not so much finished but abandoned Star Wars began production with a budget of million the total budget eventually reached million br br br Soundtrack br br Lucas initially planned to use pre existing music for Star Wars rather than an original score Since the film portrayed alien worlds he believed recognizable music was needed to create a sense of familiarity He hired John Williams as a music consultant and showed him a collection of orchestral pieces he intended to use for the soundtrack After Williams convinced Lucas that an original score would be preferable Lucas tasked him with creating it A few of the composer s finished pieces were influenced by Lucas s initial orchestral selections The Main Title Theme was inspired by the theme from the film Kings Row scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and the Dune Sea of Tatooine was influenced by the music of Bicycle Thieves scored by Alessandro Cicognini Lucas later denied he ever considered using pre existing music for the film br Over a period of days in March Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra recorded the Star Wars score The soundtrack was released as a double LP in by th Century Fox Records That year the label also released The Story of Star Wars an audio drama adaptation of the film utilizing some of its music dialogue and sound effects br In the American Film Institute chose the Star Wars soundtrack as the best film score of all time br br br Cinematic and literary allusions br Before creating Star Wars Lucas had hoped to make a Flash Gordon film but was unable to obtain the rights Star Wars features many elements ostensibly derived from Flash Gordon such as the conflict between rebels and imperial forces the fusion of mythology and futuristic technology the wipe transitions between scenes and the text crawl at the beginning of the film Lucas also reportedly drew from Joseph Campbell s book The Hero with a Thousand Faces and Akira Kurosawa s film The Hidden Fortress Tim Robey of The Telegraph has compared C PO and R D to the two bickering peasants in Fortress while a Japanese family crest in Kurosawa s film has been compared to the Imperial Crest in Star Wars Robey has also suggested that the Mos Eisley cantina brawl was influenced by Kurosawa s Yojimbo and that the scene in which Luke and his friends hide in the floor of the Millenium Falcon was derived from that film s sequel Sanjuro br Star Wars has been compared to Frank Herbert s Dune book series in multiple ways Both have desert planets Star Wars has Tatooine while Dune has Arrakis which is the source of a longevity spice Star Wars meanwhile makes references to spice mines and a spice freighter Jedi mind tricks in Star Wars have been compared to The Voice a controlling ability used by the Bene Gesserit in Herbert s novels Luke s Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru are moisture farmers on Arrakis dew collectors are used by Fremen to collect and recycle small amounts of water Herbert reported that David Lynch director of the film Dune had trouble with the fact that Star Wars used up so much of Dune Herbert and Lynch found sixteen points of identity between the two universes and argued that these similarities could not be a coincidence br Writing for Starwars com in Bryan Young noted many similarities between Lucas s space opera and the World War II film The Dam Busters In Star Wars Rebel ships assault the Death Star by diving into a trench and attempting to fire torpedoes into a small exhaust port in Dam Busters British bombers fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim bouncing bombs at dams to cripple the heavy industry of Germany also Star Wars cinematographer Gilbert Taylor filmed the special effects sequences in Dam Busters The Death Star assault sequence has also been compared to the climax of the film Squadron in which British aircraft attack a German heavy water plant by flying down a narrow fjord and dropping bombs at a precise point Lucas used clips from both Dam Busters and Squadron to illustrate his vision for dogfights in Star Wars br The opening shot of Star Wars in which a spaceship fills the upper part of the frame has been compared to the scene introducing the spacecraft Discovery One in Stanley Kubrick s film A Space Odyssey Other similarities between Kubrick s film and Star Wars include the use of EVA pods and hexagonal corridors Journalist and blogger Martin Belam has pointed out similarities between the Death Star s docking bay and the docking bay on the space station in In Young observed a number of parallels between Lucas s space opera and Fritz Lang s film Metropolis Star Wars has also been compared to The Wizard of Oz br br br Marketing br br While the film was in production a logo was commissioned from Dan Perri a title sequence designer who had worked on The Exorcist and Taxi Driver Perri created a logotype consisting of block capital letters filled with stars and leaning towards a vanishing point The graphic was designed to follow the same perspective as the opening text crawl Ultimately Perri s logo was not used for the film s opening title sequence although it was used widely in pre release print advertising and on cinema marquees br The logotype eventually selected for on screen use originated in a promotional brochure that was distributed by Fox to cinema owners in The brochure was designed by Suzy Rice a young art director at the Los Angeles advertising agency Seiniger Advertising On a visit to ILM in Van Nuys Rice was instructed by Lucas to produce a very fascist logo that would intimidate the viewer Rice employed an outlined and modified Helvetica Black typeface in her initial version After some feedback from Lucas Rice joined the S and T of STAR and the R and S of WARS Kurtz was impressed with Rice s composition and selected it over Perri s design for the film s opening titles after flattening the pointed tips of the letter W The Star Wars logo became one of the most recognizable designs in cinema though Rice was not credited in the film br For the film s US release Fox commissioned a promotional poster from the advertising agency Smolen Smith and Connolly The agency contracted the freelance artist Tom Jung and gave him the phrase good over evil as a starting point His poster known as Style A depicts Luke standing in a heroic pose brandishing a shining lightsaber above his head Leia is slightly below him and a large image of Vader s helmet looms behind them Some Fox executives considered this poster too dark and commissioned the Brothers Hildebrandt a pair of well known fantasy artists to modify it for the UK release When Star Wars opened in British theaters the Hildebrandts Style B poster was used on cinema billboards Fox and Lucasfilm later decided to promote the film with a less stylized and more realistic depiction of the lead characters and commissioned a new design from Tom Chantrell Two months after Star Wars opened the Hildebrandts poster was replaced by Chantrell s Style C version in UK cinemas br Fox gave Star Wars little marketing support beyond licensed T shirts and posters The film s marketing director Charley Lippincott had to look elsewhere for promotional opportunities He secured deals with Marvel Comics for a comic book adaptation and with Del Rey Books for a novelization A fan of science fiction Lippincott used his contacts to promote the film at San Diego Comic Con and elsewhere within the science fiction community br br br Release br br br MPAA rating br When Star Wars was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America s rating board the votes for the rating were evenly split between G and PG In an unusual move Fox requested the stricter PG rating in part because it believed the film was too scary for young children but also because it feared teenagers would perceive the G rating as uncool Lucasfilm marketer Charley Lippincott supported Fox s position after witnessing a five year old at the film s preview become upset by a scene in which Darth Vader chokes a Rebel captain Although the board initially opted for the G rating it reneged after Fox s request and applied the PG rating br br br First public screening br On May the first public screening of Star Wars was held at Northpoint Theatre in San Francisco
