id: 73637
Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise introduced as the main antagonist of the original Star Wars film although he has less screen time than his iconic equal Darth Vader in which he was played by Peter Cushing In the film Tarkin is depicted as a high ranking officer of the Galactic Empire placed in charge of the operations on the Death Star the Empire s moon sized battle station He orders the destruction of the planet Alderaan by the station s superlaser and dies at the end of the film when the Death Star is destroyed by Luke Skywalker br Apart from the original film Tarkin has made appearances in various canon and non canon Star Wars media including the animated series The Clone Wars Rebels and The Bad Batch and the films Revenge of the Sith and Rogue One He is also the protagonist of the novel Tarkin which details the character s backstory and rise to power within the Empire s ranks In the novel Tarkin advocates for the Tarkin Doctrine a military system based on the threat of force rather than force itself His philosophy becomes central to Imperial policy and earns him the position of the first Grand Moff in the Empire In the Galactic Empire a Moff is the governor of a Sector or subdivision of the Empire a Grand Moff is the governor of an Oversector a grouping of several Sectors br Tarkin s character has been well received and he has been called one of the most formidable villains in Star Wars history br br br Concept and creation br Governor Tarkin s character was originally conceived as a holy man from the planet Aquila but was changed later in the creative process into an antagonist As the Emperor would not appear until later in the original trilogy Lucas used Tarkin s final version as the main villain of the first film a personification of the Empire According to a book created to help promote the original film to prospective theaters he aspires to become the Emperor br br br Portrayals br During the production of Star Wars Peter Cushing found Tarkin s boots furnished by the wardrobe department to be very uncomfortable Director George Lucas agreed to limit shots where Cushing s feet would be visible allowing him to wear slippers Cushing admitted many years later to not knowing what a Grand Moff actually was joking that it sounded like something which infests a clothes closet and characterizing Tarkin as a deeply cross and unpleasant gentleman br In the prequel film Revenge of the Sith Wayne Pygram was able to achieve the likeness of a young version of Tarkin through the use of prosthetic makeup For his performance as Tarkin in the animated series The Clone Wars voice actor Stephen Stanton researched Cushing s performances and then tried to imitate what Cushing might have sounded like in his mid thirties and soften his voice to portray a level of humanity br In the anthology film Rogue One archive footage and a digital scan of Peter Cushing s life mask made for the film Top Secret were used to create a D CGI mask which was augmented and mapped to actor Guy Henry s face Henry had studied Cushing s mannerisms many years previously for the lead role in British TV show Young Sherlock but insisted on a screen test as he was not comfortable that his vocal imitation was accurate stating he sounded more Peter O Toole than Peter Cushing The ILM team searched through hours of footage to find suitable material of Cushing to build from The footage from A New Hope was lit very differently to the lighting used in Rogue One and had to be digitally changed The more they manipulated the lighting to match the other actors in the scenes the less like Cushing the character model looked which meant creating a balancing act between a digital figure and one who looked precisely like Cushing The owners of Cushing s estate were heavily involved with the creation and had input right down to small subtle adjustments The result which has been called one of the most complex and costly CGI re creations ever received a mixed response with questions being raised about the morality of using a dead actor s likeness br br br Appearances br br br Film br br br Star Wars br Introduced in
