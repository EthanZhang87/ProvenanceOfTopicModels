Captain Rex designation number CT is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas He was introduced as a main character in the animated The Clone Wars film and the related television series of the same name Rex is a clone trooper of the Grand Army of the Republic cloned from the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett and serves the Galactic Republic under the command of Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano Since his introduction in The Clone Wars he has also appeared in the Star Wars Rebels television series the Star Wars The Bad Batch television series the Tales of the Jedi television series and various spin off media Like all clone troopers in The Clone Wars Rebels The Bad Batch and Tales of the Jedi Rex is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker In Ahsoka Rex made his live action debut in the episode Part Five Shadow Warrior voiced by Temuera Morrison in sequences set during the Clone Wars br He is physically distinguished from other clone troopers by his close shaved blond hair and he is identified by blue markings on his armor and by stylized hawk eyes painted on his helmet Rex was also distinguished by his use of twin blaster pistols in combat He is described as a reliable and exemplary soldier considered by Anakin to be his first in command Rex is characterized as believing it is his duty to not only carry out orders but also to protect the men under his command however his belief in the Republic wavers over the course of the series br Initial development for The Clone Wars film chose Alpha featured in Star Wars Republic to be the primary clone trooper character However Lucas felt this created too much alliteration with the existing principal cast and a new character was created instead Rex was developed as the central personality to which the troopers around him aspired and featured in story arcs exploring his character development Rex became a fan favorite consistently placing in fan polls and Star Wars character ranking lists br br br Creation and development br br Initial development for The Clone Wars film chose Alpha featured in the Star Wars Republic comic to be the principal clone trooper character However because Anakin Skywalker Ahsoka Tano and R D Artoo were also principal characters Star Wars creator George Lucas felt Alpha s name created too much alliteration between the main cast and a new character Captain Rex was created instead The name Rex was chosen by Lucas Previously the name Captain Rex was used for the error prone rookie droid pilot RX of Star Tours who replaced an earlier concept of an unpredictable and risk taking Clone Wars veteran br Voice actor Dee Bradley Baker voices all the clone trooper characters in The Clone Wars including Rex To differentiate the characters Baker considered the personality traits of every clone choosing one or two adjectives for each and recorded each character separately To aid with the vocal performance Baker and supervising director Dave Filoni developed a clone triangle that arranged the characters by personality Rex characterized as the central personality type to which the other clones aspired was placed in the center and the other clones who represented an excess of certain traits relative to Rex were placed around the edges of the triangle br Filoni wished most for the series to address the fates of Rex and Ahsoka because they do not appear in Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith which was released before The Clone Wars but is set after the series timeline In April he hinted that the two characters stories were possibly connected and remarked A lot of people say they want to know more about Ahsoka and along with that goes Rex He also voiced the production team s conscious effort to write story arcs for Rex I think one of the other things is we have such a great development of Rex that we really want to keep telling Rex s story and things centered around Rex br br br Characterization and appearance br The official Star Wars Databank describes Rex as a no nonsense by the book and exemplary clone trooper brave under fire and dedicated to the men serving under him who must adjust to his maverick and headstrong Jedi commanding officers His training is described as having instilled a belief that a soldier s highest calling is duty though his belief wavers over the course of the Clone Wars and he comes to question the purpose of the conflict The entry characterized Rex as coming to admire and even imitate Anakin Skywalker s improvisation and willingness to bend rules In Darkness on Umbara Anakin describes Rex as his first in command and second to none in loyalty or capability br br Rex is distinguished by close shaved blond hair where most other clones have dark hair and stylized hawk eyes adorning his helmets like all members of the st his armor bears blue markings Later in the series Rex s armor bears tally marks representing kills and Filoni felt it communicated that Rex is becoming something of a little legend because he is a long term survivor of the Clone Wars He also bears a scar on his chin in homage to actor Harrison Ford who played Han Solo in the original trilogy br Rex s later helmet design first appearing in season four was composed of elements from both the older Episode II style and the newer Episode III style designs The T shaped visor of his new helmet used the old visor design as a base and retained the old proportions requiring some elements to be lowered to fit Filoni developed an in universe backstory for the design and felt that Rex trying to wear the same armor by welding together a hybrid version was a good character trait that added to his uniqueness Filoni also characterized this specialized helmet and hodgepodge of old gear and new gear as indicative of Rex s distrust in the quality of the new armor and Rex s belief that with classic stuff the craftsmanship is a little better Rex continues to wear his helmet and parts of his clone trooper armor in his Rebels appearances br br br Appearances br br br Star Wars The Clone Wars br Introduced in The Clone Wars animated film and featured throughout the television

March Filoni supported the former fan theory of Rex being the older member of Han Solo s raiding party previously known in Legends continuity as Nik Sant on Endor in Return of the Jedi In August writer Steven Melching shared concept art for the fourth season of Star Wars Rebels and it was reported as a confirmation of this theory Melching later clarified that at that time he was not aware if Rex and Sant are the same character stating that due to the progression of the series Rex s costume would naturally come to resemble those worn by Rebel Alliance commandos in Return of the Jedi Rebels ultimately did not state whether Rex and Nik Sant are the same character which Filoni later said was a purposeful decision to allow either possibility although the animated web series Star Wars Forces of Destiny would ultimately display Rex in place of Sant in that series animation style br br br Merchandise br Rex was the featured character for the Star Wars merchandise trade dress created by Pilot Studio The concept initially featured Anakin Skywalker but discussions of other characters best suited to representing the brand led to Rex a strong courageous character who is clearly one of the heroes of The Clone Wars Pilot Studio was initially reluctant to use Rex because his helmet did not allow for eye contact an emphasized element in the initial trade dress concept In Hot Toys produced a sixth scale action figure of Rex featuring a head sculpt which is modeled after Temuera Morrison and a second helmet br br br Reception br Captain Rex became a favorite among fans Filoni noted that while older fans were excited to see Grand Moff Tarkin and Chewbacca appear in the series younger fans appeared to prefer characters like Rex Baker was surprised Rex became well liked because the clone troopers were not established as distinct characters in the films br Rex was ranked in IGN s Top Star Wars characters where he was described as having a silly name but bad ass His ability to evolve and adapt as a character and as a soldier was noted especially his change from scorn to sympathy toward a clone trooper deserter Eric Goldman felt that the Rebels reunion between Rex and Ahsoka was a poignant moment and the emotional highlight of Relics of the Old Republic He also noted that Rex s reintroduction and Ahsoka s complete trust in him raised more questions about Rex in
