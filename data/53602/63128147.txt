excellent marksman the character Ran Malk refers to him one of the best triggermen I ve ever seen He has a hard edged sense of humor which several reviewers compared to the real life comedic style of

bully but with a murderous streak He also speaks with Burr s same real life Boston accent Mayfeld is arrogant hot headed ruthless unpredictable and has a sardonic attitude Space com writer Scott Snowden described him as a cowboy like character Mayfeld is also duplicitous and untrustworthy as he shows by his willingness to betray the Mandalorian after their mission together Comic Book

everyone smiling Sarah Moran of Screen Rant said the fact that Burr is not a Star Wars fan in real life only makes his role on The Mandalorian all the funnier Fatherly writer Ryan Britt said Mayfeld

himself br Not all reviews were positive IGN writer Joe Skrebels called Mayfeld a pretty flat villainous leader Tom Foster of TV Overmind called Burr a skilled actor but felt Mayfeld was an underdeveloped character and that the dialogue in the screenplay was too quick and vague IndieWire writer Tyler Hersko said Burr is funny and talented but that the episode s writing unfortunately gives him little to work with and that Mayfeld does little more than insult the Mandalorian for his entire running time Megan Crouse Den of Geek wrote that Mayfeld and the other characters in his crew didn t work for me because I didn t believe in them as mercenaries They re so hapless Several reviewers wrote that the entire mercenary crew including Mayfeld was generally incompetent and unintelligent throughout the episode Comic Book Resources writer Renaldo Matadeen called them the dumbest criminals in the Star Wars universe with a low IQ and no sense of tactics or strategy leaving us wondering how they got this far in the first place Nick Mangione of Geek com wrote The first hint that this won t be just a standard heist storyline is that all these people suck They are all the worst As soon as the crew is introduced you never want to see any of them again br Mayfeld was ranked eighth on a Screen Rant list of the most interesting characters from the first season of The
