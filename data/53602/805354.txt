br br Production br br br Creation and crew br The film shot in the middle of in Marin County California was directed by Ken and Jim Wheat executive produced by Lucas and written by the Wheat brothers based on a story written by Lucas Co director Ken Wheat explained the production and inspiration of the film br br Lucas guided the creation of the story over the course of two four hour sessions we had with him He d just watched Heidi with his daughter the weekend before these took place and the story idea he pushed was having the little girl from the first Ewok TV movie become an orphan who ends up living with a grumpy old hermit in the woods br We d been thinking about the adventure films we d liked as kids like Swiss Family Robinson and The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad so we suggested having space marauders which was fine with George as long as they were feet tall of course The rest of the brainstorming was done along those lines Joe Johnston the production designer and second unit director and Phil Tippett the creature supervisor were involved in the second day s story session and they contributed an assortment of bits and pieces br Lucas involvement during production was primarily in the design and editing stages according to Wheat The film s working title was Ewoks II br br br Effects br Both Ewok films were some of the last intensive stop motion animation work Industrial Light Magic produced as in the early s the technique was being replaced by go motion animation a more advanced form with motorized articulated puppets that moved while the camera shutter was open capturing motion blur in the otherwise static puppet eliminating the harsh staccato movement often associated with stop motion However the budgets of the Ewok films were such that go motion was simply too expensive for the projects so stop motion was used to realize creatures such as the condor dragon the blurrgs and the boar wolves br The Ewok movies proved an opportunity for Industrial Light Magic to hone a new technique in photographing matte paintings called latent image matte painting In this technique during live action photography a section of the camera s lens is blocked off remaining unexposed and a painting is crafted to occupy that space The film would then be rewound the blocked areas reversed and the painting photographed Since the painting now existed on the original film there would be no generational quality loss br br br Music br br The musical score for Ewoks The Battle for Endor was composed by Peter Bernstein Selections from the score were released on LP by Var se Sarabande in The release was known simply as Ewoks and also contained cues from Bernstein s previous score to The Ewok Adventure br br br Alternate versions br In a home video release the following two scenes were deleted when being chased by Terak s men Wicket races for Noa s house but Noa tells him the only chance they have got is the star cruiser Then a scene that happened shortly after where the men went inside and burned down Noa s house br When Cindel has a nightmare about bad men coming into Noa s house a scene was cut from the television broadcast in which Cindel rushes to Noa s bed to wake him up but instead finds Terak in the bed and wakes up The television version just shows Cindel waking up after the men break in br Cindel s lines Do something Wicket Use your sling You hit the ring have been altered to Do something Wicket Do something for the DVD release br In the original TV broadcast of the film the end credits were rolled over the final scene but in all home video releases of the film the end credits are rolled over a traditional black background after the final scene br br br Adaptations br In Random House published a children s book

juried awarded Emmys for Outstanding Special Visual Effects The film additionally received two nominations for Outstanding Children s Program and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Miniseries or a Special br In his review for The New York Times John Corry faulted the production s source of inspiration saying The problem with Ewoks The Battle for Endor isn t that it s badly done on the contrary it s wonderfully well done But when it s over it s over and there is no residue Mr Lucas and his colleagues find their inspiration in their own technology and there should be other places to look br Pointing to the main characters and plot elements one pair of writers concluded that both Battle of Endor and its predecessor Caravan of Courage are fairy tales despite occurring in a science fiction setting They point to magical phenomena in both films which is a fantasy element They argue that in a science fiction story the hero wants to disrupt or challenge the hierarchy of a supposed utopian society whereas in both Ewok films society is not challenged or disputed Additionally they argue that while the Star Wars saga also has fairy tale tropes it adhered more towards science fiction Another author agreed that the films are fairy tales whereas Science explains all magic br In contrast to his negative review of its predecessor Aidan Mason of Pop Culture Beast stated the film manages to improve on the original and felt much more like a Star Wars film although he was still critical of the acting br br br Legacy br br Several elements from the film have gone on to appear in
