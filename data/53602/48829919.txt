introduced as the Supreme Leader of the First Order a military junta formed from the fallen Galactic Empire In the films Snoke is a computer generated character voiced and performed by Andy Serkis using motion capture br The Star Wars universe establishes Snoke as a Force sensitive artificial being created by Emperor Palpatine to lead the First Order against the New Republic As Palpatine s puppet ruler Snoke manipulates Luke Skywalker s nephew Ben Solo into becoming Kylo Ren br The character appears as a major antagonist in The Force Awakens and the secondary antagonist in The Last Jedi and is referenced in The Rise of Skywalker Aside from the films Snoke appears in related Star Wars media br br br Character br br br Development br Snoke s appearance changed throughout principal photography and post production of The Force Awakens Andy Serkis said It s the first time I ve been on set not yet knowing what the character s gonna look like I mean talk about secrecy According to the actor the character s appearance voice and movements evolved as he and the film s writer director J J Abrams challenged the visual effects team br According to The Force Awakens senior sculptor Ivan Manzella Snoke almost became a female at one point J J picked out a maquette he liked and then we took it to a full size version sculpted in plasteline J J and creature creative supervisor Neal Scanlan didn t want him to be old and decrepit like Emperor Palpatine Manzella later revealed that influenced by a reference by Abrams to Hammer House of Horror he partially based a maquette of Snoke on Peter Cushing who portrayed Grand Moff Tarkin in the original Star Wars film br br br Portrayal br br While Serkis secretly joined the project in February his casting in The Force Awakens was first announced on April When asked about his role in July he joked I m not Yoda In May a StarWars com interview with photographer Annie Leibovitz about her The Force Awakens shoot for Vanity Fair revealed that Serkis would be playing a CGI character named Supreme Leader Snoke and featured an image of the actor in motion capture gear Serkis had previously played several CGI characters using motion capture technology including the titular gorilla in s King Kong and Caesar in the Planet of the Apes reboot series br In November Serkis said of the process of creating Snoke br br When we first started working on it Abrams had some rough notions of how Snoke was gonna look but it really hadn t been fully formed and it almost came out of discussion and performance We shot on set of course and I was in the scenes I have with other actors but the beauty of this process is you can go back and reiterate keep informing and honing beats and moments So J J after we shot last year we ve had a series of sessions where I d be in London at The Imaginarium my studio while he s been directing from L A and we ve literally been creating further additions and iterations to the character That s been fascinating And in the meantime I ve been able to see the look and design of the character grow and change as the performances change So it s been really exciting in that respect br According to Serkis costar Lupita Nyong o who played the CGI character Maz Kanata in The Force Awakens the actor coached her on performance capture work telling Nyong o that a motion capture character you develop the same way as any other You have to understand who the character is and what makes them who they are Serkis said of filming br br It was quite an unusual situation I worked specifically with Domhnall Gleeson and with Adam Driver My first day was basically standing on a foot podium doing Lord Snoke without the faintest idea what he looked like or in fact who he was I was very high up totally on my own away from everybody else but acting with them we used sort of a Kongolizer method of having sound come out of speakers to give a sense of scale and distance for the character So it was very challenging and scary in fact probably one of my most scary film experiences I ve ever had br Costume designer Michael Kaplan had the idea to give Snoke gold robes to contrast from his red and black throne room in The Last Jedi Director Rian Johnson said the red motif was intended to evoke curtains in a nod to The Wizard of Oz in which the titular character hides behind a curtain The throne room was designed to look theatrical as opposed to Palpatine s which was more utilitarian The conceptual designers of the set were inspired by unused concept art for Return of the Jedi depicting the Emperor s lava based lair under the surface of Coruscant According to The Last Jedi The Visual Dictionary the gold ring Snoke wears is set with obsidian from Darth Vader s castle on Mustafar The glyphs it is set with are a reference to four philosophers Palpatine had statues of in his office first seen in Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones Additionally Palpatine s theme can be heard during the scene in which Snoke tortures Rey br br br Description br In the context of the story Snoke is a genetic strandcast created by Emperor Palpatine to serve as his proxy in power Snoke whom Abrams called a powerful figure on the dark side of the Force was introduced as the leader of the First Order and master to the sequel trilogy s main villain Kylo Ren Serkis described Snoke as quite an enigmatic character and strangely vulnerable at the same time as being quite powerful Obviously he has a huge agenda He has suffered a lot of damage Serkis called Snoke a new character in this universe adding I think it d be fair to say that he is aware of the past to a great degree br Explaining why CGI was the only way to create Snoke s unique appearance Serkis said before the film s premiere The scale of him for instance is one reason He is large He appears tall And also just the facial design you couldn t have gotten there with prosthetics he has a very distinctive idiosyncratic bone and facial structure Chief of creature and droid effects Neal Scanlan said This character is much better executed as a CGI character That s just a practical reality when he s foot something tall he s very very thin Snoke s scarred cavernous face was not revealed before the release of the film in which he appears as a massive ominous hologram The character s deep voice was first heard in the teaser trailer released on November br Robbie Collin of The Telegraph described the disfigured and skeletal Snoke as a sepulchral horror Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times called him hissing and grotesque and Andrew O Hehir of Salon dubbed the character a spectral demonic figure Variety s Justin Chang wrote that Snoke resembled a plus sized more articulate version of his character Gollum and Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly described him as essentially Emperor Palpatine crossed with one of the aliens from Close Encounters Stephanie Zacharek of Time called the character a giant scary noseless dude who sits placidly in an oversized chair like a dark lord version of the Lincoln Monument br There were multiple fan theories regarding the origins and identity of Snoke prior to the film The Rise of Skywalker Such theories included that he was Darth Plagueis a Sith Lord anecdotally mentioned in Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith and the mentor of Palpatine allegedly possessing the power to prevent death Palpatine himself the Operator Gallius Rax a mysterious First Order manipulator from Chuck Wendig s Aftermath novel trilogy or Ezra Bridger a main character from

you the galaxy would have been mine a long time ago br According to The Rise of Skywalker The Visual Dictionary Snoke s physical appearance was purposefully designed by Palpatine to ensure his species remained unidentifiable Furthermore Snoke s reluctance to meet in person with his First Order underlings helped conceal the fact that he was an artificial being General Pryde Richard E Grant a supporting villain in The Rise of Skywalker was one of the few characters who knew Snoke was subservient to a higher power The Star Wars Book released in and co authored by Lucasfilm creative Pablo Hidalgo suggested Snoke may have been unaware of his origins In The Rise of Kylo Ren comic book series Kylo believes that Luke is responsible for Snoke s injuries br br br Reception br Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote Supreme Leader Snoke is a larger than life vaguely Harry Potter ish hologram voiced with deep gravity by Andy Serkis the full weight of this character s malignancy and dramatic power will presumably be better assessed in subsequent episodes Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times called Serkis the undisputed champion of the performance capture roles Though praising the unobtrusive sophistication of the visual effects used to portray the character Variety s Justin Chang said that Serkis is fine but not galvanizing in the role Lindsay Bahr of the Associated Press deemed Snoke one of the less memorable characters in The Force Awakens In Serkis was nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Virtual Performance for the role br Some viewers felt that Snoke s character arc was underdeveloped Various fan theories about his origins were held so strongly among some viewers that it was difficult for them to accept his demise in The Last Jedi Rian Johnson s decision to kill the character without developing him further was criticized by many Serkis addressed the criticisms by saying producers wanted the character to have a great deal of mystery but that he has been asked to not shed anything should they want to bring him back in any way whether prequel or whatever Forbes criticized The Force Awakens for not developing Snoke as a character or exploring his backstory and inexplicable rise to power after the events of the original trilogy calling the character a bandage poorly placed over a gaping plot hole Serkis acknowledged that some fans found the lack of backstory incredibly frustrating but suggested this as an opportunity to layer Snoke in a future story Despite the criticisms towards the writing Forbes praised Serkis performance in both films and was much more positive towards his appearance in The Last Jedi highlighting his death and his relationship with his apprentice Kylo Ren br br br Relationships br br br Family tree br br
