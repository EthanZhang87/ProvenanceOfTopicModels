Palpatine himself Five years later in a Reddit user posted a fan theory that Jar Jar was originally going to be revealed as a manipulative villain but this plot point was removed due to the character

admiration br br br Conception br George Lucas was inspired to develop Jar Jar based on the Disney character Goofy Singer Michael Jackson wanted to play the role but wished to portray the character using prosthetics while Lucas wanted him to be all CGI Ahmed Best was cast based on his work in the production of Stomp as Lucas wanted someone athletic for the role During his audition he performed several martial arts moves and flips which according to Best was a contrast to how Lucas pictured the character more in line with comedic silent actors such as Buster Keaton After Lucas walked out of the audition Best felt he had failed it Terryl Whitlatch created the final designs for the cowardly and insecure character br Best wore a prosthetic costume to portray Jar Jar which cost about and served as a reference for the actors to interact with animators to base the performance on and digital artists to match the lighting He was the first computer generated supporting character in a live action film although in a small number of shots such as those only showing the character s hands or feet the costume was not replaced with CGI br br br Appearances br br br Films br Jar Jar appears in

Best was signed on to portray Binks in the show Star Wars Detours br br br Reception br Even before the release of The Phantom Menace Jar Jar Binks became the subject of significant media and popular attention After the film s release Binks became symbolic of what many reviewers such as Brent Staples The New York Times David Edelstein Slate and Eric Harrison Los Angeles Times considered to be creative flaws of the film The character was widely rejected and often ridiculed by people who felt that Jar Jar was included in the film solely to appeal to children a criticism first leveled with the introduction of the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi Bruce Handy of Vanity Fair wrote that Jar Jar has come to symbolize what many fans see as the faults of the prequel trilogy characters no one much cares about a sense of humor geared toward the youngest conceivable audience members an over reliance on computer graphics and story lines devoted to the kinds of convoluted political machinations which wouldn t have been out of place in adaptations of I Claudius or The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich but which fit less snugly in films with characters like Jar Jar Binks One fan Mike J Nichols created and distributed free of charge a modified version of the film entitled The Phantom Edit which cut out several scenes featuring what Nichols dubbed Jar Jar antics The character was also lampooned on an episode of the television show South Park entitled Jakovasaurs in The Fairly OddParents Episode Abra Catastrophe The Simpsons Episode Co Dependents Day as well as the parody Star Wars episodes of Robot Chicken in which Best reprised the role in voice over form br In response to the criticism surrounding Jar Jar Star Wars creator George Lucas stated that he feels there is a section of the fanbase upset that the movies are for children but they don t want to admit that There is a small group of fans that do not like comic sidekicks They want the films to be tough like The Terminator and they get very upset and opinionated about anything that has anything to do with being childlike br In July Best said that the widespread criticism of his character had led to him considering suicide Fans felt sorry for and showed their support for Best feeling that toxic abuse is unacceptable Among the group of people is the interpreter of Yoda Frank Oz who said that he enjoyed the character Jar Jar Binks and wrote on Twitter I LOVED Jar Jar Binks I know I ll get raked over the coals for saying that but I just will never understand the harshness of people s dislike of him I do character work He is a GREAT character Okay Go ahead Shoot Gimme all ya got but you ll never make me change my mind br In April during the annual Star Wars Celebration event ahead of the th anniversary panel for The Phantom Menace George Lucas named Jar Jar as his favorite Star Wars character br br br Allegations of racial caricature br In an article for The Wall Street Journal film critic Joe Morgenstern described the character as a Rastafarian Stepin Fetchit on platform hoofs crossed annoyingly with Butterfly McQueen Legal scholar Patricia J Williams argued that many aspects of Jar Jar Bink s characterization were reminiscent of the blackface archetypes in minstrel shows while academic Paul J Ford suggested the character is a laid back clown character which utilized stereotypes of Afro Caribbean people Lucasfilm responded to these claims by denying that there were any racist intentions during the character s creation George Lucas has also responded stating that those criticisms are made by people who ve obviously never met a Jamaican How in the world could you take an orange amphibian and say that he s a Jamaican Ahmed Best also rejected such claims stating that Jar Jar has nothing to do with the Caribbean br br br Speculations of villainy br On December Adult Swim released Robot Chicken Star Wars Episode III an animated comedy special parody of Star Wars In the first sketch titled The Emperor s Back Emperor Palpatine feels remorse for his actions and calls Binks voiced by Ahmed Best himself on the telephone apologizing to him for manipulating him into granting Palpatine emergency powers in the senate during Attack of the Clones Binks pretends to accept this apology feigning innocence but after he hangs up he reveals that he was in fact a Sith Lord named Darth Jar Jar who only pretended to be manipulated by Palpatine and actually manipulated Palpatine himself This sketch was in reference to a popular in joke among Star Wars fans Five years later in late October a Reddit user by the name of Lumpawarroo the name of Chewbacca s son published a detailed theory speculating that Binks was originally written as a major antagonist of the series a manipulative prominent collaborator of Palpatine before being written off from his major villain s role due to the character s negative reception This theory was related to an earlier interview with actor Ahmed Best in r IAmA where he claimed that Jar Jar had been displaced from the story s main focus due to the backlash implying at the same time that the hate received by the character was not entirely unintentional br The post quickly became popular and received significant media coverage internationally by independent bloggers and major news outlets like The Guardian The Washington Post and The New York Times which included analysis of his actions in The Phantom Menace and gave him the nickname of Darth Jar Jar Journalist Andrew Street from The Guardian called it a classic twist comparing it to Yoda s role in The Empire Strikes Back while Matt Hickey from Forbes went to the extent of contacting George Lucas about the question but received no answer br In response to the speculations Best tweeted I will say this it feels really good when the hidden meaning behind the work is seen No matter how long it takes apparently confirming the theory Some months later he expanded upon his tweet in a YouTube interview stating there is a lot about the theory that is true there are some things about it that are not true Could Jar Jar have evolved into that I think the answer is yes Because of the backlash and rightfully so Lucasfilm backed off of Jar Jar a lot but a lot of the influence that I put into the character mirrored a lot of what was already in the Star Wars universe Best concluded only Lucas could unveil the actual role of Binks yet he also claimed that a deleted scene from Attack of the Clones would have still shown Palpatine darkly confiding his plans about the Empire to Jar Jar br J J Abrams who directed two installments of the franchise s sequel trilogy after its buyout by Disney personally approved of the theory about the villainous Jar Jar He described Lumpawarroo s argumentation as an unbelievably lengthy analysis in a very seriously thought out way as to why it s obviously true he s evil br In when questioned about it Best stated again only Lucas could answer but he confirmed the theorists idea of Jar Jar s antics being actually a disguised fighting style akin to drunken boxing revealing that he based his performance on Jackie Chan s role in the film Drunken Master He said the Darth Jar Jar theory caught it caught it I never thought anybody would see that br The Darth Jar Jar theory is referenced in the upcoming Lego Star Wars Rebuild the Galaxy animated miniseries in which a Jedi relic accidentally rewrites reality and turns Jar Jar reprised by Best into a Sith Lord br br br Character reassessment br br Since the release of the movie The Phantom Menace many people who have worked on the Star Wars films and viewers have defended Jar Jar Binks br Filmmaker and creator George Lucas defended the character Jar Jar Binks by clarifying that the Star Wars films were made for year old children He has said from the beginning in early interviews for A New Hope that the series was intended for children br In an interview with IGN during the premiere of The Force Awakens Yoda s performer Frank Oz stated that Jar Jar Binks is his favorite character I love Jar Jar Binks I swear to god I do When I saw that script I thought he was a fantastic character and I don t know what the heck happened I thought he was fantastic he was hysterical He reminded me of Abbott and Costello br Actor Liam Neeson praised Ahmed Best for his portrayal of Jar Jar Binks I know a lot of fans and critics didn t like it Ahmed Best who played Jar Jar Binks received a lot of criticism to the point where it really hurt his career And I have to say that when he was making that movie with Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks and with Ewan McGregor as young Obi Wan Kenobi he was probably one of the funniest and most talented guys I ve ever worked with I remember calling my old ex agent and saying Listen I think I just worked with the new Eddie Murphy And I still believe it br During the th anniversary of The Phantom Menace film many members of the prequel production team have defended the character and appreciated the public s acceptance at the Star Wars Celebration panel Visual effects supervisor John Knoll reflected Well I think it s good to see his newfound popularity because I think George took a lot of the criticism pretty harshly It was kind of painful for me to see how cruel people were about it and how personally George took it I think the movies didn t deserve as much hate as they received It hurt me to see how much George took those things He also said I thought the Star Wars Celebration panel was great especially the warm reaction there was to Ahmed I know he took all the vicious comments people had about Jar Jar very hard That s not his fault he didn t write that character He s an actor who did a really good job and worked hard to get it right Seeing the really warm reaction of the crowd made me feel It was moving br Animation director Rob Coleman said that twenty years later he still has younger people coming up to him and telling him that Jar Jar is their favorite character br Digital model designer Jean Bolte cited Jar Jar Binks as one of her favorite characters to work with alongside Sebulba and Yoda saying Going to Star Wars Celebration and seeing and hearing the fans so interested in which one was our contribution It really completely changed my point of view about being privileged to have had anything to do with these films br In an interview with Europa Press during the premiere of Rogue One A Star Wars Story a journalist asked actress Felicity Jones who she would like to receive a gift from if she were in the Star Wars galaxy at Christmas time and she responded I think she would be very interested to receive a gift from Jar Jar Binks or C P br Ahmed Best was moved by people s appreciation for Jar Jar Binks It was definitely the kids I had to start looking at Jar Jar through their eyes and that s what made me smile again Now those kids they are between and years old They have a different perspective on The Phantom Menace The Phantom Menace for them is their Star Wars Episodes IV V and VI that s their parents Star Wars and VII VIII and IX that s their children s Star Wars But the prequels that s theirs and they defend the prequels So I see the same thing I see the resurgence of The Phantom Menace He then talked about his experience of going to Star Wars Celebration To be very honest I was very afraid to go to Celebration Every time I m in a Star Wars setting I spend most of my time defending our work and defending Jar Jar And I just don t want to do that anymore So I was very reluctant to come to Celebration because of that and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised It wasn t the case at all I just felt nothing but love and respect and admiration for the work we did I couldn t have been more proud and I couldn t have been happier I wish George was there because I think we re at a time right now where we have to stand in that work We have to say We did it and step into that in a very proud way because it stands the test of time br br br br Footnotes br br Citations br br br External links br br Jar Jar Binks in the
