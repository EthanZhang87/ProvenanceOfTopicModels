and Queen Breha of Aquilae In a later version she is Luke s cousin and the daughter of Owen Lars and his wife Beru A subsequent story synopsis establishes her as Leia Antilles the child of Bail Antilles from the peaceful world of Organa Major In the fourth draft she is Leia Organa of Alderaan which is how she appears in the finished film br Fisher was when she was cast as Princess Leia with

movies they think I m some kind of space bitch She has no friends no family her planet was blown up in seconds so all she has is a cause From the first film Star Wars she was just a soldier front line and center The only way they knew to make the character strong was to make her angry In Return of the Jedi she gets to be more feminine more supportive more affectionate br She said in br br I would rather have played Han Solo When I first read the script I thought that s the part to be always wry and sardonic He s always that I feel like a lot of the time Leia s either worried or pissed or thank God sort of snarky But I m much more worried and pissed than Han Solo ever was and those aren t fun things to play I had a lot of fun killing Jabba the Hutt They asked me on the day if I wanted to have a stunt double kill Jabba No That s the best time I ever had as an actor And the only reason to go into acting is if you can kill a giant monster br br br Appearances br br br Original trilogy br

Han Solo and Chewbacca They escape aboard Han s ship the Millennium Falcon After analyzing the Death Star schematics the Rebels find a small weakness in the battle station which allows Luke to destroy it with torpedoes launched from his X wing After the victory Leia honors Luke Han and Chewbacca for their heroism In Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post praised Leia s courage and resiliency while experiencing imprisonment torture and the destruction of her home planet Rosenberg also notes that while Han is almost immediately attracted to Leia they end up in conflict because she insists on asserting command and he automatically resists even as she proves herself to be worthy of it br Fisher told Rolling Stone in that in the original script when Luke and Han arrive to rescue Leia she is unconscious her eyes are yellow and she is hanging upside down imagery which alludes to the horror film The Exorcist Fisher explained that the scene was changed because Chewbacca would have had to carry Leia for an extended period of time br br br The Empire Strikes Back br In The Empire Strikes Back Leia is commanding the Rebel base on Hoth As Han prepares to leave the base to pay off Jabba he

Vader and used the Force to contact Leia br Commenting on Han s attempt to pry a confession of affection out Leia Rosenberg asserts that Han s not wrong that if Leia doesn t figure out that she s a person with needs she s going to burn out In a way it s an early confession of love Han s anxious about the bounty hunters who are still pursuing him But he would stay and give his love and support to Leia if she could just acknowledge that she needs him br br br Return of the Jedi br In Return of the Jedi Leia infiltrates Jabba the Hutt s palace on Tatooine disguised as a bounty hunter She frees

After joining forces with a tribe of Ewoks the Rebels manage to destroy the Death Star and defeat the Empire br Fisher told Rolling Stone in In Return of the Jedi Leia gets to be more feminine more supportive more affectionate But let s not forget that these movies are basically boys fantasies So the other way they made her more female in this one was to have her take off her clothes Rosenberg writes of Han and Leia br br And we know those two crazy kids are locked for life in Return of the Jedi when it turns out that Han has accepted a Generalship in the Rebellion keeping it a secret from Leia In A New Hope Leia was grumbling about the quality of Han as a rescuer But when she finds out what Han s done accepting a rank he once found insulting and a mission she knows to be dangerous Leia

revolutionary look from turn of the century Mexico An exhibit at the Denver Art Museum credited a particular revolutionary later identified as Clara de la Rocha as an inspiration for the coiffure The museum stated that Leia s hair arrangement was also influenced by a hairstyle worn by indigenous Hopi women of North America Empire suggested that Leia s hairdo was based on that of Queen Fria a

television curator at the Paley Center for Media said in From the male perspective Princess Leia was a very creditable character for her time not perfect but certainly defiant assertive and strong Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post wrote in Leia wasn t just the first great heroine of science fiction and fantasy to capture my imagination She was one of the first characters I encountered whose power came from her political conviction and acumen In her article Feminism and the Force Empowerment and Disillusionment in a Galaxy Far Far Away Diana Dominguez cited Leia as a welcome change from the previous portrayals of women in film and TV She wrote br br Here was a woman who could play like and with the boys but who didn t have to become one of the boys and who could if and when she wanted to show she liked the boys a woman who is outspoken unashamed and most importantly unpunished for being so She isn t a flirty sex pot tossing her hair around seductively to distract the enemy She doesn t play the role of Maternal caretaker although she does display caring and compassion or the sweet innocent damsel who stands passively by while the men do all the work but does step aside to let them do what they re good at when it is wise to do so Leia is a hero without losing her gendered status she does not have to play the cute helpless sex kitten or become sexless and androgynous to get what she wants She can be strong sassy outspoken bossy and bitchy and still be respected and seen as feminine br Rosenberg writes that though at first Luke is an apolitical innocent in search of adventure and Han is a detached opportunist in search of money both are influenced by Leia s passion and take their places as full participants in the Rebellion She notes Everyone else eventually comes around to Leia s view of the world Leia herself singularly dedicated to her political movement against the Empire finds a partner in Han acknowledging that personal happiness can help her sustain her commitment to building a better galactic order Rosenberg cites Leia s willingness to see the best in him and Han s desire to live up to her belief in him as a foundation of their relationship also pointing out his attempts to make her recognize that she has needs like anyone else and should acknowledge that she needs him br In their essay Lightsabers Political Arenas and Marriages Ray Merlock and Kathy Merlock Jackson cite Leia as the successor of earlier science fiction heroines Wilma Deering of Buck Rogers and Dale Arden of Flash Gordon and the embodiment of a new stage in the ongoing presentation of the fairy tale princess in jeopardy Writing that after Leia no longer would princesses be passive and salvaged simply with a kiss they note the reflection of the character in later Disney Princess animated films and in woman warriors such as Ellen Ripley from the Alien franchise and Xena of the adventure TV series Xena Warrior Princess A O Scott of The New York Times described Leia as a foremother of Hermione Granger and Katniss Everdeen and of countless latter day Disney princesses She also foretold the recent somewhat belated feminist turn in the Star Wars cycle itself br Mark Hamill described Fisher s performance as br br She was effortlessly feminist you know She wasn t some shrinking violet that needed a guy to come to rescue her In fact she made Han and Luke look like chumps She was anything but what I expected I mean I sort of thought Well she s that s barely out of high school And in many ways she was a lot older and wiser than I was br Fisher herself described Leia as a huge feminist icon dismissing the suggestion that the character was ever a damsel in distress Fisher said of Leia She bossed them around I don t know what your idea of distress is but that wasn t it And I wasn t some babe running through the galaxy with my tits bouncing around So I wasn t threatening to women She added I like Princess Leia I like how she was feisty I like how she killed Jabba the Hutt I think I am Princess Leia and Princess Leia is me It s like a M bius striptease br br br Metal bikini br br Leia s slave costume when she is held captive by Jabba the Hutt at the beginning of Return of the Jedi made of brass and dubbed Leia s Metal Bikini or Gold Bikini immediately made the character and Fisher a generational sex symbol celebrated by

of a generation of fanboys hitting puberty in the spring of Fisher said in I am not a sex symbol so that s an opinion of someone I don t share that br Allie Townsend of Time wrote in that the so called slave Leia outfit has gained a cult following of its own Rosenberg noted that the costume has become culturally iconic in a way that has slipped loose from the context of the scenes in which Leia wore it and the things she does after she is forced into the outfit Acknowledging the opinion of some that the slave Leia iconography tarnishes the character s position as feminist hero Rosenberg argued br br Leia may be captive in these scenes but she s not exactly a compliant fantasy Instead she s biding her time for the moment when she can put that fury into action carrying out a carefully laid plan to rescue her lover And when that moment comes the bikini doesn t condemn Leia to passivity She rises and uses the very chains that bind her to strangle the creature who tried to take away her power by turning her into a sex object br Science fiction filmmaker Letia Clouston concurred saying Sci fi has had a long history of strong female characters Yes Princess Leia was in a gold bikini but she was also the one who single handedly killed Jabba When you take into account movies and TV shows like Terminator Aliens Battlestar Galactica and even video games like Metroid you can see sci fi has consistently promoted the strength of women more than any other genre Peter W Lee argues that the bikini connotes Leia s hopelessness and helplessness but even in that demeaning costume she retains her dignity and remains an icon of feminism Noah Berlatsky argued in The Guardian for a deeper significance to the costume beyond its function as a sex symbol stating that the outfit represents an important stage in Princess Leia s complicated relationship with Han Solo br The outfit was created by Aggie Guerard Rodgers and Nilo Rodis Jamero costume designers for Return of the Jedi According to Rodgers the design was inspired by the work of fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta Author Rikke Schubart suggested the design was also inspired by the work of science fiction illustrator Earle K Bergey The outfit featured a sculpted metal string bikini top paired with a bottom consisting of sculpted metal plates in the front and back covering a red silk loincloth Fisher wore leather boots serpentine jewelry and a collar and chain that bound her to her captor which she ultimately uses to strangle him Multiple versions of the metal bikini were created to accommodate different scenes in the film including metal pieces by sculptor Richard Miller for scenes in which Fisher remained still and a rubber version she and stuntwoman Tracy Eddon could wear comfortably while performing stunts The costume designers made a mold of Fisher s torso so it could be designed to a custom fit Fisher quipped that the bikini was what supermodels will eventually wear in the seventh ring of hell br Fisher posed in the costume for a cover story in Rolling Stone The costume has been parodied in various TV series and films including Friends Family Guy and Fanboys Yvonne Strahovski s appearance wearing the costume in Chuck prompted Wizard to rank her No of the sexiest women on TV in IGN gave Strahovski the top honor in a similar list Comedian Amy Schumer wore a replica of the outfit for the August cover of GQ br An original rubber version of the costume sold for at auction in br Despite its iconic status among many fans of the franchise the slave Leia outfit has sometimes incited controversy In response to a news segment in which parents described difficulties explaining toys featuring the costume including a chain around Leia s neck to their children Fisher called Disney s decision stupid saying Tell the kids that a giant slug captured me and forced me to wear that stupid outfit and then I killed him because I didn t like it br br br See also br
