Wars Favreu describes the character as a a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy far from the authority of the New Republic br For the episode Favreau took inspiration from several western and samurai films to create some of the scenes of the films The Mandalorian is forced to team up with a bounty droid IG in order to manage to reach the asset that both are looking for The scene is a direct reference of the film For a Few Dollars More where the Man with No Name Manco is the nickname he uses for the film is forced to team up with another bounty hunter These plot point would be reused for the season s finale for the episode Chapter Redemption and the second season s sixth episode Chapter The Tragedy The Big Country also serves as an influence for the series for the scene where the Mandalorian is trained to ride a Blurrg by Kuiil similarly when James McKay is trained to ride a horse by a more experienced rancher The film also references The Wild Bunch for the

rate the episode a out of Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times described the episode as a safe entertaining blockbuster packed with action and predictanle entertaining Paul Bradshaw of NME considered the episode sparse enough to feel bigger than it is slick without looking over polished and introducing a moody mumbly antihero that is somehow already worth caring about but that it marks to be a great start for a show Emily St James of Vox Media had a more lukewarm reception stating that the blend of Star Wars Spaghetti Westerns and prestige TV was fine but that Disney would be wanting to do more than that St James additionally described the first five minutes as stretched out br br br Accolades br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Chapter The Mandalorian at IMDb br Chapter
