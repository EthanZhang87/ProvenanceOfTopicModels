Skywalker Saga Lucas had planned a sequel trilogy as early as but canceled it by He produced only the first six episodes and for a time described these as comprising the complete story The sequel trilogy concept was revived when the Walt Disney Company entered negotiations to acquire Lucasfilm in Lucas produced new story treatments but these were largely discarded Both the acquisition and plans to produce the trilogy were announced in late br The first installment The Force Awakens was released on December after a year hiatus between the prequel and sequel trilogies It was directed by

Leia and Han Solo nephew of Luke and grandson of Anakin Skywalker who has fallen to the dark side The first two films received positive reviews from critics while the third received mixed reviews The trilogy grossed over billion at the box office worldwide with each film surpassing billion worldwide br br br Background br br br Early development br According to Mark Hamill who plays Luke Skywalker Star Wars creator George Lucas told him in that he planned three or four Star Wars trilogies Lucas suggested that Hamill could have a cameo role in Episode IX which he imagined filming by A Time magazine story in March quoting Lucas stated there would be ten Star Wars films after The Empire Strikes Back Gary Kurtz the producer of the first two films was aware of proposed story elements for Episode VII to Episode IX before At the time of the release of The Empire Strikes Back Lucas said there were seven further Star Wars films he wanted to make He said he had twelve page outlines for those films In an interview with Jim Steranko in Prevue magazine published in late Lucas described how the expansive scope of Star Wars had started with an overlong screenplay br br So I took the screenplay and divided it into three stories and rewrote the first one Then I had the other two films which were essentially split into three parts each two trilogies When the smoke cleared I said This is really great I ll do another trilogy that takes place after this I had three trilogies of nine films and then another couple of odd films It s a nine part saga that has a beginning a middle and an end It progresses over a period of about fifty or sixty years with about twenty years between trilogies each trilogy taking about six or seven years br By the time of Episode V The Empire Strikes Back s release Lucas had written story treatments for all nine Star Wars episodes In Kurtz revealed a brief outline of these treatments br br Episode I would have explored the methodology of the Jedi br Episode II would have developed the backstory of Obi Wan Kenobi br Episode III would explain the rise of Darth Vader br Episode IV had already seen Luke decide to become a Jedi and Obi Wan s final confrontation with Vader br Episode V was filmed essentially as written br Episode VI was to feature Leia as an isolated monarch Han s death and Luke showing down with Vader before exiling himself Luke and Leia were not related br Episode VII was to be the first part of a trilogy continuing the story of Luke as a Jedi br Episode VIII would have featured Luke s sister distinct from Leia br Episode IX would introduce the Emperor and depict Luke s ultimate battle with him br In late Lucas stated that he had titles and ten page story outlines for each of the nine episodes In an interview the same magazine Gary Kurtz explained that the total number of films or their content might change as they were produced Lucas similarly stated in an interview with Starlog magazine in September that he had the nine film series plotted but br br it s a long way from the plot to the script I ve just gone through that with Return of the Jedi and what seems like a great idea when it s described in three sentences doesn t hold together when you try to make five or six scenes out of it So plots change a lot when they start getting into script form br As part of his biographical research on George Lucas in the early s Lucas allowed author Dale Pollock to read the plot outlines of a film saga on the condition of signing a confidentiality agreement Pollock said these sequel trilogy drafts would involve Luke Skywalker in his s and s and that they would be The three most exciting stories They had propulsive action really interesting new worlds new characters Lucas s plans were drastically changed after The Empire Strikes Back was released owing to the stress of producing the first three films as well as pressure from his wife Marcia to step back from this kind of filmmaking By Lucas had decided to make only one Star Wars trilogy br br br Cancellation period br According to Gary Kurtz details of elements from the discarded sequel trilogy which were incorporated into Return of the Jedi include br br Luke Skywalker becomes a full fledged Jedi knight br Luke s sister who was originally meant to be a new character was revealed to be Leia br The Emperor would first appear and Luke would confront him br Through the s Lucas variously hinted at plot elements from his abandoned sequel trilogy which he said would have revolved around moral and philosophical problems including distinguishing right from wrong justice confrontation and passing on what you have learned Ideas which seem to have been used in Disney s sequel trilogy include br br Episode VII would begin years after the end of Return of the Jedi Lucas in and br R D and C PO would be the only characters to appear in all nine films Lucas in and br The key actors Hamill as Luke Skywalker Ford as Han Solo and Fisher as Princess Leia would appear in their s or s Lucas in br Lucas stated in that what happens to Luke is much more ethereal I have a tiny notebook full of notes on that Hamill said in that if his character were to return again it would be on another plane of existence or not the same character br Ideas that were apparently not retained in Disney s sequel trilogy include br br The trilogy would deal with the rebuilding of the Republic Lucas in br Luke would have a romantic relationship with a female partner Lucas in br Timothy Zahn who wrote the Legends non canonical Thrawn trilogy of novels was interviewed about the sequel trilogy after its development by Disney was announced in He confirmed that it was never meant to be based on his Thrawn trilogy nor the rest of the Expanded Universe and said that he had been briefed years before on Lucas s plans for the sequels br br The original idea as I understood it and Lucas changes his mind off and on so it may not be what he s thinking right now but it was going to be three generations You d have the original trilogy then go back to Luke s father and find out what happened to him and if there was another seventh eighth or ninth film it would be Luke s children br In Lucas announced his intentions to produce a prequel trilogy When asked he would frequently repeat that he had no plans to make the sequel trilogy and that he would not allow other directors to make it At a press conference for the Special Edition of the original trilogy Lucas stated I don t have scripts for the sequel trilogy The only notion on that was wouldn t it be fun to get all the actors to come back when they re or years old and make three more about them as old people Also in he said The whole story has six episodes If I ever went beyond that it would be something that was made up I really don t have any notion other than Gee it would be interesting to do Luke Skywalker later on It wouldn t be a part of the main story it would just be a sequel to this thing He further stated When you see it in six parts you ll understand It really ends at part six br On the possibility of someone else making Star Wars films Lucas said Probably not it s my thing In August at a press conference to discuss The Phantom Menace Lucas described the nine year commitment required to make a Star Wars trilogy In he said Basically what I said as a joke was Maybe when Harrison and Carrie are in their s we ll come back and do another version The thing I didn t realize then and that I do realize now very clearly is that not only would they be in their s but I would be in my s too He reiterated Ultimately the saga will be six films a hour story Then people can watch all six films together as they were intended to be seen br In Lucas described making the films at that age as an idea that seemed amusing at the time but doesn t seem realistic now and suggested that off the cuff comments he had made in earlier years had been misconstrued as absolute statements In after all six films had been released Lucas said The movies were the story of Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker and when Luke saves the galaxy and redeems his father that s where that story ends In another interview Lucas ruled out anybody else making Star Wars films and added that the Expanded Universe did not line up with his vision Asked if he wanted new Star Wars films to be made after his death he said I ve left pretty explicit instructions for there not to be any more features There will definitely be no Episodes VII IX That s because there isn t any story The Star Wars story is really the tragedy of Darth Vader That is the story br br br Renewed development br In May Lucas was in Orlando Florida to celebrate the opening of Star Tours The Adventures Continue at Walt Disney World He was invited to breakfast by Disney CEO Bob Iger who asked Lucas if he would be willing to sell his company to Disney Lucas had begun to consider retiring but was not ready to do so at that time Lucas considered directing Episode VII for a May release and then selling his company but decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers announcing in January that he would step away from making blockbuster films br In early after being disappointed by the weak performance of Red Tails Lucas announced to The New York Times that he was planning to retire While he was in New York he asked Kathleen Kennedy to lunch He asked if she would be a co chair at Lucasfilm with him with the intention of transferring leadership entirely to her after about a year She began working for him on June Lucas soon proposed that they work together on the sequel trilogy They brought in Michael Arndt to write a draft of Episode VII based on Lucas s synopsis Star Wars screenwriting veteran Lawrence Kasdan was hired to support Arndt After making an appearance at Star Wars Celebration VI in late August Lucas took Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher to lunch and asked if they would be willing to reprise their roles for the new films They agreed as did Harrison Ford after being promised that Han Solo would be given meaningful closure br Details of his sequel trilogy treatments included the conclusion of the Skywalker family s story with its third generation being portrayed in their twenties Lucas hoped to explain concepts he had imagined when he originally drafted his saga in the s Most specifically he revealed the symbiotic relationships between the Jedi the Force midi chlorians microscopic lifeforms first mentioned onscreen in s The Phantom Menace and the Whills all powerful creatures first mentioned in the title of the original outline of Star Wars Journal of the Whills br br The next three Star Wars films were going to get into a microbiotic world But there s this world of creatures that operate differently than we do I call them the Whills And the Whills are the ones who actually control the universe They feed off the Force Back in the day I used to say ultimately what this means is we were just cars vehicles for the Whills to travel around in We re vessels for them And the conduit is the midi chlorians The midi chlorians are the ones that communicate with the Whills The Whills in a general sense they are the Force But it s about symbiotic relationships I think personally one of the core values we should have in the world and kids should be taught is ecology to understand that we all are connected Lucas br By June Lucas had agreed to sell his company provided that Kennedy would replace him as president of Lucasfilm Iger agreed while insisting that Disney would have final say over future movies Lucas s final stipulations before the sale in late were that his story treatments would be used and that the number of Disney employees who could read them would be limited Lucas gave Kennedy the final draft of his story treatments during the October sale The same month the Disney sale and production of the sequel trilogy as well as a release date for a new film were announced to the public Lucas stated I always said I wasn t going to do any more and that s true because I m not going to do any more But that doesn t mean I m unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more Both plot outlines the one written in the s and the one written in the early s were given to Iger around the time that Disney acquired Lucasfilm br In January Lucas held the first story briefing about the as yet untitled Episode VII at Skywalker Ranch Related concepts stemming from these early briefings include the following story elements br br A year old female Jedi Padawan named Taryn Lucas also considered Thea and Winkie as potential names for the character The female Padawan was retained as the year old Rey br Another teenager named Skylar who befriends the protagonist and carries a blaster He ultimately became the stormtrooper character Finn In at least one conception Skylar was the son of Han Solo and Leia Organa and ultimately fell to the Dark Side of the Force these plot developments were retained for the backstory of Ben Solo Kylo Ren in the final iteration However in some drafts this character was not anyone s son and in others it was not decided whose son he was br The older Luke Skywalker would have exiled himself to a remote planet where the first Jedi temple was located Luke would have started off reluctant to train the female Padawan but eventually have a change of heart and agree to train her Lucas planned for Luke to die in Episode VIII Conversely in Hamill said that Lucas original vision for the ending of Episode IX was to have Luke die then instead of making a simple cameo leaving his sister Leia as a Jedi Luke was going to appear with dialogue in the first film br One of the antagonists would be a character named Darth Talon later revealed to be the female Sith lord from the Star Wars Legacy comic book series who served a powerful master codenamed Uber by the production team and was responsible in some versions of the story for turning the son of Han and Leia to the Dark Side of the Force Talon s role in the story was eventually subsumed into the role of Kylo Ren and Uber became Supreme Leader Snoke br Darth Vader s castle which Lucas had been developing since the preproduction phase of The Empire Strikes Back would have been involved br In an interview published in Lucas says he decided not to work on the trilogy because he was about to have a daughter at the time and decided to enjoy life for a while He also detailed more of his story treatments br br The trilogy would start a few years after the events of Return of the Jedi According to Lucas we establish pretty quickly that there s this underworld there are these offshoot stormtroopers who started their own planets and that Luke is trying to restart the Jedi br Darth Maul would return with robotic legs as had been established in Star Wars The Clone Wars and train the female Darth Talon as his apprentice According to Lucas She was the new Darth Vader and most of the action was with her So these were the two main villains of the trilogy Maul would become the godfather of crime in the universe because as the Empire falls he takes over br Leia is trying to rebuild the Republic and get it under control from the gangsters Lucas stated that That was the main story br Luke puts the word out so out of Jedi maybe or are left The Jedi have to grow again from scratch so Luke has to find two and three year olds and train them It ll be years before you have a new generation of Jedi By the end of the trilogy Luke would have rebuilt much of the Jedi and we would have the renewal of the New Republic with Leia Senator Organa becoming the Supreme Chancellor in charge of everything So she ended up being the Chosen One br In April it was announced that In order to give maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an element of surprise and discovery for the audience Star Wars Episodes VII IX will not tell the same story told in the post Return of the Jedi Expanded Universe The announcement stated that the only existing Star Wars material that would be considered part of the new canon would be Episodes I VI along with The Clone Wars animated film and series br In Lucas revealed to his disappointment that his outlines had been discarded in order to make something for the fans Episode VII writer and director J J Abrams later revealed that the same year Disney had given him a mandate to discard Lucas s story and start from scratch Episode VII The Force Awakens was written by Lucasfilm veteran Lawrence Kasdan along with J J Abrams and Michael Arndt Bob Iger s memoirs published in recount that Lucas was upset after hearing the plot of The Force Awakens in meetings specifically about elements that were derivative of the original film Lucas felt betrayed by Iger and Abrams because they discarded some of his sequel trilogy ideas br Episode VIII The Last Jedi writer and director Rian Johnson s initial response to the script of The Force Awakens included the suggestion of minor adjustments to the ending According to Abrams these improved the movie and made it line up more with The Last Jedi Abrams intended for BB to help Rey search for Luke which Johnson changed to R D due to his being Luke s droid as well as BB belonging to Poe and not knowing Luke Additionally Abrams ending featured Rey finding Luke lifting rocks with the Force which was changed due to Johnson s plot of Luke having disconnected himself from the Force Johnson implied that his portrayal of the Force in The Last Jedi was influenced by the Mortis trilogy of episodes from The Clone Wars which he had rewatched early in the writing process on the advice of The Clone Wars supervising director Dave Filoni He also stated that he considered including Lando Calrissian in the film possibly giving him the role of new character DJ Benicio del Toro but did not because it would have meant Lando betraying the characters without redemption Abrams credited The Last Jedi with influencing him to be more daring on The Rise of Skywalker br Some reports indicate that contrary to popular belief some plot points across the trilogy were planned in advance The idea of Luke Skywalker living on an island following his failure to stop the murder of his Jedi students and then training an apprentice who would help him overcome his self doubt was first pitched by George Lucas in during creative meetings between himself and Lucasfilm as part of story discussions for Episode VII these ideas would later be used in The Last Jedi Several plot points of The Rise of Skywalker were pitched in an early story meeting between Lucasfilm executives including Dave Filoni Pablo Hidalgo Doug Chiang John Knoll and Kiri Hart after the plot of The Force Awakens had been finalized including the notion of Leia as a mentor figure to Rey Leia breaking through to her son Ben Solo Kylo Ren and the notion of Rey as the Skywalker of the trilogy by metaphor rather than blood connection The return of Emperor Palpatine in Episode IX was planned as far back as the earliest development phase of the trilogy Similarly Abrams hinted that Palpatine being Rey s grandfather was an early idea he and Lawrence Kasdan had while working on The Force Awakens although Daisy Ridley later claimed that ideas for Rey s lineage changed throughout filming of The Rise of Skywalker Adam Driver claimed that back when shooting The Force Awakens Kylo Ren was not meant to be redeemed by the end of the trilogy which was the character arc Abrams had in mind at that moment with Ren starting insecure about his commitment to the dark side before becoming the one most committed by the end of the trilogy in reversal to his grandfather Darth Vader s arc in the original trilogy noting that Johnson took that planned direction in consideration when shooting The Last Jedi even though he took other decisions br br br Films br Unlike the previous two trilogies whose films were released approximately three years apart ahead of Memorial Day weekend the sequel films were released two years apart from each other in December Star Wars The Force Awakens was released on December and introduces the year old orphan Rey who is drawn into the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order a ruthless military faction commanded by Kylo Ren the son of Leia Organa and Han Solo In The Last Jedi released on December Rey is trained by Luke Skywalker the last living Jedi while again facing Ren and the First Order The Rise of Skywalker was released on December and features the conclusion of the age old conflict between the Jedi and Sith with Rey confronting the resurrected Emperor Palpatine br br br Star Wars The Force Awakens br br About years after the destruction of the second Death Star Luke Skywalker has vanished The remnants of the Empire have become the First Order which seeks to destroy Luke and the New Republic The First Order is opposed by the Resistance led by General Leia Organa On the planet Jakku Resistance pilot Poe Dameron obtains

Wars Celebration the title for Episode IX was confirmed to be The Rise of Skywalker Principal photography began on August and wrapped on February The Rise of Skywalker was released in the United States on December br br br Themes br br According to J J Abrams and Chris Terrio the trilogy s core theme is about learning from the previous generation akin to the Americans in the War of who preserved what was fought for in the American Revolutionary War On the inspiration for the First Order formed from the ashes of the Empire Abrams spoke of conversations the writers had about how the Nazis could have escaped to Argentina after World War II and started working together again br Polygon considers that The Last Jedi s portrayal of Luke Skywalker as a pacifist Jedi master reflects the Jedi s beliefs as being inspired by the Buddhist religion due to the character s inner conflict towards using a lightsaber and seeing it as a weapon of destruction The Last Jedi features scenes recalling Akira Kurosawa s Rashomon utilizing the Rashomon effect when Luke tells Rey that he considered murdering his nephew Ben Solo due to sensing his inevitable fall to the dark side Later Kylo recounts his perspective which prompts Luke to tell a third combined perspective of the event br According to Adam Driver Kylo Ren is morally justified in doing what he thinks is right The Rise of Skywalker depicts Kylo Ren having his helmet repaired following its destruction in The Last Jedi Abrams compared the fractured mask to Kintsugi a Japanese ceramic art of repairing broken pottery which accentuates the breakage While the helmet obscures his vulnerabilities in The Force Awakens its fractured form in The Rise of Skywalker instead communicates the fractured nature of his character Kylo overcomes and kills his father in The Force Awakens before reconciling with his memory of him in The Rise of Skywalker according to Terrio this reconciliation represents the Atonement with the Father stage of the hero s journey which the Star Wars films are heavily patterned on br Rey s journey mirrors that of Anakin and Luke in the prequel and original trilogies The final scene of The Last Jedi depicts servant children playing with a toy of Luke with one boy using the Force to grab a broom According to Inverse this symbolizes that the Force can be found in people with humble beginnings A writer for the same website interprets the end of The Rise of Skywalker as seeing Rey bury the past and rejecting any power her grandfather held over her in a completion of the hero s journey br br br Reception br br br Box office performance br The sequel trilogy experienced diminishing box office returns with each succeeding film Nevertheless it is the highest grossing trilogy of the franchise overall with The Force Awakens ranking as the fifth highest grossing film of all time br br br Response from Star Wars filmmakers br George Lucas agreed with critics who considered The Force Awakens too derivative of the original trilogy In an interview with Charlie Rose Lucas likened his decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a divorce and outlined the creative differences between him and the producers of The Force Awakens Lucas described the previous six Star Wars films as his children and defended his vision for them while criticizing The Force Awakens for having a retro feel saying I worked very hard to make them completely different with different planets with different spaceships to make it new Lucas also likened Disney to white slavers which drew some criticism He subsequently apologized for this remark In responding to the complaints of derivativeness Abrams said What was important for me was introducing brand new characters using relationships that were embracing the history that we know to tell a story that is new to go backwards to go forwards The same year the Disney produced Star Wars anthology film Rogue One was released and it was reported that Lucas liked it more than The Force Awakens In Lucas described the sequel The Last Jedi as beautifully made br Marcia Lucas George Lucas s ex wife who was an editor of all three original films and won an Oscar for her work on the first criticized the Disney sequels in an interview with J W Rinzler for his posthumous final book Howard Kazanjian A Producer s Life She stated that Kennedy and Abrams don t get the franchise particularly criticizing the deaths of Han and Luke as well as the lack of an explanation for Rey s powers br br br Critical and public response br br The sequel trilogy has received a generally positive reception from critics being collectively lauded for its emotional weight lead performances and visual effects including the focus on practical effects However several have criticized it for being derivative of the original trilogy Individually praise has been directed at The Force Awakens for embracing the spirit of the original trilogy and The Last Jedi for its direction and willingness to take risks In contrast The Rise of Skywalker received criticism for its perceived retconning of the plot characterization and themes of The Last Jedi attributed to appeasing a segment of the fanbase to which the film had proved controversial br Retrospectively critics and publications have labelled the fan response to the sequel trilogy as divisive particularly as a result of the final two installments Some have commented on the apparent lack of planning for the trilogy s overarching story feeling that the films appear inconsistent and contradictory from the differing visions of directors J J Abrams and Rian Johnson the latter was alleged to have been given complete creative control for The Last Jedi CNBC and Paste Magazine disagreed with the decision not to use a showrunner to helm the trilogy br br br Accolades br br br Academy Awards br br br Tie in media br br In addition to a vast campaign of tie in media including adaptations and the Journey to Star Wars publishing campaign released in anticipation of each film a number of other spin offs have been released altogether fleshing out characters and story elements from the trilogy including some which were cut from it and tying into earlier eras Some sources have also pointed out that streaming series The Mandalorian and its spin offs will likely set up the events of the sequel trilogy br In November Kathleen Kennedy revealed that Lucasfilm creatives had been having conversations regarding the future of the trilogy s characters At Star Wars Celebration Europe IV in a new film directed by Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy was announced that will follow Rey as she attempts to rebuild the Jedi Order years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker Ridley is set to reprise her role as Rey Kennedy also
