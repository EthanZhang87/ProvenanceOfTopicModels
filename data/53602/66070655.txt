the animated series Star Wars The Clone Wars by original Star Wars creator George Lucas and The Clone Wars supervising director Dave Filoni Voiced by Ashley Eckstein the character is introduced as the Jedi apprentice of Anakin Skywalker the main character of the Star Wars prequel films Ahsoka became a fan favorite over the course of The Clone Wars and Eckstein reprised her role for the follow up animated series Star Wars Rebels Rebels was co created by Filoni and focuses on a group of heroes who resist the Galactic Empire the Jedi Kanan Jarrus his apprentice Ezra Bridger pilot Hera Syndulla Mandalorian warrior Sabine Wren Zeb Orrelios and Hera s droid Chopper During Rebels Ahsoka learns that Anakin has fallen to the dark side of the Force and become the Sith lord Darth Vader In the final season Kanan sacrifices his life and Ezra is taken to an unknown location with antagonist Grand Admiral Thrawn The series ends with an epilogue in which Ahsoka joins Sabine to search for Ezra leading to speculation about a new series focusing on them Filoni said he had ideas for that story but nothing was in development He described bringing the two characters together as a unification of Clone Wars and Rebels and said he would not want someone else to tell their story br The franchise expanded to live action television with the Disney series The Mandalorian in Creator Jon Favreau worked with Filoni to develop the series which is set after the fall of the Empire When thinking of a way to reveal details about the Jedi to the series characters Filoni realized that Ahsoka would be able to provide this information After writing and directing episodes of the first season he felt confident enough in his filmmaking abilities to be able to introduce her to live action in the second season without mess ing it up it was important to Filoni that fans who grew up watching the animated Ahsoka feel that a live action version was the same character Disney CEO Bob Iger said in February that spin offs of The Mandalorian were being considered and there was potential to add characters to the series to then give them their own series Rosario Dawson was reported to be cast as Ahsoka for the second season a month later but this was not officially confirmed until the episode she appears in Chapter The Jedi was released in November Dawson studied acting with Hayden Christensen who portrayed Anakin in the prequel films and first expressed interest in playing Ahsoka in live action after her casting was suggested by a fan in February Filoni wrote and directed the episode which depicts Ahsoka searching for Thrawn Filoni suggested that this is before Ahsoka joins Sabine in the epilogue of Rebels The episode introduces Diana Lee Inosanto as Morgan Elsbeth a servant of Thrawn br br br Development br br Lucasfilm announced several spin off series from The Mandalorian in December including The Book of Boba Fett and Ahsoka also known as Star Wars Ahsoka The new series were set in the same trimeframe as The Mandalorian during the years between the films Return of the Jedi and Star Wars The Force Awakens and were planned to culminate in a climactic story event Filoni later indicated that this would involve a conflict with the remnants of the Empire which Ahsoka helps build towards They were being concurrently developed by Favreau and Filoni with Filoni creating writing and serving as lead producer and showrunner on Ahsoka Lucasfilm s Kathleen Kennedy Carrie Beck and Colin Wilson were also executive producers Peter Ramsey was hired to direct at least one episode by April and Filoni was confirmed to be directing multiple episodes the next month In April the series was revealed to have eight episodes and the other directors were announced Jennifer Getzinger Geeta Patel The Book of Boba Fett s Steph Green and The Mandalorian s Rick Famuyiwa Filoni said each episode would be similar in length to The Mandalorian s episodes though he tended to prefer longer episodes than Favreau which sometimes needed to be edited down to improve pacing br Ahsoka was initially reported to be a miniseries but Disney was not listing it as such by February That April Filoni was announced to be making a film that would serve as a culmination of the interconnected stories of The Mandalorian and its spin offs The film s timing would depend on future seasons of the series including a possible second season of Ahsoka which was dependent on the first season s performance When the first season was fully released in October a second season was considered more likely to be Filoni s next project than the film The next month Filoni revealed that he was now chief creative officer at Lucasfilm and would be directly involved in the planning of future films and series He was considering a second season of Ahsoka at that time and Lucasfilm officially announced that Filoni was developing the season in January br br br Writing br Following speculation and reports about the series Filoni confirmed that Ahsoka would continue the story he established in the epilogue of Rebels He never expected to tell this story as a spin off from a series like The Mandalorian and found it intimidating to actually write after thinking about it for so many years When asked if Ahsoka was effectively a fifth season of Rebels Filoni said that was one way of looking at it but he also saw all of his Star Wars projects as one larger story He said viewers did not need to watch The Clone Wars and Rebels to understand Ahsoka but he felt it would help and he hoped Ahsoka would lead to new audiences discovering the animated series on Disney The first person Filoni sent each script to was Beck who he had been working with since the start of Rebels and he also appreciated getting Favreau s advice from a perspective outside of Filoni s understanding of the characters and animated history br The series is set after Ahsoka s appearances in the second season of The Mandalorian and in The Book of Boba Fett and takes place concurrently with the third season of The Mandalorian It begins with Ahsoka as a wandering r nin who Filoni compared to the main character of Akira Kurosawa s film Yojimbo noting that Lucas was inspired by the works of Kurosawa when originally creating Star Wars This depiction of the character comes after Ahsoka s decision to leave the Jedi and the subsequent destruction of the Order in The Clone Wars as well as the revelation that Anakin is Darth Vader in Rebels This series was Filoni s first opportunity to explore these issues with the character and he wanted to show what she feels this all means about her own potential for darkness He also wanted to explore Ahsoka s feelings about continuing this legacy with an apprentice of her own and the relationships between masters and apprentices became a key theme throughout the first season Ahsoka is revealed to have taken Sabine on as her Padawan learner after the main events of Rebels but they parted ways soon after when Sabine s family were killed during the purge of Mandalore and her subsequent internal struggle reminded Ahsoka too much of Anakin Filoni was planning this storyline by the end of Rebels having come to feel that Sabine was more than just a Mandalorian warrior He saw similarities between the character and Anakin and chose to pair Sabine with Ahsoka in the epilogue of Rebels because of the complicated relationship that could potentially be developed between Ahsoka and an apprentice who reminds her of her own master He was also interested by the idea of someone training to be a Jedi who does not have a strong connection to the Force feeling that differentiated the story from most Star Wars projects which are often about very talented Jedi who he felt were not always relatable to the audience Filoni disagreed with some fans who felt this was going against the franchise s established rules for the Force noting that the Force has always been described as connecting to all living beings and adding his view that anyone can become a Jedi with the right training br Borrowing from J R R Tolkien s novel The Lord of the Rings which was a big inspiration for his storytelling Filoni wanted Ahsoka to go through a similar transformation to the character Gandalf who begins as the wandering unsure Gandalf the Gray but is later reborn as the wise and powerful Gandalf the White This transformation was hinted at in the epilogue of Rebels in which Ahsoka appears wearing all white this led to some fans calling her Ahsoka the White The second episode of the series recreates the epilogue in live action but it changes Ahsoka s costume from white to gray to allow her transformation to come later in the series In the fifth episode Ahsoka is nearly killed and goes through a near death experience in the mysterious World Between Worlds that was first introduced in Rebels There the spirit of Anakin helps Ahsoka work through her character issues Filoni saw the World Between Worlds as a cinematic device that allowed him to show flashbacks to the Clone Wars for viewers who had not seen that series However he did not want this to become a Star Wars history lesson and focused on the relationship between Ahsoka and Anakin instead He saw Ahsoka s time in the World Between Worlds as the turning point for her character allowing her to accept her past and move forward and be less stoic this is signified by a costume change to Ahsoka the White at the end of the episode Filoni wanted the audience to question whether the World Between Worlds was in Ahsoka s mind or if she was actually talking to the spirit of Anakin He also wanted to keep the focus on Ahsoka s issues rather than Anakin s as he felt Lucas had already resolved the latter s character arc in the Star Wars films and did not want to change that He wanted to depict Anakin as the heroic older brother and famous Jedi that Ahsoka once looked up to and prioritised seeing Christensen s performance over the Darth Vader costume which is only seen in brief flashes br Ahsoka and Sabine s hunt for Thrawn and Ezra takes them to a new galaxy outside the main Star Wars galaxy in a first for the franchise Filoni was inspired by an image of multiple galaxies seen in the film Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones and felt it was necessary because he thought it unlikely that Thrawn and Ezra would have remained hidden for so long if they were still in the known galaxy For Thrawn s live action introduction Filoni and Favreau consulted with Timothy Zahn who originally created the character for the Expanded Universe EU novel Heir to the Empire The novel is referenced in the series when Ahsoka describes Thrawn as the heir to the Empire The planet that is visited in the new galaxy Peridea is the ancient homeworld of Morgan s people the Nightsister witches Similar to Thrawn that group of characters were first introduced in an EU novel in this case The Courtship of Princess Leia before appearing in the animated series The three Nightsister Great Mothers who live on Peridea Aktropaw Klothow and Lakesis are named after the three Fates from Greek mythology Atropos Clotho and Lachesis Other new antagonists introduced in the series include Baylan Skoll a former Jedi who is disillusioned with the Order and searching for a secret power his apprentice Shin Hati who he is teaching to be something more than a Jedi and the Jedi hunting Inquisitor Marrok Filoni always includes wolves or references to wolves in his work because of his love for the animals and the names Skoll and Hati are references to wolves from Norse mythology Sk ll and Hati respectively while Marrok is named for a lesser known Knight of the Round Table from Arthurian legend who is turned into a werewolf br The first season ends with Ahsoka and Sabine trapped in the new galaxy Thrawn and Ezra returning to the original Star Wars galaxy and Baylan discovering large statues of the Mortis gods powerful Force wielders introduced in The Clone Wars Filoni hoped the statues would still be a striking image for viewers who had not seen The Clone Wars He had ideas for continuing the story but if that did not happen he was at least happy to have Ezra return by the end of the season as that was an important milestone for him In the last scene of the season Anakin appears as a Force ghost watching over Ahsoka and Sabine Filoni said Anakin was always watching over Ahsoka but she was not able to see him until her transformation in the fifth episode This scene depicts the season s master and apprentices theme by featuring three generations of Jedi Anakin Ahsoka and Sabine in one shot br br br Casting br br Rosario Dawson was confirmed to be reprising her role as Ahsoka Tano from The Mandalorian with the series announcement in December Dawson took over from Ashley Eckstein who voiced Ahsoka in the animated series In July Dawson acknowledged rumors that Ezra Bridger and Thrawn would be in the series By the following month Lucasfilm was looking for an actress to co star in the series as Sabine Wren who was voiced by Tiya Sircar in Rebels In October Christensen was set to reprise his role as Anakin reportedly appearing as a Force ghost due to the series being set after the character s death Natasha Liu Bordizzo was cast as Sabine a month later when Ivanna Sakhno joined the cast Mary Elizabeth Winstead was added to the cast in January and Ray Stevenson joined the next month to play an antagonist other than Thrawn Stevenson previously voiced Gar Saxon in Rebels and The Clone Wars br At Star Wars Celebration Anaheim in May Bordizzo was officially announced as Sabine The characters Hera and Chopper were also confirmed to be returning from Rebels Bordizzo auditioned for the series with a scene from Top Gun and another scene that reminded her of Star Wars character Han Solo Not knowing what the project was she assumed it was related to Marvel Studios because casting director Sarah Halley Finn is also known for working with that company Bordizzo was surprised to get an offer to star in the series based directly on her self tape audition with no callbacks or additional audition stages Favreau later said he preferred to streamline the casting process as much as possible following his own acting experiences br In September Eman Esfandi was cast as Ezra who was voiced by Taylor Gray in Rebels Esfandi was not a Star Wars fan but felt confident that he was the right person to portray Ezra and said so to his agent and manager six months before being asked to audition He researched the character online as if Ezra was a real historical figure and chose not to watch Rebels because he did not want to be too hokey about trying to copy a certain physicality and mannerisms from an animated series Esfandi auditioned for the character codenamed Riz using the same Top Gun scene that Bordizzo auditioned with He deduced that the audition was for Ezra and felt he had captured the character in his performance Similar to Bordizzo Esfandi was offered the role a day later based solely on his self tape Mena Massoud also auditioned to play Ezra after being suggested for the role by fans and being rumored to be cast as the character for over a year br Winstead was revealed to be portraying Hera at Star Wars Celebration London in April replacing Rebels voice actress Vanessa Marshall Winstead joined the series after her husband Ewan McGregor reprised his role as Obi Wan Kenobi from the prequel films in his own Disney series She said it was a luxury to be able to refer to Rebels when developing her portrayal Also at Celebration London the names of the antagonists that Sakhno and Stevenson play were revealed to be Shin Hati and Baylan Skoll respectively while several actors were announced to be reprising their roles from previous Star Wars projects Inosanto returned as Morgan Elsbeth from The Mandalorian Genevieve O Reilly reprised her role as Mon Mothma from the films and the series Andor David Tennant again voiced the droid Huyang as he did in The Clone Wars and Lars Mikkelsen reprised his role as Thrawn from Rebels Filoni first hinted to Mikkelsen that he could reprise his role in live action when the actor finished his voice work for Rebels but it was not until a year and a half later when Filoni contacted him about appearing in Ahsoka Mikkelsen s role in the series was kept a secret until it could be announced at Celebration London with Mikkelsen repeatedly denying his involvement before the reveal br Later in April Wes Chatham was revealed to be appearing as Thrawn s right hand man Captain Enoch The third episode introduces Evan Whitten as Jacen Syndulla the son of Hera and Kanan For flashbacks to the Clone Wars in the fifth episode Ariana Greenblatt portrays a young Ahsoka and Temuera Morrison voices Captain Rex reprising his role as the clone troopers from the Star Wars films In the seventh episode Anthony Daniels reprises his Star Wars film and television role as the droid C PO Additionally Paul Sun Hyung Lee reprises his role as Captain Carson Teva from The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett and the Mandalorian s on set double from those series Brendan Wayne appears as Lieutenant Lander Clancy Brown portrays Ryder Azadi reprising his voice role from Rebels while Vinny Thomas appears as Jai Kell who was voiced by Dante Basco in Rebels Nelson Lee plays Senator Hamato Xiono who was introduced in the animated series Star Wars Resistance voiced by Tzi Ma and Elden Bennett appears as Star Wars film character Admiral Ackbar Sam Witwer who has voiced numerous characters in various Star Wars projects provided additional voices for the series while Filoni provided the voice for Chopper as he did in Rebels br Rebels character Zeb was introduced to the live action series with a brief appearance in the third season of The Mandalorian created through motion capture and visual effects with Rebels voice actor Steve Blum reprising his role Zeb was subsequently not included in the first season of Ahsoka Lyvie Scott at Inverse speculated that this was due to the visual effects requirements for the character and felt his Mandalorian appearance was being used to explain his absence in Ahsoka Kanan was also not brought back from Rebels because of the character s death but an edited picture of voice actor Freddie Prinze Jr was used as an on set picture of Kanan br br br Design br Production designers Andrew L Jones and Doug Chiang returned from The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett as did costume designer Shawna Trpcic who died soon after the first season was released Prop master Josh Roth was responsible for the lightsabers As with the previous live action Star Wars series the lightsaber hilts were connected to glowing tubes to create on set interactive lighting Filoni felt some of the previous series had taken the lightsaber brightness too far and wanted the light levels in Ahsoka to be closer to those in the Star Wars films He designed Ahsoka s lightsaber hilts to be slimmer than the others comparing them to shoto and katana but this led to issues fitting the batteries for the interactive lighting inside the hilt The solution for The Mandalorian was to hide the batteries in Dawson s sleeves but this was not practical for Ahsoka considering the amount of fighting the character does throughout the series They were able to improve the technology so the batteries would fit inside the slimmer hilts instead The lightsaber blades for Baylan and Shin are more orange than the red that is traditionally used for Star Wars antagonists which Filoni said was an indication that the characters are not strictly villains Their color is based on the way Darth Vader s lightsaber would fluctuate between red and orange in some scenes of the original Star Wars films due to the older visual effects being used Stevenson requested adjustments to Baylan s lightsaber hilt based on his understanding of the character br br Filoni said all elements of the animated characters appearances were considered to an unbelievable degree when translating them into live action Ahsoka has orange skin white markings on her face and blue and white montrals horns and lekku head tails Filoni wanted her skin to look natural and less saturated than in the animated series and wanted the white markings to be subtle and not look like face paint He told Dawson not to worry about her brown eyes differing from Ahsoka s blue eyes but Dawson chose to wear colored contact lenses which she felt made the difference between wearing cosplay versus actually portraying the character She was disappointed to see that the prosthetic montrals and lekku were much shorter than their animated series look but accepted Filoni s explanation that this was needed to accommodate for her fighting and stunts New technology was developed for the series to create the montrals and lekku allowing them to be bigger and move more realistically than in The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett Dawson called it a d printed skull cap with an internal skeleton to give the lekku more fluid movement It was difficult applying the prosthetics around Dawson s long hair in the previous series so she considered shaving her head for Ahsoka but ultimately decided to just cut her hair shorter It took more than three hours to apply Dawson s make up and prosthetics for the previous series but the team got this down to minutes for Ahsoka Hera has green skin and lekku which took around three hours to apply to Winstead in the initial test This was eventually reduced to an hour which Winstead noted was a normal amount of time to get make up applied for a series Thrawn has blue skin and red eyes and Mikkelsen spent two to three hours in make up each day Filoni said there was a long process selecting the correct shades of orange green and blue so the characters had a sense of blood and skin He praised the actors for committing to the extra time required for make up and prosthetics to portray the characters br In Rebels Sabine is known for frequently changing her hair color and style She begins Ahsoka with long hair that Filoni wanted to start purple and transition to orange She then cuts her hair to be short and purple Hair designer Maria Sandoval wanted these colors to be more muted than in the animated series but said they were still bold enough that it would be a chemical impossibility for Bordizzo s hair to hold the color for the duration of filming She instead decided to use hair dye for an initial long wig and then fabric dye for a shorter wig after the character cuts her hair Sandoval s team spent two months testing different dyes to get the colors right An in between wig was created for the scene where Sabine cuts her hair while duplicates of the shorter wig were created for Bordizza s stunt double and for scenes where Sabine is wearing her helmet The short wig is not as short as Sabine s hair in Rebels with Sandoval prioritizing comfort and femininity for Bordizzo Inosanto s first scene in the series uses the same wig as The Mandalorian but Sandoval updated the character s hair for subsequent scenes in Ahsoka The new look combines the existing silvery gray color which was inspired by previous depictions of the Nightsisters with a new style that Sandoval described as a cross between the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland and Lady Tremaine from Cinderella Thrawn s black hair is a wig because Mikkelsen did not have the right hairline for the character Sandoval added some gray hairs to reflect the difficult environment Thrawn has been in since the end of Rebels but kept his hair looking composed because the character would not let himself appear shaggy Sandoval closely studied Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith to replicate Christensen s mullet hairstyle from that film For the Clone Wars flashbacks she wanted to show what Christensen s hair would realistically look like if it grew from its appearance in Attack of the Clones to the Revenge of the Sith look rather than directly adapt the straighter and sort of chunkier style seen in The Clone Wars br Legacy Effects returned from The Mandalorian to create puppets and animatronics for the series including Sabine s loth cat a cat like creature native to the planet Lothal Huyang and Chopper were also created as animatronics The series prominently features the purrgil also known as space whales from Rebels after they made a brief appearance in the third season of The Mandalorian New creatures introduced on Peridea include howlers reptilian wolf horse hybrids and the bug like Noti people who have shells that can be mistaken for rocks Creatures called howlers with a more reptilian design previously appeared in the Star Wars Jedi Knight EU video games Unlike previous live action Star Wars series this series begins with an opening crawl similar to the ones that are reserved for the start of the main Star Wars films The crawl for Ahsoka is differentiated from the films by red text and simpler formatting The end credits sequence is inspired by the star map and its planetarium like projections The sequence follows a gold line as it moves between different planets and star systems from throughout the Star Wars franchise including Lothal and Mandalore It ends with multiple gold lines converging on Peridea Stylized loth wolves and purrgil are shown around Lothal and Seatos respectively br br br Filming br The series is produced with visual effects studio Industrial Light Magic s StageCraft virtual production technology which was developed for The Mandalorian This involves filming on a volume set surrounded by a circular LED video wall that digital backgrounds can be displayed on in real time With his experience using virtual production on The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett Filoni felt he had a good handle on when the technology was right to be used and when traditional blue screen stages or outdoor locations needed to be used instead Filoni s approach to filmmaking based on his background in animation production was to previsualize each episode ahead of time so he could see and work on a version of them before filming began Filoni the other directors and cinematographers Eric Steelberg and Quyen Tran spent eight months creating and editing previsualizations of each episode using virtual reality cameras and headsets The first table reads with the cast were recorded and added to the previsualizations which Dawson described as mini episodes br The directors and cinematographers discussed the approaches to The Mandalorian The Book of Boba Fett and Obi Wan Kenobi so Ahsoka could feel like it takes place in the same universe as those series but also stand apart Steelberg s main influences were the original Star Wars film trilogy but he also discussed the works of Kurosawa with Filoni The flashbacks to the Clone Wars in the fifth episode were filmed with smoke effects and red lights to create a more abstract feeling which Filoni was inspired for by the Kurosawa film Kagemusha There were elements of Rebels that they wanted to replicate including the shot for shot recreation of that series epilogue for the end of the second episode A lot of testing was done to ensure the different colored make up and hair would show correctly on camera especially when different colored characters are together br Principal photography began on May at Manhattan Beach Studios in Los Angeles California Filming took place under the working title Stormcrow which is a reference to Gandalf the Grey from The Lord of the Rings Production took place on the different directors episodes simultaneously with two full crews working at the same time on some days Tennant s pre recorded dialogue was played on set for the other actors to perform against Dawson s favorite day of filming was when Ahsoka voice actress Ashley Eckstein visited the set Ming Qiu a stunt performer on The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett was the stunt coordinator for the series Dawson Bordizzo and Esfandi spent months training for their lightsaber fights Each fight was planned to further the story and character development Filoni wanted Baylan s fighting style to be like a medieval knight wielding his lightsaber like a claymore Ramsey felt this suited Stevenson s physicality and differentiated him from the Jedi characters Inosanto the daughter and goddaughter of famous martial artists and actors Dan Inosanto and Bruce Lee respectively was hired for The Mandalorian because of her martial arts background specifically to fight Dawson s Ahsoka She said there was a long involved fight scene between the two characters in Ahsoka Filming for some scenes on Peridea took place on outside stages while the planet s landscapes were created using footage from the Coigach and Assynt areas of Scotland The last shot of the series for Esfandi was filmed on the second last day of production Esfandi who grew a beard to portray Ezra in exile waited until the end of the shoot and receiving confirmation that he was not needed for reshoots before shaving his beard to portray a younger Ezra He was filmed against a green screen to be added as an old hologram that Sabine watches Filming lasted six months and wrapped in October br Filming for the second season is scheduled to begin in late br br br Music br At Star Wars Celebration London in April Kevin Kiner was revealed to be composing the score for Ahsoka after previously doing so for The Clone Wars Rebels The Bad Batch and Tales of the Jedi As with the animated series Kiner collaborated with his children Sean and Deana on the score and said it would have been impossible to create the five hours of music required for the first season on his own David Glen Russell also provided additional music After composing more music for the franchise than any other composer working on over television episodes across more than years Kevin said it was still a challenge to balance honoring Star Wars film composer John Williams with not directly copying him They did use some of Williams s themes from the films for specific moments including the Force theme the themes for Anakin and Darth Vader and both the main Star Wars fanfare and Princess Leia s theme for the C PO scene They also studied the composers who inspired Williams including Erich Wolfgang Korngold Sergei Rachmaninoff and Igor Stravinsky br The first theme Kevin wrote for Star Wars was Ahsoka s theme which he had used for all of the character s appearances since the start of The Clone Wars For Tales of the Jedi which Filoni wanted to be an homage to the works of Studio Ghibli and other Japanese cinema Sean and Deana created a new variation of Ahsoka s theme inspired by the music of samurai films They said this was Ahsoka s r nin motif which combines a pulsing cello with Kevin s original Ahsoka melody Kevin felt this variation of the theme fit well with Dawson s more mature portrayal of Ahsoka and they expanded on the idea as well as the Japanese influences for Ahsoka They also brought back their themes from Rebels including for Sabine Hera Ezra and Thrawn Filoni encouraged them not to use the themes as often as they initially wanted to because he felt the music was getting in the way of some scenes For example when Thrawn arrives in the sixth episode the Kiners originally intended to use a full rendition of his theme which is played on an organ Filoni felt this was the wrong approach due to the character being in a different state compared to his role in Rebels He also wanted to have a scarier introduction for viewers who did not see Rebels Trying to match the visuals of Thrawn s dilapidated Star Destroyer and army the composers slowed down the music distorted the organ sounds and made the score more atmospheric For the flashbacks to the Clone Wars in the fifth episode the Kiners included references to their synthesizer music from the final season of The Clone Wars including the track Burying the Dead Sean used the Chinese guzheng string instrument to represent the metaphysical elements of the World Between Worlds br br New themes for the series represent Baylan Shin Morgan and the Nightsister witches and the New Republic Baylan s theme prominently features the piano which is rare for Star Wars music and was inspired by Rachmaninoff The melody is a variation on the medieval chant Dies irae but played by an orchestra with a heavy metal sensibility The Kiners were particularly happy with the musical interactions between the themes for Baylan and Shin The New Republic theme is more similar to Williams s style of music and primarily has a positive sound but the composers also included some subtle darkness to foreshadow the fall of the New Republic later in the franchise s timeline They originally planned to have different music over the end credits of each episode but found this to be impractical Instead the end credits track combines different themes for the series into one starting with the r nin variation of Ahsoka s theme Inspired by the imagery of the end credits sequence the composers wrote a new celestial motif that is included in the track Feeling this was too good to just have in the credits it became a recurring motif in the score It is used for scenes with the purrgil and for the star map that points to the new galaxy Each episode s opening title card is accompanied by a different flute performance by Deana who learned to play various flutes for the series An alto flute is used for scenes with the howler br The orchestra was recorded on the Newman Scoring Stage at Fox Studios in Los Angeles This was a change from the animated series which were recorded overseas and allowed the composers to interact with the musicians as episodes were being recorded They incorporated feedback from the musicians for early episodes when composing the score for later episodes The in universe song Igyah Kah that Sabine listens to in the first episode was co written by Kevin and Deana Kiner Noah Gorelick and The Mandalorian composer Ludwig G ransson The composers initially tried to make the song sound alien before realizing that it just needed to be a banger with a punk rock style Filoni encouraged them to really go for it with the song and G ransson suggested that Sabine s theme be incorporated into it The lyrics of the song are influenced by the Tagalog language which is spoken by Kevin Kiner s wife who is from the Philippines The vocals were provided by Sarah Tudzin from the band Illuminati Hotties who Deana is friends with and had played on tour alongside br Walt Disney Records released two soundtrack albums featuring the first season s score the first volume covering music from the first four episodes including the song Igyah Kah was
