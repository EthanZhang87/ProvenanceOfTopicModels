The Ewoks singular Ewok are a fictional species of small furry mammaloid bipeds in the Star Wars universe They inhabit the forest moon of Endor and live in arboreal huts and other simple dwellings being seen as primitive in comparison with other sentient species Ewoks debuted in the feature film Return of the Jedi and have since appeared in two made for television films The Ewok Adventure and Ewoks The Battle for Endor as well as a D animated series several books and games and briefly in the feature film Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker br br br Concept and creation br George Lucas created the Ewoks because he wanted Return of the Jedi to feature a tribe of primitive creatures that bring down the technological Empire He had originally intended the scenes to be set on the Wookiee home planet but as the film series evolved the Wookiees became technologically skilled Lucas reversed the syllables to designate a new species which rhymes with the Miwok a Native American tribe indigenous to the Redwood forest in which the Endor scenes were filmed for Return of the Jedi He also based the Ewoks defeat of the Galactic Empire on the actions of the Viet Cong guerrillas who fought against American soldiers during the Vietnam War br As Wookiees were tall Lucas wanted the new species short Using the image of the Griffon Bruxellois a dog breed which Lucas owned the Ewok was developed by renowned make up artist Stuart Freeborn As presented in the films Ewoks appear as stocky sapient bipeds which stand about one metre tall They have flat faces are completely covered in fur and have large jewel like eyes Both their fur and their eyes come in a variety of earth tones primarily brown white grey gold and black Only the costume of the Ewok portrayed by Warwick Davis had moving facial features though the Blu ray release of Return of the Jedi added eye blinks to all of the Ewoks Despite their small size Ewoks are strong in the climactic battle scene of the film they are shown physically overpowering and once even throwing Imperial stormtroopers though this detail is not consistent throughout the film Ewoks live high among the trees of their home moon s forests in villages built on platforms between the closely spaced trees br br br Ewokese language br An Ewokese language was created for the films by Return of the Jedi s sound designer Ben Burtt On the commentary track for the DVD of Return of the Jedi Burtt explains that the language is based on Kalmyk a Mongolic language spoken by the Kalmyk people of Russia Burtt heard the language in a documentary and liked its sound which seems very alien to Western ears After some research he identified an year old Kalmyk refugee Burtt recorded her telling folk stories in her native language and then used the recordings as a basis for sounds that became the Ewok language and were performed by voice actors who imitated the old woman s voice in different styles For the scene in which C PO speaks Ewokese actor Anthony Daniels worked with Burtt and invented words based on the Kalmyk recordings br Separately it has been reported that the speech of Ewoks in Return of the Jedi utilizes Nepalese and some sped up Tibetan phrases the latter oddly including the phrase there is lots of money here br br br Appearances br br br Return of the Jedi br br The Ewoks are involved in a large portion of the final installment in

canon Ewoks themed comic spun off from Return of the Jedi is scheduled for release in April br br br Reception br The Ewoks are seen to be a controversial element of Return of the Jedi and the Star Wars universe in general and are seen by some to be the weakest part of the original trilogy According to Tami Katzoff of MTV News a prevailing theory among Ewok haters is that the creatures were originally conceived as a sure way to appeal to small children and sell plush toys to their parents Others enjoy the Ewoks and they have proven to be very popular with children from their introduction
