developing a spin off film focusing Ewan McGregor s Obi Wan Kenobi from the prequel trilogy However following the project s cancellation due to the financial failure of Solo A Star Wars Story McGregor entered negotiations to star in a six episode Disney limited series centered around Kenobi The series was officially announced by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy at the D event Deborah Chow was hired to direct all episodes for the series by September while Joby Harold became the head writer and showrunner in April following Kennedy s disapproval with the scripts and subsequent rewrites The series is executive produced by Harold Chow McGregor Kennedy and Michelle Rejwan Chow and Harold wanted the series to be a character study for Kenobi and worked to connect elements from the prequel trilogy and original trilogy Harold wanted to further explore Kenobi s character following the events of Order and wanted him to deal with issues from his past Chow also took inspirations from gritty poetic westerns including The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford The Proposition and the works of Akira Kurosawa br br br Writing br Various story elements in the episode were conceived by Stuart Beattie and Hossein Amini when they were developing the film A new planet Daiyu is introduced in the episode Chow had felt that it had a grittiness and energy to it but that is sort of weird and a bit shady while Harold described it as having a graffiti ridden nightlife and being kind of edgy It s just got a different lane and a different feeling He also added that its visual aesthetic was inspired by Hong Kong Harold had originally conceived that the series would take place across multiple planets as he had felt it was a core element of Star Wars He chose to include Haja Estree as he felt that Kenobi needed an informant while on Daiyu He said I needed somebody that Obi Wan can get information out of but that s very boring if it s just somebody beating up in an alley and chose to create Haja as a con man who pretends to be a Jedi br He was inspired by films such as Paper Moon and Midnight Run when writing Leia and Kenobi s scenes together The episode features Kenobi using the Force for the first time since his self exile on Tatooine Harold stated that Kenobi did not use the Force or his lightsaber prior to this as it would draw attention to himself He further elaborated that He s habitually gotten to the place where that s in his past for now So we deliberately didn t see him use it effectively until that moment because it should be a moment He shouldn t just grab his cup of coffee in the morning And he would only do it for something that s important as that That needed to be the first step He has to wrap his arms around who he is And it s a great metaphor for who he is his relationship to the Force and his ability to use it Meanwhile Morrison described his appearance as a homeless clone trooper as representing all that clone army that are no longer around anymore br While writing the script Harold adhered to Star Wars canon and consulted with Pablo Hidalgo on whether or not Kenobi knew Vader s identity saying it all comes down to is it viable within canon to play that card Which it was Which is great because that allows you at the end of Episode and the beginning of Episode it gets you so much that feels essential to the fundamental story which is Obi Wan Vader that which haunts you facing the past He chose to include the scene where Kenobi learns that Darth Vader is alive at the end of the episode as he wanted to slow everything down really be patient and really build who Obi Wan was and then introduce the notion that he s out there to then play it and then end on him saying Anakin That word is very seismic to him by then in the audience s minds because they sat with him for those two episodes opting to focus on McGregor s performance in the scene as he felt it makes the storytelling very active for the audience because they get to see it being played out on Ewan s face br br br Casting br The episode stars Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi and features co stars Kumail Nanjiani as Haja Estree M rise lvarez as Nyche Horn Flea as Vect Nokru Moses Ingram as Reva Sevander Third Sister Vivien Lyra Blair as Princess Leia Rupert Friend as the Grand Inquisitor Sung Kang as the Fifth Brother Rya Kihlstedt as the Fourth Sister and Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker Darth Vader Also appearing are Temuera Morrison as a veteran clone trooper and Esther Rose McGregor as Tetha Grig br br br Design br Production designer Doug Chiang and Chow incorporated aesthetics from Asian art and culture when designing Daiyu Chow had used pictures of various brocaded Asian fabrics for reference with Chiang describing it as this really rich jade green mixed with very wonderful maroon red And the combination of those two color palettes along with the texture of the fabric created an interesting visual identity A drug lab was also included on the planet as Harold felt Daiyu represented the underbelly within the Star Wars world and felt including realistic elements would make the series a little more tangible for the audience They chose to design it as a methane lab as they felt it had matched the tone of the series and other designs would be more expensive br The episode depicts Kenobi using the fictional wupiupi currency Propmaster Brad Elliott had consulted with Hidalgo while designing the currency He used an image from Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace and the Turkish Yuzluk a coin currency used during the Ottoman Empire as references It was originally depicted in The Phantom Menace while the Yuzluk was a source of inspiration for the original design The prop team had decreased the size of the wupiupi while keeping its original art as Chow was worried about its size due to the swift hand to hand transactions depicted br br br Filming br Principal photography began on May on the annual Star Wars Day celebration with Deborah Chow directing and Chung hoon Chung serving as cinematographer The series had used the StageCraft video wall technology provided by Industrial Light Magic ILM Filming had taken place in The Volume set the soundstage in which the StageCraft technology is implemented at the Manhattan Beach Studios Morrison had filmed his scene for the episode while shooting The Book of Boba Fett as the two series production locations were next to each other making his appearance possible br Visual effects for the episode were created by ILM Hybride Image Engine Important Looking Pirates Soho VFX W t FX Blind LTD and ReDefine br br br Music br Natalie Holt was hired as composer for the series making her the first woman to score a live action Star Wars project while John Williams composed the Obi Wan Theme Holt sought to make each planet in the series feel like its own character She described Daiyu as being more like those Asian night markets with sounds like Indonesian gamelan and dulcimer as well which you wouldn t usually hear together and composed the score for Daiyu using a rhythm She chose the rhythm as she thought it feels like it never quite lands which symbolized Kenobi s presence in the planet saying it felt like it was drawing Obi into Daiyu and into the mystery of the planet and he can t find his feet there br br br Marketing br Prior to the episode s release merchandise inspired by the episode as part of the Obi Wan Wednesdays promotion for each episode of the series was revealed including Funko Pops Hasbro Jazwares Lego sets and Mattel toys for Reva Kenobi and Darth Vader The first two episodes of the series were shown at an advanced screening at the Star Wars Celebration alongside a live performance of the series main theme

reports an approval rating with an average rating of based on reviews The site s critical consensus reads Obi Wan Kenobi steps up the pace by thrusting the reluctant hero into a fairly exciting rescue mission in an urban underbelly that is oh so uncivilized br From Total Film Bradley Russell gave the episode out of stars While he felt it was inferior to the first episode he praised Nanjiani s performance McGregor and Blair s chemistry and the overall visual aesthetic of Daiyu feeling that it was inspired by Blade Runner However he expressed some criticism with the scene when Leia runs away from Kenobi saying it is contrived you can almost feel the writers contorting themselves into pretzel shaped knots trying to figure out an organic way for the duo to be separated as the Inquisitors close in At Collider Maggie Lovvit gave the episode an A grade praising Blair s performance writing she embodies the sassy headstrong and determined Princess Leia we have come to know and love from the late and great Carrie Fisher She also highlighted Chow s direction and felt that Kenobi s adventure on Daiyu was reminiscent of the misadventures he and Anakin once got up to on Coruscant Both Stuart Heritage from The Guardian and Stephen Kelly from BBC Culture compared the series to John Wick Heritage who gave the first two episodes out of stars praised the episode s action sequences while Kelly enjoyed Kenobi and Leia s dynamic in the episode though he felt that Harold s script for the episode was inferior to that of the first br Vulture s Jesse Hassenger giving the episode a out of rating also praised the visuals of Daiyu but felt that it was hampered by the limitations of the Star Wars series signature StageCraft virtual effects He was mixed toward the character of Haja Estree opining that while Nanjiani s performance is both amusing and a reminder that these new Star Wars shows are written by pro screenwriters he felt that Haja s dialogue with Leia was too reminiscient of Lucas s in the original Star Wars films which he did not like He also was neutral towards Reva s character saying she was less than fully formed and still sounding decidedly unthreatening when she yells threats He also opined that Kenobi s relationship with Leia was too similar to that of Din Djarin and Grogu s in The Mandalorian Ben Lindbergh of The Ringer called the episode a merciful change of setting but also an improvement in pace from the first episode He likened Kenobi s character in the episode as being more similar to the detective Obi Wan of Episode II rather than the reclusive Obi Wan of Episode IV He also praised Nanjiani s performance and called Haja one of the cleverest characters created for a Disney Star Wars series to date and Blair s performance Highlighting the ending of the episode he felt it was the moment we were waiting for the one where Obi Wan learns that his nightmares can extend to his waking life too and lauded McGregor s performance in the final
