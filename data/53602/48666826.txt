confirmed to return to compose the sequel trilogy beginning with The Force Awakens br The music from the first two trailers for the film was reworked from earlier compositions Williams began working on the score in December and by June he had been through most of the film reels working on a daily basis In May Williams said he would reuse themes from the previous films such as those for Luke Leia and Han in ways that will seem very natural and right in the moments for which we ve chosen to do these kinds of quotes There aren t many of them but there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way He said that working with J J Abrams was similar to the process he went through with George Lucas in the earlier films br Recording sessions for The Force Awakens began on June at the Sony Pictures Studios Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City with William Ross conducting most of the music Williams attended the sessions and conducted the remainder of the recordings He called the recording process very luxurious with sessions scattered over a five month period between June and November The score was recorded by a freelance orchestra making it the first live action Star Wars soundtrack not to feature the London Symphony Orchestra with sessions continuing on and off over that five month period The piece orchestra recorded minutes of music although nearly an hour of that was discarded modified or rerecorded as Abrams re edited the film The theme for Snoke was recorded by a voice men s chorus Gustavo Dudamel conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams behest The last recording session took place on November br Leading up to the release of The Force Awakens multiple music streaming services began offering users Star Wars themed playlists Streaming platforms didn t exist for the previous movies so that s something that we ll be rolling out along with character driven playlists with sounds and dialogue from the movie said Ken Bunt president of the Disney Music Group People love to hear dialogue and sound effects so we re working on some ideas now that will incorporate some of that into playlisting Upon its release the soundtrack for The Force Awakens became available to stream via Spotify br br br Reception br br The musical score has received critical acclaim James Southall of Movie Wave said The new themes are great hearing the old ones again is wonderful the action music is remarkably energetic and the musical storytelling as vibrant as ever It s just so good hearing Williams return to this universe J rn Tillnes of Soundtrack Geek said The fact is that this score is not even close to the classic trilogy and it struggles with the prequel trilogy as well I don t know if it s the weakest in the saga Time will tell What I do know is that it s one of the best scores I ve heard in a while uDiscover gave the score a positive review saying The expansive dramatic passages are as full bodied as one would hope for a film as epic as The Force Awakens but the attention to detail within the score and the exquisitely recorded performance make the results a subtle and engaging listen br Jonathan Broxton of Movie Music UK praised the score saying Even when you look at it objectively what John Williams has achieved with this score is nothing short of remarkable He has written five new themes two of which Rey s Theme and the March of the Resistance are wonderfully memorable and can stand shoulder to shoulder with the already bulging cache of memorable themes within the Star Wars universe br It was nominated for Best Original Score category at th Academy Awards and lost to Ennio Morricone s score for The Hateful Eight br br br Commercial performance br The soundtrack debuted at number five on the Billboard chart for the week ending November with album equivalent units of which were pure album sales It
