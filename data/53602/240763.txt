planet called Alderaan a city planet and the capital planet of the galaxy In Lucas s draft Adventures of the Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills Saga I The Star Wars the capital planet of Alderaan is described as a floating city in the clouds suspended in a sea of cirrus methane This concept was illustrated in early sketches commissioned by Lucas from conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie and the design very closely resembles Cloud City the floating city featured in The Empire Strikes Back In Lucas s third draft the Imperial City of Alderaan became the homeworld of the Sith Lords where Darth Vader held Princess Leia captive Lucas continued to hone his script aided by screenwriters Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz By the fourth draft scenes on the Imperial capital planet had been moved to a space station called the Death Star and the name of Alderaan was given to a peaceful world destroyed by the Empire br The Empire s homeworld Had Abbadon came up in early drafts of Return of the Jedi The entire planet was to be a sprawling city However concluding that the realization of such a city was impossible at the time the creators abandoned the idea Later in the graphic novel Legacy Vector Part the name Had Abbadon was given to a lost mythic planet in the Had Abbadon System of the Deep Core This mythic planet was covered by dry fields linked to the birth of the Jedi

original concept art The appearance of the cityscape has been described as a retro futuristic metropolis and the streams of floating vehicles traveling between soaring skyscrapers is thought to have
