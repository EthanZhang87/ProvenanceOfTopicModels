when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director although this is disputed by Eastwood s unauthorized biographer Patrick McGilligan According to Eastwood s official biography the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood While in Los Angeles Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak him into a Universal studio where he introduced him to cameraman Irving Glassberg Glassberg arranged for an audition under Arthur Lubin who although very impressed with Eastwood s appearance and stature then ft in cm disapproved of his acting remarking He was quite amateurish He didn t know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood s initial contract in April at per week After signing Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth a lifelong trademark br In May Eastwood made his first real audition for Six Bridges to Cross but was rejected by Joseph Pevney After many unsuccessful auditions he was eventually given a minor role by director Jack Arnold in Revenge of the Creature a sequel to the recently released Creature from the Black Lagoon In September Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubin s Lady Godiva of Coventry won a role in February

that Eastwood considers the low point of his career br br In Eastwood was cast as Rowdy Yates in the CBS hour long western series Rawhide the career breakthrough he had long sought Eastwood was not especially happy with his character Eastwood was almost and Rowdy was too young and cloddish for his comfort Filming began in Arizona in the summer of It took just three weeks for Rawhide to reach the top in TV ratings and although it never won an Emmy it was a major success for several years and peaked at number six in the ratings from October to April The Rawhide years were some of the most grueling of Eastwood s career often filming six days a week for an average of hours a day but some directors still criticized him for not working hard enough By late Rawhide was beginning to decline in the ratings and lacked freshness in the scripts it was canceled in the middle of the season Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show but was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode In the show s first season Eastwood earned an episode At the time of Rawhide s cancellation he received an episode as severance pay br br br spaghetti Westerns and stardom br In late Eastwood s Rawhide co star Eric Fleming rejected an offer to star in an Italian made western called A Fistful of Dollars filmed in a remote region of Spain by

opportunity to escape from his Rawhide image He signed a contract for in wages for eleven weeks work with a bonus of a Mercedes Benz automobile upon completion Eastwood later said of the transition from a TV western to A Fistful of Dollars In Rawhide I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody I decided it was time to be an antihero Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name character s distinctive visual style and although a non smoker Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the mask he was attempting to create for the character br A Fistful of Dollars proved a landmark in the development of spaghetti Westerns with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero The film s success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was rehired to star in For a Few Dollars More the second of the trilogy Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the trilogy s final film The Good the Bad and the Ugly were sold to United Artists for about br In January Eastwood met producer Dino De Laurentiis in New York City and agreed to star in a non Western five part anthology production The Witches Le

quite so un Clintlike br Two months later Eastwood began work on The Good the Bad and the Ugly again playing the mysterious Man with No Name Lee Van Cleef returned as a ruthless fortune seeker with Eli Wallach portraying the Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez The storyline involved the search for a cache of Confederate gold buried in a cemetery During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop I know about these things he said Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can Minutes later confusion among the crew over the word Vaya resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed Wallach br br I wanted to play it with an economy of words and create this whole feeling through attitude and movement It was just the kind of character I had envisioned for a long time keep to the mystery and allude to what happened in the past It came about after the frustration of doing Rawhide for so long I felt the less he said the stronger he became and the more he grew in the imagination of the audience br br The Dollars trilogy was not released in the United States until when A Fistful of Dollars opened on January followed by For a Few Dollars More on May and The Good the Bad and the Ugly on December All three were commercially successful particularly The Good the Bad and the Ugly which eventually earned million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star being ranked for the first time on Quigley s Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll in in fifth place All three received poor reviews and marked the beginning of a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics respect Judith Crist described A Fistful of Dollars as cheapjack while Newsweek called For a Few Dollars More excruciatingly dopey Renata Adler of The New York Times said The Good the Bad and the Ugly was the most expensive pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre Time magazine drew attention to the film s wooden acting especially Eastwood s though a few critics such as Vincent Canby and Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised his coolness Leone s cinematography was widely acclaimed even by critics who disparaged the acting br Stardom brought Eastwood more roles He signed to star in the American revisionist western Hang Em High alongside Inger Stevens Pat Hingle Dennis Hopper Ed Begley

inspector named Harry Callahan who is determined to stop a psychotic killer by any means Dirty Harry has been described as being arguably Eastwood s most memorable character and the film has been credited with inventing the loose cannon cop genre Author Eric Lichtenfeld argues that Eastwood s role as Dirty Harry established the first true archetype of the action film genre His lines quoted

Smith Wesson Model carried by Harry Callahan Dirty Harry released in December earned million in the United States and Canada It was Siegel s highest grossing film and the start of a series of films

Holes in the plot were filled with black humor and allegory influenced by Leone The revisionist film received a mixed reception but was a major box office success A number of critics thought Eastwood s directing was as derivative as it was expressive with Arthur Knight of the Saturday Review remarking that Eastwood had absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society John Wayne who had declined a role in the film sent a letter to Eastwood soon after the film s release in which he complained that The townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer the spirit that made America great br br Eastwood next turned his attention towards Breezy a film about love blossoming between a middle aged man and a teenage girl
