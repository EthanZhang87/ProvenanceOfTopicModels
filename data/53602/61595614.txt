Kenobi to face his traumatic past and guilty feelings br br br Episodes br br br Cast and characters br br br Starring br Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi A Jedi Master who survived Order and now lives in exile under the name Ben on the planet Tatooine watching over young Luke Skywalker McGregor was excited to play a version of the character closer to Alec Guinness s portrayal from the original Star Wars trilogy than his own younger version from the prequel trilogy with Kenobi beginning the series broken and faithless and beaten having somewhat given up Executive producer Michelle Rejwan described Kenobi as being in a pretty traumatic moment following his losses in Revenge of the Sith including his apprentice Anakin s fall to the dark side of the Force Kenobi left Anakin for dead on Mustafar at the end of the film and feels guilty for doing so with director Deborah Chow being intrigued by the idea that Kenobi might still care deeply for Anakin Head writer Joby Harold said the series would relate the very emotional version of Kenobi in the prequels to Alec Guinness s zen master in A New Hope McGregor was part of the conversations about Kenobi s characterization in the series and rewatched the Skywalker Saga films to prepare He also read science fiction novels including those written by Iain M Banks for the role br br br Recurring co stars br Rupert Friend as the Grand Inquisitor A member of the Pau an species from Utapau who is the highest ranking Inquisitor of the Galactic Empire He was once a member of the Jedi Order serving as a Jedi Temple Guard Friend

Inquisitor and Darth Vader A former Jedi Youngling she secretly plots revenge against Vader for killing her peers during Order Reva shares a common goal in being dedicated to finding Kenobi though she is open to using more impulsive tactics Harold believed Reva would contribute to the legacy of Star Wars villains in a really interesting way while Ingram described her as a full on athlete and a badass Ingram felt forgiveness was a central theme of her character and that Reva was motivated by trauma from the pain of her past adding if she could let it go or if she could at least cope better she wouldn t need to do the things that she s doing She also influenced Reva s appearance insisting that the character use her natural kinky hair rather than a wig so that African American children

not played the character since Christensen rewatched the Skywalker Saga films as well as the animated series Star Wars The Clone Wars and Rebels to prepare for the role He enjoyed seeing how the animated series had further explored the relationship between Anakin and Kenobi Christensen was excited to portray Darth Vader having primarily portrayed the character as Anakin Skywalker previously and discussed how to portray Vader s simultaneous strength and imprisonment with Chow he called Vader in the series very powerful While Christensen primarily portrays Vader Dmitrious Bistrevsky serves as the in suit performer for Vader while Tom O Connell served as the stunt double James Earl Jones s voice is used for Darth Vader as with previous Star Wars media but his lines in the series were

appearance br br br Production br br br Background br Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the development of several Star Wars standalone spin off films in February Obi Wan Kenobi was the overwhelming winner of a poll by The Hollywood Reporter in August that asked which Star Wars character deserved a spin off film Ewan McGregor who portrayed Kenobi in the Star Wars prequel trilogy had informally expressed willingness to reprise the role which led to a formal meeting with Lucasfilm so the company could gauge his interest in returning to the character for a spin off film Development on such a film soon began with Stephen Daldry entering talks to direct the project in August McGregor was set as a producer on the project Daldry was expected to oversee the development and writing with Lucasfilm and contacted Hossein Amini about writing the film Amini joined the project in late br In May the film was reportedly titled Obi Wan A Star Wars Story with a plot involving Kenobi protecting a young Luke Skywalker on the planet Tatooine during tensions between local farmers and Tusken Raiders Production on the film was expected to take place in Northern Ireland under the working title Joshua Tree beginning in at Paint Hall Studios in Belfast once production on the final season of Game of Thrones ended in late However Disney cancelled their planned Star Wars spin off films including the Kenobi film following the financial failure of Solo A Star Wars Story Lucasfilm s focus changed to making series for the streaming service Disney such as The Mandalorian In August McGregor said he had been asked about a Kenobi spin off for years and years and was happy to be involved but said there were no plans for such a film at that time He was interested in exploring the character in the time between his portrayal in the prequel films and that of Alec Guinness in the original trilogy and wanted to see the story of a man who s lost his faith that could show how his version who always has a funny line to say or always seems to be calm and is a good warrior becomes a broken man and has to get back together again to match Guinness s portrayal br br br Development br McGregor entered negotiations to star in a television series for Disney centered on Obi Wan Kenobi by mid August Later that month at Disney s D event Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and McGregor officially announced that the actor would be reprising his role as Kenobi in a new series for Disney set eight years after the events of Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith Filming was scheduled to begin in July and scripts for the six episode limited series had already been written by Amini at the time of the announcement McGregor said the announcement was a relief explaining that he had been lying about his involvement in a Kenobi spin off for four years A month later Kennedy announced that Deborah Chow would direct the Kenobi series after impressing Kennedy with her work directing episodes of The Mandalorian br In November Amini said the series time period was fascinating since Kenobi is dealing with the loss of his friends and the Jedi Order which allowed Amini to explore aspects of the Star Wars franchise other than action such as its spiritual side He took inspiration from the sources that Star Wars creator George Lucas was originally inspired by including Joseph Campbell s The Hero with a Thousand Faces Samurai history and culture and Buddhism Comparing the series scripts to his original film plans Amini said he was able to explore the character politics and history more in the series than in a two hour film where there is always an imperative for the action and the plot to move particularly fast Chow felt her work on The Mandalorian was the best training she could have for the Kenobi series learning from that series executive producers Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni br Pre production on the series was underway at Pinewood Studios in London by January and screen tests were taking place with potential actors opposite McGregor By the end of the month rumors began circulating that the series had been cancelled due to production problems While this was not the case the series was put on indefinite hold and the assembled crew was sent home Kennedy was said to be unhappy with the series scripts which reportedly featured a storyline similar to the story of The Mandalorian in which the title character protects The Child with Kenobi protecting a young Skywalker from various threats Chow had shown these scripts to Favreau and Filoni who expressed concern over the similarities to The Mandalorian and encouraged Chow and the series to go bigger Lucasfilm began looking for a new writer for the series to start over on the scripts with Chow still expected to direct Kennedy explained that they were hoping to have a hopeful uplifting story and said executing that would be tricky given the state that Kenobi is in after Revenge of the Sith She added You can t just wave the magic wand with any writer and arrive at a story that necessarily reflects what you want to feel The goal was for pre production to begin again in mid once the scripts had been rewritten The series was also reportedly being reworked from six episodes to four but McGregor said he did not believe this was the case He added that Lucasfilm had decided to spend more time working on the scripts following the release of Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker and filming had been postponed until January but he did not think this would impact the series planned release schedule br Joby Harold was hired to take over as writer from Amini in April and serve as showrunner That October filming was delayed until March due to the COVID pandemic At Disney s Investor Day event on December Kennedy announced that the series was officially titled Obi Wan Kenobi and confirmed that Chow was directing In February McGregor revealed that filming for the series would take place in Los Angeles rather than London and Boston Lincolnshire England as had previously been reported The series is executive produced by Kennedy Michelle Rejwan Chow McGregor and Harold and consists of six episodes br Obi Wan Kenobi was conceived as a limited series with Chow describing it as one big story with a beginning middle and end Despite this Kennedy said there was a chance that more of the series could be made due to the enjoyable time the cast and crew had creating it as long as there was a compelling story reason to return to the character with both McGregor and Christensen expressing interest in making another season In April Kennedy noted a second season was not considered an active development for Lucasfilm reiterating Chow and McGregor s interest in more and stating the company might return to the character and storyline down the road br br br Writing br According to Chow the story went through significant changes after Harold s hiring though some story elements conceived by Amini are included in the first three episodes and the finale with Amini and Stuart Beattie receiving writing credits for those Hannah Friedman and Andrew Stanton were additional writers on the series Harold wanted to explore what happened between McGregor s portrayal of Kenobi and that of Alec Guinness in the original trilogy and noted that the series takes place when the Empire is in the ascendancy and the Jedi have been wiped out with any remaining survivors being on the run and in hiding He stated that Kenobi s past particularly his relationship with Anakin makes him a man who s very much defined by that history whether he wants to be or not He added that a crucial part of Kenobi s journey will involve reconciling that past and coming to understand it and coming to understand his place in it and also the places he has to go emotionally as well as physically and some of those battles he has to fight which ultimately have to do with facing that past and understanding who he was his part in his own history in the history of others br Harold also chose to include Leia in the series as he felt that Kenobi would also look over Leia In writing her dialogue he wanted her to come across as spirited and not just a grown up writing for a kid and used the films Paper Moon and Midnight Run as inspiration for her interactions with Kenobi He also noted that the series recontextualizes moments in future chronological installments of the franchise such as providing additional context behind Leia s message to Kenobi in A New Hope and as such he completely focused on Obi Wan Kenobi being Episode between the original trilogy and the prequels as it had to marry the storytelling choices between those two trilogies and wanted it to feel like a natural link between the original and prequel trilogies Harold also clarified that the series would not break canon after speculation arose that it would deviate from it due to Reva stabbing the Grand Inquisitor in Part II with many fans presuming he was dead thus contradicting the events of Star Wars Rebels br Kennedy and Chow cautioned the writers against making any overt connections to The Mandalorian and its spin off series with Chow stating that the strongest connections between Obi Wan Kenobi and the rest of the Star Wars franchise were to the prequel films Chow wanted to be faithful to George Lucas s original vision for the franchise and worked to connect elements from the original trilogy and prequel trilogy She researched the Extended Universe in preparation for the series citing John Jackson Miller s novel Star Wars Kenobi as inspiration for establishing the tone but was not influenced by its plot and a Sideshow statue of Kenobi which served as a visual reference for Chow She also worked to make it a character driven story comparing this to films such as Logan and Joker saying that it was where you take one character out of a big franchise and then you really have the time and you go a lot deeper with the character Additional inspirations included gritty poetic westerns such as The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and The Proposition as well as the works of Akira Kurosawa She felt that there was a strong correlation between the Jedi and the Ronin with their ethical code that goes along with it in a world that s vastly changed A new planet introduced for the series is Daiyu which Harold compared to Hong Kong with a graffiti ridden nightlife it serves as a contrast to the desert planet Tatooine where much of the series takes place br Long discussions were held before it was decided to include Darth Vader in the series and Chow said this decision was not made lightly Anakin and Vader are a huge and very profound part of Kenobi s life We ended up feeling that he made sense in telling this story Chow had championed the idea of including Vader in the series when executives at Lucasfilm were unsure whether they should Similar to Kenobi s character in the show Chow stated that Vader s character isn t quite as fully formed as A New Hope and she added that Vader s appearance in the series re contextualizes the character s scene with Kenobi in A New Hope The series also features the live action introduction of Vader s Inquisitors who are tasked with hunting down the remaining Jedi after appearing in other Star Wars media The way that Vader appears in the series and the idea to introduce the Inquisitors were both suggested by Filoni The original scripts featured different villains including Darth Maul but Chow decided not to use him as she felt it would be a little bit much to have both Maul and Vader due to the large impact that the latter has on the story She also acknowledged that Filoni had already told the story of Kenobi and Maul in this time period in the animated series Star Wars Rebels br br br Casting br Along with the series announcement at D in August came confirmation that McGregor would star in the series reprising his role as Kenobi from the prequel trilogy By the time the production shut down in January Ray Park was preparing to reprise his role as Darth Maul and an actor had been cast to portray a young Luke Skywalker Both left the series after Maul was written out of the new scripts and production was delayed br Kennedy announced in December that Hayden Christensen would reprise his role from the prequel trilogy as Anakin Skywalker Darth Vader in the series Chow had met with Christensen at his farm in Canada in late to provide him an in person pitch for the series McGregor said reuniting with Christensen on the series was the most beautiful thing of all while Kennedy described it as the rematch of the century James Earl Jones was announced as reprising his franchise role as the voice of Darth Vader though his voice was generated by an AI program called Respeecher based on previous recordings of Jones voice In March Moses Ingram Kumail Nanjiani Indira Varma Rupert Friend O Shea Jackson Jr Sung Kang Simone Kessell and Benny Safdie joined the cast with Joel Edgerton and Bonnie Piesse reprising their roles as Owen Lars and Beru Whitesun Lars respectively from the prequel films Ingram was reported to be playing a very important role for the series A month later Maya Erskine was cast in a supporting role reportedly for at least three episodes while Rory Ross revealed his involvement in January br In March Ingram Friend and Kang were revealed to be portraying the Inquisitors Reva the Third Sister the Grand Inquisitor and the Fifth Brother respectively The Grand Inquisitor and the Fifth Brother previously appeared in Star Wars Rebels voiced by Jason Isaacs and Philip Anthony Rodriguez respectively Isaacs had previously expressed interest in reprising his role in live action Varma was confirmed to be playing an Imperial officer and Grant Feely was revealed to have been cast as the new actor for young Luke Skywalker The series premiere in May revealed that Jimmy Smits was reprising his role from the prequel films as Senator Bail Organa Kessell portrays his wife Queen Breha replacing Rebecca Jackson Mendoza who briefly portrayed the character in Revenge of the Sith Vivien Lyra Blair was revealed to be cast as a young Leia Organa br Ian McDiarmid and Liam Neeson reprise their roles as Palpatine and Qui Gon Jinn in the series finale in cameo appearances Although Neeson had previously expressed hesitation to reprise the role in a TV series because he prefers films he agreed to appear out of respect for Lucas and because he did not want Qui Gon to be recast br br br Design br Doug Chiang and Todd Cherniawsky were the production designers for the series with Suttirat Anne Larlarb as costume designer Chiang who is the vice president and executive creative director of Lucasfilm overseeing the designs of all the projects said the biggest challenge of the series was bridging the designs of the prequel and original trilogies together and remaining faithful to the films while adding new elements For instance the designs of Tatooine remain consistent with the films but they were able to bring new elements to the series for the town of Anchorhead which had first been referenced in Star Wars but had never been portrayed on screen before Chiang and Cherniawsky collaborated to create a design and achieve the balance that Chow desired br Propmaster Brad Elliott rewatched all the films in the prequel trilogy to prepare for his work on the series He was influenced by resources Pablo Hidalgo brought for the creative team Ralph McQuarrie s work on the original trilogy and techniques prop builders used in the original trilogy He chose to keep some of Kenobi s belongings such as his macrobinoculars holoprojectors and datapad from the prequel trilogy He felt It made sense that Kenobi would take a few items with him to watch over Luke and explained that he kept the holoprojector in case Bail Organa had contacted him Creating Kenobi s lightsaber was challenging for the prop builders as prop designers from the prequel and original trilogies did not use the same hilt designs requiring the prop team on the series to merge the two iterations together into something new that still felt authentic He further explained that the hilt s visual aesthetic was primarily inspired from the prequel trilogy but the team had upgraded the emitter to imitate Guinness s lightsaber in Star Wars When creating the lightsabers for the Inquisitors Filoni advised they imagined that the animated version was an exaggerated version of the live action Elliot says this helped the team keep the overall form of the lightsabers from Rebels in which the Inquisitors first appeared but change the proportions for human contact The team customized the diameter of the lightsabers to accommodate the actors br br br Filming br Filming was expected to begin in April in Los Angeles California with Deborah Chow directing Filming began on May Chung hoon Chung served as cinematographer for the series and the series uses the StageCraft video wall technology which was previously used for The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett The series also filmed in The Volume set the stoundstage on which StageCraft is implemented at the Manhattan Beach Studios in Los Angeles Chow chose Chung as the cinematographer as she liked his visual style and felt that he had done things that were smaller that were emotionally intense with a strong visual identity but he also had done huge commercial projects br McGregor did costume tests for Obi Wan Kenobi on the set of The Mandalorian and said the StageCraft technology allowed him to enjoy working on the series more than he did on the prequel films due to the latter s extensive use of blue and green screen Chow also stated that her experience in directing episodes for The Mandalorian helped the production team to utilize the technology better Actor Rupert Friend had completed his scenes by that August Filming had wrapped by September Nicholas De Toth and Kelley Dixon br br br Music br br Natalie Holt was hired to compose the series score making her the first woman to score a live action Star Wars project Recording for her music was reported to have been taking place for several months by mid February when John Williams recorded the main theme for the series with an orchestra in Los Angeles Holt herself later told Star Wars Insider that she was hired as composer in late December and had to record in early March Williams previously composed the scores for the main Star Wars films and originally wrote a theme for Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars which later became associated with the Force in general Williams approached Kennedy about composing a new theme for the series because Kenobi was the only major character from the original film that he had not written a standalone theme for and Holt said the new theme was reflective wistful and had an element of hope which embodies the spirit of the show entirely This was the second time Williams had written a theme for a Star Wars project for which he was not the main composer following Solo and was the first weekly television series for which he composed the theme since Amazing Stories in br Chow flew to London to meet with Holt and do a two day intensive immersion into the unfinished footage for the series Holt then developed themes for the new characters and wrote an original score that she said had its roots in the Star Wars tradition more than Ludwig G ransson s Mandalorian music did As with previous Star Wars scores Holt took influence from real world cultural music to represent different planets in the series including using Latin music for one planet and more Eastern sounds from Thailand and Hong Kong for another Holt used a hunting horn and some unusual percussion instruments played by Brian Kilgore to create the sound of the Inquisitors which she said stirs your guts It s so haunting It s that jarring rhythmic texture G ransson s recording engineer Chris Fogel worked with Holt on engineering the score for Obi Wan Kenobi at G ransson s studio Holt completed her work for the series by late April Williams The Imperial March Force Theme and Princess Leia s Theme are quoted in the score for Part VI br In her interview with Star Wars Insider Holt later stated that we didn t have very much time on Obi Wan Kenobi stating that was because it was a very compressed process which made work on the soundtrack challenging for her and Chow br br br Marketing br A short sizzle reel was released on November as part of the Disney Day celebration which included concept art and McGregor and Chow discussing the series The first trailer for the series was released on March during Disney s annual shareholder meeting The use of Williams s score in the trailer was a notable highlight with Zack Sharf of Variety saying the most awe inspiring moment of the trailer was its use of Duel of the Fates since it is one of Williams s most bombastic pieces of score music and featuring it in the trailer points to a reunion of friend Kenobi and foe Anakin Skywalker in the new series Daniel Chin of The Ringer also praised the trailer stating that it delivers a rush of Star Wars prequel nostalgia and also noted the use of Duel of the Fates which he felt set the tone and stakes of the series A second trailer was released on May to commemorate Star Wars Day with The Hollywood Reporter s Ryan Parker describing it as intense Many commentators highlighted the appearance of Darth Vader in the trailer Michael McWhertor from Polygon felt it gave a glimpse at the intensity of the Empire s hunt for one of the last remaining practitioners of the Force Meanwhile Joss Weiss of Syfy wrote that it depicts Kenobi dealing with shameful mistakes of his own past However Angela Watercutter from Wired expressed skepticism based on the trailer and opined everything Star Wars just feels like it s on auto pilot br The series was promoted at Star Wars Celebration on May including an advance screening of the first two episodes and a live performance of the main theme by the Pacific Symphony orchestra conducted by Williams In May Volkswagen released a commercial promoting the series and its electrical car model ID Buzz featuring R D C PO and McGregor Two editions of the car inspired by Star Wars were created

predecessors Kelly praised Harold s script on the first episode but felt his script for the second was inferior He also enjoyed Kenobi and Leia s dynamic in the second episode along with the
