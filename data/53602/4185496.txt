Avellone the lead designer of The Sith Lords has said that a core part of what made KOTOR I so great was the story and your companions and that was our intention in the sequel as well and has also said that he thought that the characters and voice acting were some of the key strengths of The Sith Lords and said that they got a lot of help and support from LucasArts in the voice acting and sound department Avellone stated that in some cases the characters turned out better than we thought they would be According to Avellone while there was some stuff we wanted to add overall they got almost everything we wanted in there Avellone has said he has been surprised by the positive feedback of some of the characters br br br Player characters br br br Revan br br The main protagonist and player

over At the end of the Mandalorian Wars however both Revan and Malak fell to the dark side and turned against the Republic although Malak viewed Revan as too soft which led to a duel that ended with

leadership the Sith devastate planets Taris and Dantooine while Revan regains his power in the search for the ancient space factory The Star Forge where he defeats Malak in the game s final battle

Chris Avellone lead designer of The Sith Lords was inspired to create Sion by Tessai s death scene in Ninja Scroll In contrast to other characters Sion s design took much longer to hone down Brian Menze creator of the concept art and in game model had difficulty finding a design that Avellone was satisfied with and the two had many conversations on how he should appear It was planned that Sion would have small parts of him orbiting around him Engine troubles however made that difficult ultimately resulting in a character looking far more human Voice directors Will Beckman and Darragh O Farrell originally sought to hire someone with an English accent rather than the Scottish one found in the game Problems arose due to most English actors lacking deep voices though afterwards they wished to avoid making Sion too Scottish wishing to avoid creating a caricature to American ears They called Sion s voice one of their favorites in The Sith Lords br br br Darth Nihilus br Darth

resurgent Sith based on Malachor V though Traya was later cast out and driven into exile Nihilus then uses the might of the Sith Armada not to conquer planets but to contain them so that he could feed off the Force energy of each planet s lifeforms wiping planets of life Nihilus is defeated in the game after being drawn out and tricked into launching an attack on Telos believing it to harbour the last of the Jedi The Exile together with Canderous Ordo and Nihilus former associate Visas Marr confront the Sith Lord on his ship and Nihilus is slain either after Visas sacrifices herself due to their shared link in the Force or after his attempt to feast on the Exile s connection to the Force backfires and weakens him br Nihilus appears in the Unseen Unheard story in the final issue of Star Wars Tales which recounts Nihilus using his power to decimate all life on the Miraluka colony world of Katarr including the vast majority of the Jedi Order s leadership Visas Marr is shown as the sole

installed Nihilus is introduced to the Galaxy of Heroes mobile game as a playable character in a update As the face of the marketing for The Sith Lords the character has been featured prominently in promotional material and subject to merchandise including several action figures br Nihilus was written so players would identify him less as a human and more a force of nature Avellone described him as without personality beyond just a feeling of hunger due to having succumbed so far to the dark side Avellone felt beating such a force seemed more heroic or far more epic than taking on an individual person The character s visual was quick to define Eurogamer describes him as a concept created and greenlit in all of minutes Character modeller and lead concept artist Brian Menze was asked to create a Sith Lord with No Face from Hayao Miyazaki s Spirited Away as a reference Avellone felt that the final design which employs a lot of voluminous black was closer to the Studio Ghibli character than was intended One idea behind Nihilus s design was that there should be nothing behind the mask representative of him being a void A pet peeve of Avellone s is promotional art of Nihilus with a visible nose which contradicted his concept of a character who lack facial features Menze had drawn a nosed Nihilus for a magazine cover which had become widely circulated and Avellone had let it go to Menze s now regret br Nihilus is considered to be one of the best remembered aspects of The Sith Lords s story IGN s Jesse Schedeen singled out his obliteration of Visas homeworld as the Sith Lord s defining moment of villainy Chris Freiberg from Den of Geek ranked the introduction of Darth Nihilus as one of the most memorable moments in Star Wars video game history Glixel listed him as one of twenty awesome Star Wars characters originating in video games and considered him terrifying and more of a malevolent ghost than a typical self serving Sith br Nihilus visual design proved to be very popular with Star Wars fandom Revan aside Eurogamer s Robert Purchese described The Sith Lords villains as far more memorable than those of the first game and described Nihilus as the most recognisable of the trio Schedeen remarked that Nihilus probably wins the award for coolest looking Star Wars villain ever The Citizen s Lake Life editor David Wilcox opined that Darth Nihilus is the best designed character outside of the Star Wars saga s main players The character has been frequently referenced in fan art cosplay and other derivative works since his appearance in The Sith Lords The character was also featured on The Howard Stern Show for several weeks br Nihilus popularity has led to discussions about the supposed references to the character in canon Star Wars works such as the identity of an ancient Sith statue in Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker as well as the origins of the Nihil a faction set to be the overarching antagonists of the upcoming Star Wars The High Republic subseries Obsidian Entertainment acknowledged their creation of Darth Nihilus and the character s popularity as a notable contribution to the Star Wars license Menze noted in retrospect that co creating Darth Nihilus with Avellone is a career highlight for him and acknowledged that the character has gone on to be bigger than the game we created br br br Atris br Atris voiced by Elizabeth Rider is a former member of the Jedi Council and one of the Jedi largely responsible for banishing the Jedi Exile from the Jedi Order Prior to the events of The Sith Lords Atris had an idealistic view

challenged during the events of the Mandalorian War and the war against Darth Malak in the first game This drove her to betraying the Jedi by leaking the location of their hidden conclave resulting in

Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic In an article written for Vulture Hound Thomas Richard considered Juhani to be a conceptually interesting character He praised Taylor s subtle performance noting that Taylor delivers her lines with a purring Russian accent and a deliberate pace that all while presenting some perceptible differences with what the listener may be accustomed to hearing from real people enable her to track down her character s conflicted emotions with remarkable precision He opined that she successfully conveyed the character s struggle to understand and control the anger in her heart the resentment self blame and internalized sense of inadequacy caused by years of racial injustice exactly when she needs to Rostislav Kurka from Sci Fi Fantasy Network was of the view that Juhani s redemption was affirming and resonated with players who struggle with identity issues and the belief that they were not right according to the standards of their society Conversely Robert Purchese from Eurogamer commented that Juhani s story arc was relatively unexplored and her romance subplot was not up to BioWare s usual standards He remarked that while she did open up to Revan about her feelings the final battle commences and there s never time to find out what happens next UGO Networks considered Juhani to be one of the worst Star Wars Expanded Universe characters arguing

portrayal of queer characters in the Star Wars universe She was also the first gay character in a video game produced by BioWare David Silver guest writing for VentureBeat remarked that characters like Juhani are an example of the positive influence of LGBT video game characters as they promote understanding and represent the real life LGBT community in a strong and positive light Kurka consider Juhani to be an important LGBTQ protagonist stressing that her appearance was remarkable in terms of the entire gaming industry as there had not been many LGBTQ characters in mainstream video games at that time Complex ranked Juhani as the second coolest LGBT video game characters and opined that her importance should inspire some nerdcore rap lyric about her The Advocate ranked Knights of the Old Republic sixth on their list of notable video games with queer content citing Juhani s character arc as the reason for the placement br br br Reception br The characters have overall been well
