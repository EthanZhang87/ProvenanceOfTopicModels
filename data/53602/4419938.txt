Star Wars Rogue Squadron is an arcade style flight action game co developed by Factor and LucasArts The first of three games in the Rogue Squadron series it was published by LucasArts and Nintendo and released for Microsoft Windows and Nintendo in December The game s story was influenced by the Star Wars X wing Rogue Squadron comics and is set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy taking place primarily between events in the films Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back The player controls Luke Skywalker commander of the elite X wing pilots known as Rogue Squadron As the game progresses Skywalker and Rogue Squadron fight the Galactic Empire in missions across various planets br Gameplay is presented from the third person perspective and game objectives are divided into four categories search and destroy reconnaissance rescue and protect The player can control five craft and each offers a unique armament arrangement as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability Bonus power ups that improve these crafts weapons or durability are hidden in different levels throughout the game The player s performance is checked against three medal benchmarks after the completion of each level Acquiring these medals promotes the player s rank and helps unlock hidden content br Rogue Squadron s focus on flight combat was directly inspired by a level in Star Wars Shadows of the Empire that allowed the player to pilot a snowspeeder Working together during development Factor designed the game engine the music and worked closely with Nintendo while LucasArts produced the game s story and gameplay and ensured it was faithful to Star Wars canon Before the game s release Factor successfully appealed to Nintendo to release the Nintendo s newly developed memory Expansion Pak commercially Consequently Rogue Squadron was one of the first games to take advantage of the Expansion Pak which allows gameplay at a higher display resolution br Upon release critics praised the game s technical achievements and flight controls but its use of distance fog and the lack of a multiplayer mode drew criticism The game s sales exceeded expectations by August more than one million copies had sold worldwide It spawned two sequels developed and released for the GameCube Star Wars Rogue Squadron II Rogue Leader and Star Wars Rogue Squadron III Rebel Strike as well as Star Wars Episode I Battle for Naboo a spiritual successor released for Windows and Nintendo br br br Gameplay br Unlike the Star Wars X Wing series that emphasizes space combat simulation Rogue Squadron is a fast paced arcade style flight action game Each of the game s levels introduces mission objectives that must be completed to progress to the next level These objectives are divided into four categories search and destroy reconnaissance rescue and protect Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of TIE fighters Ground defenses are more varied and include three different walkers laser and missile turrets tanks probe droids shuttles stormtroopers and speeder bikes br Gameplay is presented from the third person perspective a view from a craft s cockpit is available The heads up display features a health meter a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons The player can control five craft X wing A wing Y wing snowspeeder and V wing Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level however after a level is completed it can be replayed with any available craft Levels set on non atmospheric moons expose the player s craft to space thus disallowing the speeder and V wing which are repulsorcraft from being used but as on other levels the craft is vertically confined Nine bonus power ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game These bonuses improve a craft s weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft for the remainder of the game br The player s performance is measured throughout the game and performance statistics are checked after each level against three medal benchmarks Each benchmark contains five categories completion time number of enemies destroyed shot accuracy number of friendly craft and structures saved and number of bonuses collected If a player s performance exceeds one of the level s three benchmarks in all five categories a medal bronze silver or gold is awarded on completion Acquiring these medals promotes the player s rank and helps unlock hidden content br br br Unlockable content br Rogue Squadron includes a number of unlockable secrets The player can unlock three bonus levels Beggar s Canyon The Death Star Trench Run and The Battle of Hoth These levels are made available when the player obtains all bronze silver or gold medals respectively on each level Alternatively they can be unlocked via passcode Unlike the game s primary levels the bonus levels are adaptions of events from the Star Wars films Beggar s Canyon allows the player to reenact the race mentioned in A New Hope while The Death Star Trench Run allows the player to execute an alternate version of the film s climactic battle In the Battle of Hoth bonus level the player can join the Rebel Alliance s combat against Imperial troops as depicted in The Empire Strikes Back br Several craft are available when unlocked Both the Millennium Falcon and a TIE interceptor are initially present in the craft selection screen However neither may be selected until the player enters the correct passcodes or achieves all bronze or silver medals respectively on the bonus levels Two other craft can be unlocked but each is confined to a specific level One is the T Skyhopper in Beggar s Canyon and an AT ST is playable in a basic demonstration level unlocked only via passcode A playable model of a Buick Electra based on a car owned by the game s sound designer Rudolph Stember is included in the game as an Easter egg br During Rogue Squadron s development Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace the first Star Wars film in more than years was less than one year from its scheduled release date To take advantage of this marketing opportunity Factor included content from the upcoming film in Rogue Squadron Lucasfilm provided the developers with design art for the Naboo Starfighter a ship prominently featured in the new film These designs were used to create an in game model Because the game was scheduled to be released six months before the film Factor was required to keep the ship s inclusion a secret As a result most of the game s development team at Factor and LucasArts were not informed of its inclusion A complex scrambling system was developed to help hide the ship s code from gamers using cheat cartridges such as GameShark or Action Replay More than six months after the release of Rogue Squadron LucasArts unveiled the code to unlock the Naboo Starfighter as a playable craft The code has been named the Nintendo s most well hidden code because of the length of time before its discovery br br br Synopsis br br br Setting br Star Wars Rogue Squadron is set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy where a war is fought between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance The game s first fifteen levels occur six months after the Battle of Yavin as depicted in A New Hope and before the events of The Empire Strikes Back As the Empire gathers strength for an all out assault on the Rebel forces Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles form Rogue Squadron a group comprising twelve of the most skilled X wing pilots from the Rebel Alliance br The sixteenth and final level of the game takes place during Dark Empire six years after Return of the Jedi s Battle of Endor The Rebel Alliance has established the New Republic which now controls three quarters of the galaxy After the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader the Galactic Empire collapsed but was reborn under a mysterious new leader who is actually a clone of Palpatine Rogue Squadron now under the command of Wedge Antilles continues to fight the Empire to protect the newly formed Republic br br br Plot br The story is divided into four chapters each of which starts with an opening crawl resembling those featured in the Star Wars films Further story details are presented through the game s instruction manual pre mission briefings character conversations during the game and in game cutscenes The game begins with Rogue Squadron briefly encountering the Empire at the Mos Eisley spaceport on Tatooine The team executes escort and rescue missions on Barkhesh and Chorax respectively br br The Rebels learn that Imperial officer Crix Madine wishes to defect to the Rebel Alliance The Empire launches an attack on Corellia where Madine is stationed to prevent his departure Rogue Squadron with the help of Han Solo and Chewbacca in the Millennium Falcon fights off the Empire and helps escort Madine safely off the planet Rogue Squadron is joined by Gold Squadron a group of Y wings now led by Crix Madine they are dispatched to the moon of Gerrard V to aid its quest for independence from the Empire They encounter the th TIE interceptor Squadron and disable Kasan Moor s TIE When Rogue Squadron tells Moor that she has been taken prisoner she offers to defect and provide the Rebel Alliance with Imperial intelligence br With the help of Kasan Moor s intelligence the Alliance launches three consecutive attacks on Imperial bases throughout the galaxy After an assault on the Imperial Enclave a facility on Kile II supporting the Empire s Naval operations Wedge Antilles is ambushed by a group of TIEs and is taken captive The Rebel Alliance tracks Wedge to an Imperial prison complex on the planet of Kessel The remaining members of Rogue Squadron travel to Kessel and rescue him and other Rebel prisoners br With Wedge Antilles free and Rogue Squadron again at full strength the Rebel Alliance turns its attention to a new Imperial threat Moff Kohl Seerdon Seerdon is consolidating Imperial power in preparation for an attack aimed at capturing Thyferra a planet that produces the healing substance bacta Rogue Squadron is ordered to disrupt his operation with hit and run missions against key targets on Taloraan and Fest In retaliation Seerdon attacks and holds a city on the planet of Chandrila hostage Rogue Squadron and the Alliance strike back by initiating a Kasan Moor engineered raid on an Imperial base located inside a volcano on Sullust While still on Sullust however General Rieekan informs the Squadron that Moff Seerdon has used their raid as a diversion and begun his attack on Thyferra With Seerdon in control of the planet s bacta and their own supply threatened Rogue Squadron quickly reaches Thyferra kills Seerdon and frees the planet br In the final chapter the game moves into the future six years after the Battle of Endor Rogue Squadron now under the command of Wedge Antilles continues to fight the wounded Empire On the planet of Mon Calamari new Imperial weapons called World Devastators are destroying the planet Rogue Squadron is deployed disables all three Devastators and destroys the Imperial presence br br br Development br After the success of Star Wars Shadows of the Empire on the Nintendo in LucasArts began planning a follow up At the time Factor was developing a game engine to create large terrain maps for their planned sequel to LucasArts Rescue on Fractalus After LucasArts signed a three game exclusivity deal with Nintendo Factor was allowed to convert their work on the new Fractalus sequel into a Star Wars game instead The game s focus would be flight combat this direction was inspired by a level of Shadows of the Empire in which the player flies a snowspeeder during the Battle of Hoth Rogue Squadron and LucasArts production manager Brett Tosti stated That whole scene was actually the genesis for Rogue Squadron because everybody said Why don t you do a whole game like that So we did Factor and LucasArts divided the game s development load Factor designed the game engine the music and worked closely with Nintendo while LucasArts produced the game s content and ensured it was faithful to Star Wars canon br Factor initially pitched a concept to allow gamers to play through missions similar to the fans favorite action sequences from the Star Wars films This proposal was rejected however At that time Lucasfilm was not comfortable with video games drawing directly from the films nor would they allow original content to be incorporated alongside battles from the films Consequently the resulting game was almost completely set in the Star Wars Expanded Universe The designers at LucasArts initially planned to adapt Rogue Squadron and Star Wars X wing Rogue Squadron a series of books and comic books set after the years of the original film trilogy and have the game centered around Wedge Antilles It was later decided that the game would instead focus on Luke Skywalker and primarily take place between the events of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back as it was more commercially appealing br br LucasArts began developing the story and gameplay in a setting that would include characters from the films participating in new original missions using Factor s terrain map engine as the base The development team s basic design plan was to combine the free roaming style of Rescue on Fractalus with the on rails gameplay of Atari s Star Wars arcade game Initially designing and refining the individualized flight controls for the game s various vehicles was difficult for programmer Mark Haigh Hutchinson before breaking through to find the right balance for each In May a demo of the game was displayed at E but the game was so incomplete at the time that Tosti considered it a tech demo It rendered a basic heightmap and an immobile AT AT model while TIE fighters lacking artificial intelligence flew and fired in a predetermined path When playing the demo for audiences Tosti followed a very specific flight path of his own to give the illusion that he was actually battling with the TIEs Despite the demo s barebones presentation response from gamers was largely positive In the final build of the game many of the enemy fighters continued to follow predetermined flight paths as calculating flight paths on the fly required too much processing power br Late in development the team realized that they were developing the game with a Nintendo memory expansion in place at all times Unable to run the game on a standard Nintendo they began working on compression techniques to allow the game to run within the confines of the standard console At the same time Factor appealed to Nintendo to release the newly developed memory Expansion Pak commercially Nintendo was reluctant expecting the technology to be reserved solely for hardware peripherals However after Iguana Entertainment also wanted to use the Expansion Pak to achieve a higher display resolution for Turok Seeds of Evil Factor was given the green light Ultimately Rogue Squadron was made to run on a standard Nintendo but the Expansion Pak increases its resolution from to br Lucasfilm was hesitant to grant access to the Star Wars library of sound effects to Factor sound designer Rudolph Stember As a compromise the company provided Stember with sounds sampled at the relatively low rate of kHz half the standard rate Stember objected claiming that the clips sounded worse than effects he had lifted from VHS tapes for a previous Star Wars project The game includes voice work from several notable people including screen actors Olivia Hussey and Raphael Sbarge as well as voice actors Bob Bergen Neil Ross and Terence McGovern Instead of using Nintendo s default sound drivers Factor developed its own tool called MOsys FX Surround The Factor drivers use Nintendo processors but tax them less advanced compression techniques were employed As a result the game includes over minutes of high quality stereo sound br In November a month before the game s scheduled release LucasArts announced the worldwide agreement with Nintendo concerning three new Star Wars video games It granted Nintendo the rights to market the games and hold exclusive worldwide distribution rights for five years following each release Rogue Squadron was the first game released under this agreement To promote the release of the game Mark Hamill the actor who played Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars films visited the Mattel Children s Hospital in Los Angeles to play the game with patients in a Starlight Children s Foundation s Fun Center br br br Reception br br Many reviews compared Star Wars Rogue Squadron to one of its inspirations the Battle of Hoth flight combat level in Star Wars Shadows of the Empire considered one of that game s best elements GamePro remarked that Rogue Squadron enhanced the flight model with true pitch roll and bank mechanics IGN praised its inclusion of upgrades more enemies better sound and stunning second generation graphics The Nintendo version received mostly positive reviews and received an aggregate score of percent from both GameRankings and Metacritic GamePro named it one of the best games released in In a retrospective IGN s Levi Buchanan stated that the game revived the Star Wars license on consoles through well paced gameplay a story tied into the Star Wars canon and visuals that made it one of the generation s top stunners br The game s technical aspects were singled out for acclaim Its visuals were called respectable in the standard resolution but highly praised in high resolution mode achieved via the Nintendo s Expansion Pak GameSpot remarked that in a higher resolution the textures of the landscapes the ships the lighting effects everything looks so much better while IGN s Peer Schneider said After playing the game in the optional high resolution mode once it s impossible to go back to the still respectable standard resolution Citing details such as decals Rebel markings R units cockpit views and exhaust flames Schneider described the game s D ship models as gorgeous IGN s Matt Casamassina said that the game was the best looking Nintendo game to date br Reviewers also praised the game s sound design Powered by the new Factor audio drivers Rogue Squadron features about minutes of speech and minutes of music GameSpot s Ryan Mac Donald believed that the game s inclusion of extended voice work helped create a movie like atmosphere IGN noted that in addition to being technically impressive the game s Dolby Pro Logic surround sound was an important gameplay element The audio signals helps the player determine enemy positions and the direction of travel IGN awarded the game three sound awards including Sound Effects Best Voice and Best Overall Sound of on the Nintendo The game earned a nomination for Game of the Year at the AIAS nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards now known as the D I C E Awards br Some reviewers complained about aspects of the game s visuals critics disliked the heavy reliance on distance fog Another common criticism of the game was the lack of multiplayer modes GamePro s review called the omission a serious unforgivable sin Schneider believed that while adding these modes would have extended Rogue Squadron s replay value the game was still enjoyable for its medal reward system and a large number of secrets and unlockables br Although nearly identical the game s PC version garnered lower review scores than its Nintendo counterpart with an aggregated GameRankings score of percent This version enjoyed many of the same praises for its gameplay but handling and graphics were cited as problematic Directly comparing the two versions AllGame s Brad Cook wrote that the PC version s handling is more difficult than the N version He believed the PC s choppy feel made it difficult to target enemies In contrast to its opinion of the N version IGN s PC review was not enthusiastic about the game s visuals IGN staff remarked that Rogue Squadron s graphics and special effects aren t spectacular and that they had seen better graphics on the PC br br br Sales br When Rogue Squadron was released in early December the title s Nintendo incarnation was the second highest selling video game for the first half of the month behind Nintendo s The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and the holiday season PC Data which tracked sales in the United States reported that Rogue Squadron sold units and earned million in revenue by the end of This made it the country s ninth best selling Nintendo release of the year Delayed until after Christmas in the United Kingdom the game was released mid January and debuted as the second best selling game of the month ahead of Ocarina of Time In August Nintendo added the title to its best selling Player s Choice collection while the PC version was re released as a part of the LucasArts Archive Series in May The PC version was also released via digital distribution in The Nintendo version sold over million copies in the United States and over in Japan Rogue Squadron s retail success was not anticipated by the game s producer Julian Eggebrecht who said that the game sold about times better than anybody expected He believed that releasing the game shortly after the theatrical re releases of the original Star Wars films and only five months before the theatrical release of Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace helped contribute to the game s success Two sequels were later developed and released for the GameCube Star Wars Rogue Squadron II Rogue Leader and Star Wars Rogue Squadron III
