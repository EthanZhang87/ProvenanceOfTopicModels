id: 319856
The Battle of Yavin takes place in the fictional universe of Star Wars It pits the Galactic Empire against the Rebel Alliance around the gas giant planet Yavin and its fourth moon br In a previous battle the rebels managed to steal the plans for the Death Star a gigantic Imperial battle station equipped with a laser capable of destroying planets However the Empire has discovered the location of the rebel base on Yavin and intends to destroy it using its new weapon The Death Star has a vulnerability that the rebels have discovered When it is in orbit around Yavin they send all their ships in a desperate attack to destroy it This leads to battles with Imperial fighters commanded by Darth Vader Using the Force Luke Skywalker manages to reach the vulnerability and destroy the battle station without leaving any survivors br For the Rebel Alliance this battle is a victory However the rebels are forced to flee to settle elsewhere Indeed Darth Vader who was not aboard the Death Star when it exploded continues to hunt them down br The Battle of Yavin is depicted in the film A New Hope It is largely created using practical special effects It serves as a reference point in the Star Wars chronology br In addition to the film it is represented in novelizations of the film in which it appears as well as in several novels video games and comics br br br Universe br br The Star Wars universe unfolds in a galaxy inhabited by humans and numerous extraterrestrial species It is the stage for conflicts between Jedi knights and Sith lords individuals sensitive to the Force a mysterious energy field that grants them psychic abilities The Jedi master the light side of the Force a beneficial and defensive power to maintain peace in the galaxy The Sith on the other hand harness the dark side a harmful and destructive power for their personal use and to dominate the galaxy br Since the acquisition of Lucasfilm by the Walt Disney Company there are two Star Wars universes Legends and Canon They share the six original films and the television series The Clone Wars The Legends universe additionally incorporates complementary stories presented in books comics TV movies or games released before The Canon universe on the other hand encompasses the stories from the films and other materials released since br br br Background br Several years before the Clone Wars the Confederacy of Independent Systems begins developing a weapon capable of destroying entire planets the Death Star Following the war in BBY Before the Battle of Yavin the Galactic Republic is reformed into an Empire and Grand Moff Tarkin oversees the construction of the battle station until its completion nearly twenty years later It is intended to quell any dissent against the Empire br From the Empire s inception small groups rebel against its authority including Saw Gerrera and his team as well as the crew of the Ghost Over time some of these cells unite to form the Rebel Alliance br br br Prelude br br br Official Universe br Engineer Galen Erso who participates in the design of the Death Star embeds a flaw that can destroy the entire station He manages to contact the rebel Saw Gerrera so that his daughter Jyn Erso can retrieve the station s plans and destroy it With the help of the Rebel Alliance Jyn and her team named Rogue One infiltrate the Scarif base where the Imperial archives are located A fierce battle ensues on the surface between the assault group and the forces on site and in space between the rebel fleet and the Imperial reinforcements led by the Sith Darth Vader Jyn Erso succeeds in transmitting the Death Star plans to the orbiting ships but the battle station fires its superlaser on the planet s surface leaving no survivors The Tantive IV commanded by Princess Leia Organa receives the plans and escapes br br br Legends Universe br On Toprawa where the Death Star s superlaser is under construction a group of rebel spies manages to steal the plans for the battle station They transmit them to the Tantive IV which is orbiting the planet However it is pursued by Darth Vader s Star Destroyer forcing it to flee br br br Common part br The Tantive IV is intercepted by Darth Vader s Star Destroyer above Tatooine Before being captured Princess Leia Organa entrusts the Death Star plans to the droid R D who escapes aboard an escape pod accompanied by C PO On the desert planet the two droids are captured by Jawas who sell them to the farmer Owen Lars He hands them over to his nephew Luke Skywalker who discovers a message hidden by Leia Organa for the Jedi Master Obi Wan Kenobi She asks him to aid the rebellion R D leaves without warning to search for the Jedi He is caught up by Luke and C PO but they fall into an ambush by Tusken Raiders They are saved at the last moment by Kenobi who takes them to his home br br Darth Vader brings Leia Organa back to the Death Star where she is imprisoned Since the Imperial Senate was dissolved shortly before by the Emperor she no longer enjoys the protection afforded to senators Grand Moff Tarkin interrogates the princess wanting to know the Rebel Alliance s headquarters location He threatens to open fire on Alderaan where Leia Organa grew up She tells him that she is on Dantooine Despite this Tarkin orders the planet s destruction before her eyes br On Tatooine Luke learns that his father was a Jedi Knight Obi Wan gives him his former apprentice s lightsaber When they return to the Lars farm they find a massacre Imperial troops have murdered Luke s uncle and aunt Consequently he decides to accompany Kenobi and the two droids to Alderaan In Mos Eisley they meet Han Solo and Chewbacca owners of the Millennium Falcon The smugglers are hired to discreetly take them to their destination However they are found by stormtroopers forcing them to leave the planet in haste br On board the space station Grand Moff Tarkin learns that there is only an abandoned old base on Dantooine He tortures the princess to make her confess the truth At the same time the Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace into an asteroid field The crew realizes that the planet has been destroyed They follow TIE fighters heading towards a moon When they realize it s not a moon but the Death Star it s already too late they are caught in a tractor beam and forced to land They manage to disguise themselves as stormtroopers and infiltrate the station They free Princess Leia but must face a powerful enemy Sith Lord Darth Vader Obi Wan Kenobi engages him in combat while the others board the Millennium Falcon The Jedi allows himself to be killed by his former apprentice allowing the others to escape br They go to Yavin where the rebel base is located to deliver the Death Star plans contained within R D They are analyzed by the Alliance engineers and the vulnerability is discovered However the Empire had placed a tracking beacon on the Falcon when it was still aboard the station This allows Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader to know the exact position of the rebel headquarters and therefore to send the Death Star to destroy it br br br Battlefield br br The battle takes place in the orbit of the gas giant planet Yavin near one of its natural satellites Yavin It also unfolds around the Death Star extending into one of its trenches br br br Technologies br br The Imperial forces consist of the Death Star a mobile battle station capable of destroying entire planets equipped with numerous TIE fighters the Empire s primary combat vessel and a symbol of its power Darth Vader pilots an upgraded version the TIE Advanced X which is faster more powerful and tailored to the dimensions of the Sith Lord s armor br br The Rebel forces consist of two squadrons The Gold Squadron commanded by Jon Dutch Vander consists of eight Y wing interceptors which are used primarily for bombing missions It is accompanied by the Red Squadron led by Garven Dreis and composed of eight X wing interceptors They are supported by the Millennium Falcon a YT light freighter piloted by smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca br br br Course br When the Death Star arrives at Yavin it is not properly positioned to fire on the fourth moon This allows the rebels to launch an attack to destroy the battle station Its weakness has been clearly identified a proton torpedo must be fired into the exhaust port to trigger a chain reaction that will destroy it For this mission two squadrons of Y wing and X wing interceptors take off Luke Skywalker designated as Red pilots one of the X wings accompanied by R D As they approach the Death Star a group of TIE fighters intercepts them The Red Squadron engages in combat with them allowing the Y wings of the Gold Squadron to enter the trench toward the exhaust port br However they are destroyed by Darth Vader s TIE Advanced X fighter The Sith Lord participates in the battle to protect the station forcing the X wings of the Red Squadron to enter the trench as well They are vulnerable there and are each destroyed or damaged in turn At the end only Luke Skywalker remains to accomplish the mission A group of TIE fighters pursues him preparing to fire He is saved at the last moment by Han Solo and Chewbacca aboard the Millennium Falcon who manage to scatter the Imperial fighters Following the advice of Obi Wan Kenobi whose voice he hears Luke Skywalker deactivates the targeting system of the ship and using the Force he fires a proton torpedo that enters the port and destroys the Death Star before it can open fire on Yavin br br br Review br The Battle of Yavin is a victory for the Rebel Alliance They manage to defeat the forces of the Galactic Empire Practically all Imperial personnel are killed and almost all of the Empire s equipment including the Death Star is destroyed The only survivor is Darth Vader who participated in the battle his TIE Advanced X fighter was damaged by Han Solo br On the rebel side the losses are heavy In addition to the Millennium Falcon only three ships from the Red and Gold squadrons return including those piloted by Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles However the commanders of these two squadrons were shot down during the fighting br br br Consequences br Following the loss of the battle station the Empire initiates the construction of a second Death Star This one is under construction around the forest moon of Endor and is more than twice the size of the first br With the rebel headquarters discovered on Yavin they are forced to relocate to another planet They decide to settle on Hoth an icy planet located in the Outer Rim br The Second Death Star is eventually destroyed by the Rebels as well br br br Concept and creation br br Before the production of the film A New Hope even began George Lucas created sketches of the various spacecraft that would participate in the Battle of Yavin In November he hired model maker Colin Cantwell and illustrator Ralph McQuarrie Cantwell created the initial designs for the Y wing interceptor and the Millennium Falcon while McQuarrie produced illustrations of key scenes from the film one of which depicted a group of Y wing interceptors attacking the Death Star br Only one full scale X wing interceptor model was built which was visible in the scene preceding the battle in the Rebel hangar on Yavin The space battles were entirely created using mechanical special effects Only one cockpit was constructed and the actors portraying the pilots took turns sitting in it while the droid behind them was replaced br Some scenes of the battle were enhanced with digital special effects in the and re releases of the film For example the number of rebel ships approaching the Death Star was increased and the space battle sequences were refined with the explosions being reworked The scene depicting the destruction of the battle station was embellished with a circular shockwave br br br Adaptation br In addition to its official appearances in novels novelizations films and television series the Battle of Yavin appears in various other Star Wars universe derivative products br br br Video games br br The Battle of Yavin is featured in numerous video games In Star Wars Empire at War released in and set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope players can control either the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance At one point they find themselves replaying the battle around Yavin while controlling one of these two factions In Star Wars X Wing released in players embody Luke Skywalker and must destroy the Death Star br In Star Wars Rogue Squadron released in players take on the role of Luke Skywalker and can unlock a secret level allowing them to participate in the Battle of Yavin This mission is also the first in its sequel Star Wars Rogue Squadron II Rogue Leader released in br In the mobile game Star Wars Trench Run was released Players take on the role of a pilot during combat in the trench of the space station br The arcade game Star Wars released in includes several space combat sequences including one on the surface of the Death Star br br br Figurines br Many action figures depict characters from the Battle of Yavin For instance in Hasbro released action figures featuring certain pilots from the Red Squadron and the Empire In and action figures depicting Wedge Antilles General Jan Dodonna and Dutch Vander the leader of the Gold Squadron were also released br Lego has produced spherical figurines of various planets and moons with the Yavin figurine released in as set number titled X wing Starfighter Yavin It comes with a figurine of Luke Skywalker and the X wing interceptor he pilots during the battle br br br Amusement parks br A segment of the Star Tours attraction is inspired by the Battle of Yavin Visitors board a Starspeeder an intergalactic transport ship bound for the moon of Endor At one point the transport joins a group of Rebel fighters and takes part in the assault against the third Death Star This attraction no longer in existence was replaced by Star Tours The Adventures Continue It was present in Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort in the United States until at Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan until and at Disneyland Paris in France until br br br Reception br The website Screen Rant ranks the Battle of Yavin in third place in its list of the best battles from the original Star Wars trilogy The site finds that everything about this battle is superb particularly praising the mechanical special effects and the scene where Han Solo saves Luke Skywalker In its ranking of the entire saga the same website places it in the first position explaining that it is the sequence with the most tension Similarly the website PubSquare Media also ranks the Battle of Yavin in the first position However the website Looper only ranks it in fifth place as it considers it to be a small battle between two Rebel squadrons and a few Imperial fighters br br br Posterity br br br In the culture br Several fans have attempted to calculate the number of casualties resulting from the explosion of the Death Star at the end of the Battle of Yavin The figures vary as sources do not always provide the same number of people on board Estimates suggest it to be around one million br On YouTube a channel imagined what the Death Star s laser light would look like if it existed in reality In the video the laser light is not green but transparent making it invisible It is also depicted as capable of quickly changing targets rendering it more dangerous than in the fictional universe Another channel recreated the trench run scene using animated Lego figurines The creators took some liberties including the presence of ships that would not normally be there br In a spoof of conspiracy theories some fans have made tongue in cheek speculations that the Death Star s destruction was actually deliberately caused or at least allowed to happen by the Galactic Empire itself rather than as the result of the Rebel assault br The Simpsons animated series has parodied the Battle of Yavin on several occasions In the episode My Sister My Sitter from Season Bart hears his dance teacher s voice in his head advising him to use dance in the same way Obi Wan Kenobi advises Luke Skywalker to use the Force before destroying the Death Star Similarly in the episode Pygmoelian from Season Patty says to Selma The bitterness is strong in this one referencing Darth Vader s line The Force is strong in this one from the trench run scene Additionally a reference to the battle appears in comic book number released in October The family s dog Santa s Little Helper appears in a commercial for the Krusty Burger chain wearing Biggs Darklighter s X wing helmet who was a childhood friend of Luke Skywalker and a member of the Red Squadron br br br Star Wars timeline reference point br The Battle of Yavin serves as the reference point for the Star Wars timeline Events are dated in relation to it using day years For example the Battle of Geonosis which marks the start of the Clone Wars takes place in BBY while the Battle of Endor which marks the end of the Galactic Civil War takes place in ABY br The book Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker The Visual Guide released in uses another reference point the Starkiller Base
