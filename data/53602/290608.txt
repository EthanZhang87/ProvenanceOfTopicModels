speeder bikes from and holds an impromptu funeral In the seventh episode it is revealed that it was the Pykes who killed the tribe and framed the Nikto gang br br br Expanded Universe br br According to the noncanon Star Wars Expanded Universe sources Tusken Raiders are named after Fort Tusken an early Old Republic mining settlement in which all of the settlers were overwhelmed captured or killed by Tusken Raiders then referred to as Sand People The attack probably occurred due to the fort s placement over one of the Raiders holy wells br Although the Sand People are aggressive and violent by nature they have deep seated traditions that they cling to tightly Young raiders are required to prove their adulthood in various physical activities While the Sand People have no written language the most revered member of a Tusken clan is the storyteller He knows the life story of every member of his clan and also knows of the clan s history The storyteller is required to memorize the histories word for word eliminating any chance for misinterpretation or distortion Apprentice storytellers often are more hard pressed to prove themselves than warriors for a single mistake in reciting the histories means instant death by decapitation As violent as their nature is Sand People stay as far from the moisture farmers as the farmers do them There are occasional skirmishes with the more outlying settlements br Specialists studying the past of the Tusken Raiders also used the term Ghorfa to denote an earlier sedentary phase of their culture and lastly Kumumgah for the earliest stratum of sentient civilization on the planet believed by some to represent a common ancestry shared by the Ghorfas the Tuskens and the Jawas br The comic book series Star Wars Republic explains that exiled Jedi Sharad Hett and his son A Sharad Hett lived among the Tusken Raiders for many years Hett was one of the few non Tuskens to be accepted into their ranks and was even given the title of warlord Although A Sharad Hett believed he was half Tusken for the better part of his life during his training on Coruscant he learned that Humans and Tusken Raiders were genetically unable to interbreed This leads him to believe that his mother must have been a human captured by the Tusken Raiders at a young age and raised as a Tusken The series Star Wars Legacy set some years later reveals that A Sharad eventually turned to the dark side of the Force and as the Sith Lord Darth Krayt briefly conquered the galaxy br In the Junior Jedi Knights and New Jedi Order series it is revealed that Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila was raised by the Tusken Raiders after they killed her parents br A Tusken Raider named Hoar appears as a playable character in the PlayStation fighting game Star Wars Masters of Ter s K si In the Xbox Original game Star Wars Battlefront II players are allowed to play as Tusken Raiders in a special game mode called hunt br Tusken Raiders appear in Knights of the Old Republic and The Old Republic when players visit Tatooine If the player pursues peace between the Tusken Raiders and the local mining corporations in Knights of the Old Republic the player will be given an opportunity to learn the entire history of the Tusken Raiders and Tatooine During the recital of Tusken Raider history the player learns that Tusken Raiders were once human exactly like the player Tatooine though now a desert planet was once a lush and verdant world and the original humans in the Star Wars Galaxy were abducted from this world by the Rakata of the Infinite Empire and then seeded among the stars as slaves building the Infinite Empire s monuments br Eventually the humans of Tatooine rebelled against the Infinite Empire and in retaliation their world was destroyed by an orbital bombardment of the entire surface Remaining groups of survivors adapted to the world s new destroyed surface and the lesson that they took from all of this was that it was a sin to advance technologically and reach for the stars like their ancestors did The player s companion will note that because the history has been passed only through recitation that it may be inaccurate however almost everything the Tusken Raider recites to the player is confirmed throughout the game and the only thing left to be confirmed is whether or not the Tusken Raiders were in fact once human and the origin for all humans throughout the galaxy br br br Concept and creation br Star Wars creator George Lucas said that the Tuskens design was inspired by the Bedouin an Arab tribe from the desert regions of North Africa br br br Tusken Sign Language br In his script for The Mandalorian episode Chapter The Gunslinger Dave Filoni mentioned that the Tusken Raiders should use some form of sign language Deaf actor Troy Kotsur was hired as a consultant When developing the sign language he attempted to avoid American Sign Language and suit the Tuskens cultural and environmental context A lifelong Star Wars fan Kotsur also played a Tusken scout in the episode The sign language later appeared to a greater extent in Chapter The Marshal as well as the first three episodes of The Book of Boba Fett br Chapter The Gunslinger was the first time that Tuskens had communicated on screen Media outlets praised the sign language for humanizing the Tuskens and moving away from their characterization as indigenous savages Fans especially deaf viewers were similarly enthusiastic about the inclusion of an alien sign language in Star Wars and started a Facebook group to further develop the Tusken language br br br
