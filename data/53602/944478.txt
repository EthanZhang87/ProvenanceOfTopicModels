through the game instead the player must survive for a set length of time either avoiding or destroying enemies and the shots they fire The player begins with six shields one of which is lost for every collision with an enemy or projectile If the player loses all shields and is hit again the game ends br Each wave of the game consists of three attack phases culminating in the destruction of the Death Star br br br Phase br In the first phase the Imperial March or another part of John Williams Star Wars score is briefly played electronically and the player engages in a dogfight with Darth Vader and enemy TIE fighters in outer space near the Death Star After the TIE fighter waves when flying towards the Death Star the yellow grid lines on the Death Star spell out either May the force be

towers rise to confront the player The player is awarded a bonus for destroying every turret br br br Phase br In the third phase the player must navigate the trench until finally firing a proton torpedo for a direct hit on the exhaust port target If the player is successful the Death Star explodes and the player is awarded a bonus shield to a maximum of six can be set internally for a maximum of eight Should the player fail to hit the exhaust port a shield is lost and the player must attempt the trench again If the player manages to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything but the exhaust port a bonus is awarded for using the Force br The game then resets to the first phase Each successive wave greatly increases the difficulty TIE fighters shoot more often artillery bunkers and laser towers appear in the second phase and obstacles appear in the trench during the third Unlike the movie where the units shoot beams similar to lasers the enemy units in this game shoot
