get one of the prisoners out of it The episode also took inspiration from the opening scene of the western film For a Few Dollars More as it features a sequence where a gang of bank robbers broke their leader El Indio out of a high security jail which would serve as inspiration for where the group manages to break Qin out from the prison The Mandalorian also takes inspiration from Batman for the part where he proceeds to capture his teammates having been betrayed by them The Mandalorian continues struggling with the responsibility of taking care of the Child concealing him as he allows the stranger mercenaries on board his ship However as the series continues about the increasing relationship of the lead Yost developed the story to continue the increase of the relationship of the
