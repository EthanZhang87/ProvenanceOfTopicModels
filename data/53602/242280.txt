The Galactic Republic commonly known as The Republic is a fictional political entity in the Star Wars universe that predates the formation of the Galactic Empire It is prominently featured in the prequel trilogy of Star Wars films offering a glimpse into its history and functioning In the original trilogy which takes place after the events of the prequels the Republic is referred to as the Old Republic suggesting its long established nature br The Republic is portrayed as a democratic republic that has sustained itself peacefully for over twenty five thousand years but was tied up in layers of bureaucracy It was mainly overseen by the Galactic Senate the Republic s legislative branch It was protected by the Jedi Order the Guardians of peace and justice throughout the Star Wars galaxy After the end of the Galactic Empire the New Republic was founded It was enforced by the original Rebel Alliance eventually known as the New Republic Military The consolidation of the New Republic is depicted in The Mandalorian as it sought to wipe out remnants of the Imperial forces and was eventually destroyed by the First Order under Supreme Leader Snoke s direction in Star Wars The Force Awakens br br br Fictional history canon br br br Fictional timeline canon br br In the Star Wars chronology the destruction of the first Death Star during the Battle of Yavin serves as a significant event used to establish the calendar era The battle is depicted in Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope the first film released in the franchise Following this event the conventional notation for standard years is BBY Before the Battle of Yavin and ABY After the Battle of Yavin Alternative notations such as BSW Before Star Wars Episode and ASW After Star Wars Episode may be used br br br Background br In the Star Wars universe the earliest history of the galaxy before the Republic is not extensively explored However it is believed that various species including humans evolved in the Core Worlds and eventually became dominant throughout the galaxy According to the hypothesis humans are thought to have originated from Coruscant a central planet in the Star Wars galaxy From there they settled in other Core Worlds such as Alderaan and eventually expanded their presence to colonize other planets across the galaxy According to Smith the origin of hyperdrive technology in the Star Wars galaxy is uncertain It is speculated that hyperdrive might have been invented by the humans of the Core Worlds or it could have been introduced to them by alien traders from the Unknown Regions Regardless of its origin there is a consensus that hyperspace travel predated the Republic and played a crucial role in enabling the formation of a galactic civilization It allowed for interstellar travel and facilitated the establishment of central governments spanning multiple planetary systems ultimately leading to the rise of the Galactic Republic br br br Old Republic br According to the large body of films and other fiction that belong to the Star Wars franchise the Old Republic was formed years before the events of Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope when the first Galactic Constitution was signed on Coruscant after hyperdrive connected many worlds in the Core and enabled the establishment of an interstellar central government Coruscant became the capital planet of the Old Republic the Galactic Empire and the New Republic and the entire surface evolved into one big city with skyscrapers reaching more than levels The Republic was made up of several hundred thousand worlds and each planet or system had representation in the Republic Senate which comprised most of the Republic s Legislative Branch and the government itself It started merely as an economic and protective alliance mainly among the Core worlds It eventually expanded to the Colonies and other outlying worlds and regions becoming a superpower rather than an alliance and it became the sole superpower in the galaxy The Core Worlds such as Coruscant and Alderaan were notable for their prosperity which was later matched by the Colonies while the Inner Rim and Expansion Region were a bit less secure and wealthy the Mid Rim was an unsafe region that saw much of the fighting Galactic Civil War on planets such as Naboo and Kashyyyk as it was far from the Republic s military concentrated in the Core The Outer Rim was the most unsafe place in the galaxy where neither the Republic nor the Empire ever gained much de facto hold leading to lawlessness widespread violence and crime syndicates many key battles of the Clone Wars took place here A large part of the Outer Rim including Tatooine was traditionally ruled by the Hutts and therefore called the Hutt Space br As the Republic expanded it came into contact with the slave empire of Zygerria Because slavery was disallowed in the Republic it disliked the Zygerrian Empire as slavery was central to the Empire s political and economic system conversely the Empire refused to become part of the Republic The Republic and Jedi declared war on the Empire and won The Empire was reduced to a small harmless alliance on Zygerria br br br Sith Empire and reforms br The Sith which formed in the Republic s early years return to their original strength and invaded Malachor The first Sith War began which led to the demise of the first Republic The power of the new Sith Empire increased as the Republic decreased The Republic and Jedi forces failed to keep the Empire s Forces out of Republic Space Soon the Sith became a second superpower Around this time an ancestor of Pre Vizsla stole the Darksaber from the Jedi Temple Around years prior to Star Wars the Dark Age began and the Old Republic was brought to the brink of collapse but with the Liberation of Coruscant the Sith Empire collapsed first After the Sith Empire was defeated c BBY the Republic now known as the Galactic Republic reformed and became a democracy It demilitarized at the Ruusan Reformation shortly after the Seventh Battle of Ruusan br br br High Republic br The multimedia project Star Wars The High Republic depicts the galaxy years before The Phantom Menace br The Republic began to diplomatically influence its neighboring worlds rather than conquer them by force This meant the Republic expanded slowly The Republic finally took control of the Mid Rim br Power blocs formed out of the Republic but the Jedi kept order The Republic became peaceful but corrupt and a Core Rim distrust formed After Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum came to power a standoff between the Trade Federation and the Republic led to the Invasion of Naboo BBY depicted in Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace br While the Republic flourished the Empire of Zygerria tried to cause a war known as the Zygerrian War However after a few minor battles the Zygerrians quickly withdrew their army since it stood no chance in this war br br br Separatist Crisis br br Several trade organizations represented in the Senate such as the Trade Federation and Commerce Guild kept armies of droids to protect their profits and occasionally took advantage of this such as when the Trade Federation invaded and occupied Naboo Individual sectors also maintained their security forces such as the Naboo Security Force or the CorSec from Corellia and these were sometimes used to combat small threats However there was no centralized and official military of the Republic The Trade Federation and other cartels within the Republic desired that the Republic government lack significant central military power so that it could not enforce any legal regulations on their business br Dissatisfied with several problems in the Republic such as ineffectual government heavy taxes and perceived favoritism of the Core Worlds over the Outer Rim planets the Confederacy of Independent Systems CIS was formed in BBY several systems seceded from the Republic and formed a new state thus triggering the Separatist Crisis The CIS was ostensibly headed by former Jedi Master Count Dooku although Palpatine was actually in command of both sides who gained much popularity among critics of the Republic after his scathing Raxus Address outlining the problems of the Republic leading many systems to side with him and form the Confederacy The Separatists became a huge threat to the Republic after some of the galaxy s mega corporations allied with the CIS as they possessed vast resources and private armies of battle droids A Military Creation Act was proposed in the Republic Senate strongly opposed by many of the Republic s pacifist leaders such as Padm Amidala the Queen of Naboo who feared the possibility of war But most of the Senate advocated a permanent official and central military to oppose the Separatist threat Supporters of the Act include Orn Free Taa of Ryloth and Ask Aak of Malastare br However a Clone Army had already been created in secret on the planet Kamino on the edge of the galaxy ten years earlier commissioned without authorization by Master Sifo Dyas a former Jedi perceiving chaos in the galaxy When it became clear the Confederacy had no intention of negotiating the Republic quickly accepted the Army made for them and it was dubbed the Grand Army of the Republic br br br Clone Wars br br Despite the high quality of its armaments and cloned troops the Republic s war effort was initially hindered because most of the major industrial companies in the galaxy had under the aegis of the Techno Union sided with the Confederacy Eventually though the Republic became a humongous superpower not only economically but also militarily The rapid militarization of the Republic during the Clone Wars overseen by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine had far reaching effects The Confederacy won most battles in the first year of the Clone Wars During the second and middle year of the Clone Wars however the Republic defended itself from Separatist attacks and retaliated with its own assaults many of which were successful During the third and final year of the Clone Wars the Republic won many offensive battles in the Mid Rim and pushed the Separatist forces back to the Outer Rim with its Outer Rim Sieges campaign br br br Fall of the Republic br During the Clone Wars the Senate increasingly granted enormous amounts of power to Palpatine who was the Commander in Chief Such actions were deemed justified in the name of security and were considered a perfectly reasonable way to increase the wartime government s efficiency Eventually Palpatine and his office gained enough political power to equal the Senate br Tension between Palpatine and the Jedi grew as the war progressed Many members of the Jedi Council remained skeptical of Palpatine s growing power In time the Jedi believed that Palpatine would not surrender his emergency powers nor his position which had long gone over term by the end of the war This suspicion was also shared by some senators including Padm Amidala of Naboo Bail Organa of Alderaan and Mon Mothma of Chandrila br After the death of Separatist leaders Count Dooku and General Grievous the Head of State and Commander of the Separatist Army respectively and the discovery that Palpatine was actually Darth Sidious the Sith Lord behind the war the Jedi activated their contingency plans br br br Order br A small group of experienced Jedi led by Mace Windu attempted to arrest Palpatine for treason Palpatine killed all but Windu with minimal effort and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel Windu appeared to have won but was prevented from executing Palpatine by the intervention of Anakin Skywalker at which point Palpatine killed Windu At that moment Skywalker took the title and name of Darth Vader pledging himself to the dark side as a Lord of the Sith br Shortly afterwards Palpatine secretly issued Order compelling the Clone army to exterminate all Jedi Because of inhibitor chips implanted inside the clones heads the clones were forced to kill most of the Jedi in what would later become known as the Great Jedi Purge The Jedi Padawans remaining on Coruscant were eliminated by Darth Vader formerly known as Anakin Skywalker and his personal legion br br br Galactic Empire vs Rebel Alliance br br Before the conclusion of the Clone Wars Palpatine addressed the Senate He related the story of an unsuccessful assassination attempt on his life by the Jedi Claiming that it was a rebellion and that their next move would be to kill all the Senators he declared the Jedi Order to be enemies of the Republic Palpatine announced that the Galactic Republic should be reorganized into the Galactic Empire and he should be the emperor for life Deluded by Palpatine s charisma and skill and perhaps also by his considerable dark side power the majority of the Senate cheered him on loudly in approval The official continuation of the Galactic Republic was the Galactic Empire br As the Clone Wars entered their final year Palpatine s once near unanimous support had begun to falter As depicted in the Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith novelization and deleted scenes from the film itself a bloc of senators began to emerge even before the Clone Wars end who opposed Palpatine s authoritarian rule and resented his treatment of the Jedi and other opponents This bloc originally led by influential politicians such as Bail Organa Mon Mothma and later by Bail s adopted daughter Princess Leia Organa eventually became the political voice of the emerging Rebel Alliance br During the war the Empire was supported by the Empire of the Zygerrians but since they were too weak to make a minor difference their support to the Galactic Empire is often overseen br br br New Republic br br The New Republic was a restoration of the Galactic Republic after the Galactic Empire was crushed following Palpatine s death and the destruction of the second Death Star in the Battle of Endor in ABY After the fall of the Emperor remnants of the Empire were ordered to initiate Operation Cinder a contingency plan created by Palpatine to annihilate both its organization its followers and its enemies as an act of punishment for failing to prevent his demise including the planets they have controlled The Rebels however prevented the Empire s self destruction in the Battle of Jakku finally ending Palpatine s reign over the galaxy In ABY part of the New Republic concerned about corruption emerging in the Senate and its unwillingness to see the First Order as a major threat created the Resistance to fight the First Order The New Republic is first portrayed onscreen in Star Wars The Force Awakens where it is depicted as the ruling government of the galaxy and primary target of the First Order a neo Imperialist military junta that sought to reclaim the Empire s legacy years after the events portrayed in Return of the Jedi the New Republic effectively collapsed when the First Order s Starkiller Base destroyed Hosnian Prime and the New Republic fleet and Senate with its phantom energy beam In Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker after the Battle of Exegol Rey a reformed Ben Solo and the Resistance have successfully put an end to the First Order the Sith Eternal and the resurrected Palpatine making way for the Republic to be reborn anew br br Legends br The successor government to the Empire was explored as early as Marvel Comics self titled Star Wars series which ran until The New Republic per se debuted in the Star Wars Legends novel Heir to the Empire by author Timothy Zahn br br br Institutions br br br Senate Chancellor and Jedi Order br br The Republic begins as a mutual protection and economic alliance among a number of planets in the Core Each member world or system chooses a Senator to represent them in the Galactic Senate the main body of the legislative branch of the government Senators are ambassadors of their homeworlds or systems Member worlds and systems maintain their governments and societies as long as it does not defy any central and core Republican laws There are a wide variety of different local governments along the political spectrum from monarchies to republics to hive like communes br When the Republic s power and influence expand many new areas of the galaxy are incorporated into the Republic The Core and Colonies are the base of the Galactic Republic A reorganization of senatorial representation occurs years prior to Star Wars during the Ruusan Reformation The most common organization for these new territories is to group regions into Sectors of about inhabited worlds Each sector is represented by a Senatorial Delegation When the number of sectors becomes too large sectors are organized into roughly a thousand regions each represented by one delegation to the Senate br The Senate serves as the unicameral main body of the legislative branch but has immense power over the entire Galactic Republic The capital of the Republic which contains the most political power and wealth is Coruscant br Inside the Senate Building there is an area in which the Senate debates casts votes and makes or passes bills It contains floating platforms each of which contain a senator and his or her aides Each platform in the senate represents a sector of the galaxy A few platforms represent individual worlds of high importance or worlds bringing special pleas to the Senate Some represent special interest groups such as the Trade Federation and other companies corporations and industries Each senatorial delegation has one vote br The members of the Senate elect a Supreme Chancellor from among their ranks who serves as the Senate s presiding officer and as the Republic s de facto leader The Chancellor is assisted by the Vice Chair who is presumably elected in the same manner as the Chancellor the same Vice Chair is present throughout the entire prequel trilogy The Senate follows pseudo parliamentary rules Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum was forced out of office by the Senate in a motion of no confidence introduced by Queen Padm Amidala of Naboo for example br Senators receive one vote in all matters procedural and substantive The Chancellor is elected from within the Senate for a set term The Senate gives the Chancellor emergency powers in times of crisis and removes him from office when necessary The assembly is in turn divided into individual committees each specializing in specific fields of government administration and which were responsible for creating legislation to be reviewed by the full assembly The Senate has some form of judicial power as well although the Republic has a judicial branch in which the Supreme Court was the main body br The main functions of the Senate are to mediate disputes between members provide for the common defense create and pass laws into effect that would benefit most of the Republic and regulate inter system trade The Jedi Order although technically not officially part of the Republic are considered the defenders of the general Republic The Republic often orders the Jedi to specific areas that require assistance In this way they are eventually the unofficial police force of the Republic They become representatives of the Senate as well to some extent br Despite the seemingly organized structure of the Republic the waning years of the Republic are a time of corruption and great social injustice The Senate becomes divided between those who genuinely wish to uphold the values and ideals of the Republic and those who wish to further their own goals Following a series of weak and ineffectual Chancellors there is a crisis involving the invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation over a tariff passed by the Senate br After Senator Palpatine of Naboo becomes Chancellor he increases the power of the office from acting as commander in chief of the Grand Army of the Republic or the Republic Military to the institution of his personal bodyguard organization the Red Guard The Office of the Supreme Chancellor is given power equaling that of the Senate The Galactic Senate also meets less often as the Chancellor is voted more emergency powers to act on his own during the time of crisis br Eventually many Outer Rim planets and companies leave the Republic due to the amount of corruption and unfair treatment to Outer Rim worlds Together they form a rebellion known as the Confederacy of Independent Systems almost exclusively referred to in the films as the Separatists Some large industrial companies including the Trade Federation side with the Separatists providing them with their military and its resources br br br Galactic politicians br Politicians include Senators the Supreme Chancellor the Vice Chair of the Senate the Administrative Aide various Representatives from systems and to an unofficial extent the members of the Jedi Council Jedi Council members hold special status as they appear to have the ability to watch Senate meetings and advise such Senators on various matters The Jedi order protects these people br br br Military br While the Republic had an Army and Navy for thousands of years after the Rusaan Reformations the Republic does not maintain a military except for a small force known as the Judicial Forces br br br Palpatine and the Jedi br The Jedi with the most authority served on the Jedi High Council among whom Yoda and Mace Windu act as de facto leaders at the height of the Republic Although the Senate holds some degree of political authority over the Jedi very little pressure was ever put on the council before Palpatine took office and demanded that Anakin Skywalker become a member of the Council in Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith despite the misgivings of the Jedi While the Jedi Council allowed Anakin to sit among them they did not grant him the rank of Master br br br Reception and analysis br br The story of the Galactic Republic s rise fall and resurrection have been compared to those of the real world Roman Republic and Weimar Germany The story of its fall and redemption has also been compared to that of Anakin Skywalker br Brake and Chase compared the hypothesized colonization of the Core Worlds by Coruscanti humans to the state of the space colonisation by humans from the Earth which had taken its first step with NASA s Apollo program of just before George Lucas invented Star Wars They argued that Lucas offered a solution to the Fermi paradox indeed most of the Star Wars galaxy was conquered colonized and submitted to the central government of the Republic rather quickly by the expansionist humans from the Core Worlds soon after they acquired the necessary rocket technology for interstellar travel but there are still large uncharted Unknown Regions which are simply too far from the fashionable Core Worlds to have been fully explored as exploration of the Unknown Regions is lethally dangerous let alone colonized Thus it s possible that the Solar System is also situated in the Milky Way s version of the Unknown Regions and that even if there are other species in the Milky Way which may even have established a Star Wars like Galactic Republic or Empire the Earth and its human civilization have so far been in uncharted and dangerous hyperspace travel territory from that galactic civilization s point of view and humans themselves are still too technologically limited to make contact with it br Silvio posits that Star Wars films should be understood as being heavily influenced by the time in which they were created The prequel trilogy where the Galactic Republic was first depicted was influenced by the presidency of George W Bush including the war on terror the Iraq War and the increased U S security apparatus with the Patriot Act Anakin Skywalker s line If you re not with me then you re my enemy is an echo of Bush s war on terror dichotomy that Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists George Lucas even confirmed that Padm Amidala s line So this is how liberty dies to thunderous applause invokes the Bush administration s passing of the Patriot Act and Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without public scrutiny br br br Appearances in the chronological order br The Acolyte present br Star Wars The Phantom Menace First appearance br Star Wars Attack of the Clones br Star
