BB or Beebee Ate is a droid character in the Star Wars franchise He appeared in the three films of the sequel trilogy Star Wars The Force Awakens Star Wars The Last Jedi and Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker He also appeared as a major supporting character in the animated series Star Wars Resistance appearing in the first episodes of season and in the short film Rogue Not Quite One He is a BB astromech droid serving the Resistance and is owned by Poe Dameron Spherical with a free moving domed head BB is portrayed by both a rod puppet and a remote controlled robotic unit The character has been well received by critics and fans and has become one of the most beloved and recognizable characters of the Star Wars saga in recent years br br br Conception br br br Idea and design br BB s design was based on a sketch by The Force Awakens director J J Abrams According to special effects artist Neal Scanlan It was a very simple sketch beautiful in its simplicity of a ball with this little dome on top His design included asymmetrical panels to make it easier for the viewer to track motion because Scanlan says If you had parallel patterns that ran around the circumference they would be less informative as to the direction BB was traveling br Abrams also named the character saying I named him BB because it was almost onomatopoeia It was sort of how he looked to me with the obviously and then the two B s The name was conceived early on in the film s production and was one of the few to remain unchanged Before receiving his final name the droid was nicknamed Surly by the pre production team br br br Constraints and realization br In August The Force Awakens cinematographer Daniel Mindel and Episode VIII director Rian Johnson each stated that Abrams would use little computer generated imagery CGI and more practical traditional special effects in order to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars film To that end the droid BB was a physical prop developed by Disney Research created by Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors Seven BB puppets were constructed for filming The most prominent was a rod puppet controlled by puppeteers Dave Chapman and Brian Herring In addition there were several radio controlled units and some static prop versions A fully functioning self contained robotic unit was not practical for shooting so most of the walking scenes were achieved by the puppet with rods removed in post production Later a self standing remote controlled unit was constructed and used at promotional events br br br Description br BB is a spherical robot with a free moving domed head It is white with orange and silver accents and a black optical lens on its headpiece BB also possesses multiple panels containing various tools or ports Scanlan said of the robot s personality We always imagined BB as being quite manipulative I think he knows he s cute He knows that he can win people over And he uses that like children do to get his own way In this film he has a very important mission that he has to accomplish and so he uses his personality his coyness and all of those things Of BB s gender he said I m still not sure dare I say whether BB is male or female BB was female in our eyes And then he or she became male And that s all part of the evolution not only visually but in the way they move how they hold themselves br Calling the robot a Swiss Army Knife that shouldn t be trusted he noted that while each of the BB s panels has a specific purpose like a port or tool not all of them have been absolutely defined to leave options for future films br br br Voice br The voice of BB was supplied by comedians Bill Hader and Ben Schwartz both credited as BB vocal consultants in the film The effect was created by Abrams manipulating Hader and Schwartz s voices through a talkbox attached to an iPad running a sound effects app br br br Appearances br br br In film br br br The Force Awakens
