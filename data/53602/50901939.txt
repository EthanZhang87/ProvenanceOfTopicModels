into a story in Clone Wars br Supervising director of The Clone Wars Dave Filoni stated We wanted a brother sister duo on Onderon and the character Saw was a character that George had already created and he just wanted to involve and tell a little more about that character So in the course of that we created Steela to be Saw s sister who would act as a natural foil to Ahsoka br Andrew Kishino who voiced Saw in The Clone Wars said that the character Has even sort of embodied in him that feisty spirit of the Rebellion The take no garbage kind of individual He s stoic and strong and brash He s that guy and it s that kind of strength tempered with Steela s calm level headed thinking that is to stand up to something that will ultimately become the Empire absolutely critical and necessary br
