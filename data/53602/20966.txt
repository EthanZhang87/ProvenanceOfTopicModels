Marvel Comics is an American comic book publisher and the property of The Walt Disney Company since December and a subsidiary of Disney Publishing Worldwide since March Marvel was founded in by Martin Goodman as Timely Comics and by had generally become known as Atlas Comics The Marvel era began in August with the launch of The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee Jack Kirby Steve Ditko and many others The Marvel brand which had been used over the years and decades was solidified as the company s primary brand br Marvel counts among its characters such well known superheroes as Spider Man Iron Man Wolverine Captain America Black Widow Thor Hulk Daredevil Doctor Strange Black Panther and Captain Marvel as well as popular superhero teams such as the Avengers X Men Fantastic Four and Guardians of the Galaxy Its stable of well known supervillains includes the likes of Doctor Doom Magneto Green Goblin Red Skull Loki Ultron Thanos Kang the Conqueror Venom and Galactus Most of Marvel s fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe with most locations mirroring real life places many major characters are based in New York City New York United States Additionally Marvel has published several licensed properties from other companies This includes Star Wars comics twice from to and again since br br br History br br br Timely Publications br br br Pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman created the company later known as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in Goodman who had started with a Western pulp in was expanding into the emerging and by then already highly popular new medium of comic books Launching his new line from his existing company s offices at West nd Street New York City he officially held the titles of editor managing editor and business manager with Abraham Goodman Martin s brother officially listed as publisher br Timely s first publication Marvel Comics cover dated Oct included the first appearance of Carl Burgos android superhero the Human Torch and the first appearances of Bill Everett s anti hero Namor the Sub Mariner among other features The issue was a great success it and a second printing the following month sold a combined nearly copies While its contents came from an outside packager Funnies Inc Timely had its own staff in place by the following year The company s first true editor writer artist Joe Simon teamed with artist Jack Kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes Captain America in Captain America Comics March It too proved a hit with sales of nearly one million Goodman formed Timely Comics Inc beginning with comics cover dated April or Spring br While no other Timely character would achieve the success of these three characters some notable heroes many of which continue to appear in modern day retcon appearances and flashbacks include the Whizzer Miss America the Destroyer the original Vision and the Angel Timely also published one of humor cartoonist Basil Wolverton s best known features Powerhouse Pepper as well as a line of children s talking animal comics featuring characters like Super Rabbit and the duo Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal br Goodman hired his wife s year old cousin Stanley Lieber as a general office assistant in When editor Simon left the company in late Goodman made Lieber by then writing pseudonymously as Stan Lee interim editor of the comics line a position Lee kept for decades except for three years during his military service in World War II Lee wrote extensively for Timely contributing to a number of different titles br Goodman s business strategy involved having his various magazines and comic books published by a number of corporations all operating out of the same office and with the same staff One of these shell companies through which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel Comics by at least Marvel Mystery Comics May As well some comics covers such as All Surprise Comics Winter were labeled A Marvel Magazine many years before Goodman would formally adopt the name in br br br Magazine Management Atlas Comics br br The post war American comic market saw superheroes falling out of fashion Goodman s comic book line dropped them for the most part and expanded into a wider variety of genres than even Timely had published featuring horror Westerns humor talking animal men s adventure drama giant monster crime and war comics and later adding jungle books romance titles espionage and even medieval adventure Bible stories and sports br Goodman began using the globe logo of the Atlas News Company the newsstand distribution company he owned on comics cover dated November even though another company Kable News continued to distribute his comics through the August issues This globe branding united a line put out by the same publisher staff and freelancers through shell companies from Animirth Comics to Zenith Publications br Atlas rather than innovate took a proven route of following popular trends in television and films Westerns and war dramas prevailing for a time drive in film monsters another time and even other comic books particularly the EC horror line Atlas also published a plethora of children s and teen humor titles including Dan DeCarlo s Homer the Happy Ghost similar to Casper the Friendly Ghost and Homer Hooper la Archie Andrews Atlas unsuccessfully attempted to revive superheroes from late to mid with the Human Torch art by Syd Shores and Dick Ayers variously the Sub Mariner drawn and most stories written by Bill Everett and Captain America writer Stan Lee artist John Romita Sr Atlas did not achieve any breakout hits and according to Stan Lee Atlas survived chiefly because it produced work quickly cheaply and at a passable quality br In Goodman switched distributors to the American News Company which shortly afterward lost a Justice Department lawsuit and discontinued its business Atlas was left without distribution and was forced to turn to Independent News the distribution arm of its biggest rival National DC Comics which imposed draconian restrictions on Goodman s company As then Atlas editor Stan Lee recalled in a interview We had been turning out books a month maybe more and suddenly we went to either eight or books a month which was all Independent News Distributors would accept from us br br br Marvel Comics br br The first modern comic books under the Marvel Comics brand were the science fiction anthology Journey into Mystery and the teen humor title Patsy Walker both cover dated June which each displayed an MC box on its cover Then in the wake of DC Comics success in reviving superheroes in the late s and early s particularly with the Flash Green Lantern Batman Superman Wonder Woman Green Arrow and other members of the team the Justice League of America Marvel followed suit br In writer editor Stan Lee revolutionized superhero comics by introducing superheroes designed to appeal to older readers than the predominantly child audiences of the medium thus ushering what Marvel later called the Marvel Age of Comics Modern Marvel s first superhero team the titular stars of The Fantastic Four Nov broke convention with other comic book archetypes of the time by squabbling holding grudges both deep and petty and eschewing anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status Subsequently Marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated This applied to The Amazing Spider Man title in particular which turned out to be Marvel s most successful book Its young hero suffered from self doubt and mundane problems like any other teenager something with which many readers could identify br Stan Lee and freelance artist and eventual co plotter Jack Kirby s Fantastic Four originated in a Cold War culture that led their creators to revise the superhero conventions of previous eras to better reflect the psychological spirit of their age Eschewing such comic book tropes as secret identities and even costumes at first having a monster as one of the heroes and having its characters bicker and complain in what was later called a superheroes in the real world approach the series represented a change that proved to be a great success br Marvel often presented flawed superheroes freaks and misfits unlike the perfect handsome athletic heroes found in previous traditional comic books Some Marvel heroes looked like villains and monsters such as the Hulk and the Thing This naturalistic approach even extended into topical politics Comics historian Mike Benton also noted br br In the world of rival DC Comics Superman comic books communism did not exist Superman rarely crossed national borders or involved himself in political disputes From to there were more communists in Marvel Comics than on the subscription list of Pravda Communist agents attack Ant Man in his laboratory red henchmen jump the Fantastic Four on the moon and Viet Cong guerrillas take potshots at Iron Man br All these elements struck a chord with the older readers including college aged adults In Spider Man and the Hulk were both featured in Esquire magazine s list of college campus heroes alongside John F Kennedy and Bob Dylan In writer Geoff Boucher reflected that br br Superman and DC Comics instantly seemed like boring old Pat Boone Marvel felt like The Beatles and the British Invasion It was Kirby s artwork with its tension and psychedelia that made it perfect for the times or was it Lee s bravado and melodrama which was somehow insecure and brash at the same time br In addition to Spider Man and the Fantastic Four Marvel began publishing further superhero titles featuring such heroes and antiheroes as the Hulk Thor Ant Man Iron Man the X Men Daredevil the Inhumans Black Panther Doctor Strange Captain Marvel and the Silver Surfer and such memorable antagonists as Doctor Doom Magneto Galactus Loki the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus all existing in a shared reality known as the Marvel Universe with locations that mirror real life cities such as New York Los Angeles and Chicago br Marvel even lampooned itself and other comics companies in a parody comic Not Brand Echh a play on Marvel s dubbing of other companies as Brand Echh la the then common phrase Brand X br Originally the company s publications were branded by a minuscule Mc on the upper right hand corner of the covers However artist writer Steve Ditko put a larger masthead picture of the title character of The Amazing Spider Man on the upper left hand corner on issue that included the series issue number and price Lee appreciated the value of this visual motif and adapted it for the company s entire publishing line This branding pattern being typically either a full body picture of the characters solo titles or a collection of the main characters faces in ensemble titles would become standard for Marvel for decades br br br Cadence Industries ownership br In while selling million comic books a year company founder Goodman revised the constraining distribution arrangement with Independent News he had reached under duress during the Atlas years allowing him now to release as many titles as demand warranted Late that year he sold Marvel Comics and its parent company Magazine Management to the Perfect Film Chemical Corporation later known as Cadence Industries though he remained as publisher In Goodman finally ended his distribution deal with Independent by signing with Curtis Circulation Company br In the United States Department of Health Education and Welfare approached Marvel Comics editor in chief Stan Lee to do a comic book story about drug abuse Lee agreed and wrote a three part Spider Man story portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous However the industry s self censorship board the Comics Code Authority refused to approve the story because of the presence of narcotics deeming the context of the story irrelevant Lee with Goodman s approval published the story regardless in The Amazing Spider Man May July without the Comics Code seal The market reacted well to the storyline and the CCA subsequently revised the Code the same year br Goodman retired as publisher in and installed his son Chip as publisher Shortly thereafter Lee succeeded him as publisher and also became Marvel s president for a brief time During his time as president he appointed his associate editor prolific writer Roy Thomas as editor in chief Thomas added Stan Lee Presents to the opening page of each comic book br br A series of new editors in chief oversaw the company during another slow time for the industry Once again Marvel attempted to diversify and with the updating of the Comics Code published titles themed to horror The Tomb of Dracula martial arts Shang Chi Master of Kung Fu sword and sorcery Conan the Barbarian in Red Sonja satire Howard the Duck and science fiction A Space Odyssey Killraven in Amazing Adventures Battlestar Galactica Star Trek and late in the decade the long running Star Wars series Some of these were published in larger format black and white magazines under its Curtis Magazines imprint br Marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line Marvel pulled ahead of rival DC Comics in during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux Goodman increased the price and size of Marvel s November cover dated comics from cents for pages total to cents for pages DC followed suit but Marvel the following month dropped its comics to cents for pages offering a lower priced product with a higher distributor discount br In Perfect Film Chemical renamed itself as Cadence Industries and renamed Magazine Management as Marvel Comics Group Goodman now disconnected from Marvel set up a new company called Seaboard Periodicals in reviving Marvel s old Atlas name for a new Atlas Comics line but this lasted only a year and a half br In the mid s a decline of the newsstand distribution network affected Marvel Cult hits such as Howard the Duck fell victim to the distribution problems with some titles reporting low sales when in fact the first specialty comic book stores resold them at a later date But by the end of the decade Marvel s fortunes were reviving thanks to the rise of direct market distribution selling through those same comics specialty stores instead of newsstands br Marvel ventured into audio in with a radio series and a record both had Stan Lee as narrator The radio series was Fantastic Four The record was Spider Man Rock Reflections of a Superhero concept album for music fans br br Marvel held its own comic book convention Marvelcon in spring and promised a Marvelcon At the event Stan Lee used a Fantastic Four panel discussion to announce that Jack Kirby the artist co creator of most of Marvel s signature characters was returning to Marvel after having left in to work for rival DC Comics In October Marvel which already licensed reprints in different countries including the UK created a superhero specifically for the British market Captain Britain debuted exclusively in the UK and later appeared in American comics During this time Marvel and the Iowa based Register and Tribune Syndicate launched a number of syndicated comic strips The Amazing Spider Man Howard the Duck Conan the Barbarian and The Incredible Hulk None of the strips lasted past except for The Amazing Spider Man which is still being published br In Jim Shooter became Marvel s editor in chief Although a controversial personality Shooter cured many of the procedural ills at Marvel including repeatedly missed deadlines During Shooter s nine year tenure as editor in chief Chris Claremont and John Byrne s run on the Uncanny X Men and Frank Miller s run on Daredevil became critical and commercial successes Shooter brought Marvel into the rapidly evolving direct market institutionalized creator royalties starting with the Epic Comics imprint for creator owned material in introduced company wide crossover story arcs with Contest of Champions and Secret Wars and in launched the ultimately unsuccessful New Universe line to commemorate the th anniversary of the Marvel Comics imprint Star Comics a children oriented line differing from the regular Marvel titles was briefly successful during this period although hampered by legal action by the owners of the recently defunct Harvey Comics for purposefully plagiarizing their house style br br br Marvel Entertainment Group ownership br In Marvel s parent Marvel Entertainment Group was sold to New World Entertainment which within three years sold it to MacAndrews and Forbes owned by Revlon executive Ronald Perelman in In Perelman took MEG public Following the rapid rise of this stock Perelman issued a series of junk bonds that he used to acquire other entertainment companies secured by MEG stock br br Marvel earned a great deal of money with their s children s comics imprint Star Comics and they earned a great deal more money and worldwide success during the comic book boom of the early s launching the successful line of comics set in the future Spider Man etc and the creatively daring though commercially unsuccessful Razorline imprint of superhero comics created by novelist and filmmaker Clive Barker In Marvel began selling Marvel Universe Cards with trading card maker SkyBox International These were collectible trading cards that

November Rosenberg sold Malibu to Marvel In purchasing Malibu Marvel now owned computer coloring technology that had been developed by Rosenberg and also integrated the Ultraverse line of comics and the Genesis Universe into Marvel s multiverse Earlier that year the company secured a deal with Harvey Comics whereas Marvel took on the publishing and distribution of Harvey s titles br In late Marvel acquired the comic book distributor Heroes World Distribution to use as its own exclusive distributor As the industry s other major publishers made exclusive distribution deals with other companies the ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major distributor in North America Diamond Comic Distributors Inc Then by the middle of the decade the industry had slumped and in December MEG filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection In early when Marvel s Heroes World endeavor failed Diamond also forged an exclusive deal with Marvel giving the company its own section of its comics catalog Previews br Marvel in the early to mid s expanded their entries in other media including Saturday morning cartoons and various comics collaborations to explore new genres In they

media genre comics including a Christian superhero named The Illuminator they made adaptions of Christian novels too including In His Steps The Screwtape Letters and The Pilgrim s Progress In Marvel had some of its titles participate in Heroes Reborn a crossover that allowed Marvel to relaunch some of its flagship characters such as the Avengers and the Fantastic Four and outsource them to the studios of two of the former Marvel artists turned Image Comics founders Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld The relaunched titles which saw the characters transported to a parallel universe with a history distinct from the mainstream Marvel Universe were a solid success amidst a generally struggling industry br br br Marvel Enterprises br In Toy Biz bought Marvel Entertainment Group to end the

comics line br In the company launched the imprint Marvel Knights taking place with reduced Marvel continuity according to one history with better production quality The imprint was helmed by soon to
