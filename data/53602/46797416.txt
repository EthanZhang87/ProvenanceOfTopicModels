and Tales of the Jedi br In the Star Wars universe Kanan is a Jedi Padawan who survived the Great Jedi Purge after his master Depa Billaba sacrificed herself to save him From that point onwards Kanan lived most of his life on the run hiding from the Galactic Empire before eventually meeting Hera Syndulla and joining the Ghost crew as its de facto leader Although he initially keeps his Force abilities hidden from his comrades he re embraces his Jedi role after meeting Ezra Bridger whom he begins training in the Jedi arts while also attempting to complete his own training and become a Jedi Knight Later Kanan and his crew join the Rebel Alliance to assist them in their fight against the Empire While Kanan ultimately sacrifices himself to save his friends his legacy lives on through their memories of him as well as his and Hera s son Jacen Syndulla br br br Creation and development br br br Concept br Executive producer Dave Filoni describes the character as a cowboy Jedi Animation supervisor Keith Kellogg said He is a Jedi but he s not a Jedi in the traditional sense that we ve had before on the show He s a little more rough around the edges He s kept his lightsaber locked away so he hasn t used it in a long time After being blinded Kanan has been compared to the Star Wars Legends character Rahm Kota from Star Wars The Force Unleashed another blinded Jedi which led Pablo Hidalgo from the Lucasfilm story group to say on Twitter that both characters were inspired by Zatoichi Filoni compared Kanan to Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings The character s name was inspired by a road in Malibu California called Kanan Dume Road br Prior to auditioning Prinze was unaware that he was about to audition for a Star Wars series he only learned of this immediately beforehand in the studio parking lot when an unknown legendary voice actor informed him what he was actually auditioning for Although Disney originally did not want Prinze in the role Filoni disagreed Prinze was officially hired later that day br During the development of the second season the character was originally slated to be killed by Maul in the episode Twilight of the Apprentice However Disney objected to the idea as they thought that the character should be in every episode of the series In regards to the character s eventual death in the episode Jedi Night of the fourth season of Star Wars Rebels Filoni felt this was a natural end to Kanan promising he will see Hera again before being blinded and said In that moment he s not bound as this material thing that the physicality of sight would be a limitation to him While sketching storyboards for Kanan s death Filoni became reluctant to kill the character but Prinze who was resolute about the fact that his character needed to die since the beginning of the series encouraged him to write the scene br br br Voice acting br Kanan is voiced by Freddie Prinze Jr in Star Wars Rebels Star Wars Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker and
