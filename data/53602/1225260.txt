the game until his brother Dellis Tantor discovers that the Empire killed their father Dellis is imprisoned by the Empire for revealing this information though Brenn is initially led to believe that

Chris Kramer of NextGen said Another in a long string of Star Wars misses Force Commander is not as bad as Rebellion but isn t even as good as Myth II or Warzone Brian Wright of GamePro said All in all Force Commander feels incomplete While a lot of care has gone into certain parts of the game much of it seems to have been thrown in without a second thought Star Wars fans will certainly get a
