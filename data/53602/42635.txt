Charles Milles Manson n Maddox November November was an American criminal cult leader and musician who led the Manson Family a cult based in California in the late s Some of the members committed a series of at least nine murders at four locations in July and August In Manson was convicted of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people including the film actress Sharon Tate The prosecution contended that while Manson never directly ordered the murders his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy br Before the murders Manson had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions While gathering his cult following he was a singer songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys who introduced Manson to record producer Terry Melcher In the Beach Boys recorded Manson s song Cease to Exist renamed Never Learn Not to Love as a single B side but without a credit to Manson Afterward Manson attempted to secure a record contract through Melcher but was unsuccessful br Manson would often talk about the Beatles including their eponymous album According to Los Angeles County District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi Manson felt guided by his interpretation of the Beatles lyrics and adopted the term Helter Skelter to describe an impending apocalyptic race war During his trial Bugliosi argued that Manson had intended to start a race war although Manson and others disputed this Contemporary interviews and trial witness testimony insisted that the Tate LaBianca murders were copycat crimes intended to exonerate Manson s friend Bobby Beausoleil Manson himself denied having ordered any murders br br br Early life br br br Childhood br Charles Milles Maddox was born on November to year old Ada Kathleen Maddox of Ashland Kentucky in the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center in Cincinnati Ohio Manson s biological father appears to have been Colonel Walker Henderson Scott Sr of Catlettsburg Kentucky against whom Maddox filed a paternity suit that resulted in an agreed judgment in Scott worked intermittently in local mills and had a local reputation as a con artist He allowed Maddox to believe that he was an army colonel although Colonel was merely his given name When Maddox told Scott that she was pregnant he informed her that he had been called away on army business after several months she realized he had no intention of returning Manson never knew his biological father br In August before Manson s birth Maddox married William Eugene Manson a laborer at a dry cleaning business Maddox often went on drinking sprees with her brother Luther Elbert Maddox leaving Charles with babysitters Maddox and her husband divorced on April after William alleged gross neglect of duty by Maddox Charles retained William s last name of Manson On August Kathleen and Luther were arrested for assault and robbery Kathleen and Luther were sentenced to five and ten years of imprisonment respectively br Manson was placed in the home of an aunt and uncle in McMechen West Virginia His mother was paroled in Manson later characterized the first weeks after she returned from prison as the happiest time in his life Weeks after her release Manson s family moved to Charleston West Virginia where he continually played truant and his mother spent her evenings drinking She was arrested for grand larceny but not convicted The family later moved to Indianapolis where Maddox met alcoholic Lewis Woodson Cavender Jr through Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and married him in August br br br First offenses br In an interview with Diane Sawyer Manson stated that when he was aged he set his school on fire He also got repeatedly in trouble for truancy and petty theft Although there was a lack of foster home placements in at the age of Manson was placed in the Gibault School for Boys in Terre Haute Indiana a school for male delinquents run by Catholic priests Gibault was a strict school where punishment for even the smallest infraction included beatings with either a wooden paddle or a leather strap Manson ran away from Gibault and slept in the woods under bridges and wherever else he could find shelter br Manson fled home to his mother and spent Christmas at his aunt and uncle s house in West Virginia However his mother returned him to Gibault Ten months later he ran away to Indianapolis It was there in Manson committed his first documented crime by robbing a grocery store at first to simply find something to eat However Manson found a cigar box containing just over a hundred dollars which he used to rent a room on Indianapolis Skid Row and to buy food br For a time Manson had a job delivering messages for Western Union in an attempt to live honestly However he quickly began to supplement his wages through theft He was eventually caught and in a sympathetic judge sent him to Boys Town a juvenile facility in Omaha Nebraska After four days at Boys Town he and fellow student Blackie Nielson obtained a gun and stole a car They used it to commit two armed robberies on their way to the home of Nielson s uncle in Peoria Illinois Nielson s uncle was a professional thief and when the boys arrived he allegedly took them on as apprentices Manson was arrested two weeks later during a nighttime raid on a Peoria store In the investigation that followed he was linked to his two earlier armed robberies He was sent to the Indiana Boys School a strict reform school outside of Plainfield Indiana br At the Indiana Boys School other students allegedly raped Manson with the encouragement of a staff member and he was repeatedly beaten He ran away from the school eighteen times Manson developed a self defense technique he later called the insane game in which he would screech grimace and wave his arms to convince stronger aggressors that he was insane After a number of failed attempts he escaped with two other boys in February The three escapees robbed filling stations while attempting to drive to California in stolen cars until they were arrested in Utah For the federal crime of driving a stolen car across state lines Manson was sent to Washington D C s National Training School for Boys On arrival he was given aptitude tests which determined that he was illiterate but had an above average IQ of His case worker deemed him aggressively antisocial br br br First imprisonment br On a psychiatrist s recommendation Manson was transferred in October to Natural Bridge Honor Camp a minimum security institution in Virginia His aunt visited him and told administrators she would let him stay at her house and help him find work Manson had a parole hearing scheduled for February However in January he was caught raping a boy at knifepoint Manson was transferred to the Federal Reformatory in Petersburg Virginia where he committed a further eight serious disciplinary offenses three involving homosexual acts He was then moved to a maximum security reformatory at Chillicothe Ohio where he was expected to remain until his release on his st birthday in November Good behavior led to an early release in May to live with his aunt and uncle in West Virginia br br In January Manson married a hospital waitress named Rosalie Rosie Jean Willis January August Around October about three months after he and his pregnant wife arrived in Los Angeles in a car he had stolen in Ohio Manson was again charged with a federal crime for taking the vehicle across state lines After a psychiatric evaluation he was given five years probation Manson s failure to appear at a Los Angeles hearing on an identical charge filed in Florida resulted in his March arrest in Indianapolis His probation was revoked and he was sentenced to three years imprisonment at Terminal Island in Los Angeles br While Manson was in prison Rosalie gave birth to their son Charles Manson Jr April June During his first year at Terminal Island Manson received visits from Rosalie and his mother who were now living together in Los Angeles In March when the visits from his wife ceased his mother informed him Rosalie was living with another man Less than two weeks before a scheduled parole hearing Manson tried to escape by stealing a car He was given five years probation and his parole was denied br br br Second imprisonment br Manson received five years parole in September the same year in which Rosalie received a decree of divorce By November he was pimping a year old girl and receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents In September he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to cash a forged U S Treasury check which he claimed to have stolen from a mailbox the latter charge was later dropped He received a ten year suspended sentence and probation after a young woman named Leona Rae Candy Stevens who had an arrest record for prostitution made a tearful plea before the court that she and Manson were deeply in love and would marry if Charlie were freed Before the year s end the woman did marry Manson possibly so she would not be required to testify against him br Manson took Leona and another woman to New Mexico for purposes of prostitution resulting in him being held and questioned for violating the Mann Act Though he was released Manson correctly suspected that the investigation had not ended When he disappeared in violation of his probation a bench warrant was issued An indictment for violation of the Mann Act followed in April Following the arrest of one of the women for prostitution Manson was arrested in June in Laredo Texas and was returned to Los Angeles For violating his probation on the check cashing charge he was ordered to serve his ten year sentence br Manson spent a year trying unsuccessfully to appeal the revocation of his probation In July he was transferred from the Los Angeles County Jail to the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island Washington There he took guitar lessons from Barker Karpis gang leader Alvin Creepy Karpis and obtained from another inmate the contact information of Phil Kaufman a producer at Universal Studios in Hollywood Among Manson s fellow prisoners during this time was future actor Danny Trejo with the two participating in several hypnosis sessions together Manson s mother moved to Washington State to be closer to him during his McNeil Island incarceration working nearby as a waitress br Although the Mann Act charge had been dropped the attempt to cash the Treasury check was still a federal offense Manson s September annual review noted he had a tremendous drive to call attention to himself an observation echoed in September In Leona was granted a divorce During the process she alleged that she and Manson had a son Charles Luther Manson According to a popular urban legend Manson auditioned unsuccessfully for the Monkees in late this is refuted by the fact that Manson was still incarcerated at McNeil Island at that time br In June Manson was sent for the second time to Terminal Island in preparation for early release By the time of his release day on March he had spent more than half of his thirty two years in prisons and other institutions This was mainly because he had broken federal laws Federal sentences were and remain much more severe than state sentences for many of the same offenses Telling the authorities that prison had become his home he requested permission to stay br br br San Francisco and cult formation br br br Parolee and patient br Less than a month after his release Manson moved to Berkeley from Los Angeles which could have been a probation violation Instead after calling the San Francisco probation office upon his arrival he was transferred to the supervision of criminology doctoral researcher and federal probation officer Roger Smith Until the spring of Smith worked at the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic HAFMC which Manson and his family came to frequent Roger Smith as well as the HAFMC s founder David Smith received funding from the National Institutes of Health and reportedly the CIA to study the effects of drugs like LSD and methamphetamine on the counterculture movement in San Francisco s Haight Ashbury District The patients at the HAFMC became subjects of their research including Manson and his expanding group of mostly female followers who came to see Roger Smith regularly br Manson received permission from Roger Smith to move from Berkeley to the Haight Ashbury District He first took LSD and would use it frequently during his time there David Smith who had studied the effects of LSD and amphetamines in rodents wrote that the change in Manson s personality during this time was the most abrupt Roger Smith had observed in his entire professional career Manson also read the book Stranger in a Strange Land a science fiction novel by Robert Heinlein Inspired by the burgeoning free love philosophy in Haight Ashbury during the Summer of Love Manson began preaching his own philosophy based on a mixture of Stranger in a Strange Land the Bible Scientology Dale Carnegie and the Beatles which quickly earned him a following He may have also borrowed some of his philosophy from the Process Church of the Final Judgment whose members believed Satan would become reconciled to Jesus and they would come together at the end of the world to judge humanity br br br Involvement with Scientology br Manson began studying Scientology while incarcerated with the help of fellow inmate Lanier Rayner and in July listed Scientology as his religion A September prison report argues that Manson appears to have developed a certain amount of insight into his problems through his study of this discipline Another prison report in August stated that Manson was no longer an advocate of Scientology Upon his release in Manson traveled to Los Angeles where he reportedly met local Scientologists and attended several parties for movie stars Manson completed hours of auditing His right hand man Bruce Davis worked at the Church of Scientology headquarters in London from November to April br br br San Francisco followers br br Shortly after relocating to San Francisco Manson became acquainted with Mary Brunner a year old graduate of University of Wisconsin Madison Brunner was working as a library assistant at the University of California Berkeley and Manson until that point making his living by panhandling moved in with her Manson then met teenaged runaway Lynette Fromme later nicknamed Squeaky and convinced her to live with him and Brunner According to a second hand account Manson overcame Brunner s initial resistance to him bringing other women in to live with them Before long they were sharing Brunner s residence with eighteen other women Manson targeted individuals for manipulation who were emotionally insecure and social outcasts br Manson established himself as a guru in Haight Ashbury which during the Summer of Love was emerging as the signature hippie locale Manson soon had the first of his groups of followers most of them female They were later dubbed as the Manson Family by Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi and the media Manson allegedly taught his followers that they were the reincarnation of the original Christians and that The Establishment could be characterized as the Romans br Sometime around Manson began using the alias Charles Willis Manson Before the end of summer he and some of his followers began traveling in an old school bus they had adapted putting colored rugs and pillows in place of the many seats they had removed They eventually settled in the Los Angeles areas of Topanga Canyon Malibu and Venice along the coast br In Brunner became pregnant by Manson On April she gave birth to their son whom she named Valentine Michael in a condemned house where they were living in Topanga Canyon She was assisted by several of the young women from the fledgling Family Brunner like most members of the group acquired a number of aliases and nicknames including Marioche Och Mother Mary Mary Manson Linda Dee Manson and Christine Marie Euchts xv br In his book Love Needs Care about his time at the HAFMC David Smith claimed that Manson attempted to reprogram his followers minds to submit totally to his will through the use of LSD and unconventional sexual practices that would turn his followers into empty vessels that would accept anything he poured Manson Family member Paul Watkins testified that Manson would encourage group LSD trips and take lower doses himself to keep his wits about him Watkins stated that Charlie s trip was to program us all to submit By the end of his stay in the Haight in April Manson had attracted twenty or so followers all under the supervision of Roger Smith and many of the staff at the HAFMC The core members of Manson s following eventually included Brunner Charles Tex Watson a musician and former actor Bobby Beausoleil a former musician and pornographic actor Susan Atkins Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten br br br Subsequent arrests br Supervised by his ostensible parole officer Roger Smith Manson grew his family through drug use and prostitution without interference from the authorities Manson was arrested on July for attempting to prevent the arrest of one of his followers Ruth Ann Moorehouse Instead of Manson being sent back to prison the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor and Manson was given three additional years of probation He avoided prosecution again in July when he and the family were arrested while moving to Los Angeles when his bus crashed into a ditch Manson and members of his family including Brunner and Manson s new born baby were found sleeping naked by police Afterwards he was again arrested and released only a few days later this time on a drug charge br br br Involvement with the Beach Boys br br On April Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys was driving through Malibu when he noticed two female hitchhikers Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey He picked them up and dropped them off at their destination On April Wilson noticed the same two girls hitchhiking again and this time took them to his home at Sunset Boulevard Wilson later recalled that he told the girls about our involvement with the Maharishi and they told me they too had a guru a guy named Charlie Manson who d recently come out of jail after twelve years Wilson then went to a recording session when he returned later that night he was met in his driveway by Manson and when Wilson walked into his home about a dozen people were occupying the premises most of them young women By Manson s own account he had met Wilson on at least one prior occasion at a friend s San Francisco house where Manson had gone to obtain marijuana Manson claimed that Wilson invited him to visit his home when Manson came to Los Angeles br Wilson was initially fascinated by Manson and his followers referring to him as the Wizard in a Rave magazine article at the time The two struck a friendship and over the next few months members of the Manson Family mostly women who were treated as servants were housed in Wilson s residence This arrangement persisted for about six months br Wilson introduced Manson to a few friends in the music business including the Byrds producer Terry Melcher Manson recorded numerous songs at Brian Wilson s home studio although the recordings remain unheard by the public Band engineer Stephen Desper said that the Manson sessions were done for Dennis Wilson and Terry Melcher In September Wilson recorded a Manson song for the Beach Boys originally titled Cease to Exist but reworked as Never Learn Not to Love as a single B side released the following December The writing was credited solely to Wilson When asked why Manson was not credited Wilson explained that Manson relinquished his publishing rights in favor of about a hundred thousand dollars worth of stuff Around this time the Family destroyed two of Wilson s luxury cars br Wilson eventually distanced himself from Manson and moved out of the Sunset Boulevard house leaving the Family there and subsequently took residence at a basement apartment in Santa Monica Virtually all of Wilson s household possessions were stolen by the Family the members were evicted from his home three weeks before the lease was scheduled to expire When Manson subsequently sought further contact he left a bullet with Wilson s housekeeper to be delivered with a threatening message br Band manager Nick Grillo recalled that Wilson became concerned after Manson had got into a much heavier drug situation taking a tremendous amount of acid and Dennis wouldn t tolerate it and asked him to leave It was difficult for Dennis because he was afraid of Charlie Writing in his memoir Mike Love recalled Wilson saying he had witnessed Manson shooting a black man in half with an M rifle and hiding the body inside a well Melcher said that Wilson had been aware that the Family were killing people and had been so freaked out he just didn t want to live anymore He was afraid and he thought he should have gone to the authorities but he didn t and the rest of it happened br br br Spahn Ranch br Manson established a base for the Family at the Spahn Ranch in August after their eviction from Wilson s residence The ranch had been a television and movie set for Westerns but the buildings had deteriorated by the late s The ranch then derived revenue primarily from selling horseback rides Female Family members did chores around the ranch and occasionally had sex on Manson s orders with the nearly blind year old owner George Spahn the women also acted as guides for him In exchange Spahn allowed Manson and his group to live at the ranch for free br br br Doomsday beliefs br br The Manson Family evolved into a doomsday cult when Manson became fixated on the idea of an imminent apocalyptic race war between America s Black minority and the larger White population A white supremacist Manson told some of the Family that Black people would rise up and kill the entire White population except for Manson and his followers but that they were not intelligent enough to survive on their own they would need a white man to lead them and so they would serve Manson as their master In late Manson adopted the term Helter Skelter taken from a song on the Beatles recently released White Album to refer to this upcoming war br br br Tate encounter br On March Manson entered the grounds of Cielo Drive which he had known as Melcher s residence He was not invited As he approached the main house Manson was met by Shahrokh Hatami an Iranian photographer who had befriended film director Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate during the making of the documentary Mia and Roman Hatami was there to photograph Tate before she departed for Rome the following day Seeing Manson approach Hatami had gone onto the front porch to ask him what he wanted Manson said that he was looking for Melcher whose name Hatami did not recognize Hatami told him the place was the Polanski residence and then advised him to try the path to the guest house beyond the main house Tate appeared behind Hatami in the house s front door and asked him who was calling Hatami and Tate maintained their positions while Manson went back to the guest house without a word returned to the front a minute or two later and left br That evening Manson returned to the property and again went to the guest house He entered the enclosed porch and spoke with Altobelli the owner who had just come out of the shower Manson asked for Melcher but Altobelli felt that Manson was actually looking for him It was later discovered that Manson had apparently been to the property on earlier occasions after Melcher left Altobelli told Manson through the screen door that Melcher had moved to Malibu and said that he did not know his new address although he did br Altobelli told Manson he was leaving the country the next day and Manson said he would like to speak with him upon his return Altobelli said that he would be gone for more than a year Manson said that he had been directed to the guest house by the persons in the main house Altobelli asked Manson not to disturb his tenants Altobelli and Tate flew together to Rome the next day Tate asked him whether that creepy looking guy had gone to see him at the guest house the day before br br br Crimes and trial br br br Crowe shooting br Tex Watson became involved in drug dealing and robbed a year old rival named Bernard Lotsapoppa Crowe Crowe allegedly responded with a threat to kill everyone at Spahn Ranch In response Manson shot Crowe on July at Manson s Hollywood apartment Manson s belief that he had killed Crowe was seemingly confirmed by a news report of the discovery of the dumped body of a Black Panther in Los Angeles br Although Crowe was not a member of the Black Panthers Manson concluded he had been and expected retaliation from the Panthers He turned Spahn Ranch into a defensive camp establishing night patrols by armed guards Watson would later write Blackie was trying to get at the chosen ones Manson brought in members of the Straight Satans Motorcycle Club to act as security br br br Hinman murder br year old Gary Alan Hinman a music teacher and graduate student at UCLA had previously befriended members of the Family and allowed some to occasionally stay at his home in Topanga Canyon According to Atkins Manson believed Hinman was wealthy and sent her Brunner and Beausoleil to Hinman s home to convince him to join the Family and turn over the assets Manson thought Hinman had inherited The three held Hinman hostage for two days in late July as he denied having any money During this time Manson arrived with a sword and slashed his face and ear After that Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death allegedly on Manson s instruction Before leaving the residence Beausoleil or one of the women used Hinman s blood to write political piggy on the wall and to draw a panther paw a Black Panther symbol br According to Beausoleil he came to Hinman s house to recover money paid to Hinman for mescaline provided to the Straight Satans that had supposedly been bad Beausoleil added that Brunner and Atkins unaware of his intent went along to visit Hinman Atkins in her autobiography wrote that Manson directed Beausoleil Brunner and her to go to Hinman s and get the supposed inheritance of She said that two days earlier Manson had told her privately that if she wanted to do something important she could kill Hinman and get his money Beausoleil was arrested on August after he was caught driving Hinman s car Police found the murder weapon in the tire well br br br Tate murders br On the night of August Watson took Atkins Krenwinkel and Linda Kasabian to Cielo Drive Watson later claimed that Manson had instructed him to go to the house and totally destroy everyone in it and to do it as gruesome as you can Manson told the women to do as Watson instructed them br The occupants of the Cielo Drive house that evening were Tate aged who was months pregnant her friend and former lover year old Jay Sebring a noted celebrity hairstylist Polanski s friend year old Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski s year old girlfriend Abigail Anne Folger heiress to the Folgers coffee fortune and daughter of Peter Folger Also present on the property were year old caretaker William Garretson and his friend year old Steven Earl Parent Polanski was in Europe working on a film Music producer Quincy Jones was a friend of Sebring who had planned to join him that evening before changing his mind br Watson and the three women arrived at Cielo Drive just past midnight on August Watson climbed a telephone pole near the entrance gate and cut the phone line to the house The group then backed their car to the bottom of the hill that led to the estate before walking back up to the house Thinking that the gate might be electrified or equipped with an alarm they climbed a brushy embankment to the right of the gate and entered the grounds br Headlights approached the group from within the property and Watson ordered the women to lie in the bushes He stepped out and ordered the approaching driver Parent to halt Watson leveled a caliber revolver at Parent who begged him not to hurt him claiming that he would not say anything Watson lunged at Parent with a knife giving him a defensive slash wound on the palm of his hand that severed tendons and tore the boy s watch off his wrist then shot him four times in the chest and abdomen killing him in the front seat of his white AMC Ambassador coupe Watson ordered the women to help push the car up the driveway br Watson next cut the screen of a window then told Kasabian to keep watch down by the gate she walked over to Parent s car and waited Watson removed the screen entered through the window and let Atkins and Krenwinkel in through the front door He whispered to Atkins and awoke Frykowski who was sleeping on the living room couch Watson kicked him in the head and Frykowski asked him who he was and what he was doing there Watson replied I m the devil and I m here to do the devil s business br On Watson s direction Atkins found the house s three other occupants with Krenwinkel s help and forced them to the living room Watson began to tie Tate and Sebring together by their necks with a long nylon rope which he had brought then slung it over one of the living room s ceiling beams Sebring protested the rough treatment of the pregnant Tate so Watson shot him Folger was taken momentarily back to her bedroom for her purse and she gave the murderers Watson then stabbed Sebring seven times Frykowski s hands had been bound with a towel but he freed himself and began struggling with Atkins who stabbed at his legs with a knife He fought his way out the front door and onto the porch but Watson caught up with him struck him over the head with the gun multiple times stabbed him repeatedly and shot him twice br Kasabian had heard horrifying sounds and moved toward the house from her position in the driveway She told Atkins that someone was coming in an attempt to stop the murders Inside the house Folger escaped from Krenwinkel and fled out a bedroom door to the pool area Krenwinkel pursued her and caught her on the front lawn where she stabbed her and tackled her to the ground Watson then helped kill her her assailants stabbed her a total of twenty eight times Frykowski struggled across the lawn but Watson continued to stab him killing him Frykowski suffered fifty one stab wounds he had also been struck thirteen times in the head with the butt of Watson s gun which bent the barrel and broke off one side of the gun grip which was recovered at the scene br In the house Tate pleaded to be allowed to live long enough to give birth and offered herself as a hostage in an attempt to save the life of her unborn child Instead both Atkins and Watson stabbed Tate sixteen times killing her The coroner s inquest found that Tate was still alive when she was hanged with the nylon rope although the cause of her death was determined as a massive hemorrhage while in Sebring s murder it was found that he was hanged lifeless br According to Watson Manson had told the women to leave a sign something witchy Atkins wrote pig on the front door in Tate s blood Atkins claims she did this to copycat the Hinman murder scene in order to get Beausoleil out of jail who was in custody for that murder br br br LaBianca murders br The four murderers plus Manson Leslie Van Houten and Clem Grogan went for a drive the following night Manson was allegedly displeased with the previous night s murders so he told Kasabian to drive to a house at Waverly Drive in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles Located next door to a home where Manson and Family members had attended a party the previous year it belonged to year old supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his year old wife Rosemary LaBianca co owner of a dress shop br According to Atkins and Kasabian Manson disappeared up the driveway and returned to say that he had tied up the house s occupants Watson Krenwinkel and Van Houten entered the property Watson claims in his autobiography that Manson went up alone then returned to take him up to the house with him Manson pointed out a sleeping man through a window and the two entered through the unlocked back door Watson claims Manson roused the sleeping Leno LaBianca from the couch at gunpoint and had Watson bind his hands with a leather thong Rosemary was brought into the living room from the bedroom and Watson covered the couple s heads with pillowcases which he bound in place with lamp cords Manson left and Krenwinkel and Van Houten entered the house br Watson had complained to Manson earlier of the inadequacy of the previous night s weapons Watson sent the women from the kitchen to the bedroom where Rosemary LaBianca had been returned while he went to the living room and began stabbing Leno LaBianca with a chrome plated bayonet The first thrust went into his throat Watson heard a scuffle in the bedroom and went in there to discover Rosemary LaBianca keeping the women at bay by swinging the lamp tied to her neck He stabbed her several times with the bayonet then returned to the living room and resumed attacking Leno whom he stabbed a total of twelve times He then carved the word WAR into his abdomen br Watson returned to the bedroom and found Krenwinkel stabbing Rosemary with a knife from the kitchen Van Houten stabbed her approximately sixteen times in the back and the exposed buttocks Van Houten claimed at trial that Rosemary LaBianca was already dead during the stabbing Evidence showed that many of the forty one stab wounds had in fact been inflicted post mortem Watson then cleaned off the bayonet and showered while Krenwinkel wrote Rise and Death to pigs on the walls and Healter sic Skelter on the refrigerator door all in LaBianca s blood She gave Leno LaBianca fourteen puncture wounds with an ivory handled two tined carving fork which she left jutting out of his stomach She also planted a steak knife in his throat br Meanwhile Manson drove the other three Family members who had departed Spahn with him that evening to the Venice home of the Lebanese actor Saladin Nader Manson left them there and drove back to Spahn Ranch leaving them and the LaBianca killers to hitchhike home According to Kasabian Manson wanted his followers to murder Nader in his apartment but Kasabian claims she thwarted this murder by deliberately knocking on the wrong apartment door and waking a stranger The group abandoned the murder plan and left but Atkins defecated in the stairwell on the way out br br br Shea murder br year old Hollywood stuntman Donald Jerome Shorty Shea was murdered on August more than two weeks after the Tate LaBianca murders when Manson told Shea Bruce Davis Tex Watson and Steve Grogan to go on a ride to a nearby car parts yard on the Spahn Ranch According to Davis he sat in the back seat with Grogan who then hit Shea with a pipe wrench and Watson stabbed him They brought Shea down a hill behind the ranch and stabbed and brutally tortured him to death Bruce Davis recalled at his parole hearings br br I was in the car when Steve Grogan hit Shorty with the pipe wrench Charles Watson stabbed him I was in the backseat with with Grogan They took Shorty out They had to go down the hill to a place I stayed in the car for quite a while but what then I went down the hill later on and that s when I cut Shorty on the shoulder with the knife after he was well I don t know I I don t know if he was dead or not He didn t bleed when I cut him on the shoulder br When I showed up you know he was he was incapacitated I don t know if you asked if he was unconscious I don t know He may or may not have been He didn t seem conscious He wasn t moving or saying anything And it started off Manson handed me a machete as if I was supposed to I mean I know what he wanted But you know I couldn t do that And I in fact I did touch Shorty Shea with a machete on the back of his neck didn t break the skin I mean I just couldn t do it And then I threw the knife and he handed me a bayonet and it I just reached over and I don t know which side it was on but I cut him right about here on the shoulder just with the tip of the blade Sort of like saying Are you satisfied Charlie br br And I turned around and walked away And I I was sick for about two or three days I mean I couldn t even think about what I what I had done br In December Shea s skeletal remains were discovered on a nondescript hillside near Santa Susana Road next to Spahn Ranch after Grogan one of those convicted of the murder agreed to aid authorities in the recovery of Shea s body by drawing a map to its location According to the autopsy report his body suffered multiple stab and chopping wounds to the chest and blunt force trauma to the head br br br Suspected murders br br In total Manson and his followers were convicted of nine counts of first degree murder However the LAPD believes that the Family could have claimed up to at least twelve more victims Cliff Shepard a former LAPD Robbery Homicide Division detective said that Manson repeatedly claimed to have killed many others Prosecutor Stephen Kay supported this assertion I know that Manson one time told one of his cellmates that he was responsible for murders Tate s younger sister Debra Tate has also claimed that investigators are just scraping the surface when it comes to the number of Manson s victims and has further elaborated on how Manson sent her a taunting map of the Panamint Range with crosses on it that she believed were meant to represent buried bodies This has resulted in several excavations that have been undertaken at Manson s Barker Ranch but they have not resulted in any bodies being found br br Nancy Warren and Clyda Dulaney were both found near Ukiah California at the antique store owned by Warren on October They had both been beaten and strangled to death with thirty six leather thongs After the Family members were arrested they became suspects when it was discovered that members of the Family had been in the Ukiah area at the time of the murders However no one in the Family was ever charged with the murders and no arrests were ever made in the case br Marina Elizabeth Habe was murdered on December She was a student at the University of Hawaii home on vacation when she was murdered in Los Angeles According to the autopsy report Habe s throat had been slashed and she had received numerous knife wounds to the chest She suffered multiple contusions to the face and throat and had been garrotted There was no evidence of rape Habe was abducted outside the home of her mother in West Hollywood Cynthia Avenue A former Manson Family associate claimed members of the Family had known Habe and it was conjectured she had been one of their victims br Darwin Morell Scott was the uncle of Manson and the brother of Manson s father Colonel Scott On May Scott was found brutally stabbed to death in his Ashland Kentucky apartment His body was pinned to the kitchen floor with a butcher knife and he had been stabbed nineteen times After Manson s arrest it was reported that local residents claimed to have seen a man resembling Manson using the alias Preacher in the area at the time Darwin was murdered Manson was on parole in California at the time of the murder but the murder occurred when Manson was out of touch with his parole officers br Mark Walts was an acquaintance of the Family members and was even known to associate with them at the Spahn Ranch On July Walts hitchhiked to the Santa Monica Pier so he could go fishing His fishing pole was found abandoned at the pier and his body was found the next day near Mulholland Drive He had been shot three times in the chest Though the Family was reportedly shocked by Walts murder his brother was convinced that Manson was responsible for his death and even called him in order to directly accuse him of his murder The Los Angeles Sheriff s Department investigated Spahn Ranch in regard to Walts murder but no links were found and the murder was never solved br John Philip Haught was an Ohio native who had moved to California and met Manson in the summer of He joined the Manson Family and was amongst the group who was arrested in the October raid of the clan for the Tate LaBianca murders Manson suspected him of being an informant On November Haught was associating with some members of the Family According to all present Haught suddenly found a gun in the room picked it up and promptly shot himself while attempting a game of Russian roulette However when police investigated the death they found that the gun rather than having zero bullets and one spent shell casing instead contained seven bullets and one spent shell Moreover the gun had been wiped free of prints Additionally a male witness who had held Haught s head after the shooting told Cohen he had entered the room to find a female Manson follower with the gun in her hand Despite this police concluded Haught had actually killed himself br James Sharp and Doreen Gaul were both found stabbed to death in an alley in Los Angeles on November The murder of the two young Scientologists involved both being stabbed between fifty and sixty times Police immediately noted the similarities to these murders and those of the Tate LaBianca murders the killings of Sharp and Gaul happened close to where the Labianca s lived In Helter Skelter author Vincent Bugliosi wrote that Gaul was rumoured to be a former girlfriend of Manson Family member Bruce Davis Davis had lived at the same housing complex as Gaul but in a police interview he denied knowing her br Reet Jurvetson was a young woman found stabbed to death on November Her body was found with over one hundred and fifty stab wounds from a penknife to her neck and upper body along with defensive wounds on her hands and arms She had been disposed of along Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles California Some witnesses claimed to have seen a woman named Sherry who matched Jurvetson s description among members of the Manson Family but it turned out that this individual was alive Manson himself denied any involvement in killing Jurvetson Detectives within the Los Angeles Police Department have noted striking similarities between the method of murder of both Jurvetson and Habe but no firm connection between both murders has ever been established br Joel Pugh was found dead in the Talgarth Hotel in London England on December His wrists had been cut and his throat was slit twice British authorities listed the death a drug induced suicide saying Pugh had been depressed Pugh was a Family member who was married to another member of the Family Sandra Good Stephen Kay and others claim Manson hated Pugh He had no reason to commit suicide and Manson was very unhappy that Sandy was with Pugh Kay has said Pugh s death occurred when a number of Manson Family members were being arrested for the Tate LaBianca murders Manson follower Bruce Davis was in London at the time Pugh died br Ronald Hughes was an American attorney who represented Leslie Van Houten a member of the Manson Family Hughes disappeared while on a camping trip during a ten day recess from the Tate LaBianca murder trial in November The badly decomposed body of Hughes was found in March wedged between two boulders in Ventura County It was rumoured although never proven that Hughes was murdered by the Family possibly because he had stood up to Manson and refused to allow Van Houten to take the stand and absolve Manson of the crimes though he might have perished in flooding Attorney Stephen Kay has stated that while he is on the fence about the Family s involvement in Hughes death Manson had open contempt for Hughes during the trial Kay added The last thing Manson said to him Hughes was I don t want to see you in the courtroom again and he was never seen again alive Family member Sandra Good stated that Hughes was the first of the retaliation murders br On November the body of year old Vietnam Marine combat veteran James Lambert Willett was found by a hiker near Guerneville California Months earlier he had been forced to dig his own grave and then was shot and poorly buried His station wagon was found outside a house in Stockton where several Manson followers were living including Priscilla Cooper Lynette Fromme and Nancy Pitman Police forced their way into the house and arrested several of the people there The body of Willett s year old wife Lauren Chavelle Willett was found buried in the basement She had been killed very recently by a gunshot to the head in what the Family members initially claimed was an accident It was later suggested that she was killed out of fear that she would reveal who killed her husband Michael Monfort pleaded guilty to murdering Lauren and Priscilla Cooper James Craig and Nancy Pitman pleaded guilty as accessories after the fact Monfort and William Goucher later pleaded guilty to the murder of James and James Craig pleaded guilty as an accessory after the fact The group had been living in the house with the Willetts while committing various robberies Shortly after killing Willett Monfort had used Willett s identification papers to pose as Willett after being arrested for an armed robbery of a liquor store Willett was not involved in the robberies and wanted to move away but was presumably killed out of fear that he would talk to police br Laurence Merrick was an American film director and author He is best known for co directing the Oscar nominated documentary Manson in Sharon Tate was a former student at Merrick s Academy of Dramatic Arts Merrick was killed by a gunman on January He was shot in the back in the carpark of his acting school Merrick s murder went unsolved until October when year old Dennis Mignano confessed to police At his subsequent trial Mignano was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a mental hospital Mignano was an unemployed would be actor and singer with a long history of psychiatric problems and a possible prior relationship with the Manson clan br Six months after the murder of Merrick Mignano s sister Michele Mignano a topless dancer was also murdered Her body was found on June ft into a Western Pacific railroad tunnel in Niles Canyon Authorities referred to her death as an execution style slaying with her dying from exsanguination due to multiple gunshot wounds A number of bullet cartridges were found near her body She was shoeless yet fully clothed with jewellery so sexual assault and robbery were both ruled out as motives Her murder has never been solved br br br Investigation br The Tate murders became national news on August after the Polanskis housekeeper Winifred Chapman arrived for work that morning On August detectives of the Los Angeles County Sheriff s Department which had jurisdiction in the Hinman case informed Los Angeles Police Department detectives assigned to the Tate case of the bloody writing at the Hinman house According to Vincent Bugliosi because detectives believed the Tate murders were a consequence of a drug transaction the Tate team initially ignored this and other evidence of similarities between the crimes br During the Tate autopsies detectives working on the Hinman case noticed similarities in the weapons used the stab wounds and the writing in blood on the walls They brought the information to detectives working on the Tate murders According to Detective Charlie Guenther Vince Bugliosi didn t want anything to do with the Hinman case Hinman was a nothing case Vince didn t want to prosecute it br Held briefly as a Tate suspect Garretson told police he had neither seen nor heard anything on the murder night He was released on August after undergoing a polygraph examination that indicated he had not been involved in the crimes The LaBianca crime scene was discovered at p m on August approximately nineteen hours after the murders were committed when year old Frank Struthers Rosemary s son from a prior marriage and Leno s stepson returned from a camping trip br On August the LAPD told the press it had ruled out any connection between the Tate and LaBianca homicides On August the sheriff s office raided Spahn Ranch and arrested Manson and twenty five others as suspects in a major auto theft ring that had been stealing Volkswagen Beetles and converting them into dune buggies Weapons were seized but because the search warrant had been misdated the group was released a few days later In a report at the end of August the LaBianca detectives noted a possible connection between the bloody writings at the LaBianca house and the singing group the Beatles most recent album br Still working separately from the Tate team the LaBianca team checked with the sheriff s office in mid October about possible similar crimes They learned of the Hinman case and also learned that the Hinman detectives had spoken with Beausoleil s girlfriend Kitty Lutesinger She had been arrested a few days earlier with members of the Manson Family br The arrests for car thefts had taken place at the desert ranches to which the Family had moved A joint force of National Park Service Rangers and officers from the California Highway Patrol and the Inyo County Sheriff s Office federal state and county personnel had raided both the Myers and Barker ranches after following evidence left when Family members had burned an earthmover owned by Death Valley National Monument The raiders had found stolen dune buggies and other vehicles and arrested two dozen people including Manson A Highway Patrol officer found Manson hiding in a cabinet beneath Barker s bathroom sink br Following up leads a month after they had spoken with Lutesinger LaBianca detectives contacted members of a motorcycle gang Manson tried to recruit as bodyguards while the Family was at Spahn Ranch Meanwhile a dormitory mate of Susan Atkins informed LAPD of the Family s involvement in the crimes Atkins was booked for the Hinman murder after she told sheriff s detectives that she had been involved in it Transferred to Sybil Brand Institute a detention center in Monterey Park California she had begun talking to bunkmates Ronnie Howard and Virginia Graham to whom she gave accounts of the events in which she had been involved br br br Apprehension br On December the LAPD announced warrants for the arrest of Watson Krenwinkel and Kasabian in the Tate case the suspects involvement in the LaBianca murders was noted Manson and Atkins already in custody were not mentioned the connection between the LaBianca case and Van Houten who was also among those arrested near Death Valley had not yet been recognized Watson and Krenwinkel were already under arrest with authorities in McKinney Texas and Mobile Alabama having picked them up on notice from LAPD Informed that a warrant was out for her arrest Kasabian voluntarily surrendered to authorities in Concord New Hampshire on December br Physical evidence such as Krenwinkel s and Watson s fingerprints which had been collected by LAPD at Cielo Drive and photographs between was augmented by evidence recovered by the public On September the distinctive caliber Hi Standard Buntline Special revolver Watson used on Parent Sebring and Frykowski had been found and given to the police by Steven Weiss a year old who lived near the Tate residence In mid December when the Los Angeles Times published a crime account based on information Susan Atkins had given her attorney Weiss s father made several phone calls which finally prompted LAPD to locate the gun in its evidence file and connect it with the murders via ballistics tests br Acting on that same newspaper account a local ABC television crew quickly located and recovered the bloody clothing discarded by the Tate killers The knives discarded en route from the Tate residence were never recovered despite a search by some of the same crewmen and by LAPD A knife found behind the cushion of a chair in the Tate living room was apparently that of Susan Atkins who lost her knife in the course of the attack br The trial began on June The prosecution s main witness was Kasabian who along with Manson Atkins and Krenwinkel had been charged with seven counts of murder and one of conspiracy Since Kasabian by all accounts had not participated in the killings she was granted immunity in exchange for testimony that detailed the nights of the crimes Originally a deal had been made with Atkins in which the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty against her in exchange for her grand jury testimony on which the indictments were secured once Atkins repudiated that testimony the deal was withdrawn Because Van Houten had participated only in the LaBianca killings she was charged with two counts of murder and one of conspiracy br Originally Judge William Keene had reluctantly granted Manson permission to act as his own attorney Because of Manson s conduct including violations of a gag order and submission of outlandish and nonsensical pretrial motions the permission was withdrawn before the trial s start Manson filed an affidavit of prejudice against Keene who was replaced by Judge Charles Older On Friday July the first day of testimony Manson appeared in court with an X carved into his forehead He issued a statement that he was considered inadequate and incompetent to speak or defend him self and had X d him self from the establishment s world Over the following weekend the female defendants duplicated the mark on their own foreheads as did most Family members within another day or so br The prosecution argued the triggering of Helter Skelter was Manson s main motive The crime scene s bloody White Album reference helter skelter written by Susan Atkins and the writing of pigs was correlated with testimony about Manson predictions that the murders Black people would commit at the outset of Helter Skelter would involve the writing of pigs on walls in victims blood The defendants testified that the writing in blood on the walls was to copy that of the Hinman murder scene not an apocalyptic race war According to Bugliosi Manson directed Kasabian to hide a wallet taken from the scene in the women s restroom of a service station near a Black neighborhood However as co prosecutor Stephen Kay later pointed out the wallet was actually left about twenty miles away in a predominantly White neighborhood Sylmar br br br Ongoing disruptions br During the trial Family members loitered near the entrances and corridors of the courthouse To keep them out of the courtroom proper the prosecution subpoenaed them as prospective witnesses who would not be able to enter while others were testifying When the group established itself in vigil on the sidewalk some members wore sheathed hunting knives that although in plain view were carried legally Each of them was also identifiable by the X on their forehead br Some Family members attempted to dissuade witnesses from testifying Prosecution witnesses Paul Watkins and Juan Flynn were both threatened Watkins was badly burned in a suspicious fire in his van Former Family member Barbara Hoyt who had overheard Susan Atkins describing the Tate murders to Family member Ruth Ann Moorehouse agreed to accompany the latter to Hawaii There Moorehouse allegedly gave her a hamburger spiked with several doses of LSD Found sprawled on a Honolulu curb in a drugged semi stupor Hoyt was taken to the hospital where she did her best to identify herself as a witness in the Tate LaBianca murder trial Before the incident Hoyt had been a reluctant witness after the attempt to silence her her reticence disappeared br On August despite precautions taken by the court Manson flashed the jury a Los Angeles Times front page whose headline was Manson Guilty Nixon Declares This was a reference to a statement made the previous day when U S President Richard Nixon had decried what he saw as the media s glamorization of Manson Voir dired by Judge Charles Older the jurors contended that the headline had not influenced them The next day the female defendants stood up and said in unison that in light of Nixon s remark there was no point in going on with the trial br On October Manson was denied the court s permission to question a prosecution witness whom defense attorneys had declined to cross examine Leaping over the defense table Manson attempted to attack the judge Wrestled to the ground by bailiffs he was removed from the courtroom with the female defendants who had subsequently risen and begun chanting in Latin Thereafter Older allegedly began wearing a revolver under his robes br br br Defense rests br On November the prosecution rested its case Three days later after arguing standard dismissal motions the defense stunned the court by resting as well without calling a single witness Shouting their disapproval Atkins Krenwinkel and Van Houten demanded their right to testify br In chambers the women s lawyers told the judge their clients wanted to testify that they had planned and committed the crimes and that Manson had not been involved By resting their case the defense lawyers had tried to stop this Van Houten s attorney Ronald Hughes vehemently stated that he would not push a client out the window In the prosecutor s view it was Manson who was advising the women to testify in this way as a means of saving himself Speaking about the trial in a documentary Krenwinkel said The entire proceedings were scripted by Charlie br The next day Manson testified The jury was removed from the courtroom According to Vincent Bugliosi it was to make sure Manson s address did not violate the California Supreme Court s decision in People v Aranda by making statements implicating his co defendants However Bugliosi argued Manson would use his hypnotic powers to unfairly influence the jury Speaking for more than an hour Manson said among other things that the music is telling the youth to rise up against the establishment He said Why blame it on me I didn t write the music To be honest with you Manson also stated I don t recall ever saying Get a knife and a change of clothes and go do what Tex says br As the body of the trial concluded and with the closing arguments impending defense attorney Hughes disappeared during a weekend trip When Maxwell Keith was appointed to represent Van Houten in Hughes absence a delay of more than two weeks was required to permit Keith to familiarize himself with the voluminous trial transcripts No sooner had the trial resumed just before Christmas than disruptions of the prosecution s closing argument by the defendants led Older to ban the four defendants from the courtroom for the remainder of the guilt phase This may have occurred because the defendants were acting in collusion with each other and were simply putting on a performance which Older said was becoming obvious br br br Conviction and penalty phase br On January the jury returned guilty verdicts against the four defendants on each of the twenty seven separate counts against them Not far into the trial s penalty phase the jurors saw the defense that Manson in the prosecution s view had planned to present Atkins Krenwinkel and Van Houten testified the murders had been conceived as copycat versions of the Hinman murder for which Atkins now took credit The killings they said were intended to draw suspicion away from Bobby Beausoleil by resembling the crime for which he had been jailed This plan had supposedly been the work of and carried out under the guidance of not Manson but someone allegedly in love with Beausoleil Linda Kasabian Among the narrative s weak points was the inability of Atkins to explain why as she was maintaining she had written political piggy at the Hinman house in the first place br Midway through the penalty phase Manson shaved his head and trimmed his beard to a fork he told the press I am the Devil and the Devil always has a bald head In what the prosecution regarded as belated recognition on their part that imitation of Manson only proved his domination the female defendants refrained from shaving their heads until the jurors retired to weigh the state s request for the death penalty The effort to exonerate Manson via the copycat scenario failed On March the jury returned verdicts of death against all four defendants on all counts On April Judge Older sentenced the four to death br br br Third imprisonment br br br s s br br Manson was admitted to state prison from Los Angeles County on April for seven counts of first degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of Abigail Ann Folger Wojciech Frykowski Steven Earl Parent Sharon Tate Polanski Jay Sebring and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca As the death penalty was ruled unconstitutional in Manson was re sentenced to life with the possibility of parole His initial death sentence was modified to life on February br On December Manson was convicted of first degree murder in Los Angeles County Court for the July death of musician Gary Hinman He was also convicted of first degree murder for the August death of Donald Shea Following the decision of California v Anderson California s death sentences were ruled unconstitutional and that any prisoner now under a sentence of death may file a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court inviting that court to modify its judgment to provide for the appropriate alternative punishment of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without possibility of parole specified by statute for the crime for which he was sentenced to death Manson was thus eligible to apply for parole after seven years incarceration His first parole hearing took place on November at California Medical Facility in Vacaville where his petition was rejected br br br Gerald Ford assassination attempt br br On September the Family returned to national attention when Squeaky Fromme attempted to assassinate U S President Gerald Ford The attempt took place in Sacramento to which she and fellow Manson follower Sandra Good had moved so that they could be near Manson while he was incarcerated at Folsom State Prison A subsequent search of the apartment shared by Fromme Good and another Family recruit turned up evidence that coupled with later actions on the part of Good resulted in Good s conviction for conspiring to send threatening communications through the United States mail service and for transmitting death threats by way of interstate commerce The threats involved corporate executives and U S government officials vis vis supposed environmental dereliction on their part br Fromme was sentenced to years to life becoming the first person sentenced under United States Code Title chapter which made it a Federal crime to attempt to assassinate the President of the United States In December Fromme serving a life sentence for the assassination attempt escaped briefly from Federal Prison Camp Alderson in West Virginia She was trying to reach Manson because she heard that he had testicular cancer she was apprehended within days She was released on parole from Federal Medical Center Carswell on August br br br s s br br In the s Manson gave four interviews to the mainstream media The first recorded at California Medical Facility and aired on June was by Tom Snyder for NBC s The Tomorrow Show The second recorded at San Quentin State Prison and aired on March was by Charlie Rose for CBS News Nightwatch and it won the national news Emmy Award for Best Interview in The third with Geraldo Rivera

Nikolas Schreck conducted an interview with Manson for his documentary Charles Manson Superstar Schreck concluded that Manson was not insane but merely acting that way out of frustration br On September Manson was imprisoned in the California Medical Facility at Vacaville when inmate Jan Holmstrom poured paint thinner on him and set him on fire causing second and third degree burns on over percent of his body Holmstrom explained that Manson had objected to his Hare Krishna chants and verbally threatened him After Manson was housed in the Protective Housing Unit at California State Prison Corcoran in Kings County The unit housed inmates whose safety would be endangered by general population housing He had also been housed at San Quentin State Prison California Medical Facility in Vacaville Folsom State Prison and Pelican Bay State Prison br In June a prison disciplinary committee found that Manson had been trafficking drugs He was moved from Corcoran State Prison to Pelican Bay State Prison a month later br br br s br br On September MSNBC aired The Mind of Manson a complete version of a interview at California s San Quentin State Prison The footage of the unshackled unapologetic and unruly Manson had been considered so unbelievable that only seven minutes of it had originally been broadcast on Today for which it had been recorded br In Los Angeles disc jockey Matthew Roberts released correspondence and other evidence indicating that he might be Manson s biological son Roberts biological mother claims that she was a member of the Manson Family who left in mid after being raped by Manson she returned to her parents home to complete the pregnancy gave birth on March and put Roberts up for adoption CNN conducted a DNA test between Matthew Roberts and Manson s known biological grandson Jason Freeman in showing that Roberts and Freeman did not share DNA Roberts subsequently attempted to establish that Manson was his father through a direct DNA test which proved definitively that Roberts and Manson were not related br In the Los Angeles Times reported that Manson was caught with a cell phone in and had contacted people in California New Jersey Florida and British Columbia A spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections stated that it was not known if Manson had used the phone for criminal purposes Manson also recorded an album

album remains unreleased br In Manson stated that he was bisexual saying Sex to me is like going to the toilet Whether it s a girl or not It doesn t matter I don t play that girl guy shit I m not hung up in that game In the imprisoned Manson became engaged to year old Afton Elaine Burton and obtained a marriage license on November Manson gave Burton the nickname Star She had been visiting him in prison for at least nine years and maintained several websites that proclaimed his innocence The wedding license expired on February without a marriage ceremony taking place Journalist Daniel Simone reported that the wedding was canceled after Manson discovered that Burton wanted to marry him only so that she and friend Craig Hammond could use his corpse as a tourist attraction after his death According to Simone Manson believed that he would never die and may simply have used the possibility of marriage as a way to encourage Burton and Hammond to continue visiting him and bringing him gifts Burton said on her website that the reason that the marriage did not take place was merely logistical Manson had an infection and had been in a prison medical facility for two months and could not receive visitors She said that she still hoped that the marriage license would be renewed and the marriage would take place br br br Psychology br On April Manson was denied release at his twelfth parole hearing which he did not attend After his March parole hearing Manson refused to attend any of his later hearings The panel at that hearing noted that Manson had a history of controlling behavior and mental health issues including schizophrenia and paranoid delusional disorder and was too great a danger to be released The panel also noted that Manson had received rules violation reports had no indication of remorse no insight into the causative factors of the crimes lacked understanding of the magnitude of the crimes had an exceptional callous disregard for human suffering and had no parole plans At the April parole hearing it was determined that Manson would not be reconsidered for parole for another fifteen years not before at which time he would have been years old According to a recent re analysis of Manson s psychological state researchers suggest that he may have been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia Instead they propose that Manson had bipolar disorder and psychopathy br br br Illness and death br On January Manson was being held at Corcoran Prison when he was rushed to Mercy Hospital in downtown Bakersfield because he had gastrointestinal bleeding A source told the Los Angeles Times that Manson was very ill and TMZ reported that his doctors considered him too weak for surgery that normally would be performed in cases such as his He was returned
