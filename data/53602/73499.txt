in the th Anniversary Edition of Heir to the Empire John Booth wrote in Wired that Zahn created and developed Thrawn as a character by deliberately establishing the Grand Admiral as a villain who leads not by coercion and fear but through valuing strategy and loyalty Zahn explained in that Thrawn s version of the Empire is different from that of Palpatine because Thrawn does not have Palpatine s megalomania and xenophobia Calling Thrawn and Mara Jade his favorite of the characters he created Zahn noted in that writing the Grand Admiral provides the intellectual challenge of trying to come

the Empire br In Heir to the Empire Thrawn plots to destroy the New Republic despite their numerical advantage over the remaining Imperial forces He sets his sights on the Wayland storehouse of the late Emperor Palpatine which contains a massive array of Spaarti cloning cylinders and a practical cloaking shield To this end Thrawn and his subordinate Gilad Pellaeon captain of the Star Destroyer Chimaera enlist the help of smuggler Talon Karrde and his second in command Mara Jade to obtain several salamander like creatures called ysalamiri Thrawn uses the ysalamiri which possess the natural

forces for the battle against the New Republic Mara Jade in an attempt to exonerate the Empire s warrant for Karrde s arrest goes to Thrawn and offers to reveal the location of the Katana fleet Instead he has her followed and Karrde is captured Luke and Mara rescue Karrde from Thrawn s Star Destroyer as Thrawn attempts to capture another man who knows about the Katana fleet Meanwhile Leia learns that the Noghri serve the Empire because they revere her late father Darth Vader who they believe saved their planet Honoghr from ecological disaster Leia convinces them that they have been deceived and effectively enslaved by the Empire and they switch sides With Ackbar temporarily neutralized as a tactical opponent Thrawn leads an army of clones to claim the so called Katana fleet

find the cloaked asteroids but Thrawn s forces intercept and surround them Meanwhile Luke and Leia lead a group to destroy the cloning facility on Wayland killing C baoth and destroying the cloning cylinders Just as Thrawn and Pellaeon learn that the Noghri aided in the attack on Wayland Thrawn s Noghri bodyguard Rukh kills the Grand Admiral whose last words are But it was so artistically done

initiates peace talks with Princess Leia However Moff Disra hires a con artist Flim to impersonate the deceased Grand Admiral Thrawn to motivate the Imperial forces Major Grodin Tierce the clone of a former stormtrooper imbued with Thrawn s tactical intellect by the grand admiral himself strategizes that the false Thrawn could also rally support for the Empire and intimidate the New Republic The tactic is successful until Pellaeon and Talon Karrde on opposing sides but both desiring peace expose Flim Meanwhile at a fortress called the Hand of Thrawn Luke and Mara discover a gestating and near

writing the novel as always it was immensely fun to play tactics with Thrawn Though StarWars com suggests that in Outbound Flight Thrawn is too smart and basically decent to become the servant of Palpatine that he later becomes Zahn explains br br My sense has always been that Thrawn was manipulating Palpatine just as much as Palpatine is manipulating him After all he only came to the Empire
