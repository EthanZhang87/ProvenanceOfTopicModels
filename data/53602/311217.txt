The interstellar space opera epic Star Wars uses science and technology in its settings and storylines The series has showcased many technological concepts both in the movies and in the expanded universe of novels comics and other forms of media The Star Wars movies primary objective is to build upon drama philosophy political science and less on scientific knowledge Many of the on screen technologies created or borrowed for the Star Wars universe were used mainly as plot devices br The iconic status that Star Wars has gained in popular culture and science fiction allows it to be used as an accessible introduction to real scientific concepts Many of the features or technologies used in the Star Wars universe are not yet considered possible Despite this their concepts are still probable br br br Tatooine s twin stars br br In the past scientists thought that planets would be unlikely to form around binary stars However recent simulations indicate that planets are just as likely to form around binary star systems as single star systems Of the exoplanets currently known actually orbit binary star systems and orbit multiple star systems with three or more stars Specifically they orbit what are known as wide binary star systems where the two stars are fairly far apart several AU Tatooine appears to be of the other type a close binary where the stars are very close and the planets orbit their common center of mass br The first observationally confirmed binary Kepler b is a close binary Exoplanet researchers simulations indicate that planets form frequently around close binaries though gravitational effects from the dual star system tend to make them very difficult to find with current Doppler and transit methods of planetary searches In studies looking for dusty disks where planet formation is likely around binary stars such disks were found in wide or narrow binaries or those whose stars are more than or less than AU apart respectively Intermediate binaries or those with between and AU between them had no dusty disks In it was reported by The Guardian that NASA spacecraft Kepler had discovered a planet named Kepler b with twin suns as seen in the Star Wars films br Certified astrophysicist and Star Wars fan Jeanne Cavelos explains that scientists have been skeptical about the likelihood of binary star systems such as Tatooine since the gravity of one star may prevent planets from developing around the other Two stars of different masses orbiting one another would cause gravity fields to shift causing potential instabilities in the orbits of any planets in their system br According to her even planets in more stable orbits of a binary star system would suffer other kinds of problems such as climatic problems As an example a planet in a binary star system orbiting the larger star would be drawn closer to its gravitational field causing the planet to endure heat of great temperatures during this period As the planet passes its larger star and reaches the orbit of its smaller star the gravitational field of that star would give the planet more distance from it The distance perhaps along with the smaller solar projection of the star would send the planet into extreme frigid temperatures br According to Cavelos astronomers hypothesize at least two possible solutions to these problems exist and that even life supporting binary star systems could exist One scenario could be two stars billions of kilometres apart A planet or planets would be able to orbit one star while at minimum influence of the other A star known as Proxima Centauri or Alpha Centauri C is about one trillion kilometres away from its sister stars Alpha Centauri A and B Also according to Cavelos astronomers believe that Proxima Centauri could have planets of its own If so they would be minimally influenced by Proxima Centauri s sister stars due to the vast distance between them and these sister stars Assuming the existence of planets around Proxima Centauri from these planets the sister suns would appear as bright stars in the sky br Another scenario would be two stars that would be closer to one another at a distance of only a few million kilometres A planet orbiting far enough away would be affected by their gravitational fields almost as if there were one If the distance between the two stars was a small fraction of the distance between them and the planet it would be stable for the planet Dawn and dusk would occur on such a planet as they would on Tatooine br br br Blaster bolts br Star Wars makes heavy use of blaster and ion weaponry attributed to laser plasma or particle based bolts of light Characters can be seen escaping or even dodging those bolts and the blaster bolts themselves can be seen flying at a moderate fast speed Dodging a laser bolt would be nearly impossible as it would travel at the speed of light Due to that it is reasonable the blaster fire would pass like a sparkle and hit its target Sometimes characters will call the bolts laser bolts that while they do not travel at light speed are made of intense light energy br However many official canonical Star Wars sources state that blaster technology is different from real lasers According to official canon they are a form of particle beam This is supported by how magnetically sealed walls deflect them br The Polish Academy of Sciences in collaboration with the University of Warsaw managed to film an ultra short laser pulse by using cameras that produce billions of frames per second These laser pulses were so powerful that they almost instantly ionized the atoms they encountered resulting in the formation of a plasma fiber filament br The effects of a blaster on a live target were portrayed more or less the same in every part of the Star Wars series Since blaster bolts consist of light or particle based energy the bolts would burn through the flesh of a target with some even exploding against their target exerting great force The latter effect was usually from a blaster with greater size Blasters have even been shown to have plasma energy as ammunition which is portrayed as blue bolts As of The Force Awakens these blue bolts rupture and damage flesh with little to no burning which causes bleeding injuries as Poe shot a Stormtrooper with a blaster that caused him to bleed until death Another instance of a blaster causing bleeding was when Chewbacca shot Kylo Ren with his Bowcaster the small explosion against his body causing a bleeding injury coupled with burns In many modern showings of blaster fights someone hit by a blaster has cinders and soot outlining the area where they were shot Also blasters hit with great amounts of friction and kinetic energy enough to cause sparks to fly off the target make the target burst into flames or kill a target on impact even if the target is not penetrated by the bolt as it is when some targets are armored against blasters br br br Vibration in vacuum br Star Wars is famously known for its epic space dogfights Blaster engine and explosion sounds can be heard in those space scenes Space is a vacuum however and since sound requires matter to propagate the audience should not hear any sound br This has been explained in some Star Wars media as the result of a sensor system that creates three dimensional sound inside the cockpit or bridge matching the external movement of other vessels as a form of multimodal interface although the audience is still able to hear sound even from a perspective that is in space In the canon novel Lords of the Sith it is explained that the characters in a galaxy far far away indeed do not hear any sound in space if no longer confined by their vessels br br Vader s interceptor streaked toward the gun bubble aimed directly at it Content with the trajectory he unstrapped himself overrode the interceptor s safeties threw open the cockpit hatch and ejected into space br Immediately he was spinning in the zero g the ship and stars alternating positions with rapidity Yet he kept his mental hold on the air lock handle and his armor sealed and pressurized sustained him in the vacuum The respirator was loud in his ears br br His ship slammed into the gun bubble and the transport the inability of the vacuum to transmit sound causing the collision to occur in eerie silence Fire flared for a moment but only a moment before the vacuum extinguished it br Therefore the ability to hear sound in a vacuum by the audience is not heard by the iconic characters but only to the audience as an interpretation to imagine what sounds we hear in the films as out of universe artifacts br br br Asteroid field in Episode V br br In The Empire Strikes Back after the Battle of Hoth the Millennium Falcon is pursued by Imperial ships through a dense asteroid field The chunks of rock in the field are moving at rapid speeds constantly colliding and densely packed Ordinarily an asteroid field or belt is unlikely to be so densely packed with large objects because collisions reduce large objects to rubble About the only way for an asteroid belt to maintain itself would be to balance destructive high speed collisions with constructive soft collisions but it is unclear whether this is happening in the film br In contrast to Star Wars the ship featured in A Space Odyssey Discovery One had a course that took it directly through the asteroid belt in the novel without real fear of collision on the part of the mission organizers However the Solar System s Asteroid Belt is far less dense and several real spacecraft have passed through it without harm br On the other hand the so called Trojan asteroid fields named after the asteroids found in Jupiter Sun Lagrange points are known to be packed much more densely The Solar System contains two such fields the Greek Trojans and the Trojan Trojans and two more Neptune s trojans have been discovered recently but little is known about them currently br Also contained within this scene is a portion in which Han and Leia emerge from the Millennium Falcon and are seen wearing only a facemask for air The lack of pressure would have likely caused rapid decompression of their bodies as the asteroid likely did not have an atmosphere See Effect of spaceflight on the human body br br br Flight dynamics br Unlike the true flight dynamics of space those seen in Star Wars closely mirror the familiar dynamics of flying in Earth s atmosphere For example fixed wing aircraft must make banked turns because they use air pressure to operate Yet in the airless vacuum of space in Star Wars the spaceships always unnecessarily bank when turning Physicist Lawrence M Krauss says this is for a simple reason it looks good br By banking the center of gravity would be maintained so up is still up but the g forces generated at such speeds would surely injure the occupants This is handled in the films by devices known as inertial compensators br In order to turn in non atmospheric flight some force must still be applied to the craft presumably by some sort of thruster or generated force field wave the location of which in relation to the craft s centre of gravity will dictate the orientation of the ship or bank angle required to make the turn br br br Destruction over Endor br br Following the events of Return of the Jedi there has been widespread speculation that the destruction of the second Death Star as seen in the film would cause a radiation spread on the forest moon of Endor s atmosphere and surface given that the explosion was caused by an attack on its nuclear core reactor br The phenomenon has been around supposedly since following a number of comic book productions on Star Wars beyond the original trilogy of unknown canonicity although like most other works it has been declared non canonical and part of the distinct Star Wars Legends continuity in and has been known as The Endor Holocaust It came about from a rational analysis in multiple commentaries of the aftermath of the second Death Star s destruction and its hypothetical effects on the forest moon and its living inhabitants Based on all the information from the stories it has been concluded that a nuclear fallout would cause radioactive contamination on the surface of the planet or moon leading to widespread death and destruction br More recent analysis by physicists has supported the theory from a scientific perspective br Studying and analyzing the second Death Star s destruction physicists hypothesize its results and consequences Astrophysicist and Star Wars fan Dave Mosher covers the film s events in a word essay His first argument is the Death Star explosion resulting from the rebel attack on its nuclear reactor the whole space station would be reduced to a large number of fine metallic pieces raining down on Endor The debris would burn up in Endor s atmosphere turning into toxic soot and spark planetary firestorms br Another scientist Sarah Stewart reanalyzes the situation and theorizes the moon s previous state after some environmental cleanup from the Death Star s fallout br Matija Cuk who studies orbital dynamics theorizes the Death Star s reactor blowing up in one second sending enormous chunks of debris at about miles per hour He argues the energy carried by the debris would not be sufficient to destroy the moon but erode the side facing the Death Star He also argues all ships near the Death Star at the time of its explosion would be destroyed by it He also adds the rebels witnessing the explosion from the planet s surface would be killed by the radiation released from the explosion even before the debris reaches them br He concludes the debris following the explosion would strike the moon s surface and would send rocks on the surface to the far side of the moon In his analysis the extinction of the Ewoks is inevitable br Planetary physicist Erik Asphaug who also studies giant impacts on moons and planets opposes these theories He argues the Death Star would not be reduced to tiny bits following explosion He argues that all nuclear explosions in rock would vaporize matter near it but break matter a further distance away into pieces The further away the pieces the less they would break He concludes large chunks of the Death Star would hit the forest moon s surface some even creating craters The most problematic result in his analysis is the fire caused by the large radioactive debris that would set the moon s forests ablaze br A detailed analysis to the aftermath of the Death Star explosion in Return of the Jedi by planetary scientist Dave Minton concludes all the Ewoks would have died as a result Using the information provided from the holograms in the briefing scene aboard the giant cruiser Home One in Episode VI Minton estimates the diameter of the Death Star or Death Star II to distinguish it from the first Death Star in Episode IV A New Hope is about three hundred forty three kilometers or about seven percent the diameter of Endor br This would make Endor slightly larger than Mars but about the size of Earth He also notes that in diameter Endor would still be smaller than Mars but denser in mass by his measurement formula Endor s composition being smaller would be unusual but not impossible according to him br He applies this data to the orbital dynamics problem Discounting the possibility of the second Death Star being preserved in Endor s orbit by the use of anti gravitational repulsors a commonality in the Star Wars galaxy Minton instead compares the Death Star in the forest moon s orbit to that of a satellite in Earth s orbit Applying Kepler s Third Law he determines an orbital period as exactly one day But applying this law he determines astrophysical problems with the Death Star using Endor s gravity to sustain itself in the forest moon s orbit For simplicity he assumes a day on Endor as hours br Minton also argues the explosion of the second Death Star in Episode VI is lighter than that of the first one in Episode IV His argument is drawn from the two films where the one in A New Hope explodes instantaneously wheres the second one in Return of the Jedi explodes in a longer time period allowing the rebel pilots to escape alive and their ships unharmed by the explosion The film specifically shows Wedge Antilles and Lando Calrissian hitting two main sections of the core reactor from an X wing fighter and the Millennium Falcon co piloted by Nien Nunb causing the reactor to collapse and start a chain explosion and resulting in the Death Star blowing up from a series of internal explosions and collapses br Minton therefore concludes there would be little vaporization of remaining material and that the explosion would move a lot slower than what is required to keep them in orbit which he estimates is about miles per second Using the equation representing orbital velocity of the Death Star he theorizes the fragments would need to be orbiting at about kilometers per second to maintain orbit at the same altitude the Death Star had been Since this does not happen he argues the remains of the former Death Star would fall straight into the area where the shield generator has been on the moon s surface br To estimate the effects of the second Death Star Minton looks into its mass According to estimated data from some students of Lehigh University the steel mass needed for building one would be around kilograms times the mass cubed in weight this would give the Death Star a mass of about kg Using this data Minton produces equations that lead him to conclude the fragments would hit the moon s surface so hard it would cause craters almost four times the size of the Chicxulub crater in Mexico This impact would cause a planetary firestorm and vaporize all lifeforms on the moon br br br Hyperspace travel br br The hyperspace travel in the Star Wars franchise requires two elements light speed travel and hyperspace Ships in the Star Wars Universe have engines capable of propelling them to the speed of light However current physical theory states that it is impossible for any physical object to attain that speed as long as the object has a non zero mass because an infinite amount of energy would be required to accelerate the mass to such a speed a logical impossibility in our universe Moreover even if one were traveling at light speed it would still take thousands of years to travel even a moderately sized galaxy It is for these reasons that Star Wars space vessels use a hyperdrive br This is explained by having the ships warp to another dimension presumably a brane universe with different physical laws Gravity supposedly reaches between branes In Star Wars gravity in real spaces forms gravitational mass shadows in hyperspace Hyperspace in Star Wars is unrelated to the presumed space between universal bubbles in real life physics br Hyperspace travel has also been noted to have some form of air resistance as seen in Deal or No Deal an episode of the Star Wars the Clone Wars TV series Trace Martez smuggler and friend of Ahsoka Tano apologises for flight turbulence on her heavily modified Nebula class freighter nicknamed the Silver Angel having left the air brakes on This would be normal if Martez was encountering air resistance in the atmosphere of Coruscant the planet she had just left However she only encountered turbulence once she entered hyperspace which suggests that hyperspace has some form of gaseous atmosphere for lack of a better term br br br Planets moons and planetoids br br In the Star Wars franchise almost everyone can breathe and move on many planets and these as well as the star systems are treated as small places Both defects have an accurate explanation br The Star Wars Expanded Universe states that many of the planets of the galaxy were colonized and adapted to the atmosphere and gravity of the most populated species and there are also many species such as Kel Dor and Skakoans that need to use devices like breathing masks or pressurized suits In the other case since the Star Wars franchise develops itself to the intergalactic level it is assumed that almost all the planets on it are planetary civilizations a theory well based in reality and that could possibly happen in a distant future br The novelization of A New Hope ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster mentions that humans colonized Tatooine in the section introducing the Tusken Raiders The section implies that humans colonized the planet and settled in the more remote areas of the much sparsely populated planet which did not give much chance of contact between the Tusken Raiders and the human colonists who settled on the planet in small numbers br Also in the same novel the section introducing the planet Yavin describes it as uninhabitable Its satellite moons are described as planet sized The fourth moon called Yavin IV as it was named by early human colonizers is described rich with plant and animal life It describes an ancient civilization that once existed in the jungles of the moon but disappeared centuries before human explorers ever set foot on the moon The only evidence of their existence the ancient architectural sites and monuments they left behind as seen in the film most of which were mysteriously built At the time the Rebel Alliance used territory on Yavin as their hidden base the only thing left on the moon was plant insect and animal life br Jeanne Cavelos points to the Tales of the Jedi comic book series that document the early colonization of much of the populated Star Wars galaxy Her argument is that the humans in the Star Wars galaxy being a single species as well as appearing and living like human beings on Earth likely originated from a single Earth like planet though the exact origin or home world of the human species in the Star Wars universe is not exactly known She suggests that to be able to colonize other planets the humans of the Star Wars galaxy could not have been genetically altered She points to the fact that Luke Skywalker lived his life on Tatooine but did not require any genetic altering to adapt to Hoth a planet with a climate estimately the opposite of Tatooine br There are also problems with the possibility of humans altering the climate of the planet they colonize She mentions the fact that there are native species on planets that humans live on such as the Jawas alongside the Tusken Raiders on Tatooine who survive in the same climate as humans live on If they lived in another climate prior to human colonization and environmental modification alternation such as terraforming they are unlikely to survive br Another possibility she suggests is the use of artificial aids that would help the colonists adapting to life on a newly settled planet before gradually adapting to life there Some variations in climate and gravity would be adaptable to the colonists over a few generations as long as the variations are not too great Through a period of generations the colonists would evolve and adapt even perhaps by evolutionary mutations br There is also the unlikelihood of other planets having air just like Earth s and automatically being breathable according to other scientists Cavelos claims Only a small number of such planets probably exist The chances are greater of finding planets with similar atmospheres that would require minimal atmospheric modification but unlikely to be identical to Earth s that arriving humans could simply survive on them br Another issue amongst this is that if human species would be unlikely to encounter a planet with an exact Earth like environment it would be even more unlikely for so many different alien species to be of the same environmental background and surviving in the same environmental conditions as seen at the Mos Eisley cantina in A New Hope br br br Lightsabers br br Often lightsabers are said to be composed of lasers However using lasers raises several issues br br The necessity of something to reflect the end of the beam br Having a compact and powerful enough power source br Lasers do not clash when their beams cross br Lasers are silent br There are some materials that can withstand a lightsaber and some can even deactivate one upon contact br Earlier forms of the weapon were known as protosabers in the Star Wars galaxy that required battery packs which were connected to the lightsaber hilt through a power cord The battery pack was attached to a belt worn by the Jedi using the lightsaber similar to how a flamethrower is worn but was not ideal as it restricted the Jedi s movements during combat br Lightsabers have been generally explained as plasma kept in a force field usually an electric or magnetic field The force field could not be magnetic because the field contains heat something a magnetic field is incapable of doing Thus the force field must be a shield not known by modern technology Additionally when two plasma blades would come into direct contact it would almost certainly result in magnetic reconnection causing an explosive release of the plasma contained in both sabers br The problems with lightsabers that use actual light blades mentioned at the beginning of this section are not all insurmountable For instance it is mentioned that Lasers do not clash when their beams cross which is a statement based on our day to day experience with light But Euler and Heisenberg have shown in that for sufficiently high intensities light can actually interact with itself an effect due to quantum fluctuations of the vacuum Given this then it is possible to imagine a scenario of two lightsabers clashing in which photons coming from the hilt of one lightsaber are scattered toward the hilt of the other lightsaber the scattering is done in the region where the two lightsabers overlap Since photons have momentum those scattered photons would exert radiation pressure on the hilt of the other lightsaber Using techniques from ultrahigh intensity lasers it has been shown that for lasers with an electric field strength of the order of V m the force felt in the hilt of each lightsabers is approximately N or roughly equivalent to the force exerted by a one kilogram object falling on a human foot This force due to scattered photons would give an impression of blade solidity when the two lightsabers clash An incredible amount of energy is necessary to power such a lightsaber For instance powering a lightsaber with an electric field strength of V m for one minute requires J or ten times less than the total energy output of the Sun in one second If the energy source is nuclear fusion such a lightsaber would require kg of nuclear fusion fuel to operate for one minute In other words one would need to fit the equivalent of ten Great Pyramid of Giza s of nuclear fusion fuel in the hilt to operate such a lightsaber for one minute br br br See also br Technology in Star Wars br Star Wars Where Science Meets Imagination br br br br br br External links br Stephen Warren First Planet
