collected Greef then informs the Mandalorian about a lucrative job from a mysterious man known only as The Client who insists on meeting with the Mandalorian face to face This job turns out to be a bounty against Grogu aka The Child a young alien of the same unnamed species as Yoda br Greef next appears in Chapter The Sin during which he informs the Mandalorian to bring the captured Grogu directly to the Client The Mandalorian does so only to later rescue Grogu back from the Client who is an agent of the Galactic Empire This is a violation of the Bounty Hunters Guild code so Greef organizes a group of bounty hunters to confront the Mandalorian and get Grogu back A massive gunfight ensues in which most of Greef s bounty hunters are killed when the Mandalorian receives assistance from a group of fellow Mandalorian warriors Greef himself escapes and confronts the Mandalorian at his ship the Razor Crest but the Mandalorian shoots him off his boarding ramp before flying away

accepts Greef s offer bringing along with him Cara Dune Kuiil and IG to assist in the mission During their voyage the party is attacked by pterodactyl like creatures and Greef receives a poisonous slash that would have been fatal but Grogu uses the Force to heal him Greef is so moved that he has a change of heart and informs the others about the trap They devise a new plan in which they leave

droid controlled floating barge on a river of lava Greef is present when IG sacrifices himself to eliminate a large number of stormtroopers to ensure the group s escape and he survives an attack by Moff Gideon in a TIE fighter which the Mandalorian repels Afterward Greef decides to stay behind on Nevarro and rebuild the Bounty Hunters Guild and he invites Cara Dune to work as his enforcer which

Mandalorian and Grogu return to Nevarro for repairs to the Razor Crest they reunite with Greef and Cara who present to them some of the changes made to the place before inviting the former to join them on a raid on the last Imperial base on the planet in exchange for the repairs The base turns out to have more than just a skeleton crew as the group finds numerous stormtroopers patrolling its corridors They deactivate the lava cooling system so that the natural lava flows will destroy the base During their escape the group finds scientists and vats of what appear to be cloned bodies The scientists attempt to destroy the evidence but before they can do so the Mythrol uncovers a recording from Dr Pershing that reveals he had been transfusing Grogu s blood which has a high M count into test subjects Stormtroopers soon swarm the team and they are forced to escape before the lava overheats and destroys the base br The Mandalorian flies from the base to retrieve his ship using his jetpack whilst Greef Cara and Mythrol steal a stormtrooper transport A chase ensues between the transport driven by Cara and scout troopers riding speeder bikes Greef kills the last scout trooper but TIE fighters launched from the base chase after them disabling the transport s cannon The base soon explodes due to the overheating of the lava As the TIE fighters close in on Greef Cara and Mythrol the Razor Crest appears and destroys the Imperials After the Mandalorian receives the promised repairs to his ship and departs from Nevarro once again with Grogu Greef is visited by New Republic pilots who invite him to help stop whatever the Empire is planning br br br Season br Greef appears in season where Weathers again directs an episode He first appears in the season premiere Chapter The Apostate when The Mandalorian returns to Nevarro in hope of retrieving IG Greef who is now Nevarro s High Magistrate is later confronted by pirates In a stand off Greef wounds one of them as he

the Mandalorian and offers the Mandalorians a home on Nevarro br In Chapter The Spies Greef gifts the Mandalorian with IG a rebuilt IG which now serves as a mech suit for Grogu allowing him to communicate saying yes or no br br br Characterization br Greef Karga has a gruff personality and a no nonsense approach to business He projects a calm and confident demeanor and is motivated largely by financial profit but is also fair in his dealings He is loyal to his allies to some degree but can also be duplicitous and shifting in his allegiances as seen by the way in which he repeatedly switches between friend and adversary to the Mandalorian Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair felt Greef simultaneously protected and manipulated the Mandalorian at times and that Mandalorian did not fully trust him as a result Weathers has described his character as a combination of a used car salesman and a puppeteer KGO TV writers Janet Davies and Marsha Jordan described Greef as a shadowy underworld figure Weathers said the character has something that you can t quite trust but also said he is definitely not amoral Greef is a mysterious character and Weathers has said it was a conscious decision by the writers to keep aspects of his history and motivations cryptic There s some real strong indications that give you some idea of who he is but we never let on completely Greef has a very theatrical and sometimes over the top personality enjoys action and the company of bounty hunters over whom he exerts strict control through his leadership role in the Bounty Hunters Guild Although normally self assured and confident Greef does act cautiously and sometimes even fearfully in some situations such as his interaction with the Client br br br Concept and creation br br br Conception br br The character of Greef Karga was created by Jon Favreau the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian He was originally planned to make a brief appearance in the series but Favreau and the series writers found that they liked the character so much that they expanded his part and gave him a larger role Karga was initially envisioned as a Weequay a species first seen on Return of the Jedi but Favreau and his crew concluded that they didn t wish to have Karga s performance hidden behind a mask br Greef Karga was first publicly unveiled during the Star Wars Celebration convention in Chicago on April along with the character Cara Dune The event also featured teaser footage featuring Greef a still photo of the character and included a panel discussion with Carl Weathers and Gina Carano the actress who portrays Cara discussing their characters A fully finished scene of Greef offering a bounty to the Mandalorian was also screened It was the first time Weathers had seen finalized footage from the show after which he said How can you not react to that It s beautiful hearing the fans react to it br During the panel Weathers said of his character He s kind of the head of this guild of bounty hunters There seems to be a lot of kind of nefarious people Some publications misspelled Karga s name after the event with Anthony Gramuglia of Comic Book Resources calling him Greif Marda and Variety writer Jordan Moreau misspelling the last name as Carga Further footage of the character was included in the first trailer of The Mandalorian which debuted at the D convention on August According to Adrienne Tyler of Screen Rant some viewers mistook images of Greef Carga in the trailer for Lando Calrissian a Star Wars character who dates back to the original Star Wars trilogy On October a character poster of The Mandalorian solely featuring Greef Karga was released br br br Portrayal br Favreau who offered the part to Weathers was a fan of the actor and had previously met Weathers through their mutual membership in the Directors Guild of America Favreau began courting him for The Mandalorian early in the process of preparing for the series Weathers said Favreau did sort of a slow roll on me describing the project to him and impressing the actor with his passion for the show Weathers met with Favreau to discuss the Greef Karga character with Favreau showing him concept art from the series which Weathers described as magnificent and some of the most beautiful artwork He was also impressed with Dave Filoni the executive director for The Mandalorian saying of him and Favreau We re in really good hands Although Weathers originally signed on for only a few episodes the character was later expanded and the role grew larger than what he initially accepted Favreau said We really did rope him in Weathers agreed to accept the part if he could have the opportunity to direct future episodes of The Mandalorian if it was renewed for a second season to which Favreau agreed As a result Weathers directed the season episode Chapter The Siege of The Mandalorian thus becoming the second cast member of The Mandalorian to direct an episode of the show after IG actor Taika Waititi Weathers also later directed the season episode Chapter The Foundling br Upon first reading the part Weathers said Greef Karga reminded him of film director screenwriter and actor John Huston particularly his performance in the film Chinatown He felt there was a theatricality and larger than life quality to the character and he deliberately performed some of his lines in a showy and melodramatic way as a result Weathers casting was first announced on December though rumors had been had been discussed on the Making Star Wars podcast and other Internet sites two months prior to the formal announcement Weathers called The Mandalorian one of the most exciting projects of his career saying Being a part of this is one of the greatest things that s happened in all of the years that I ve been in entertainment He said he was very impressed by the quality of writing in the scripts and that he particularly enjoyed his character s shifting allegiances and unpredictable about faces It s much more interesting to play someone who is not all of one thing not one dimensional Certainly with Greef you have to really keep your eye on him br Weathers said he knew little about Greef Karga s backstory before playing the character and that he did not want to know it because he felt the mystery helped him convey a sense of ambiguity Regarding Greef s history Weathers said I didn t ask it I didn t care I didn t want to know However he also added If I had to guess he was going through some dark times He was doing maybe some pretty dark stuff br br br Filming br There was a great deal of secrecy surrounding the filming of The Mandalorian and Weathers was not allowed to divulge any details about the series In the early months he was not even allowed to reveal that he was appearing in the show He joked I had to cut my finger and sign in blood that I would say nothing about it The actor said his time filming The Mandalorian has been a positive experience describing it as a liberating experience when you have so many smart talented collaborative good hearted caring people around you on a daily basis Weathers performed his stunts for The Mandalorian He said he has pushed for diversity in the casting of The Mandalorian not only based upon race but also such factors as height age and physical appearance I want to see anything that we have experienced in the world to be in that universe because they re disparate creatures coming from every part of the universe So why wouldn t they be there After filming each episode Weathers liked to watch the footage and study what the director and actors brought to each scene br Weathers said he particularly enjoyed working with the director Deborah Chow during the filming of Chapter The Sin because she had planned what she wanted to do for the episode very precisely and meticulously in advance He said this took a lot of pressure off of him and the rest of the cast giving them more freedom and helping ensure their own choices were in sync with hers Weathers action sequences in Chapter The Sin took a particularly long time to film due to the many elements involved in the shootout scene In Greef Karga s scenes with the Client played by German film director Werner Herzog Weathers deliberately made Greef less confident and commanding than normal to convey that the Client was a dangerous character He was a great admirer of Herzog referring to him as maestro on the set of The Mandalorian and the two had extensive conversations with each other about Herzog s past films and his relationship with actor Klaus Kinski br br br Cultural impact br br br Critical reception br Greef Karga has received generally positive feedback from fans and reviewers Screen Rant ranked him sixth
