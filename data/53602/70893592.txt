lightsaber from the desert and leaves Tatooine br br br Production br br br Development br By August Lucasfilm was developing a spin off film focusing on Ewan McGregor s Obi Wan Kenobi from the prequel trilogy However following the project s cancellation due to the financial failure of Solo A Star Wars Story McGregor entered negotiations to star in a six episode Disney limited series centered around Kenobi The series was officially announced by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy at the D event Deborah Chow was hired to direct all episodes for the series by September while Joby Harold became the head writer and showrunner in April following Kennedy s disapproval with the scripts and subsequent rewrites The series is executive produced by Harold Chow McGregor Kennedy and Michelle Rejwan Chow and Harold wanted the series to be a character study for Kenobi and worked to connect elements from the prequel trilogy and original trilogy Harold wanted to further explore Kenobi s character following the events of Order and wanted him to deal with issues from his past Chow also took inspirations from gritty poetic westerns including The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford The Proposition and the works of Akira Kurosawa br br br Writing br Various story elements in the episode were conceived by Stuart Beattie and Hossein Amini when they were developing the film The episode takes place a decade after the events of Order McGregor had described Kenobi as a broken man after what happened with the Jedi order at the end of Episode III but also what happened with Anakin that he lost him to the dark side He feels an enormous amount of responsibility for that and guilt He further noted that he d lost his faith it was interesting to take him into a darker place and then over the course of the series see how he finds his faith again and gets back to being the Obi Wan that we knew and loved Harold had also noted that Kenobi was traumatized by both his past and the rise of the Empire adding Within that hopeless fatalistic world we find possibly the most famous of all our surviving Jedi in hiding struggling with that faith that defines the Jedi and wanting to hold onto it and hoping to regain that faith within that sort of hopeless world br Harold said that the Galactic Empire was in ascendancy during this time period that most of the Jedi Order was killed and that the Empire has set up the Inquisitor program which consists of dark side Force users tasked with finding and killing Jedi They were recruited by Darth Vader with Chow wanting them to be depicted in a way that felt true to the spirit of the animated series Rebels where they had originated from The episode features the Grand Inquisitor Fifth Brother and the Third Sister Reva Sevander and their introduction in the series was an idea conceived by Dave Filoni Reva s character was originally conceived by Beattie and Amini br He chose to include Princess Leia in the episode as he felt that her message to Kenobi in Star Wars would be less arbitrary as a choice and a decision now that we know the depth of the history they have together I liked the fact that it helped reinforce and better articulate a little piece of the jigsaw that is already in place He also did so as he felt that having her being kidnapped would force Kenobi out of exile because he would equally prioritize Leia and Luke s explaining that Bail Organa gets to articulate that to Obi Wan in the cave in Episode She s Obi Wan s daughter too That s a vital piece of canon to explore to me If anything s gonna take him away from Luke it had to be her Harold also felt that taking him Kenobi to new places was really exciting br br br Design br Propmaster Brad Elliott was influenced by resources Pablo Hidalgo brought for the creative team Ralph McQuarrie s work on the original trilogy and techniques prop builders used in the original trilogy He kept some of Kenobi s belongings from previous films such as his macrobinoculars holoprojectors and datapad He felt it made sense that Kenobi would take a few items with him to watch over Luke and explained that he kept the holoprojector in case Bail Organa had contacted him The macrobinoculars were fabricated from a pair that was originally intended to appear in Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones The datapad was originally used by Anakin Skywalker in Attack of the Clones but he felt visual guides indicate that the datapad actually belonged to Kenobi Creating Kenobi s lightsaber was challenging for the prop builders as prop designers from the prequel and original trilogies did not use the same hilt designs requiring the prop team on the series to merge the two iterations together into something new that still felt authentic The T skyhopper model the toy which Kenobi attempts to give Skywalker was created based on reference photos from the original prop as used in A New Hope with prop builders utilizing the same model kits used to create the original one br br br Casting br The episode stars Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi and features recurring co stars Rupert Friend as the Grand Inquisitor Sung Kang as the

ReDefine br br br Music br Natalie Holt was hired as composer for the series making her the first woman to score a live action Star Wars project while John Williams composed the Obi Wan Theme Holt explained that in the episode Obi s in the desert he s given up everything he s lost he s alone I tried some single instruments but it just didn t feel right Suddenly John was on board and his involvement unlocked the use of those heritage themes She described the process as finding the right level of Star Wars homage because we ve got heritage characters and adding in new elements as well While writing the score for the series she wanted to find the right balance for them Deborah Chow and Kathleen Kennedy were looking for in Obi s world and took inspiration from William s work on Star Wars Holt wanted each of the planets in the series to feel like their own character For Alderaan she added South American flavors and used an orchestra and synthesizers for the score Chow described it as a really socialist country green modern tech and compared the Organa family to the Obamas br br br Marketing br Prior to the episode s release merchandise inspired by the episode as part of the Obi

The site s critical consensus reads Ewan McGregor returns to the Star Wars fold with a wearier Obi Wan but this saga still feels vital in a premiere that cleverly plays on fan expectations br Giving the episode an A grade Maggie Lovitt of Collider felt the episode was a strong re introducing to Obi Wan Kenobi and praised its script though she stated that the fun really begins in the later released Part II Bradley Russell from Total Film gave the series and a half out of stars He praised Chow s direction John William s score and the cast performances particularly that of McGregor Blair and Ingram He felt that McGregor takes every opportunity to flash Obi Wan s internal pain all over his face and called it one of Star Wars great performances already and called the episode a near perfect opening to a lost chapter in Obi Wan s history though he expressed disappointment of Friends role as the Grand Inquisitor At Vulture Jesse Hassenger rated the episode stars out of praising Chow s direction and visuals He also praised the pacing and McGregor s performance and the amount of screen time Kenobi has in the episode writing it excels when it accumulates silent details and small interactions from his lonely routine He opined that the episode served as both a character study and a call to action but felt it did not reach the hero in spartan exile gold standard of say James Mangold s The Wolverine criticizing some of the dialogue and scenes with Bail Organa and Owen Lars which he felt becomes clunkier and less expressive br BBC Culture s Stephen Kelly praised Harold s script opining that it was remarkable in the first episode for its tightness with not a single scene feeling superfluous or wasted He also praised McGregor s performance and Kenobi s characterization calling it a compelling portrait of defeat and regret bolstered by a sad soulful performance from McGregor who has managed to dim the twinkle from Obi Wan s eyes He also praised its production values though he did say it was unmistakably televisual writing scenes on Tatooine have a strange artificial quality to them unbefitting of Obi Wan s grand status Doesn t he deserve a bigger stage and gave the first two episodes four out of five stars Matt Purslow of IGN praised the overall story and felt Kenobi s mission to save Leia showed character growth He also highlighted McGregor s performance and gave the episodes an out of calling it the most well balanced Star Wars story for quite some time Writing for The Verge Andrew Webster also lauded McGregor s performance and called the Inquisitors suitably menacing He added that his favorite part was how lived in the universe feels much like classic Star Wars and called the show a refreshingly old school Star Wars story though he felt that some plot elements didn t make sense br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Part I at IMDb br Part I on Wookieepedia a Star Wars wiki
