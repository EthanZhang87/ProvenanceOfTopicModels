around the world were shut down due to the COVID pandemic The pandemic still impacted post production for the season br br br Music br Composer Ludwig G ransson was able to take advantage of the emotional attachment that the audience developed with his musical themes during the first season which gave him the ability to immediately give them what they want or play the themes with different harmonies or different instrumentation and people will instantly recognize it G ransson uses the series main theme in a lot of new and different iterations in the second season He explained that the Mandalorian s theme was primarily played on the recorder during the first season to emphasize his lone man s journey but was played on guitar in some flashbacks to the character s childhood In the second season the theme is primarily played on electric guitar to show the character s new confidence and relationship with Grogu G ransson uses an Ibanez eight string electric guitar for this br G ransson introduces new musical themes for each episode in the season with new sounds and ideas as each episode has a different genre setting and characters He uses a rock n roll heavy metal mood in Chapter The Marshal as an homage to the music Ennio Morricone wrote for Sergio Leone s Western films Chapter The Passenger prominently features G ransson s theme for Grogu which he wrote during development on the first season It is played on a Fender Rhodes electric piano which G ransson compared to John Williams use of the glockenspiel and celeste in the Star Wars films to create a storybook or magical feeling For Bo Katan s introduction in Chapter The Heiress G ransson used distorted synthesizer sounds to create an industrial sound that matched the character s speed and energy His theme for Boba Fett also uses distorted sounds inspired by sound effects that Rodriguez added to his initial cut of Chapter The Tragedy The first season does not feature any references to Williams original themes but there were a lot of conversations between G ransson and the producers about how to flirt with the Star Wars themes a little bit in the second season leading to several inclusions G ransson references Williams theme for Yoda in Chapter The Jedi when that character is mentioned and he reprises Williams theme for The Force when Skywalker appears in Chapter The Rescue He also uses Kevin Kiner s theme for Ahsoka Tano from Star Wars The Clone Wars for scenes with that character br The biggest challenge for the season s post production team was recording G ransson s orchestral score during the COVID pandemic The series was one of the first to use the th Century Fox scoring stage when it allowed recordings again Thirty string players were recorded there for the first seven episodes with the players wearing masks and spaced six feet apart The final episode increased the string players to forty while also adding over a dozen brass and woodwind players To comply with health regulations and musician union rules the strings were recorded on separate days from the brass and woodwinds Additional musicians were recorded remotely and combined with the scoring stage recordings as well as recordings of G ransson playing the guitar recorder piano bass rock drums and synthesizers Recording took place from July to September br Unlike the first season where an album
