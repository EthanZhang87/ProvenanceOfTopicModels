review of The Force Awakens Henry Barnes of The Guardian wrote that Gleeson s screechy pseudo Nazi role as General Hux is not as colourful or as nuanced as Adam Driver s part as Kylo Ren but given he s a functionary Gleeson certainly makes an impression However after the release of Star Wars The Last Jedi and Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker some criticism was levelled at the use of the character to provide comic relief particularly after having been introduced as a serious villain The character s story arc was also discussed The revelation that he had become a Resistance spy and his subsequent unceremonious death was subject to some criticism br br br br br Text was copied from Armitage Hux at Wookieepedia which is released under a Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike
