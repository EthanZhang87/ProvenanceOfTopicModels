id: 13115824
The Sith are the main antagonists in the fictional universe of the Star Wars franchise They are the antithesis and ancient enemies of the Jedi The Sith Order is depicted as an ancient cult of warriors who draw strength from the dark side of the Force and use it to seize power by any means necessary including terrorism and mass murder their ultimate goals are to destroy the Jedi and rule the galaxy The various antagonistic factions in the franchise namely the Confederacy of Independent Systems the First Galactic Empire the Imperial Remnant and the First Order all originated with the Sith Sith known individually as Sith Lords are by nature ruthless At any point a single individual assumes absolute authority amongst their kind and is granted the honorific Dark Lord of the Sith Sith culture is based on perpetual treachery and betrayal The fate of Sith Lords is typically to be murdered and replaced by their own apprentices Sith teach their apprentices to revere the dark side of the Force to give full reign to aggressive emotions such as rage and hatred and to believe that others are expendable in the pursuit of power thus making the Lords demise inevitable br Like the Jedi the Sith use the lightsaber as their traditional weapon a device that generates a blade like plasma powered by a kyber crystal In contrast to the Jedi who primarily use blue and green lightsabers the usual color for a Sith lightsaber is red born of an unnatural corruption of the kyber crystal through the dark side s malignancy causing it to bleed This even affects the sound of ignition with a harsher hiss br br br Etymology br The word Sith is taken from the science fiction novel The Warlord of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs in which it refers to a species of beetle It was first used for Star Wars in the rough draft of Star Wars with the first published use being the novelization of Star Wars as a title for the villain Darth Vader the Dark Lord of the Sith Sith characters had also been portrayed as such in some Star Wars Legends works prior to the release of The Phantom Menace the first film to identify characters as Sith on screen and in deleted footage from the original film br In his novel series The Thrawn Trilogy author Timothy Zahn labeled Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine as Dark Jedi as the meaning of the term Sith had not yet been defined Subsequent Star Wars Legends media use the term Dark Jedi for various characters attuned to the dark side of the Force Some of these characters including Vader and Palpatine would be later identified as Sith although the term would also be applied to non Sith characters with similar goals and practices br br br Influences br br George Lucas acknowledged that the Jedi Sith and other Force concepts have been inspired by many sources These include knighthood chivalry paladinism samurai bushido Shaolin Monastery Feudalism Hinduism Qigong Greek philosophy and mythology Roman history and mythology Sufism Confucianism Shint Buddhism and Taoism and numerous cinematic precursors The works of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and mythologist Joseph Campbell especially his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces directly influenced Lucas and was what drove him to create the modern myth of Star Wars In particular the contrasting narrative relationship between the dark side using Sith and light side using Jedi mirrors several modern and classical literary tropes br The ongoing struggle of the humanistic light side affiliated Jedi to permanently defeat the egoistic dark side affiliated Sith is framed not only as a contest of values but as a deep metaphysical conflict The dark side of the Force is viewed by the Jedi and generally represented within Star Wars media as not only a dangerous expedient but as a form of existential corruption which must be purged for the universe or a person to attain spiritual balance Jedi are often depicted as imperfect individuals but their cause of selfless heroism is ultimately on the right side of an inexorable cosmic struggle against evil embodied in the power hungry Sith and the dark side of the Force br The dualistic relationship between these Sith and Jedi concepts of purity mirrors the philosophical and literary concept of Apollonian and Dionysian the Jedi are portrayed as embracing purity reason temperance altruism and other humanistic virtues the Sith by contrast embrace curiosity emotion conflict power instincts unfettered self interest and other hedonistic vices However whereas the classic Greek concept did not necessarily view the Apollonian and Dyonisian principles as opposed Star Wars frames the Jedi and Sith as opponents in a dire moral struggle with the Sith cast as corrupted villains apparently destined to defeat or self destruction in the end br Within the Star Wars narrative the Jedi and Sith naturally have a different understanding of the Force In Sith rhetoric the relationship between the philosophy of Jedi versus Sith closely mirrors German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche s concept of master slave morality Sith value master virtues such as pride and power whereas the Jedi value altruistic slave virtues like kindness and compassion br The goal of the Sith is tangible greatness the ability to shape or destroy a world according to one s will alone The goal of the Jedi is moral goodness freedom from inner turmoil and selfish desires However the Sith consider the Jedi s aspirations to be either hopeless or pathetic To the Sith achieving greater power following one s passion and freedom from inhibition are more authentic ways of expressing the Force While the Jedi seek a harmonious connection to the Force the Sith seek a deeper understanding through conflict because they believe the Force is defined by conflict br br br Development br Originally George Lucas conceived the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the Schutzstaffel had served Adolf Hitler In developing the history for The Empire Strikes Back Lucas condensed this into one character in the form of Darth Vader br br br Ideology br Sith philosophy values conflict as a catalyst for growth and as a tool for purging the weak disloyal and undisciplined Sith emphasize the maxims because we feel like it and survival of the fittest and view restraint as a weakness Members adhere to master morality are characterized by the desire to seize power by any means necessary leveraging force both physical and supernatural social maneuvering and political cunning to their advantage br Throughout Star Wars media and in popular culture the Sith are infamous as the dualistic antagonists to the Jedi an affiliation of altruistic warriors who strive to use their own martial training and connection to the light side of the Force to promote peace and the common welfare throughout the galaxy To counteract the Jedi s benevolent influence the Sith instigate both large and small scale conflicts as part of their larger plan to destabilize the Republic and eventually take control of the galaxy br br br The Code of the Sith br The Sith are dedicated to the Code of the Sith and to mastering the dark side of the Force The Code of the Sith identifies conflict as the fundamental dynamic of reality and holds that the search for lasting peace within or without is both quixotic and misguided Rather Sith embrace strife and dark passion as salutary and emancipatory forces as they believe that violent struggle purges the decadent and weak and that emotions such as aggression and hate provide the strength and resolve to secure freedom through victory br br The Code br Peace is a lie There is only passion Through passion I gain strength Through strength I gain power Through power I gain victory Through victory my chains are broken The Force shall free me br br Although Sith seek dominion Sith philosophy stresses that power belongs only to those with the strength cunning and ruthlessness to maintain it and thus betrayal among the Sith is not a vice but an endorsed norm Accordingly the Sith reject altruism self denial and kindness as they regard such attitudes as founded on delusions that fetter one s perceptions and power In connection with their philosophy the Sith draw on the dark side of the Force through severe negative emotions a technique opposed to that of their archenemies the Jedi who rely on the Force s light side i e the Force as experienced through disciplined states of apathy Notably both the Jedi and Sith shun romantic and familial love as well as other positive emotions the Jedi fear that such love will lead to attachment and thus selfishness while the Sith fear it will compromise their ruthlessness and connection to the dark side of the Force br br Although the Sith are intimately linked to the dark side not every user of the dark side is a Sith nor is every user of the light side a Jedi Yes a Jedi s strength flows from the Force But beware of the dark side Anger fear aggression the dark side of the Force are they Easily they flow quick to join you in a fight If once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny consume you it will as it did Obi Wan s apprentice br The dark side of the Force is stigmatized as seductive corruptive and addictive by the Jedi who view it as evil whereas the Sith consider the dark side of the Force to be its most powerful manifestation and regard the abstemious Jedi as blinded by false virtue As portrayed in all Star Wars related media the dark side provides users with powers similar to those of the light side using Jedi but as it leverages passion and violence its use is enhanced by negative raw and aggressive emotions and instinctual feelings such as anger greed hatred and rage By deciding to learn the ways of the dark side of the Force the Sith may also acquire powers and abilities considered by some in the Star Wars universe to be unnatural A notable example is Force lightning electricity projected from the fingertips as a means of attack and torture most famously used by Darth Sidious to torture Luke Skywalker in Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi In Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith meanwhile Palpatine claims that the dark side gave the Sith lord Darth Plagueis power over death itself Being uninhibited in their use of the Force Sith could also repurpose abilities shared with the Jedi such as telekinesis to new and terrifying effect Darth Vader was infamous for his use of telekinetic strangulation or Force choke as a means of execution or intimidation br br Fear is the path to the dark side Fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to suffering br Extended use of the dark side reshapes the user s very nature resulting in a loss of humanity morality and the ability to love leaving every Sith to varying degrees amoral cruel and violent Considering this dark change in personality to be a transformation into a different person altogether some who turn to the dark side take on a different name as they regard their former persona as dead and destroyed Sith Lords in particular adopt a new name upon their initiation into the Order prefixing it with the title Darth e g Darth Vader Severe saturation in the dark side may even lead to physical degradation It is common for Sith who have immersed themselves in the dark side to have yellow eyes and pale skin as evidenced by Darth Sidious in Return of the Jedi and the newly corrupted Vader in Revenge of the Sith Although Sith are deeply affected by the Machiavellian methods and dark arts they practice they are not portrayed as necessarily irredeemable some Sith most famously Darth Vader in the final moments of his life have renounced the Order and the dark side of the Force br br The dark is generous It is patient and it always wins but in the heart of its strength lies its weakness one lone candle is enough to hold it back br Martial arts are a core part of the Sith tradition and Sith featured in the Star Wars film series have all been highly trained warriors who further augment their abilities with the Force Like the Jedi the Sith s signature armament is a lethal focused energy melee weapon known as a lightsaber which generally only those trained in the ways of the Force can use effectively although General Grievous a non Force user is able to murder numerous Jedi and seize their lightsabers as trophies Sith use lightsabers in combination with Force derived powers such as telekinesis enhanced dexterity and precognition to achieve superhuman combat prowess A well trained Sith is depicted as being at least a match for a well trained Jedi Knight and either can handily defeat multiple ordinary attackers In matters of dress Sith may adopt any attire consistent with their plans or guise they commonly favor black robes and armor br br br Fictional backstory Legends br The Sith s history prior to the events of the films is portrayed in the comic book series Tales of the Jedi published by Dark Horse Comics from to and considered part of the non canonical Legends continuity The Sith Order began around BBY during a period known as the Hundred Year Darkness A series of conflicts began between the rebellious Dark Jedi a faction of the Jedi Order and the rest of the Order The Dark Jedi were defeated and cast out exiled to the unknown regions These Exiles settled on the planet Korriban and encountered its native species the Sith The strongest among the Exiles Ajunta Pall became the first to hold the title Dark Lord of the Sith His contemporaries such as Karness Muur and XoXaan became Sith Lords The human Dark Jedi interbred with the Sith species who also had an affinity for the Dark Side They would become the original Sith Empire br One of the earliest leaders of this Sith Empire was Tulak Hord He expanded the Sith territories and conquered the Dromund System home to Dromund Kaas later the capital of the Sith Empire He was eventually followed by Marka Ragnos the last ruler of a period known as the Golden Age of the Sith Upon the passing of Ragnos two contenders for the throne of Dark Lord Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh dueled at his funeral Eventually after a series of conflicts Sadow was victorious and Kressh apparently killed br Sadow began the Great Hyperspace War invading the Republic and laying siege to its planets Sadow s efforts were initially met with success his forces amplified by illusions that Sadow projected from his meditation sphere Ultimately however his concentration was broken when his apprentice turned on him With his illusions dispersed Sadow s forces were forced to retreat Upon returning to Sith space they found that Kressh had not been killed and they engaged him in a space battle Sadow was victorious once again but they were soon attacked by Republic forces Sadow escaped by causing the Denarii Binary Star to go supernova The Sith Empire was saved from collapse by Darth Vitiate another one of Ragnos former acolytes who led the Sith into hiding in the Unknown Regions br In the Empire s absence the influence of the Sith eventually led to the corruption of several Jedi Knights including Freedon Nadd Exar Kun and Ulic Qel Droma Nadd a former prodigy from the Jedi stronghold world of Ossus made the conscious choice to embrace the dark side of the Force and sought out knowledge from Sadow s fallen empire eventually leading him to Sadow himself still alive and in exile on Yavin IV After learning from Sadow Nadd killed him and used his Sith status and power to conquer the planet Onderon and produce a royal lineage After Nadd s death Exar Kun sought out Sith arts from both Nadd s spirit and that of Marka Ragnos The latter declared Kun Dark Lord of the Sith and made Qel Droma his apprentice Corrupting several Jedi to their cause and allying themselves with warriors such as the Mandalorians Kun and Qel Droma declared war on the Galactic Republic During a raid on the Jedi Library at Ossus Qel Droma dueled and killed his brother but was captured Qel Droma was redeemed and was instrumental in Kun s downfall when the latter retreated to Naga Sadow s former stronghold on Yavin IV br Exar Kun s invasion directly influenced the Mandalorian Wars whereas the individuals known as Revan and Alek came across Darth Vitiate s empire in the Unknown Regions Seduced to the dark side and declaring themselves Sith Lords Revan and Alek became Darth Revan and Darth Malak respectively Vitiate had them seek out the Star Forge an ancient alien weapons plant that the Sith hoped to use to speed up their return to the galaxy Revan and Malak instead opted to use the Star Forge to fuel their own imperial war machine and led a brutal and hugely successful campaign against the Republic Revan was eventually betrayed by Malak allowing a Jedi strike team to capture him Malak continued his conquest without Revan s tactical leadership until a redeemed Revan defeated him and the Star Forge the source of the Sith fleet was destroyed br Remnants of Revan s Sith Empire were reorganized into a loose alliance of soldiers assassins and fallen Jedi led by the Sith Triumvirate a triad of Sith Lords consisting of Darth Traya Revan s former teacher Darth Nihilus a fallen Jedi and survivor of the Mandalorian Wars and Darth Sion a veteran Sith warrior from Exar Kun s war The three of them began a shadow war against the Jedi with Nihilus using his power to absorb Force energies to wipe out an entire planet of Jedi refugees while Sion led a contingent of assassins to hunt down the survivors This First Jedi Purge brought the Jedi Order to the brink of extinction The Triumvirate s downfall came about when Meetra Surik a Jedi who was exiled after the Mandalorian Wars returned to known space She defeated the three Sith and without the Sith leadership and the destruction of their base of operations on Malachor V the remaining Sith forces faded into obscurity Surik s students were able to help the Jedi recover from the Triumvirate s purge br Around years later the original Sith Empire still under the leadership of a seemingly immortal Vitiate emerged from the Unknown Regions and declared war on the republic This war dubbed the Great Galactic War was halted when Vitiate on the cusp of victory was restrained by the telepathic prowess of Revan After a period of non fighting called the Galactic Cold War tensions boiled over and the Galactic War began The war briefly fell in favor of the Republic and the Jedi with the Sith gradually losing ground until both factions were forced to join in an alliance against a third faction of Force users known as the Eternal Empire Once the Eternal Empire was defeated the war against the Sith resumed Vitiate perished during the conflict with Darth Malgus eventually taking control Malgus proved to be a fairly successful leader but over time the Sith Empire eventually fell to infighting and mostly disappeared Occasionally a Dark Lord such as Darth Rivan or Darth Ruin would rise and fall but the Sith did not become a major threat again until around years later br At this point the Brotherhood of Darkness arose led by the Sith Lord Skere Kaan They focused on controlling the infighting between the Sith This policy allowed them to make great progress in their war against the Republic br Ironically one of their own the Sith Lord Darth Bane turned on them engineering a civil war that ended with the deaths of every one of the Brotherhood s members except for Bane himself Bane then started the Rule of Two which evolved into the Sith as they are seen in the films an order consisting only of two Sith lords a master and an apprentice br br br Fictional history br br The Star Wars saga began with the film Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope which was released in Since then films books computer games and comics have been released all set in the fictional universe of Star Wars which has expanded the history of the Sith within their stories br The schemes of the Sith are key to the overarching plot of the Star Wars films and much other fictional material in the franchise Their background has varied among depictions but the Sith have always been insidious archenemies of the Jedi leveraging dark arts in pursuit of power and revenge The Sith were first mentioned in A New Hope in a scene ultimately cut from the film They were expanded upon heavily in the following years in books comics games and other multimedia The Sith were formally introduced on screen with the release of Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace in as a shadowy martial order manipulating the movie s political factions into a galaxy spanning civil war br Star Wars The Clone Wars first aired on Cartoon Network in This series took place between Episode II Attack of the Clones and Episode III Revenge of the Sith During this time Anakin Skywalker is a full fledged Jedi Knight and the series shows how he progresses into his fall to the Dark Side of the Force Count Dooku is the active Sith Lord and leader of the Separatist Alliance The series also explores Dooku s attempts at training secret apprentices like Asajj Ventress and Savage Opress in order to eventually defeat Darth Sidious and become the ruling Sith Lord br br br Emergence of the Sith Order br The origin agenda abilities and philosophy of the Sith are intertwined with their relationship to the Force With proper training the Force may be called upon by rare individuals capable of sensing or touching it to achieve extraordinary feats such as telekinesis precognition and mental suggestion Not all psychological states are conducive to employing the Force discipline is required However both quietude and focused intense passion alike can be effective The Sith originated in a species of Force sensitive warriors who discovered the efficacy of passion as a tool to draw on the Force at least years prior to the events of the first Star Wars film Fully embracing this approach they became defined and corrupted by it br The warriors who would become the first Sith were apparently heterodox members of the Jedi The Jedi served as a space faring knightly order within the Galactic Republic a representative democracy encompassing most developed worlds The Jedi Order sought to use the powers of the Force to help defend the weak and advance the rule of law across the galaxy in keeping with their ethics of self sacrifice and service to the common welfare The Jedi creed mirrored their method of utilizing the Force and Jedi doctrine favored states of serenity detachment compassion and humility as the proper means of accessing its power Controversy emerged when members of the Jedi Order began to experiment with passion as an alternative The Jedi establishment saw these innovations as a threat to the ethos of the Jedi opening members to the seduction of power and cruelty Eventually this controversy led to a conflict in which the rebelling Jedi were defeated and exiled br In exile the dissident Jedi were free to explore the relationship between passion and the Force They concluded that the martial and ethical disciplines of the Jedi establishment were foolish and misguided Passion not quietude was the most potent means of accessing the Force and conflict not peace was the natural and healthy state of the universe Rejecting the teachings of the Light side of the force the exiles now embraced ruthless personal ambition believing that power belonged to those with the cunning and strength to seize it In their training the dissidents would seek to master the Force by cultivating dark passions such as anger and hate a practice condemned by the Jedi Guided by their egoistic philosophy based on ruling by seizing power and armed with taboo Dark Side techniques the former Jedi exiles reemerged to menace the galaxy as the Sith Order aiming to conquer the Galactic Republic and exact revenge against the Jedi br br br Great Hyperspace Wars br A succession of Sith led regimes would arise to challenge the Jedi and the Galactic Republic an era known as The Great Hyperspace Wars The Jedi led Republic Armed Forces managed to repel the Sith Invasion from Coruscant and then pursued them all the way back to Korriban and essentially killed and purged all of the Sith they could find Republic historians would call this campaign the post great hyperspace War counter Invasion but the Sith simply called it a holocaust However internal power struggles would prove decisive in thwarting the Sith s designs The paradox of reconciling endless personal ambition with the interests of the Sith as a whole became a great practical and philosophical concern for the Sith Ultimately this paradox was resolved through a drastic reorganization by Darth Bane who recast the Sith into a master apprentice tradition called the Rule of Two Starting with Darth Bane there would be only two Sith at a time one to embody power and the other to crave it While concealing their identity as Sith a succession of Sith masters and apprentices would work through the centuries to place themselves into positions of power and undermine the responsible authorities preparing to overtake the Galactic Republic The Banite tradition encouraged each apprentice to eventually challenge and murder his or her master and take an apprentice in turn In this way Darth Bane guaranteed the conspiracy remained a secret for a thousand years He believed the Sith could exert their power and obtain their revenge against the Jedi by galactic domination The first six Star Wars films chronicle this ancient scheme br br br Ascent to power of the Sith br Darth Bane s plan would come to fruition through Sheev Palpatine a Naboo Senator later Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and secretly a Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious By manipulating disgruntled factions within the Galactic Republic Palpatine orchestrated civil war This conflict known within the Star Wars universe as the Clone Wars provided a justification for consolidating power in the Galactic Republic s chief executive and assembling a large army of cloned soldiers conditioned to obey certain key commands issued by Palpatine The Jedi eventually discovered Palpatine s identity as a Sith Lord and attempted to arrest him Palpatine framed their actions as an attempted coup using it as a pretext for annihilating the Jedi by activating Order one of the embedded protocols in the clone soldiers In the course of effecting his designs Palpatine also manipulated the most powerful Jedi knight Anakin Skywalker into his service by promising to teach him how to save the life of Padm Amidala In a tragic irony Padm s sheer horror at discovering Anakin s collaboration with Sidious resulted in her death during childbirth Sidious would trick Anakin into believing that he had killed Padm in anger Anakin s subsequent emotional collapse would lead him to fully embrace the dark side of the Force Sidious would rule the newly created Galactic Empire for approximately years as its Emperor with Darth Vader at his side Initially unknown to Vader and Sidious two children were delivered by Padme before her death br br br Sith temples br The Rebels episode Twilight of the Apprentice features a forbidden planet called Malachor home of an ancient Sith temple The temple contains a superweapon and can only be activated by placing a special Sith Holocron in an obelisk at the summit of the pyramid inside the temple Thousands of years prior a battle was waged on Malachor that resulted in the deaths of its inhabitants Somewhere between the events of his last appearance in Solo A Star Wars Story and this Rebels episode Darth Maul had become stranded on the planet When Ahsoka Tano Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger arrive Ezra is separated from them He is discovered by Maul and together they use the Force cooperatively to solve a series of tests and retrieve a Sith Holocron With the help of Kanan and Ahsoka they fought three Inquisitors all of whom are killed by Maul Maul then betrays his allies blinding Kanan and proceeds to activate the superweapon br Maul is defeated by a sightless Kanan and Darth Vader arrives with the intention of retrieving the holocron but is challenged by Ahsoka his former Padawan While the superweapon is preparing to fire Kanan and Ezra retrieve the holocron and escape preventing the weapon of mass destruction from being used Even though the temple is destabilized Ahsoka and Vader keep fighting to the death within the rapidly crumbling building until it eventually explodes wounding Vader br The Star Wars Resistance episode The Relic Raiders depicts a Sith temple hidden underneath a later Jedi

Skywalker Darth Vader and the Emperor aboard a mobile battle station known as the Death Star the Sith lineage would end as Darth Bane prescribed that it proceed Darth Sidious offered Skywalker an ultimatum to enter his service or die and proceeded to use his Force derived powers to torture and threaten to kill Skywalker when the latter refused to embrace the dark side of the Force Experiencing a crisis of conscience at the imminent death of Skywalker whom Vader now knew to be his son Darth Vader chose to intervene and kill his former master Sidious fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One Vader would die of his own injuries shortly thereafter thus apparently bringing an end to the Sith and their ancient vendetta br The film The Rise of Skywalker depicts the climax of the conflict between the Sith and the Jedi and features the group known as the Sith Eternal led by a resurrected Darth Sidious When Sidious meets his permanent and final demise at the hands of his granddaughter Rey the moment also marks the definitive end of the Sith br br br Overview br br br Timeline br Before the films At an unknown point in time numerous Jedi become disillusioned with the Order and exile

Naboo he rose to power within the Galactic Republic s government system starting from Senator of his homeworld then to Supreme Chancellor of the Republic and finally to self proclaimed Emperor of the Galactic Empire This was done by cultivating a public image as a humble and competent politician while secretly mastering dark Sith arts studying under Plagueis and planning the destruction of the Jedi Order and Republic Eventually by manipulating disaffected political groups and using double agents to sow discord Palpatine fomented a civil war that provided an opportunity for him to seize absolute power He had three known Sith apprentices Darth Maul Darth Tyranus and Darth Vader He was eventually betrayed and killed by his last Vader at the end of Return of the Jedi He returned more

final death marked what appears to be the definitive end of the Sith br In Legends continuity Darth Sidious would return using clones and ancient Sith powers returning in several clone bodies over the course of several novels and comics During this time he would briefly turn Luke Skywalker to the dark side of the Force through sheer power as much as by guile though Luke would later be redeemed by his sister Leia and restored to the light side of the Force and defeat Palpatine once and for all Shortly before his first death Palpatine had sent a psychic command through the Force to Mara Jade planting in her the need to kill Luke She eventually fulfilled this command by slaying a clone of Luke called Luuke Skywalker whom Palpatine had made in an attempt to use him against the original
