out of and said that although some fans might be disappointed by having to wait before seeing Ahsoka Tano he wrote For me Chapter was one of the most significant episodes we ve seen so far As much as The Mandalorian thrives on older Star Wars connections the fact that it also stands so well within its own canon and world building can only be a good thing Laura Prudom at IGN said Weathers effortlessly evokes the iconography of the films here None of it is particularly subtle but it s deployed with enough adrenaline to make for an exhilarating ride br Alan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone praised Weathers calling his direction terrific as well as praising the digital effects and stunt teams He suggested that the episode felt like a backdoor pilot for a show featuring Cara Dune br Louis Chilton of The Independent was frustrated that the episode was another side quest and took focus away from the main characters A five minute or so stretch sees Mando s associates steal the limelight but the sequence feels too much like a drab spin off a stark reminder of just how much The Mandalorian relies on its two leads br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Chapter The Siege at
