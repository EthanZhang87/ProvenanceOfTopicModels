bounty hunter Durge who was introduced in the Clone Wars micro series as a human character but Star Wars creator George Lucas instead suggested the creation of an entirely new bounty hunter with a Western design The result was inspired by Western film actors such as Lee Van Cleef s portrayals of Angel Eyes in The Good The Bad and the Ugly and Colonel Mortimer in For a Few Dollars More while retaining the features of the Duros species in the Star Wars universe Corey Burton s vocal performance inspired by the voices of actors Lance Henriksen who was originally envisioned to voice Bane and Peter Lorre was then digitally modified by the series sound production team While Filoni researched the character he happened across unused concept art from the original trilogy of a gun toting bounty hunter with a wide brimmed hat that helped determine the character s final look Filoni speculated on George Lucas original idea for the character that became Cad Bane Something you notice about George Lucas after a while is that he ll mention a name like Mace Windu in a version of Star Wars and then it pops up in So this I guess might have been an idea George had for the character Cad Bane way back when and now finally he s getting around to bringing him to the screen in The Clone Wars br Cad Bane made his debut in the season one finale Hostage Crisis Giancarlo Volpe the director of the episode has compared Bane to bounty hunter Boba Fett The crew loves Cad Bane and I really think the fans will too He brings a serious bad ass sensibility to Star Wars He s a lethal and ruthless bounty hunter

harming and murdering innocents and even children in pursuit of his quarry Examples of his sadistic tendencies include his brutal torture and execution of Jedi Master Bolla Ropal as well as his willingness to kill another bounty hunter simply for having a hat that he liked Bane s lack of morality disregard for collateral damage and staunch belief in only looking out for himself earn him a reputation as one of the galaxy s most notorious mercenaries which often puts him into conflict with more honorable hunters such as Boba Fett Although he considers compassion for others to be a liability Bane is not entirely without a code of honor he saves Rako Hardeen actually Obi Wan Kenobi in disguise when Moralo Eval tries to drop him into a fire pit telling Eval to kill Hardeen like a man instead of at the push of a button br As a Duros Bane has blue skin red eyes and a tall and slim frame He often wears a wide brimmed hat and has a habit of chewing on toothpicks Although his
