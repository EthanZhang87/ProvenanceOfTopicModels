double for Hayden Christensen br br br Production br br br Writing br Lucas said he conceived the Star Wars saga s story in the form of a plot outline in However he later clarified that at the time of the saga s conception he had not fully realized the details only major plot points The film s climactic duel has its basis in the Return of the Jedi novelization in which Obi Wan recounts his battle with Vader that ended with the latter falling into a molten pit Lucas began working on the screenplay for Episode III before the previous film Attack of the Clones was released proposing to concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets In The Secret History of Star Wars Michael Kaminski surmises that Lucas found flaws with Anakin s fall to the dark side and radically reorganized the plot For example instead of opening the film with a montage of Clone War battles Lucas decided to focus on Anakin ending the first act with him killing Count Dooku an action that signals his turn to the dark side br A significant number of fans speculated online about the episode title for the film with rumored titles including Rise of the Empire The Creeping Fear which was also named as the film s title on the official website on April Fool s and Birth of the Empire Eventually Revenge of the Sith also became a title guessed by fans that George Lucas would indirectly confirm The title is a reference to Revenge of the Jedi the original title of Return of the Jedi Lucas changed the title scant weeks before the premiere of Return of the Jedi declaring that a true Jedi could never seek revenge br Lucas had originally planned to include even more ties to the original trilogy and wrote early drafts of the script in which a year old Han Solo appeared on Kashyyyk but the role was not cast or shot He also wrote a scene in which Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he created him from midichlorians and is thus his father a clear parallel to Vader s revelation to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back but later scrapped this scene as well Another planned scene by Lucas that was written during the early development of the film was a conversation between Master Yoda and the ghostly Qui Gon Jinn with Liam Neeson reprising his role as Jinn he also hinted his possible appearance in the film However the scene was never filmed and Neeson was never recorded although the scene was present in the film s novelization br After principal photography was complete in Lucas made even more changes to Anakin s character rewriting his turn to the dark side Lucas accomplished this through editing the principal footage and filming new scenes during pickups in London in In the previous versions Anakin had several reasons for turning to the dark side one of which was his sincere belief that the Jedi were plotting to take over the Republic Although this is still intact in the finished film by revising and refilming many scenes Lucas emphasized Anakin s desire to save Padm from death Thus in the version that made it to theaters Anakin falls to the dark side primarily to save Padm br br br Art design br For the Kashyyyk environment the art department turned to the Star Wars Holiday Special for inspiration Over a period of months Lucas would approve hundreds of designs that would eventually appear in the film He would later rewrite entire scenes and action sequences to correspond to certain designs he had chosen The designs were then shipped to the pre visualization department to create moving CGI versions known as animatics Ben Burtt would edit these scenes with Lucas in order to pre visualize what the film would look like before the scenes were filmed The pre visualization footage featured a basic raw CGI environment with equally unprocessed character models performing a scene typically for action sequences Steven Spielberg was brought in as a guest director for the film s climax overseeing the pre visualization of an unused version of the Utapau chase scene and making art design suggestions for the Order assassinations as well as the Mustafar duel The pre visualization and art department designs were sent to the production department to begin building sets props and costumes br br br Filming br Although the first scene filmed was the final scene to appear in the film shot during the filming of Attack of the Clones in the first bulk of principal photography on the film occurred from June to September with additional photography at Shepperton Studios in Surrey and Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire from August to January The initial filming took place on sound stages at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film These included the limestone mountains depicting Kashyyyk which were filmed in Phuket Thailand The production company was also fortunate enough to be shooting at the same time that Mount Etna erupted in Italy Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar br While shooting key dramatic scenes Lucas would often use an A camera and B camera or the V technique a process that involves shooting with two or more cameras at the same time in order to gain several angles of the same performance Using the HD technology developed for the film the filmmakers were able to send footage to the editors the same day it was shot a process that would require a full hours had it been shot on film Footage featuring the planet Mustafar was given to editor Roger Barton who was on location in Sydney cutting the climactic duel br Hayden Christensen said Lucas asked him to bulk up and physically show the maturity that had taken place between the two films The actor explained that he worked out with a trainer in Sydney for three months and ate six meals a day and on every protein weight gain supplement that man has created to go from lb kg to lb kg br Christensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel long before Lucas would shoot it They trained extensively with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and perform their duel together As in the previous prequel film McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes without the use of stunt doubles The speed at which Vader and Obi Wan engage in their duel is mostly the speed at which it was filmed although there are instances where single frames were removed to increase the velocity of particular strikes An example of this occurs as Obi Wan strikes down on Vader after applying an armlock in the duel s first half br Revenge of the Sith was the first Star Wars film in which Anakin Skywalker and the suited Darth Vader were played by the same actor in the same film As Christensen recounted it was originally intended to simply have a tall guy in the Darth Vader costume but after begging and pleading Christensen persuaded Lucas to have the Vader costume used in the film created specifically to fit him The new costume featured shoe lifts and a muscle suit It also required Christensen who is feet or metres tall to look through the helmet s mouthpiece br In Gary Oldman was originally approached to provide the voice of General Grievous however complications arose during contract negotiations after Oldman learned the film was to be made outside of the Screen Actors Guild of which he is a member He backed out of the role rather than violate the union s rules Matthew Wood who voiced Grievous disputed this story at Celebration III held in Indianapolis According to him Oldman is a friend of producer Rick McCallum and thus recorded an audition as a favor to him but was not chosen Wood who was also the supervising sound editor was in charge of the auditions and submitted his audition anonymously in the midst of others under the initials A S for Alan Smithee Days later he received a phone call asking for the full name to the initials A S br br br Visual effects br The post production department handled by Industrial Light Magic began work during filming and continued until weeks before the film was released in Special effects were created using almost all formats including model work CGI and practical effects The same department later composited all such work into the filmed scenes both processes taking nearly two years to complete Revenge of the Sith has shots that use special effects a world record br The film required artists and man hours to create seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone Members of Hyperspace the Official Star Wars Fan Club received a special look into the production Benefits included not only special articles but they also received access to a webcam that transmitted a new image every seconds during the time it was operating in Fox Studios Australia Many times the stars and Lucas himself were spotted on the webcam br br br Deleted scenes br Lucas excised all scenes of a group of Senators including Padm Bail Organa and Mon Mothma Genevieve O Reilly organizing an alliance to prevent Palpatine from usurping any more emergency powers Though this is essentially the birth of the Rebel Alliance the scenes were discarded to achieve more focus on Anakin s story The scene where Yoda arrives on Dagobah to begin his self imposed exile was also removed but is featured as an extended scene in the DVD release although McCallum stated he hoped Lucas would have added it to the new cut as part of a six episode DVD box set br Bai Ling filmed minor scenes for the film playing a senator but her role was cut during editing She claimed this was because she appeared in a nude pictorial for the June issue of Playboy whose appearance on newsstands coincided with the film s May release Lucas denied this stating that the cut had been made more than a year earlier and that he had cut his own daughter s scenes as well The bonus features show an additional removed scene in which Jedi Master Shaak Ti is killed by General Grievous in front of Obi Wan and Anakin The bonus features also show Obi Wan and Anakin running through Grievous ship escaping droids through a fuel tunnel and arguing over what R D is saying br br br Music br br The music was composed and conducted by John Williams who has composed and conducted the score for every episode in the Star Wars saga and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and London Voices in February The film s soundtrack was released by Sony Pictures Classical Records on May more than two weeks before the film s release A music video titled A Hero Falls was created for the film s theme Battle of the Heroes featuring footage from the film and was also available on the DVD br The soundtrack also came with a collectors DVD hosted by McDiarmid titled Star Wars A Musical Journey which features music videos set to remastered selections of music from all six film scores set chronologically through the saga br br br Release br br br Marketing br The first trailer for Revenge of the Sith premiered in theaters on

George Lucas revealed a preview of the film at the ShoWest Convention in Las Vegas saying It s not like the old Star Wars This one s a little bit emotional We like to describe it as Titanic in space

approximately US million in lost productivity because of employees who took a day off or reported in sick Grauman s Chinese Theatre a traditional venue for the Star Wars films did not show it However a line of people stood there for more than a month hoping to convince someone to change this Most of them took advantage of an offer to see the film at a nearby cinema ArcLight Cinemas formerly the Cinerama Dome On May the Empire Cinema in London s Leicester Square hosted a day long Star Wars marathon showing of all six films an army of Imperial stormtroopers guarded the area and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra gave a free concert of Star Wars music br br br Leaked workprint br A copy of the film leaked onto peer to peer file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters The film was a time stamped workprint suggesting it may have come from within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a copy of the film was taken from an unnamed Californian post production office by an employee who later pleaded guilty to his charges The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P P network br br br Rating br Revenge of the Sith is the first Star Wars film to receive a PG rating from the Motion Picture Association of America MPAA officially for sci fi violence and some intense images namely for the scene in which Darth Vader is set aflame by lava Lucas had stated months before the MPAA s decision that he felt the film should receive a PG rating because of Anakin s final moments and the film s content being the darkest and most intense of all six films Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper later opined that children would be able to handle the film as long as they had parental guidance All

the previous two films br Most critics have considered the film to be the best of the prequel trilogy A O Scott of The New York Times concluded that it was the best of the four episodes Mr Lucas has directed and equal to The Empire Strikes Back as the richest and most challenging movie in the cycle J R Jones a Chicago Reader critic who disliked The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones gave the film a positive review saying that it had a relatively thoughtful story Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three and a half out of four stars writing If Lucas got bogged down in solemnity and theory in Episode II Attack of the Clones the Force is in a jollier mood this time and Revenge of the Sith is a great entertainment but he noted that the dialogue throughout the movie is once again its weakest point br Though many critics and fans viewed Revenge of the Sith as the strongest of the three prequels some viewers thought it was more or less on par with the previous two episodes Much of the criticism was directed towards the dialogue particularly the film s romantic scenes critics claimed this demonstrated Lucas s weakness as a writer of dialogue a subject with which Lucas openly agreed when receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute Some film critics and fans criticized Hayden Christensen s acting calling it wooden A retrospective review by Time felt that Christensen s maligned performance was in part affected by the screenwriting br br br Other responses br Some American conservatives criticized the film claiming it had a liberal bias and was a commentary on the George W Bush administration and Iraq War Some websites went so far as to propose a boycott of the film Lucas defended the film stating that the film s storyline was written during the Vietnam War and was influenced by that conflict rather than the war in Iraq Lucas also said The parallels between Vietnam and what we re doing in Iraq now are unbelievable br Art critic Camille Paglia praised the film as an essential example of the modern digital art movement due to its overwhelming operatic power and yes seriousness and arguing that its finale has more inherent artistic value emotional power and global impact than the work of some contemporary artists br During the late s the film amassed a cult following on social media among some

political military and mythological motifs to enhance his story s impact The most media coverage was likely given to an exchange between Anakin and Obi Wan leading to the aforementioned conflict If you re not with me then you re my enemy Anakin declares Despite Lucas insistence to the contrary The Seattle Times concluded Without naming Bush or the Patriot Act it s all unmistakable no matter what your own politics may be br McDiarmid Lucas and others have also called Anakin s journey to the dark side Faustian in the sense of making a pact with the devil for short term gain with the fiery volcano planet Mustafar representing hell Midway through the film Lucas intercuts between Anakin and Padm by themselves thinking about one another in the Jedi Temple and their apartment respectively during sunset The sequence is without dialogue and complemented by a moody synthesized soundtrack Lucas coverage of the exterior cityscapes skylines and interior isolation in the so called Ruminations sequence is similar to the cinematography and mise en sc ne of Rosemary s Baby a film in which a husband makes a literal pact with the devil br br br Other media br br br Novelization br br The film s novelization was written by Matthew Stover It has more dialogue than the film and certain story elements were expanded upon in the novelization including Anakin and Palpatine s relationship and

integrating scenes from the film However many sections of the game featured scenes cut from the film or entirely new scenes for the game The style of the game was mostly lightsaber combat and fighting as Obi Wan or Anakin It also has a form of multiplayer mode which includes both VS and Cooperative mode In the first mode two players fight with characters of their choice against each other in a lightsaber duel to the death In the latter mode two players team up to combat increasingly difficult waves of enemies br br br The Clone Wars br br The animated film and subsequent television series fill the three year gap between the events of Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith A number of plot threads initially developed for inclusion in Revenge of the Sith were instead incorporated into The Clone Wars These include Boba Fett s revenge plot against Mace Windu for his father Jango s death and the solving of the mystery behind deceased Jedi Master Sifo Dyas which was introduced in Attack of the Clones The final four episodes of the series take place concurrently with Revenge of the Sith Several scenes from the film were recreated and expanded for these episodes in order to

McGregor Christensen Earl Jones Edgerton Piesse Smits McDiarmid and Daniels reprise their roles from the film br br br Backstroke of the West br In a fandub of Revenge of the Sith was released titled Star War sic the Third Gathers Backstroke of the West The script used in the fandub originated from the English subtitles of a Mandarin Chinese bootleg DVD of the film that had been purchased by an American in Shanghai The subtitles almost entirely filled with errors and mistranslations stemmed from a bootlegger first having listened to the film in English writing down what they believed to have heard and occasionally making things up which was then converted into Mandarin and back into English via inaccurate machine translation resulting in nonsensical Chinglish br The dub became an Internet meme and a viral video and received praise from multiple news outlets Patrick Shanley from The Hollywood Reporter described it as a fan made masterpiece while Julia Alexander from Polygon called the
