br Creation and development br Various claims have been made about the origins of the character Obi Wan Kenobi In his book about the Star Wars franchise Chris Taylor asserts that Obi Wan was inspired

Fortress br Lucas created Obi Wan Kenobi as a mentor for Luke and originally planned for him to continue training Luke in the sequel The Empire Strikes Back Although Obi Wan s death was not in the final version of the Star Wars script Lucas decided during filming that Obi Wan would die in the film According to Alec Guinness he begged Lucas to kill off his character because he hated Obi Wan s dialogue Lucas however claims he killed off Obi Wan s because the character served no purpose after his duel with Vader Lucas later reflected It would be much more powerful satisfying and interesting if Darth Vader were to kill him and he were to go on to a different form br In outlining The Empire Strikes Back Lucas wanted to bring back Obi Wan as a ghost from another dimension to continue training Luke while also considering that due in part to Guinness s health he would need to replace him with a new but similar character This new mentor would eventually take the form of Yoda br Lucas

personality and his responsibilities br br br Portrayal br When casting Star Wars Lucas sought an established star for the role of Obi Wan He considered Peter Cushing for the part but decided the actor s lean features would be better employed as the villainous Grand Moff Tarkin The film s producer Gary Kurtz felt a strong character actor was required to convey the stability and gravitas of Obi Wan Before Guinness was cast the Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune who plays Makabe Rokur ta in The Hidden Fortress was considered for the role Mifune s daughter Mika Kitagawa said her father had a lot of samurai pride and turned down the roles of both Obi Wan and Darth Vader because he thought Star Wars would employ cheap special effects and would therefore cheapen the image of samurai Once Guinness was selected and production was underway Lucas credited the English actor with inspiring the cast and crew to work harder which contributed significantly to the completion of filming Harrison Ford who plays Han Solo in the film said he admired Guinness s preparation professionalism and kindness towards the other actors br Ewan McGregor portrays Obi Wan in the prequel trilogy and in the miniseries
