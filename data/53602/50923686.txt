character appeared in the original treatment of Rogue One written by John Knoll chief creative officer at Industrial Light Magic and in the first draft of the script written by Gary Whitta The character was created as a member of Rogue One then commanded by a Rebel Alliance sergeant version of Jyn Erso The original intention was to kill all members of the Rogue One team including Cassian However fearing that Disney would not allow the ending Knoll and Whitta wrote that Cassian escapes Scarif with the Death Star plans alongside Jyn Erso and though their ship is destroyed by Darth Vader after they transfer the plans to Princess Leia they narrowly survive in an escape pod Whitta stated that having to jump through so many hoops to ensure survival indicated that Cassian and Jyn should die on Scarif Producer Kathleen Kennedy and Disney ultimately approved the ending in which the entire crew dies The main purpose of this action was believed to be for the characters to be ultimately replaced after the film by the crew of the original trilogy br br br Casting and portrayal br br In May it was announced that Diego Luna had been cast in a lead role in Rogue One Director Gareth Edwards wanted Cassian to be warm and likeable rather than the typical stoic brooding action hero leading to Edwards s decision to cast Luna early in the casting process Edwards was impressed by Luna s background in small character driven productions as he wanted the film to tell a more personal story than previous Star Wars instalments Luna felt that his casting and the casting of other non white men in the film s leading roles reflected a modern approach and a world in which racial and cultural diversity is in fact making us richer and more interesting br Luna spoke in the role with his native Mexican accent an exception for the film franchise which has mostly featured United States Canadian and British accents Luna stated that his accent was not an issue with the film s producers who were happy with it Luna also dubbed Andor s dialogue for the Spanish language version of the film the dub was recorded in Mexico City months before the film s theatrical release br While filming Rogue One Luna developed a personal backstory for Cassian to help him get into character In an interview with Entertainment Weekly he stated that he incorporated Mexican cultural influences into the character s backstory He imagined the character to come from a marginalized background as a way to explain his unique accent in the Star Wars universe He stated this backstory resonated with Andor showrunner Tony Gilroy who also wanted to explain the character s distinctive accent br In November it was reported that Luna would reprise his role in the Disney series Andor which was released in A young version of Cassian is portrayed by Antonio Vi a in the show s first season Luna once again dubbed the character for the Spanish language version of Andor which also features co star Adria Arjona voicing her own character br br br Backstory and development br br For Andor Luna and the writers of the series both sought to expand on Cassian s backstory and explore how he became the rebel leader portrayed in Rogue One At the beginning of the series Cassian is more childish and shortsighted than the character in Rogue One At the beginning of his story Gilroy imagined Cassian as being motivated by anger rather than ideology According to Gilroy the first season of Andor takes a completely disillusioned and completely self interested character and follows his development into someone fully dedicated to the Rebellion s cause Luna said that the series was ultimately about change and transformation br In Andor Cassian is established to be a refugee who was separated from his culture and community on the indigenous planet of Kenari by the Empire s oppressive regime Unlike most humans in the Star Wars universe the inhabitants of Kenari do not speak Galactic Basic the common language of the Galaxy explaining Cassian s accent The series retcons Cassian s prior backstory as established in Star Wars Rogue One The Ultimate Visual Guide which claimed that he was born on Fest In the series he has falsified documents which claim Fest as his birthplace br Luna and Gilroy saw this backstory as a way to establish Cassian s alienation and resentment for the Empire Gilroy stated that the loss of his home explained Cassian s coldblooded commitment to the Rebellion saying he wanted to allow Cassian to do some very unpleasant things along the way and yet you still not reject him Cassian s unjust incarceration and the execution of his adopted father contributes to his hatred of the Empire and he dedicates himself to resisting the Empire after being imprisoned on Narkina By the end of

IndieWire wrote that the character was a bit lost between archetypes but he s charming enough Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that the fey soft spoken Luna is particularly ill suited to play a rakish man of adventure Praising Felicity Jones in the role of Jyn Erso Chris Nashawaty wrote in Entertainment Weekly I wish Luna had a little more personality a little more Han Solo swagger to match her br Many critics and authors commented on the character s ruthless and cynical personality especially in comparison to other Star Wars protagonists Cassian s murder of an informant at the beginning of Rogue One is often considered to be a defining moment for the character Eric Goldman of IGN wrote that Luna projects innate charisma mixed with ongoing unease as we see Cassian

oppression br br Terrance MacMullan in Rebellions are Built on Hope describes Cassian as a complex but ultimately good character whose faith in his comrades is a core part of the film s philosophy To MacMullan Cassian s murder of the informant distinguishes Rogue One s more nuanced philosophy from the clear good against evil conflicts of the Original Trilogy Macmullan commented that Having to witness the daring Cassian Andor murder a fellow Rebel in cold blood nearly inverts the famous line from the crawl of Revenge of The Sith while the battles of the Clone Wars taught us that there are heroes on both sides Rogue One makes us wonder if there are villains on both sides br br br Andor br The character s portrayal in Andor received mixed reviews from critics with some complimenting his

written Humphrey Bogart style cynical romantic Ryan Britt in a review for Den of Geek wrote that the character had unclear motivations and a lack of agency in the first season that made its finale unsatisfying br Some critics have considered the story arc in which Cassian is imprisoned on Narkina to be a commentary on exploitation in the prison industrial complex Tracy Brown and Jamil Smith of the Los Angeles Times felt that the arc was a timely exploration of mass incarceration br br br Latino representation br Cassian is the first Star Wars character portrayed by a Mexican actor and one of the first Latino lead characters in a Star Wars film His appearances in Rogue One and Andor are considered milestones in the history of racial diversity and Latino representation in the Star Wars

the last years br After the release of the theatrical trailer for Rogue One the film was praised for not masking Luna s Mexican accent Caroline Framske of Vox wrote that getting to see a Star Wars
