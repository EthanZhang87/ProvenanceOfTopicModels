the dark side of the Force which results in his transformation into Darth Vader Padm eventually dies after giving birth to the twins Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Natalie Portman portrays Padm in all three prequel films In addition to films Padm appears in animated series novels comics and video games br br br Creation br Padm is introduced in The Phantom Menace the first film of the prequel trilogy She is mentioned briefly however in the film Return of the Jedi the final film of the original trilogy In the film Leia tells Luke that she has faint memories of her mother Lucas has explained that although he created a backstory for the mother while writing the original trilogy it did not make it into the films He wanted her to be mentioned in Return of the Jedi however because he was planning on introducing her as a main character in later films When Lucas began writing The Phantom Menace he envisioned similarities between Padm and Leia who he described as the daughter who follows so closely in her mother s footsteps br br br Portrayal br br br Casting br During development for The Phantom Menace concept artists were given character outlines by Lucasfilm The fourteen year old Padm was described as similar to Princess Ozma from the Land of Oz series of novels Lucas who both wrote and directed the film wanted to cast a performer who displayed strength comparable to that of Leia who is a central character in the original trilogy The filmmakers auditioned over two hundred actresses for the role before selecting Natalie Portman who was sixteen at the time One of the concept artists Iain McCaig said Portman exhibited vulnerability and strength akin to Ozma br Portman was enthusiastic about the role and thought it would be empowering for young female viewers to witness the intelligence and leadership abilities of the teenage monarch She worked closely with Lucas on her character s accent and mannerisms and watched the films of Lauren Bacall Audrey Hepburn and Katharine Hepburn to draw inspiration from their voice and stature She was relatively unfamiliar with the Star Wars franchise when she was cast and watched the original trilogy before filming began br br br Costumes br Lucas has explained that galactic society in the prequel trilogy is more sophisticated than in the original trilogy To illustrate this difference the costumes in the prequels are more elaborate than those in the earlier films Trisha Biggar the costume designer for the prequel films said there were only three costumes initially planned for Padm However Lucas felt that a noble of her stature would be constantly changing her wardrobe depending on the occasion He decided that every time the queen appeared in The Phantom Menace she would be wearing a different costume The resulting wardrobe was influenced by fashions from Japan Mongolia Tibet and other countries For Attack of the Clones Lucas wanted Padm s garb to reflect the romantic storyline He requested that her costumes be skimpy and sultry Padm s garments were displayed at the Fashion Institute of Design Merchandising in Los Angeles in and at the Detroit Institute of Arts in br br br Reception br Portman s performance in the prequel films was criticized in a number of reviews James Berardinelli called her acting in The Phantom Menace lackluster while Annlee Ellingson of Box Office Magazine said her delivery was stiff and flat perhaps hindered by the gorgeous but cumbersome costumes In his review of Attack of the Clones Mike Clark of USA Today complained about the performances of both Portman and Hayden Christensen who portrays Anakin Skywalker He wrote Both speak in monotone for doubly deadly effect though when not burdened by his co star Christensen often finds the emotion in his limited intonations Reviewing Revenge of the Sith Ed Halter of The Village Voice said that computer generated characters like wheezing cyborg baddie General Grievous and blippeting fireplug R D emot ed more convincingly than either Portman or Christensen Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle offered a less critical appraisal describing Portman s portrayal in Revenge of the Sith as decorative and sympathetic Despite the criticism Portman s performances in both Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith earned her nominations for the Saturn Award for Best Actress br br br
