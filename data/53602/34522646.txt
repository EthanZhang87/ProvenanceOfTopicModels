Freeborn designed the masks and prosthetics to match each of the costumes along with Doug Beswick Rick Baker Phil Tippett Nick Maley and Christopher Tucker Freeborn has remarked that the cantina scene was specifically set up to be a shock scene until this point in the film there had been few appearances of non human creatures and the entrance into the cantina suddenly presented the audience with an array of outlandish species Working from Lucas s direction and a maquette set designer John Barry created the cantina set complete with circular bar and shady alcoves Mollo included a few costumes borrowed from Westerns and based some other costumes on characters from the film Destination Moon and the s television series Lost in Space The alien musicians in the band were played by a number of

negotiated limited additional funding from th Century Fox executives to support second unit filming Some of the most important additional footage shot was to enhance the cantina scene at Hollywood Center Studios Lucas had been dissatisfied with the make up in previous shots due to Freeborn s illness and was now able to fully realize the scene with several close ups of alien creatures complete with Freeborn s masks Lucas also supplemented the limited coverage he had from the Tunisia footage with footage from Death Valley The new material was cut into the film by Lucas s editors including Lucas s then wife Marcia Lucas br Lucas remained dissatisfied with the final cut of the cantina scene and beginning with Lucasfilm s release of the Special Edition of Star Wars in made a number of changes to it He adjusted the confrontation between Han Solo and Greedo to portray Greedo firing at Han first This change was repeatedly further altered and has proved one of the most controversial among Star Wars fans giving rise to the popular slogan Han shot first in protest of it For the DVD the opening sequence of the cantina scene was modified to replace some practical creatures with
