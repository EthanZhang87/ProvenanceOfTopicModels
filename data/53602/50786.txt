Boba Fett BO H B FET is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise First appearing in the Star Wars Holiday Special where he was voiced by Don Francks he is an armored bounty hunter featured in both the original and prequel film trilogies In the original trilogy the character is a supporting antagonist and was mainly portrayed by Jeremy Bulloch and voiced by Jason Wingreen Notable for his taciturn demeanor and for never removing his helmet Fett appears in both The Empire Strikes Back employed by the Galactic Empire and Return of the Jedi serving the crime lord Jabba the Hutt While seemingly killed in Return of the Jedi after falling into a sarlacc he has since appeared in Star Wars media set after the film confirming his survival within the new canon portrayed by Temuera Morrison Daniel Logan plays a preteen Boba in the prequel film Attack of the Clones which reveals the character s origins as the genetic clone and adoptive son of Jango Fett also a famous bounty hunter Morrison appeared first in Star Wars media playing Jango The animated series The Bad Batch further reveals Boba to have been born Alpha and to have a biological twin sister Omega The series also reveals that he has another sister named Emerie Karr br The character also appears in many forms of Star Wars media outside of the films such as books comics television series and video games many of which depict him as an antihero rather than a villain and explore his background motivations and morality Daniel Logan reprised his role as the younger version of Fett in the animated series Star Wars The Clone Wars while Temuera Morrison who also portrayed Jango in Attack of the Clones has portrayed an adult Boba in most of his Star Wars appearances since that film most prominently in the live action Disney series The Mandalorian and its spin off series The Book of Boba Fett in which he assumes control over Tatooine with his partner Fennec Shand as the planet s new daimyo br During the development of The Empire Strikes Back Fett was originally conceived as a member of a group of white armored Imperial supercommandos before the idea was scrapped in favor of a solitary bounty hunter This concept later evolved into the Mandalorians a cultural group with strong warrior traditions who sport armor and helmets similar to Fett s In several Star Wars works Fett himself is portrayed as a Mandalorian or at least connected to the Mandalorian culture through his armor with his father Jango confirmed to have been a Mandalorian foundling and war veteran in The Mandalorian br The character of Boba Fett quickly became a fan favorite despite his limited presence in the original Star Wars trilogy and is now a widely recognized figure in popular culture His popularity within the Star Wars fanbase has earned him a cult following br br br Concept and development br Star Wars creator George Lucas created Boba Fett in his April screenplay draft of The Empire Strikes Back basing the character on Sergio Leone s Man with No Name Clint Eastwood The character needed to be designed quickly as Lucas had agreed for him to be featured in the Star Wars Holiday Special later that year The character s design stemmed from initial concepts for Darth Vader who was originally conceived as a rogue bounty hunter While Vader became less of a mercenary and more of a dark knight the bounty hunter concept remained and Fett became an equally villainous but less conspicuous character Concept artist Ralph McQuarrie influenced Fett s design which was finalized by and is credited to Joe Johnston br Norman Reynolds and the film s art department built the costume Fett s armor was originally designed for super troopers and was adapted for Fett as the script developed Screen tested in all white Fett s armor eventually garnered a subdued color scheme intended to visually place him between white armored rank and file Imperial stormtroopers and Vader who wears black This color scheme had the bonus of conveying the gray morality of his character The character s armor was designed to appear to have been scavenged from multiple sources and it is adorned with trophies A description of Fett s armor in the mid Bantha Tracks newsletter catalyzed rampant speculation about his origins By Fett s backstory included having served in an army of Imperial shock troops which had battled the clone troopers of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars br Despite two years of widespread publicity about Fett s appearance in The Empire Strikes Back script rewrites significantly reduced the character s presence in the film Fett s musical theme composed by John Williams is not music exactly but more of a gurgly viola and bassoon thing aurally cross pollinated with some obscure static sounds Sound editor Ben Burtt added the sound of jangling spurs created and performed by the Foley artist team of Robert Rutledge and Edward Steidele to Fett s appearance in Cloud City intending to make the character menacing and the scene reminiscent of similar gunfighter appearances in Western films At one point in Return of the Jedi s development Fett was conceived as being a main villain but he was finally replaced with the Emperor when Lucas decided to not make a third trilogy of Star Wars Lucas also considered having Fett fight Lando Calrissian during the sarlacc sequence br An official reference book states that Fett charges famously expensive fees and that he undertakes only those missions which meet his harsh sense of justice Daniel Keys Moran who wrote a few stories featuring Boba Fett cited Westerns as an influence on his development of the character Moran said br br The difficult thing with Fett was finding a worldview for him that permitted him to proclaim a Code given the stark Evil that permeated the Empire Fett pretty much had to be either Evil or an incredibly unforgiving harsh greater good sort of guy The second approach worked and has resonated with some readers br Lucas at one point considered depicting Vader and Fett as brothers in the prequel films but discounted it as too hokey In continuing to develop the character in the prequel films Lucas closed some avenues for expanding the character s story while opening others by establishing that Fett is a clone of a similar bounty hunter Jango Fett Lucas considered modifying later editions of Return of the Jedi by adding a shot of Fett escaping the sarlacc but decided against it because it would have detracted from the story s focus Lucas also said that had he known Fett would be so popular he would have made the character s death more exciting In after Lucas had sold Lucasfilm to Disney Star Wars historian Jonathan W Rinzler revealed that Lucas had privately acknowledged that Fett escaped from the sarlacc This was canonically established with Fett s appearances in The Mandalorian six years later portrayed by Temuera Morrison which led to a spin off focused on the character The Book of Boba Fett starring Morrison Joe Johnston and Morrison himself criticized the decision to portray the character without his helmet Morrison noting it was done to avoid comparisons with the titular character of The Mandalorian br br br Film casting and production br Boba Fett is primarily played by Jeremy Bulloch in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi Bulloch s half brother alerted him to the role He was cast as Fett because the costume happened to fit as if a Savile Row tailor had come out and made it he did not have to do a reading or screen test and Bulloch never worked from a script for either film br Filming the role for Empire lasted three weeks The actor was pleased with the costume and used it to convey the character s menace Bulloch based his performance on Clint Eastwood s portrayal of the Man with No Name in A Fistful of Dollars similar to the Western character Bulloch cradled the blaster prop made the character seem ready to shoot slightly tilted his head and stood a particular way Bulloch did not try to construct a backstory for the character and said later that the less you do with Boba Fett the stronger he becomes Playing Fett in Empire was both the smallest and most physically uncomfortable role Bulloch has played Bulloch said donning the heavy jetpack was the worst aspect of the role br Bulloch spent four weeks on Return of the Jedi He was unaware of Fett s demise before filming began and was very upset by the development he would like to have done more with Fett Still Bulloch believed killing Fett made the character stronger and that his weak death makes fans want the character to return Bulloch thought a scene created for the Special Edition in which Fett flirts with one of Jabba the Hutt s dancers was not in keeping with the character s nature br A younger version of the character was played by Daniel Logan in Attack of the Clones which establishes that Boba is a clone of his father Jango Logan had not seen any of the Star Wars films before being cast as Fett but he watched the original trilogy at Lucas request The actor had to rely on his imagination for the bluescreen filming Both Bulloch and Logan had also expressed interest in reprising their role of Fett in the planned Underworld TV series but the series remains undeveloped br br br Other portrayals br According to the official Star Wars website Fett was voiced by Don Francks in the Holiday Special Bulloch wore Fett s costume in Empire and Jedi but John Morton filled in during one scene for Empire and Jason Wingreen voiced the character in Empire His brief appearance in the Special Edition of the original film Episode IV A New Hope was performed by Industrial Light Magic creature animator Mark Austin The character s appearance in the Special Edition footage of Jedi was performed by Don Bies and Nelson Hall For the rereleases Temuera Morrison replaced the character s original voice for continuity with

the side of the sail barge from which he falls into the sarlacc s mouth The Special Edition release of the film includes an additional scene of Fett flirting with some of Jabba s female dancers br In

Shand on Tatooine br br In June it was reported that Temuera Morrison would appear as Fett in the second season of The Mandalorian As the series takes place five years following Return of the Jedi this would confirm the character s survival after his fall into the sarlacc s mouth and retcon his apparent death In the second season s premiere Chapter The Marshal it is explained that Fett s armor was salvaged by Jawas after his supposed death and then bought by Cobb Vanth a character first introduced in the Star Wars Aftermath trilogy of novels who used it to protect the Tatooinian village of Mos Pelgo from various threats In the episode the armor is eventually obtained by the Mandalorian after Vanth relinquishes it so that it could be returned to its rightful owners the Mandalorian people

of the most popular Star Wars characters In Boba Fett was selected by Empire magazine as the th greatest movie character of all time and he is included on Fandomania s list of The Greatest Fictional Characters IGN ranked Boba Fett as the eighth top Star Wars character due to his status as a fan favourite and cult following He personifies danger and mystery and Susan Mayse calls Fett the unknowable Star Wars character who delivers mythic presence Although Tom Bissell asserts that no one knows why Boba Fett has become so popular nor cares why both Lucas and Bulloch cite Fett s mysterious nature as reasons for his popularity Bulloch who has never fully understood the character s popularity attributes it to the costume and the respect Fett garners from Darth Vader and Jabba the Hutt Fett s addition to the Special Edition of A New Hope was criticized by Screen Rant which called it pointless fan service br The initial Boba Fett toy more than Fett s actual film appearance might be responsible for the character s popularity Henry Jenkins suggests children s play helped the character take on a life of its own Moran said Vader s admonition specifically to Fett in The Empire Strikes Back No disintegrations gives Fett credibility he was interested in Fett because the character is strong silent and brutal Jeter says that even when Fett appears passive he conveys capability and ruthlessness Bissell credits Bulloch for giving Fett effortless authority in his first scene in The Empire Strikes Back using such nuances as cradling his blaster and slightly cocking his head Fett s small role in the film may have made the character seem more intriguing Logan who was a Young Artist Award nominee for his portrayal of Fett compares Fett to that boy in school who never talks and who attracts others curiosity br Bissell adds that Boba Fett along with other minor characters like Darth Maul and Kyle Katarn appeals to adolescent boys images of themselves essentially bad ass but honorable about it This tension and the absence of a clear evil nature distinct from evil actions offer Fett dramatic appeal Furthermore Fett is cool because he was designed to be cool presenting a wicked ambiguity akin to John Milton s portrayal of Satan in Paradise Lost and Iago in William Shakespeare s Othello Bissell compares Fett to Beowulf Ahab and Huckleberry Finn characters too big for their original presentation and apt for continued development in other stories Moran finds Fett reminiscent of the Man with No Name br Fett has been featured extensively in pop culture and parodies Breckin Meyer provides his voice in various Robot Chicken sketches Nerdcore rapper MC Chris included a Star Wars themed song titled Fett s Vette on his debut album The creator of the Spartan helmets for the film painted one of them to look like Fett s helmet br The San Francisco Chronicle describes Boba Fett fans as among the most passionate and the character is important to Star Wars fan culture Boba Fett s popular following before the character even appeared in The Empire Strikes Back influenced Damon Lindelof s interest in developing Lost across multiple media Between filming The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi Mark Hamill pitched the idea that Fett was Luke Skywalker s mother to George Lucas which he didn t like In about a feminist campaigned online to

and Examiner com also disliked Fett s responses at the end of the episode when confronting Mace Windu He says something incredibly whiny Young does state however that o verall this pair of episodes was a satisfying conclusion to season two which really upped the game in this series in terms of animation storytelling and suspense GalacticBinder com s reviewer Chris Smith wrote Lucasfilm delivers another exciting episode to finish off a tremendous second season Adam Rosenberg writing in MTV Movies Blog discusses Boba Fett s return He s going to have to be put through a lot more hell before he

just something that Disney doesn t want to use anymore This prompted some backlash from fans including Mark Austin who portrays Fett in the Special Edition of A New Hope While the ship was not
