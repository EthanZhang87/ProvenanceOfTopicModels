K SO also referred to as K or Kaytoo Esso is a droid character in the Star Wars franchise first appearing in the film Rogue One He is a CGI character voiced and portrayed through motion capture by Alan Tudyk In the film K SO is a reprogrammed Imperial security droid and the co pilot of Cassian Andor br br br Character br br br Development br K SO was part of the initial line up of spies in John Knoll s pitch for Rogue One as an Imperial protocol droid Designs for the character s look focused on giving him both a unique silhouette as well as keeping him in tune with the Imperial aesthetic from A New Hope References of Imperial designs were used and the character s chest plate draws on the armor of an AT AT commander in The Empire Strikes Back Unused designs by Ralph McQuarrie for droids and stormtrooper helmets would influence his eventual head shape Originally designed as a black protocol droid further story development and drafts that accentuated his ties to the Empire turned K SO into an Imperial security droid His laid back personality became a visually amusing contrast to his towering monolithic form Director Gareth Edwards wanted K SO to be appealing despite his figure and designs continued to reflect elements of his personality with his form his stoop is one example showing his casual kind of personality br br br Portrayal br K SO is voiced and portrayed via motion capture by Alan Tudyk Tudyk initially turned down the role as he felt he would be busy with Con Man a webseries he had crowdfunded The droid s height meant Tudyk had to wear in cm tall stilts to perform the character which he had difficulty taking off and thus would take to the bathroom Tudyk called the stiltwalking the most challenging part of playing the droid finding further difficulty in walking over things like sand and running K when rendered had a slightly hunched over look So in order to prevent his own slouch from being added to the character Tudyk had to force himself to stand up straight With K SO having an inanimate face Tudyk tried to keep emotion in his body and his movement The actor worked with a mask teacher Orlando Pabotoy br Tudyk auditioned with three different accents an American accent a mid Atlantic accent and an English accent The English accent was chosen due to the character s Imperial roots and as he was a droid Tudyk gave him a more formal proper accent Tudyk improvised or altered many of K SO s lines However he was concerned about making the character an outlier in his own movie similar to Jar Jar Binks hoping to keep K SO feeling like part of the world br Industrial Light Magic used a modified Unreal Engine in a scene to render the droid in real time while filming This was the first time they had been able to work with CGI in the moment br br br Description br K SO is a KX series security droid originally created by the Empire reprogrammed by pilot Cassian Andor to serve the Rebel Alliance He is co pilot and sidekick to Andor and lends comic relief to the film Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post noted K SO s angular spidery limbed appearance calling him snippily sarcastic IGN s Eric Goldman described the droid as C PO s dark amped up counterpoint Like Threepio he has a knack for giving troubling statistics but instead of speaking with a worried attitude K SO has more of a resigned and often amusingly cruel and blunt approach Similarly Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly called the character C PO s more sarcastic less fey cousin Todd McCarthy described K SO as a more useful resourceful and sarcastic version of C PO in The Hollywood Reporter Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian compared the character to the titular robot from Ted Hughes novel The Iron Man writing br br K SO is hulking and dark more like Ted Hughes s Iron Man in miniature but with a droll way of objecting to orders his style in backtalk involves a nicely timed deferred punchline The arms are long resulting in an almost knuckle dragging simian way of walking In his taciturn way K SO could almost be a quasi Chewie presence br br br Appearances br br br Rogue One br K SO portrayed by Tudyk appears in Rogue One A Star Wars Story which was released in December In the film he is the second in command of Cassian Andor and rescues Jyn Erso from an Imperial labor camp on Wobani The three travel to Jedha to obtain a message from scientist Galen Erso the father of Jyn K SO is told to stay on the ship but later helps the rebels fight off stormtroopers and makes their escape from Jedha City as it is being destroyed by the Death Star Later he joins a group of Rebel volunteers to acquire the Death Star plans on Scarif Accompanied by a disguised Cassian and Jyn K SO infiltrates the planet s Imperial base and stays in the control room while Andor and Erso search for the schematics in the data vault Though he manages to fend off some attacking stormtroopers K SO succumbs to multiple shots but not before destroying the control panel of the vault door locking the closed door His sacrifice would prevent Jyn and Cassian from being killed by stormtroopers and allow them to successfully steal the plans br According to Tudyk K SO had a different death in the original ending of Rogue One The character was to be shot and killed by Orson Krennic the main villain of the film but the writers thought that K SO deserved a more heroic demise to be more suitable for him br br br Related works and merchandising br K SO appears in the novelization of Rogue One by Alexander Freed Tudyk reprises the role in the short film The Good Stuff
