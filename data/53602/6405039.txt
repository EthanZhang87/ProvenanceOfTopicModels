This is a list of different Star Wars species containing the names of fictional sentient species from the Star Wars franchise beginning with the letters U through Z Star Wars is an American epic space opera film series created by George Lucas The first film in the series Star Wars was released on May Star Wars A New Hope and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon followed by five sequels and three prequels The series featured a variety of species of alien like fictional creatures often humanoid br br br Ubese br Ubese are humanoid creatures that are primarily called on as mercenaries or bounty hunters Normally they are very aggressive people The Ubese s home world is unknown and was supposedly heavily bombarded by Republic warships in ancient times The Republic attacked in a preemptive strike due to aggressive weapon development programs on Ubese worlds The bombardments destroyed the weapon stockpiles destroying Uba I outright and poisoning Uba II Uba III and Uba V Only Uba IV remained somewhat viable although the toxic atmosphere requires that the Ubese wear environment suits outdoors Ubese tend to be very secretive associating only within their own circles br They have a very distinct hatred for Jedi believing they destroyed their homeworld thus they train with Cortosis weapons items that can resist lightsabers During the events of Knights of the Old Republic II The Sith Lords they were employed by an Exchange thug to kill the Jedi Exile The typical Ubese wears a protective airtight environment suit and it s usually armed with a double bladed vibrosword The armor they wear In Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is black with a little shine their faces are not visible due to the helmets they prefer to wear br Princess Leia was disguised as the Ubese bounty hunter Boushh in the beginning of Return of the Jedi br Ubese language is simply called Ubese br br br Ugnaught br Ugnaughts are a race of workers and scavengers that appear in The Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi the TV show Star Wars Rebels and the TV show The Mandalorian as well as in the games Jedi Knight Jedi Knight II Star Wars Bounty Hunter Lego Star Wars II The Original Trilogy Star Wars The Force Unleashed Star Wars The Old Republic and the novel Boba Fett Crossfire They are short in stature with pig like faces br Kuiil introduced in The Mandalorian is an Ugnaught br br br Umbaran br Umbarans reside on the dark world of Umbara deep within the Ghost Nebula Umbarans have the ability to subtly influence or control people easily They also see in ultraviolet spectrums Umbarans very closely resemble humans but with pale bluish skin and colorless eyes br Sly Moore Chancellor Palpatine s staff aide is an Umbaran br br br Unu br Unu is the name given to the main nest or hive of Killiks an all female race of hive mind insectoid amazons Unu was the hive that took in injured Jedi Raynar Thul after he crash landed on their world Raynar eventually became UnuThul leader of the Killiks name from the hive s name Unu and Raynar s last name Thul Any part of the old Raynar Thul s mind was either destroyed or buried in his own mind The Unu and Killiks are introduced in The Dark Nest trilogy by Troy Denning part of the Star Wars Expanded Universe br br br Utai br The Utai are one of the two races native to the planet Utapau They have long eyestalks a short body structure two toes per foot four fingers per hand and brown eyes that are well adapted to dark conditions The Utai are also known as Shorts due to both their short stature and brief lives They are native to the sinkholes of their home planet being the first to colonize the walls and crevices They are primarily working class people responsible for large aquaculture plots and domesticating several creatures for use as transports and beasts of burden br Utai society exists side by side with that of the gaunt Pau an They have only been seen in Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith Where the Pau ans are tall and thin their Utai cousins are generally short and chubby Utai have pale hairless skin and large oblong heads Two glassy black eyes protrude on thick stalks from the Utai s face which is otherwise unremarkable aside from a small puckered mouth Utai have stubby four fingered hands and are capable workers and mechanics An age ago the Utai were the sole inhabitants of Utapau s plummeting sinkholes living in dwellings nestled among the crevices of the rocky walls A planetary climate change forced Utapau s other primary species the Pau ans to migrate underground The two species formed a mutually beneficial society merging their disparate civilizations and generally living in peace A natural hierarchy formed with the Pau ans well placed as the rulers and politicians of the Utapaun cities while the more hands on Utai served as laborers and workers Utai also serve as the keepers of the varactyl super fast lizard beasts used as mounts on Utapau and over the years have learned how to tame the creatures The Utai were completely CG in the movie br br br Utapaun br The native inhabitants of Utapau can be divided into two distinct species The taller more highly evolved Pau ans have deeply lined ash colored faces gaunt builds and wear thick tightly fitting clothes The smaller Utai make up the working class They have rounded faces with distended eyes and have a short stocky build br br br Vaathkree br This species evolved on the planet of Vaathkree They seem to be made of stone and metal but it is only an armor like covering They are known for their religion centered on bartering br br br Vagaari br The Vagaari are a humanoid species from the Unknown Regions They are a race of nomadic conquerors and slavers that ruled a considerable area in the Unknown Regions They are led by the Miskara a position obtained after successfully executing a coup d etat Their clothing includes voluminous robes and large Vagaari traditional masks intended to compensate for their height and scare enemies Their government was the Vagaari Empire They appear in Outbound Flight and Survivor s Quest and are mentioned significantly in the Ascendancy Trilogy br br br Veknoid br Veknoids also known as Velkoids were a species native to the planet Moonus Mandel The famous podracer Teemto Pagalies was a Veknoid as was the Jedi Master Zao br br br Vella br Vella are the amphibious humainoid inhabitants of the planet Velreone br br br Verpine br The Verpine inhabit the Roche asteroid field and run the aerospace engineering company Slayn Korpil Verpine are characterized by their bipedal wingless bodies and their unusual ability to communicate with each other via organic short l wave radio transmissions originating from their antenna They also have vision which enables them to view microscopic fractures and stresses which is one of the reasons they make excellent mechanic and repair crews With Admiral Ackbar they designed the B wing They have an egalitarian completely democratized society Until recently the Verpine do not play a significant part in any of the Star Wars movies or novels but several of their devices do appear in the video game series Knights of the Old Republic as well as in Star Wars novels These devices seem to be almost exclusively weaponry or arms related and include a wide array of hand held projectiles that can alternatively function as shotguns sniper rifles high power assault rifles and fully automatic machine guns br However in Karen Traviss book Sacrifice they approached Boba Fett with offers of a protection agreement wherein Verpine technology would be combined with Mandalorian iron to produce unmatched weaponry Fett agrees and through the book it is apparent that as opposed to being equals the Verpine fall more under a Mandalorian sphere of influence The Verpine initiate the terms of the treaty when an argument with the Murkhanan over patents is ignored by the New Republic Jacen Solo ordered part of a fleet to patrol the space between planets arguably to get a look at the new Mandalorian fighter the Bes uliik and also setting up a possible Mandalorian Republic conflict The book ends with Boba Fett leading a strike force of Bes ulikks to bomb a series of Murkhanan industrial areas and to announce that the Mandalorians have returned br br br Vodran br The Vodrans are a species of meter tall humanoid reptiles with tough skin ranging in coloration from olive to brown and a small frame of spiny horns around their faces Though warm blooded they laid reptilian eggs with an egg clutch typically producing two or three Vodran young They were native to the planet Vodran on the fringes of the Si klaata Cluster br Before the founding of the Galactic Republic the Vodrans were approached by Dojundo the Hutt an emissary from the Hutt Empire to recruit the Vodrans for the Hutts war with the legendary Xim the Despot The Vodrans believing the Hutts to be evil deities agreed to serve the Hutts Their presence along with those of the Weequay Klatooinians and Nikto was instrumental in the defeat of Xim s army of war droids at the Third Battle of Vontor After the victory at Vontor the Hutts had the Vodran representative Kl ieutu Mutela along with the representatives of the Klatooinans Weequay and Nikto sign themselves into eternal servitude which the Vodran fulfilled faithfully br In time Vodrans adopted Hutt culture as their own Their society was organized into miniature kajidics and their family clans answered directly to the Hutt Clan of Ancients Their dealings with the rest of the galaxy always went through their Hutt masters br br br Vor br The Vor are a pterosaur like species that live on the planet Vortex The Vor tend not to use extreme force when dealing with foreign threats but instead rely on their superior morality with their strong reason and intellect br br br Voxyn br The Voxyn are a reptilian species known for their ferocious defense mechanisms As well as being extremely agile they bear poisonous spinal bristles spit a strong acid brown in color and have a screech noted to cause bleeding of the ears in some of the humanoid characters These vicious creatures were created by the Yuuzhan Vong during the New Jedi Order time period to hunt and kill Jedi There is little more known about the creatures due to a limited appearance in the novel Star by Star by Troy Denning All other appearances of the species in other franchise publications are as mentions br br br Vratix br The Vratix are native to the planet of Thyferra They are essential in the creation of the healing fluid bacta They perfected the creation of bacta by combining alazhi and kavam They vastly outnumber the human natives of the planet but are considered inferior to their corporate counterparts br The Vratix are humanoid insects They have large compound eyes a stalk like neck and three pairs of limbs sprouting from a cylindrical thorax and abdomen The upper set of limbs acts as triple jointed arms while the lower two serve as legs The last set of limbs is well muscled and is used in jumping Most Vratix are gray in color with the shades darkening with age br br br Vulptereen br Vulptereen are a stocky race from Vulpter recognizable by their shovel like snouts which sported six tusks and a single long feeler br br br Vurk br Vurks are a reptilian humanoid species with elongated faces dark eyes and a sweeping crest extending from their skulls giving them the appearance of a parasaurolophus They are native to the remote planet Sembla a watery world with warm shallow seas small volcanic islands and beautiful coral reefs rich in crystals br Vurks are nomadic and they are equally comfortable on both land and water Though they are very ethical and peaceful they are wrongly considered primitive by the rest of the galaxy because they have not developed large settlements and technology This however is due to not needing them and not because of low intelligence level br Jedi Master Coleman Trebor was a Vurk br br br Weequay br They are a race of humanoid creatures that hail from the planet Sriluur a harsh desert planet lending to the species tanned skin tone and rough sandy wrinkled skin Their eyes are dark and slightly recessed into their skull their hair tied into at least one long braid a staple characteristic and religious tradition br Due to Sriluur s proximity to Hutt Space Weequay expatriates are often found as bodyguards in Hutt syndicates through both employment and enslavement many are seen in Return of the Jedi during the Sarlacc Pit scene The most famous character from this species is the pirate Hondo Ohnaka who appears in The Clone Wars and Rebels animated series br They are a laconic people with traditions rooted deeply in their religious beliefs Much of their culture is structured around the worship of a pantheon of gods primarily the God of the Moon Quay Their cities are built around a temple known as a thal br br br Whaladon br Whaladons were large sentient mammals native on Mon Cala They communicated via sing songs Poaching of Whaladons was forbidden by Mon Calamari law but they were hunted when the Galactic Empire occupied the planet br They were first featured in the novel The Glove of Darth Vader br br br Wharl br Wharls are another name for the Tchuukthai br br br Whiphid br Whiphids also known as Toolans are tall muscled furred creatures with great tusks from the planet Toola They are great hunters and they export ice to other planets They can also go into a coma like state to heal major wounds br One particular Whiphid was J Quille who while working under Jabba the Hutt had tried to assassinate him with a slow acting poison in his food Another Whiphid was Jedi Master K Kruhk He supposedly died at the Battle of Hypori though he was shown to be alive approximately years later Aiaks Fwa was a Whiphid bounty hunter employed by Jabba the Hutt for services pertaining to the Battle of Ylesia br Many Whiphids can be found as thugs and enforcers in the underworld a sizable chunk of the thuggish workers in the aggressive regulation smashing Offworld Mining Corporation were Whiphids and the crime boss Lady Valarian operating off of Tatooine a one time competitor with Jabba the Hutt was also a Whiphid as they are disliked by most other races in general for some of their crude and brutish tendencies br The home planet of the Whiphids is the icy world of Toola in the Outer Rim Clone Commander Keller led an Imperial task force to root out Jedi hiding on Toola in the early days of the New Order Luke Skywalker Jedi Knight found Jedi artifacts left behind by a Master of the Old Jedi Order in a cave there possibly the work of Keller s division although Skywalker observed lightsaber slashes in the Jedi s empty robes that he believed must have been the handiwork of his father Darth Vader br br br Wirutid br A Wirutid is a hyper intelligent fungus that evolves into a human form to secure shelter and trap prey br br br Wol Cabasshite br A commonly misunderstood and mis characterized species Wol Cabasshites are a unique example of a culture that has advanced to sentience without the need for technology Their evolved brains are indeed highly intelligent but with a life cycle so abstract and alien their musings are often indecipherable Indeed studying Wol Cabasshite s philosophy has long been a fashionable pastime of the intellectual elite with longstanding debates regarding interpretation of the most famous and bizarre of Wol Cabasshite texts br The closest known genetic relative of the very long lived Wol Cabasshites is a small non sentient species of plasma leech parasite whose entire life cycle occurs on spacecraft where they feed on plasma and other energetic power sources Millennia of space travel have spread both the non sentient leech and the Wol Cabasshite throughout the galaxy far from their homeworld of Wol Cabassh br Wol Cabasshites are remarkably hardy They can exist in both vacuum and atmosphere having no respiratory system and a naturally pressurized interior Wol Cabasshites can tolerate remarkable temperature extremes br With a plasma rich diet and extraordinarily high metallic content in their blood Wol Cabasshites exude a magnetic field controlled by certain internal muscles including their tongues By shaping and focusing this field Cabasshites communicate with each other at a range of up to meters br Their language uses phonemic pulses of energy with syntactic contours in the field Magnetic singing is an important part of Wol Cabasshite cultures Gifted Wol Cabasshites can use magnetic fields to communicate directly with the neurons of other sentients though this often requires direct contact The sometimes unsettling sensation of direct neuron communication with a Wol Cabasshite has spread to rumors that the species can take control of a subject s brain though that is not the case br The Wol Cabasshite ability to manipulate magnetic fields has resulted in the development of devices by other cultures to assist in communication Wol Cabasshites can operate devices attuned to their magnetic singing for the purposes of locomotion communication and even defense though most do not bother Most Wol Cabasshites are content to simply sit and contemplate the nature of the universe and eat br Physiologically Wol Cabasshites are mostly stomach they even have two brains one for digestive tasks and one for cognition They eat constantly extracting nutrients and metals from nearly any substance they touch There are no known substances that are toxic to Wol Cabasshites though they are susceptible to Brainworm Rot Type A an airborne virus that affects their cognitive functions Given the bizarre nature of Wol Cabasshite thought diagnosis is very difficult br Although Wol Cabasshites reproduce asexually by vomiting out their stomach linings which become pupal Cabasshite adults may exchange genetic material during mutual tongue grooming This results in organisms exhibiting isolated genetic properties of other individuals br br br Wookiee br br Wookiees are generally peaceful creatures of the forests of Kashyyyk They have a tribal society governed by a Chieftain They are very tall furry and powerful with a humanoid shape They have extremely sharp rectractable claws however it is considered a Tribal crime to use claws in combat Aside from their stature Wookiee have bow casters which can also be seen with mounted scopes They are considered loyal friends and commit life debts to people who save them the most well known being the life debt between Chewbacca and Han Solo br br br Woostoid br Yellow skinned humanoids from the planet Woostri They were targeted during Grand Admiral Thrawn s campaign of galactic conquest Surprisingly these aliens held Imperial doctrines as truth In the novel The Last Command these aliens were referred to as the Woostroid br br br Wroonian br Wroonians are a blue skinned humanoid race from the planet Wroona in the Inner Rim br br br X ting br The X ting are an insectoid species native to the planet Cestus that change gender every three years This species proved to be dying out in the novel The Cestus Deception br br br Xendekian br The Xendekian are a small species of blue brown green and reddish brown colored skin native to the planet of Xendek They first appeared in the comic strip called Endangered Part in the lead story of Star Wars Adventures br br br Xexto br The Xexto are short m max have four arms two legs and long necks They hail from the planet Troiken Some prominent Xexto include Gasgano the Podracer pilot and Yarael Poof Jedi Master and one of the last members of the Jedi Council before the Great Jedi Purge who was a member of a genetically altered sect of Xexto the Quermians br br br Y bith br Millions of years ago sentience took root among the ancient forerunners of the Bith species on Clak Dor VII As the Bith evolved they developed impressive cities in the mountains and jungles of their world The capital city of Weogar and the domed city of Nozho stood for centuries as testament to the achievement of the proto Bith culture but relations between the cities soured and they developed a fierce rivalry br About three hundred years ago the tensions boiled over as a dispute over a stardrive patent ignited in a civil war When the war finally ended Clak dor VII s biosphere was ruined A biological attack launched at Nozho had shattered the city mutating its populace and the surrounding wildlife br Most Nozho citizens were killed outright but many who survived developed mutagenic irregularities that soon led to the creation of a subspecies of Bith The Y bith which translates as Ghost Bith eventually left the hermetically sealed cities that were built amid the ruins and attempted to establish a permanent population on Clak dor IV where they eventually founded the city of New Nozho br The bio engineering geniuses among the Y bith stabilized much of the mutation s worst effects but the populace had to adapt to their new traits of poor eyesight stronger hands and feet ductile mouth structures sensitive skin and thicker bones The Y bith have been tolerated by the Bith though not openly accepted by mainstream Bith culture Though some claim residual guilt over the bombings that created the Y bith as the cause of Bith apprehension the Bith themselves pragmatically deny such reasons They cite the Y bith s volatile biochemistry that triggers bouts of violence and aggression as reason enough to keep their distance br The Y bith have been working to gain acceptance as members of the galactic community with New Nozho becoming a notable trade port Over the course of generations the Y bith had spread to other worlds forming a notable minority presence on Nar Shaddaa and Coruscant where they aided the rebuilding efforts following the Yuuzhan Vong war br The Y bith see the story of their people as one of success and will continue working tirelessly until the whole galaxy including their Bith cousins agree br br br Yevetha br Yevetha are a Star Wars legends species now extinct or severely endangered skeletal looking race of humanoids from the planet N zoth near the Galactic Core br They were extremely xenophobic considering all other races to be vermin The Empire utilized them as shipyard workers and technicians during the Galactic Civil War primarily because of their perfectionist nature and knack for technology This backfired when the Yevetha took over all the Black shipyards and killed or enslaved all the Imperials during a full retreat During the events of the New Jedi Order the Yuuzhan Vong attacked and destroyed the Yevetha at the behest of the Fia a race from the Koornacht Cluster world of Galantos So great was the Yevethan disdain for other species that one of the survivors chose to attack and destroy a Chiss clawcraft rather than accept aid br An Imperial officer once commented to Princess Leia that the Empire had always feared the potential of the Yevetha noting that they were never allowed access to sensitive technology like hyperdrives br At their peak the Yevetha controlled a vast fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers Interdictor Cruisers their own custom made thrustships and the Super Star Destroyer Pride of Yevetha br br br Yoda s species br An unnamed race of diminutive green skinned humanoids with large pointed ears Some are powerful with the Force Known members include Yoda introduced in The Empire Strikes Back Yaddle first seen in Episode I The Phantom Menace Vandar Tokare Knights of the Old Republic and Grogu also known as the Child or Baby Yoda of The Mandalorian They can live for many centuries as Yoda claims to be years old Much about the species including its name and origins has been deliberately left vague by George Lucas and other Star Wars writers br br br Yuuzhan Vong Grysk br The Yuuzhan Vong were introduced as the main antagonists of the book series The New Jedi Order depicted as an extragalactic technophobic fanatically religious species who were intent upon conquering the galaxy which they attempted during the Yuuzhan Vong War They were both invisible to direct Force sight and unaffected by direct Force powers The Yuuzhan Vong used biotechnology and their culture was based on dominating eradicating or enslaving others and body mutilation for social status br The species was said to have featured peripherally in canceled episodes of The Clone Wars br br Canon br After the October acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney the Yuuzhan Vong were declared non canonical in April In their stead The Force Awakens introduced the First Order a successor state that arose from one of many Imperial Remnants between and ABY and eventually destroyed the New Republic in ABY while the Resistance formed in ABY continued to fight against the First Order A canonical version of the Yuuzhan Vong now known as the Grysk was introduced in the Timothy Zahn novel Thrawn Alliances Both species are described as having sloping foreheads and skull like faces as well as being a threat to the Chiss Ascendancy hailing from the Unknown Regions and enslaving other races though the Grysk use conventional mechanical technology rather than biotechnology and the novel is set in an earlier time frame than the previous non canonical Legends novels The Grysk made a major appearance as Jixtus in Thrawn The Ascendancy Trilogy br br br Yuvernian br The Yuvernians are a two headed mottled skinned reptilian horselike race from the planet of Yuvern They were fairly large beings meters in length and standing meters in height They had yellow skin with black spots and elongated skulls A Yuvernian named Cane Adiss can be seen in Jabba s palace in Return of the Jedi br br br Yuzzem br The Yuzzem are a large powerful mammalian species similar to Wookiees Most were enslaved during the reign of the Empire and taken from their home planet of Ragna III to do hard labor They appear similar to Wookiees but appearing more like werewolves Their similarities to Wookiees have led people to believe the two share a common ancestor but this has not been confirmed br br br Yuzzum br The Yuzzums not to be confused with Yuzzem are fur covered mammals with a wide mouth with protruding teeth on top of their heads and long legs They are less intelligent than the Ewoks and dwell on the plains of the forest moon Endor Groups of Yuzzums often hunt in packs through the tall grass of the plains hunting for rodents to eat br They have been exported as pets but are not very good at it They have a musical language and some Yuzzums have found employment as singers One of the singers in Jabba the Hutt s court was a Yuzzum named Joh Yowza Only three Yuzzums have been seen so far Joh Yowza Schmood and Wam Lufba Joh Yowza is the only CGI Yuzzum the rest are puppets br br br Zabrak br The Zabrak are humanoids whose most distinctive feature is the array of small horns on top of their heads Their home planet is Iridonia though they have a subspecies hailing from the planet of Dathomir It is believed that they are among the galaxy s first space faring people They have strong willpower and are a stubborn proud people By nature they tend to be independent and fearless hence have never been a successful venture in the slave trade One commonly recognized individual of this race is Darth Maul Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious Their crown of horns typically grow in at puberty and are considered secondary sex characteristics The pattern in which horns grow differs between Zabrak sub species It is analogous to race subspecies br Zabrak eye colors are often similar to the eye colors of humans with blues and browns being the most common Yellow purple red green and orange eyes are also seen regularly However Darth Maul s red yellow eye color was apparently the result of corruption by the Dark Side Zabrak also traditionally have facial tattoos typically composed of a pattern of thin lines which is considered the most traditional of Zabrak tattoos br Zabrak are popular in the gaming world The customizable player character of Jedi Knight Jedi Academy Jaden Korr can be a Zabrak female Players of the MMO Star Wars Galaxies were able to choose Zabrak as a playable race and can currently do so in the Star Wars MMO Star Wars The Old Republic In Star Wars Battlefront II Iridonian and Dathomirian Zabraks were both choosable classes for heavy and specialist br br br Iridonian br Iridonian Zabrak skin coloration could be light tan light tan dark brown or even moonlight blue Zabraks could be completely bald or fully haired Certain horn patterns are linked with certain hair patterns or lack thereof Hair can be any of the same colors seen in the human species However unlike humans Zabrak males do not have eyebrows and do not grow facial hair There is also a different pattern of horns for each gender The horns on the female are more directed to the front of the head while the most commonly males have them spanned all across the top of their head br Iridonians kept their tattoos more conservative than Dathomirians Zabrak are also well known for their skill with technology and highly advanced weaponry br Known Iridonian Zabrak from canon include Agen Kolar Eeth Koth and Sugi The Clone Wars Known Iridonian Zabrak from the Star Wars expanded universe include Bao Dur Knights of the Old Republic II Maris Brood Star Wars The Force Unleashed and Wolf Sazen Star Wars Legacy br br br Dathomirian br Dathomirian Zabrak skin coloration for males could be red peach or yellow Females could have white blue or gray skin Only males had horns females didn t Male Dathomirian Zabraks did not have hair unlike Iridonians but females could br Dathomirian tattoos were quite elaborate and were applied to them at a young age Tattoos could be black or brown and were created using the paste of the mushling plant from their home planet of Dathomir br Male Dathomirians referred to each other as brothers They were skilled in melee and hand to hand combat and known for their tribal and savage ways br Female Dathomirians referred to each other as sisters and lived in clans with each practicing the dark side of the force which they called magick They re also the more dominant gender br Known Dathomirian Zabrak from canon and the expanded universe include Darth Maul Savage Opress and Asajj Ventress The Clone Wars br br br Zeffo br The Zeffo also known as the Zeffonians are an extinct race of anthropomorphic force sensitive beings From the planet of the same name the Zeffo is introduced in the video game Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order which was developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts The Zeffo were ruled by Sages and tombs were built to remember them The Zeffo valued the Force and are often credited as the first of the force sensitive The exact reason for the extinction of the Zeffo is unknown but in a recording left behind by an unknown Zeffo Sage he states that his people were learning the ways of pride and greed br The Zeffo homeworld has a rocky and mountainous structure similar to the structure of Earth After the extinction of the Zeffo species Imperial forces occupy the planet An Imperial excavation can be found on Zeffo as well as a crashed Venator near an ancient tomb br br br Zeltron br The extremely attractive Zeltrons are a near human species native to the planet Zeltros Their skin is bright pink full red to dark brown a special pigmentation that develops from a reaction to their sun s radiation The Zeltron people have the ability to project powerful pheromones much like those emitted by Falleen These can be activated at will and can affect a specific individual or entire groups at the same time br Zeltrons are also empathic able to sense the feelings of others as well as project their own For this reason their love and comfort is extremely important to them Sharing positive emotions is deemed to everyone s benefit while sharing negative emotions is not In accordance with this Zeltros democratic government will go to great lengths to make sure no one on Zeltros is unhappy Zeltros has had few tyrants or despotic rulers because they cannot commit atrocities without experiencing another s pain Zeltros has however been invaded twelve times in the past six centuries But most invaders because of the Zeltrons pheromones have given up their hostile intentions and joined in the non stop festivities Hence Zeltrons do not worry about such trivial matters as planetary defenses or military forces They are able fighters though and they stay in peak physical condition at all times br Zeltrons will go to any length to please guests and they get pleasure from being hospitable They hold massive celebrations for practically any event They are also extremely promiscuous and are extremely proud of their sexual prowess They consider the concept of monogamy quaint but unrealistic br Zeltron technology is on par with most space faring worlds They possess space travel advanced agricultural and industrial methods and excellent knowledge of medicine particularly antibiotics Zeltron scientists have provided notable refinements in the fields of science and created much of the technology for the Pleasure Domes at Hologram Fun World br Zeltron craftsmen are renowned the galaxy over for their erotic sculptures paintings and other works of art Also in high demand on other worlds are Zeltron courtesans known as criblez who fulfill any physical desire one may have without limits Many crime lords particularly Hutts have taken special interest in these Zeltron servants Because of their popularity and because they spend their lives pursuing gratification Zeltrons are quite common in the galaxy particularly at spaceports where they can find many prospective mates br This race has now appeared in the Star Wars video game Knights of the Old Republic II The Sith Lords One Zeltron seen in the Star Wars series was Luxa an employee for the Exchange on Telos br br br Zhell br The Zhell are the supposed pre evolved state of humans in the Star Wars galaxy br The Zhell were dominant on Coruscant at some point before BBY Before the Battle of Yavin until the Taung conquered them In the middle of their epic battle against the Zhell their efforts were helped by an erupting volcano that wiped out the major Zhell city The Taung then systematically destroyed all remaining Zhell camps br br br Zillo Beast br The Zillo Beast was a gargantuan serpentine creature with a lengthy whip like tail At meters tall the Zillo Beast towered over all species on its native planet of Malastare and was considered at the top of its food chain until its presumed extinction Its tail contained eight sharp spikes and the beast itself uniquely possessed a third arm protruding from its back br Its heavy plated armor was invulnerable to explosions blaster fire and even lightsaber strikes Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker discovered that gaps in the creature s armored plates could be exploited to damage or stun the creature On one such occasion clone troopers were able to subdue the creature by using stun tanks aimed at the gaps in its armor to put the beast to sleep for transport to Coruscant br This creature first appeared in The Clone Wars season episode The Zillo Beast br br br Zygerrian br The Zygerrians are a race of feline like bipeds who are slavers from the planet Zygerria which is governed by queen Miraj Scintel They appear on The Clone Wars during the Slaves of the Republic arc br br br See also br br List of Star Wars species A E br List of Star Wars species F J br List of Star Wars species K O br List of Star Wars species P T br br br br br br External links
