currently in development br br br Concept and creation br br br Development br br When writing The Empire Strikes Back George Lucas planned to introduce a gambler type character which developed into Lando Calrissian Wanting the character to be a foil to the rough swashbuckler Han Solo possibly an old friend Lucas envisioned Lando as a cool con man with the elegance of James Bond and wit of Star Trek s Spock He would support the Empire thinking that he could outsmart the Imperials before coming to see the Rebellion as a more worthy cause br Lucas thought Lando could superficially look like a normal human but drawing from the Clone Wars mentioned in the original Star Wars film be a clone from a ruling clan of others just like him causing Princess Leia to distrust him His faction from one of many planets of clone countries was probably partly responsible for the war Lucas saw the character as a Rudolph Valentino character almost too perfect looking due to his genes being manipulated in the cloning process br Actor Yaphet Kotto was an early choice for the role but he chose to appear in the prison drama Brubaker instead Billy Dee Williams later stated that he built the character around two features he found interesting the cape and the Armenian name Calrissian The original teaser trailer for The Empire Strikes Back introduced the character as Landau Calrissian br Lando s cane in The Rise of Skywalker was designed to resemble Cloud City It is inscribed Baron Lando Calrissian br br br Portrayal br In The Verge noted that despite Han Solo s first name being written as Han and Lucas also pronouncing the name as Han h n off screen within the films most characters including Luke Skywalker pronounce it as Hahn h n The Verge also noted how Williams s Lando seems to be the only character to pronounce it as Han like Lucas and that when in The Empire Strikes Back Lando is choked by Chewbacca for betraying Han Lando causes most other characters to shift to Han In Solo A Star Wars Story Glover decided to deliberately use Han instead of Hahn in order to honor the character s trait br Ahead of the release of Solo A Star Wars Story co writer Jonathan Kasdan suggested that Lando is pansexual and stated There s a fluidity to Donald Glover and Billy Dee s portrayal of Lando s sexuality I would have loved to have gotten a more explicitly LGBT character into this movie I think it s time certainly for that and I love the fluidity sort of the spectrum of sexuality that Donald appeals to and that droids are a part of He doesn t make any hard and fast rules When asked about a scene where L jokes about Lando s being flirtatious towards Han writer Lawrence Kasdan said That is her personality Maybe it means something maybe it doesn t When asked about Lando s pansexuality Donald Glover stated How can you not be pansexual in space There s so many things to have sex with In recent years Marvel LGBT pride themed series of comic covers have featured Lando canonizing the character s LGBT status br br br Appearances br br br Film br Lando is portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in The Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker and by

its power core causing the station to explode He then joins the other Rebels on Endor in celebrating their victory and the end of the Empire br br br Sequel trilogy br Lando did not appear in the first film of the sequel trilogy The Force Awakens According to Williams the reason Lando did not return may have been that he did not fit into the storyline His absence from the casting announcement caused the displeasure of some fans br Lando was also absent from The Last Jedi During the early development of the film director Rian Johnson briefly considered bringing back Lando as the codebreaker that Resistance members Finn John Boyega and Rose Tico Kelly Marie Tran seek in the coastal city of Canto Bight but Lando was finally written out of the film s script with the codebreaker role ultimately going to Benicio del Toro s character DJ br Lando finally reappeared in s The Rise of Skywalker marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history In the backstory to the film in the years of peace after the Galactic Civil War Lando attempted to start a family and had a daughter who was kidnapped by unknown culprits when she was two years old In time it became clear that the First Order was behind both her abduction and those of other children of former Rebel leaders who had become stormtroopers thereby leaving them reluctant to order any action against the fledgling organisation lest they unwittingly kill their own children After the tragedy of losing his daughter and his failure in a quest with Luke Skywalker to find answers about the growing darkness in the Force Lando left his wife and settled on the desert planet of Pasaana adopting a life of solitude br Lando returns in The Rise of Skywalker on Pasaana appearing jovial and guiding Rey Daisy Ridley Poe Dameron Oscar Isaac Finn and Chewbacca toward a clue for the whereabouts of the Sith wayfinder Poe asks Lando to aid the Resistance but Lando refuses saying he does not fly anymore but sends his regards to Leia Lando reappears much later in the film upon Leia s death and he tells a grieving Poe that he Luke Leia and Han were similarly unprepared when they were fighting the Empire but that they were able to succeed because they had each other This inspires Poe to launch an offensive against the Sith Eternal forces including the Final Order with Lando traveling the galaxy to recruit Rebel veterans and other supporters of the Resistance s cause to help in the final battle Just as the Resistance appears most overwhelmed in the battle Lando Chewbacca and Wedge Antilles Denis Lawson arrive in the Millennium Falcon alongside a massive fleet of Resistance sympathizers allies and veterans and they help to win the battle and the war At the end of the film as the galaxy is celebrating the Resistance s victory against Emperor Palpatine Ian McDiarmid and the Sith Eternal Jannah Naomi Ackie a former stormtrooper approaches Lando and says she does not know where she is from he tells her that they will find out together br br br Standalone films br Donald Glover portrays a young Lando Calrissian in Solo A Star Wars Story which takes place roughly thirteen years before The Empire Strikes Back Glover had the opportunity to speak with Billy Dee Williams and seek his input He said Just be charming Which is the best advice Williams had expressed interest in making a cameo appearance though likely as another character in the film but he did not ultimately appear br In the film Lando is introduced as a gambler and retired smuggler who owns a ship fast enough for Han Alden Ehrenreich and his associates to use in stealing a load of raw starship fuel Han tries to win the ship the Millennium Falcon from him in a game of sabacc but

a new benchmark in the status of black representation in science fiction cinema According to Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post Lando is a fascinating and fraught part of the Star Wars legacy and the conversation around race in science fiction She added that Lando s the only character in Star Wars with a truly comfortable sense of style On his portrayal she wrote One of Williams s accomplishments in Empire and Return of the Jedi is how much he feels like an old fashioned movie star in a futuristic setting without making the performance seem incongruous br In Billy Dee Williams publicly admitted that he received backlash from children who were angered by Lando s betrayal of Han in The Empire Strikes Back Williams felt that the situation would have been different if Lando had been played by a white actor Williams wrote that Lando is not black or white he s just Lando Above and beyond the arguments or discussions of bygone eras he is of the future He further stated br br The one thing I always find myself explaining is that Lando didn t betray Han and his friends He was dealing as best he could with a situation that was presented to him by the Empire upon their arrival One of the most amusing moments for me was that Lando decided to challenge Darth Vader for about three seconds until he realized that maybe he d better back down and figure out another way to save his friends br Writing for The Verge Megan Farokhmanesh criticized Jonathan Kasdan s assertion that Lando is pansexual as a piss poor shot at representation and argued that Kasdan was conflating pansexuality with promiscuity Farokhmanesh compared the assertion to J K Rowling s statement that her character Albus Dumbledore is gay despite no Harry Potter media depicting this In Billy Dee Williams criticized the decision as well blaming Solo s underperformance at the box office on its focus on this topical issue br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Lando Calrissian in the
