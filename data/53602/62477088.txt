the bombing of the planet s surface but that Moff Gideon had turned on his word and ordered the destruction of the planet anyway The term Moff is a title for a high ranking Imperial official who served as a governor of a specific sector of space for the Empire Its first use dates back to the original Star Wars film most notably with the character Grand Moff Tarkin though the word Moff is not used in that film and the character is only identified by that title in the end credits br Gideon s life drastically changed after the fall of the Empire and he became a warlord leading his own Imperial remnant As the character Cara Dune states in the show it was widely believed Gideon had been executed for war crimes before the events of the series In The Mandalorian Gideon is attempting to

The Client is meeting with the bounty hunter Greef Karga and his associate Cara Dune at a cantina on the planet Nevarro He is under the impression that Greef has brought Grogu to him along with the imprisoned Mandalorian who had been trying to protect Grogu from the Empire In reality Grogu is not with them and the meeting is a trap arranged by the Mandalorian and his allies to kill the Client and his stormtroopers When Gideon contacts the Client during the meeting the Client assures him he has Grogu in his custody Gideon suggests that is not the case then orders a squadron of his death troopers to open fire on the cantina killing the Client and his troops Afterwards the cantina is surrounded by stormtroopers and death troopers and Gideon lands his modified TIE fighter outside the building and emerges informing the trapped Mandalorian Cara and Greef that he wants Grogu br Gideon returns in the season finale episode Chapter Redemption in which he speaks to the Mandalorian and

his crimes The Armorer explains to the Mandalorian that ownership of the Darksaber made Gideon the Heir to Mandalore before the Mandalorian had won it from him a title that is now his although due to removing his helmet he cannot be considered a Mandalorian by their tribe before bathing in the caves beneath the ruined Mandalore br br br The Mandalorian season three br After the ending of Chapter

found by Carson Teva with a fragment of Beskar alloy left behind br In Chapter The Spies it is revealed that Elia Kane one of the bridge officers of Gideon s ship when the Mandalorian attacked it in

Mandalore Moff Gideon attends a meeting alongside members of the Shadow Council a group of Imperial remnant leaders including Captain Gilad Pellaeon and Commandant Brendol Hux father of the Star Wars

military reinforcements after discovering that the Mandarlorians were planning on retaking Mandalore after Chapter Guns for Hire As Bo Katan Kryze and the Mandalorian discover Gideon s military base on Mandalore Gideon reveals himself to the Mandalorians donning a new suit of Mandalorian armor boasting of his newfound power and that he will aggregate the best resources of Mandalore cloners and Jedi to create an army with which to bring order to the galaxy After having a disarmed Djarin taken to the briefing room Gideon orders his fleet of TIE Interceptors and TIE Bombers to begin attacking

force shield br br br Other media br Moff Gideon appears as a playable character in the mobile role playing game Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes br br br Characterization br br Gideon is a dangerous and fierce man who does not hesitate to harm or kill anyone to get what he wants Though leading a remnant of the Galactic Empire Gideon freely admits that he acts in his own self interest and in the first season finale of The Mandalorian he explicitly states to the Mandalorian and his allies that they cannot trust him and he would gladly kill them all Gideon does not hesitate to kill his own men when they fail him or even for mere annoyances like when they interrupt him Sly intimidating and unforgiving Gideon is extremely determined to achieve his goals and is willing to sacrifice the lives of his men to get Grogu His motivation to get Grogu appears personal as he tells the Mandalorian it means more to me than you will ever know br Gideon is a strong military strategist and despite the fall of the Empire still wields power commanding a considerable number of Imperial forces including people equipment and spaceships Stephanie Dube Dwilson of Heavy com noted that while many of the remnant Imperial stormtroopers featured throughout the first season had worn and dirty armor the troopers under Gideon s command had new and pristine armor reflecting Gideon s stature Through his past association with the Imperial Security Bureau Gideon had access to a great deal of classified intelligence and as a result he is extremely knowledgeable about topics unknown to most other characters in the series Giancarlo Esposito said the character seems to know everything about everyone as illustrated in the season finale when he reveals he knows the names and biographical details of the Mandalorian Cara Dune and Greef Karga br Esposito has rejected simple classifications of Gideon as a good or bad character noting that he is attempting to restore stability to the galaxy following the fall of the Empire Esposito felt Gideon becomes sort of the guardian of the people after the Empire s decline and that in attempting to bring order to a lawless time the character could be seen as a savior Esposito said of the character Is he good Is he bad We don t know We do know that the world needs someone to put it back together He felt this moral ambiguity was particularly applicable to the real world at the time in which the series was released saying Leaders who exhibit kind of a faulty power because they still have ideas that they want to aggrandize themselves we re in that world now Gideon has a vision for the future and a strong personal sense of order one of the driving principles of the Empire which had a militaristic approach to policing the galaxy that Gideon also embraces br Several reviewers have suggested that Gideon may be actively attempting to emulate Darth Vader one of the major characters from the Star Wars franchise who had been an agent of the Empire Gideon s personality and behavior also bear similarities to Vader including his tendency to execute underlings who disappoint him Kevin Melrose of Comic Book Resources also noted that Gideon s TIE fighter crash near the end of the first season finale is similar to Vader s final scene in the original Star Wars film when his TIE Advanced fighter is sent spiraling out of control into space br br br Concept and creation br br br Portrayal br br Moff Gideon is portrayed in The Mandalorian by Giancarlo Esposito He was recruited for the part by series creator and showrunner Jon Favreau Esposito and Favreau had previously worked together on several previous projects starting with the pilot for the post apocalyptic science fiction television series Revolution which Favreau directed and in which Esposito starred Favreau next directed Esposito in a commercial for the video game Destiny which led to Favreau casting him in his film adaptation of The Jungle Book Esposito said one of the first things he did after accepting the role was to contact his friend Samuel L Jackson the actor who portrayed Mace Windu in the Star Wars prequel trilogy and say Yo man I m in that series too dude br The casting of Esposito was announced on December Details about his character were not immediately revealed though there was early speculation he might be playing a villain due to his past performance as Gus Fring one of the primary antagonists of Breaking Bad and an important character in its spinoff Better Call Saul Footage of Gideon was first publicly shown at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Chicago on April which included a brief shot of the character flying his TIE Fighter Esposito was on hand at the D Expo on August for the release of the first public trailer of The Mandalorian Gideon also appeared briefly in a second trailer released on October br In preparation for the role Esposito rewatched the Star Wars films to get a sense of the style of the films and to try to get a feeling for what it would be like to be in that fictional universe Esposito was a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy film prior to joining The Mandalorian though he said he was less interested in the later prequel films because they became more and more in a different vein than what I wanted to be in Regarding the original Star Wars films Esposito said br br For me these films they formed a part of my childhood and they gave me the ability to dream and to feel like they would take me to another place And when you have a film that does that in an imaginary world that could be so real it s very exciting for you They taught me how to feel like a champion how to feel like there are always going to be challenges but that if we are able to come together as a family somehow and if I can believe in myself I can overcome anything br Esposito was disappointed with the lack of diversity in the older Star Wars films and appreciated that there were more minority actors in the later productions as well as in the cast of The Mandalorian which he credited to Favreau He called being cast as Moff Gideon a dream come true and said of the role He s a very interesting character and I m so honored to be a part of this production After the show aired Giancarlo said two of his four daughters sent him text messages urging him not to hurt the Child who had become an Internet sensation Esposito said he jokingly responded I will squash that little big eared bastard br br br Costume br br Moff Gideon s costume was designed by Brian Matyas concept designer and artist for The Mandalorian He called designing Gideon s costume one of the highlights for me on the show and for my career as a whole The costume was created based upon the design by costume designer Joseph Porro with props and costume fabrication by Frank Ippolito via Ippolito s company Thingergy Inc The costume is all black and includes body armor a cape and an elaborate chest piece and several reviewers have noted the costume s similarities to that of Star Wars character Darth Vader Esposito called his costume incredible and said he wanted to keep his costume and props after filming but was not able to They said to me it s all going to wind up in a museum You re going to be so honored when you see it there in a couple of years But you can t have it now br br br Filming br Esposito s scenes for The Mandalorian were filmed on a sound stage in Southern California on a Volume a large warehouse like motion capture stage with green screens and tracking cameras spread throughout the space Using a combination of physical set pieces and images projected onto the screens the Volume allows the actors to be filmed and placed into a digital environment Esposito said of filming scenes in the Volume we can control the physical atmosphere of what is projected on the walls and control how gravity is you get a feeling that gravity is being played with br Esposito particularly enjoyed working with Taika Waititi the director of the season finale whom he described as in his own world creatively and called a very different and odd human being but aren t we all as creative artists The sequences with Moff Gideon flying his TIE Fighter were filmed in the Volume and Waititi was very detail oriented in working with Esposito on the scenes For example Waititi gave Esposito very specific feedback on what he felt Esposito should be doing with his feet during the final scene when he cuts himself free from the crashed TIE Fighter Esposito found this direction confusing saying What s bugging you about the way my feet are I m on a globe feet in the sky Esposito said he enjoyed seeing and interacting with the animatronic puppet of Grogu during filming saying It melts my heart because the reality is this little baby does things that you could never imagine and when you look at those eyes and that little body how can you not help but fall in love Esposito had not seen the finished footage of The Mandalorian until a few months before the show aired br br br Reception br Moff Gideon has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike Scott Snowden of Space com said Giancarlo Esposito plays the role to perfection Sean Keane of CNET called the character absolutely magnificent and pretty damn scary Screen Rant writer Kiki Evans said Moff Gideon makes quite a terrifying villain Kevin Pantoja also from Screen Rant said the character immediately feels like a major threat upon his introduction to the show Stephanie Dube Dwilson of Heavy com said the character strikes the perfect mix of potentially crazy and very powerful SyFy writer Matthew Jackson said though Gideon s appearance in the first season was brief it was also impactful writing The character quickly established himself as a force to be reckoned with Brian Silliman also of SyFy called Moff Gideon a formidable villain IGN writer Laura Prudom said the first season ends with Moff Gideon positioned as a worthy adversary for the Mandalorian and his allies Ben Pearson of Film said the character made a big impact in the season finale Caitlin Gallagher of Bustle noted that immediately after Chapter The Reckoning aired many fans expressed outrage sadness and anxiety about Moff Gideon particularly on social media websites due to his role in the death of the character Kuiil and the kidnapping of the Child at the end of that episode Moff Gideon ranked second on a Screen Rant list of the most interesting characters from the first season of The Mandalorian third on a separate list of the ten best characters from the show and his costume was ranked seventh on a list of the ten best costumes in the first season br br For his performance as Gideon in the Season One finale Esposito was nominated
