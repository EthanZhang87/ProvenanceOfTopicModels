planning its potential sequels Lucas imagined a film just about Wookiees nothing else After the original film s success its cast made a few appearances on TV variety shows According to Charles Lippincott who was head of marketing of the Star Wars Corporation CBS brought the idea of doing a TV special to him and Lucas although there is some internal dispute about this claim According to J W Rinzler Everybody agreed that a television special was a good idea Lucas was busy moving his production company to a new location which was not heavily involved in the special According to Lucasfilm producer Gary Kurtz br br It did start out to be a lot better with a different script We had half a dozen meetings with the TV company that was making it In the end because of work on promoting Star Wars and working on the next film we realized we had no time So we just left it to them and just had the occasional meetings with them provided them with access to props and the actors and that was it br Though Lucas is uncredited it was his idea to build the narrative around Chewbacca s family CBS hired experienced variety show writers and producers including writer Bruce Vilanch who was concerned about the decision to center the special on a species who grunt in a fictional language without subtitles Regardless Lucas would not budge on his vision The special went through two directors The first David Acomba was brought in through an attempt to make us different in variety shows according to Lippincott br Acomba a classmate of George Lucas at USC film school was unfamiliar with a multiple camera setup which caused some problems Acomba also felt that there was a divide between himself and the producers and chose to leave the project after finishing only a few scenes including the cantina and Jefferson Starship He was replaced by Steve Binder whose only contact with Lucasfilm was a Wookiee bible detailing how the species should look and behave Stan Winston was hired to design the Wookiee family br The special was broadcast in its entirety in the United States only once on Friday November the week before Thanksgiving on the television network CBS from pm to pm

video watched by Lumpy br Art Carney has a more integral role in the story playing a trader named Saun Dann on Kashyyyk who is a member of the rebellion and helps Chewie s family His segments are also largely played for laughs and at one point includes a scene alluding to his character Ed Norton from The Honeymooners where an Imperial officer demands that he get on with it while Carney dallies with a prop thus introducing the Jefferson Starship performance br br br Cartoon br The high point of the special is generally considered to be the animated segment known as The Faithful Wookiee which is the first official Star Wars cartoon It was written by Lucas and produced by Toronto animation firm Nelvana Ltd which later produced Droids and Ewoks two Saturday morning series based on the franchise in on ABC Lucas requested that the visual style be inspired by Moebius The vocal talents of the main cast are featured Intended as an in universe flashback Luke wears a yellow jacket similar to his outfit at the end of A New Hope br The cartoon introduces Boba Fett whose appearance was based on footage of the unpainted costume from The Empire Strikes Back and according to Nelvana co founder Clive Smith their suggestion to scuff up his costume a little bit influenced the character s live action appearance The final costume design made a public parade appearance two months before the Holiday Special aired The simplified color scheme for the cartoon was later repeated for Fett s appearance in Droids According to the official Star Wars website Fett was voiced by Don Francks in the

level of canon superseded by other licensed works br This was clarified in by Leland Chee who maintained Lucasfilm s internal continuity database called the Holocron According to Chee the Holocron contained at least entries about The Star Wars Holiday Special by that point These placed all elements referred to in other works such as Life Day and Chewbacca s family members in an intermediary level of canon Chee stated that elements not subsequently referred to were given the next lowest rank br Chee also confirmed that Leslie Schofield appears as an unnamed character in The Star Wars Holiday Special and not the character he played in A New Hope named Chief Bast Previously this confusion had caused some fans to question whether Bast s death aboard the Death Star was genuine drawing
