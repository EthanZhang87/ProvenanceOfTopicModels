repelling multiple bounty hunters during the climactic scene in Chapter The Sin Vizsla has a confident personality and is more outspoken than most of the other Mandalorians in his tribe Scott Snowden of Space com called him the alpha Mandalorian in the room He despises the Galactic Empire due to its persecution of the Mandalorian people His hatred for the Empire runs so deep that he opposes any collaboration or association with them whatsoever This distinguishes him from the show s title character who reluctantly accepts a bounty hunting assignment from Imperials a decision that ultimately leads to a brief physical skirmish between him and Vizsla br However Vizsla has a respect for both his tribe and Mandalorian culture that supersedes his feelings of distaste toward the Empire He willingly steps down from his confrontation with Din Djarin when the tribe s leader the Armorer reminds them of the moral code and way of the Mandalorian people Despite their differences Vizsla and Djarin display a mutual respect for each other This is demonstrated when Vizsla places his own safety and that of his tribe at risk to help Djarin at the end of Chapter The Sin When Djarin notes that this would place the sanctuary of the tribe s enclave at risk Vizsla responds with the clan s credo This is the Way Snowden called this a genuine lump in the throat moment as the Mandalorian s comrades have sacrificed everything to help the bounty hunter do the right thing br Din Djarin later returns the favor in Chapter The Foundling in which he helps Vizsla rescue his son from a flying
