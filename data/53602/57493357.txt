br br br Character br br br Description br Qi ra is introduced as an earnest thief in love with Han and dreaming of escape from the slums of the planet Corellia They are separated by circumstance and when they reunite years later they have both been through life changing experiences Clarke called Qi ra a badass who kind of follows a femme fatale arc and said She has a couple of guises but essentially she is just fighting to stay alive If you ve got a really glamorous lady in a really sordid environment you kind of know the glamour is hiding a few rough roads Solo director Ron Howard described Qi ra as secretive slippery and morally questionable a much different sort of a character from Daenerys Targaryen Clarke s character from the HBO series Game of Thrones Clarke noted that her Solo character isn t like the women that you ve seen in Star Wars yet and said that Qi ra is different from the other women I ve played but the similarity is her strength and her survival instincts She just has a bit more grit She said We re going to hit you with a character that could very easily well be a dude because you question her motives That s really exciting in the Star Wars universe because that has never happened Clarke said Qi ra s journey is definitely one of survival and strength The way that I felt about her was yeah this girl has got a core of steel Calling Qi ra a galactic femme fatale Entertainment Weekly s Anthony Breznican wrote br br This is a character who doesn t want her full resume out there She s a woman of shadows of secrecy She s a woman of many identities the truest ones hidden away and only visible to those she trusts which may be no one She s also one of the primary forces that shape Han the young smuggler br Clarke said Every single part of her as a character reflects on the Han Solo that we know and love She explained br br The beautiful thing about this Han Solo story is it s highlighting all of the most brilliant aspects of Han Solo the character and characterizing those aspects in characters that he meets on his journey to becoming who he is You are seeing all of these different elements that make up who he is through the people and the interactions and the relationships just as we all do as human beings We are simply the embodiment of our experiences You see the beginnings of him this loveable rogue You get it fine tuned throughout these relationships and Qi ra is one of those relationships that has an impact on him as a character The goal is that the shadow of Qi ra is there in Han as a character that we know This girl is another texture that makes up who he is when we first meet him br According to Solo co writer Jonathan Kasdan Qi ra is Han s formative experience with romance and that experience very directly influences the relationships he has later on with people like Leia Describing Qi ra s relationship with Han Clarke explained that They grew up as comrades essentially They grew up as pals as partners in crime There is obviously the romantic side of things But they grew up together So they were kids together She said that later within that relationship the thing that you see with Qi ra is that she is an enigma Clarke also noted There is this underlying joy in an origin story because you know where they end up And Qi ra is nowhere to be seen so something has happened Something must have happened to affect him as a person but for us fans not to know about her br br br Portrayal br In October Tessa Thompson Naomi Scott Zo Kravitz Emilia Clarke Kiersey Clemons Jessica Henwick and Adria Arjona were being considered for the female lead in Solo A Star Wars Story named Kura in early drafts Clarke known for her role as Daenerys Targaryen in the HBO fantasy television series Game of Thrones was cast the following month Clarke told Vanity Fair that she struggled with the character under Solo s original co directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller and sought advice from the film s father and son screenwriters Lawrence and Jonathan Kasdan She said of the role She ll be the sort of character that will keep you on your toes and I think that was one of the biggest things that drew me to her as a character and got me really excited br Qi ra was featured in the May episode Triplecross of the D animated web series Star Wars Forces of Destiny voiced by Olivia Hack br br br Reception br br br General br Qi ra has been positively received by both critics and fans with many referring to her as a standout and the most fascinating aspect of Solo A Star Wars Story Pete Morrison of the Rebels Report called her the best character in the film Stating that Emilia Clarke jumps from genre franchise in Game of Thrones to another in a galaxy far far away and manages to have the most complex and interesting story arc of any character in the film Futurism s Marguerita Tan wrote that Qi ra is a complex character who is not only intelligent and resourceful but also someone who can look after herself Tan concluded that it wasn t hard to understand why many fans were so keen to see the character in more on screen adventures Dana Brandt of The Daily Cardinal was critical of the character s arc stating that Qi ra and by extension her relationship with Han was underdeveloped Bustle s Casey Cipriani suggests that Qi ra may or may not have been a Sith and states that a female villain who can use the Force has never been portrayed in a Star Wars film br br br Future br Many have expressed interest in a follow up to Qi ra s story Derrick Clements of the Daily Harold wrote she is introduced as a character with depth and mystery to spare Most of all where the film leaves her is tremendously full of possibility Writing for Comic Book Resources Rita Dorsch proclaimed Qi ra s turn in Solo to be the most interesting part of the film and went on to state that any follow up needs to focus on her Bustle s Angelica Floria stated the headstrong combatant played by Clarke seems to only have just begun her role in the Star Wars universe She notes that Clarke signed on for multiple films and adds that the ending of Solo makes it clear that future Star Wars projects could continue
