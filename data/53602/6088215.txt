while trying to keep his existence a secret However after he is tasked with planting the seeds of what would become the Rebel Alliance which Vader plans to take advantage of to overthrow the Emperor Starkiller begins to question his own morality and to slowly redeem himself Following The Walt Disney Company s acquisition of Lucasfilm in the game became part of the non canonical Star Wars Expanded Universe also known as Star Wars Legends and an alternative origin for the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Civil War was given in other forms of Star Wars media such as Star Wars Rebels br Star Wars The Force Unleashed received generally positive reviews from critics with praise for its story voice acting physics art and soundtrack but criticism for its linear gameplay and technical issues The game was a bestseller in the United States and Australia with over one million copies sold its debut month As of February the game had sold over seven million copies and was the fastest selling Star Wars video game of its time A sequel Star Wars The Force Unleashed II was released in October br br br Gameplay br The Force Unleashed is a third person action game in which the player s character s weapons are the Force and a lightsaber Developers treated the main character s lightsaber like another Force power and wanted to ensure something visceral and cool happened with each button push The game has a combo system for stringing lightsaber attacks and for combining lightsaber attacks with Force powers Experience points earned by killing enemies and finding artifacts can be used to increase Starkiller s powers and traits The gameplay is intended to be easy to learn the development team included horrible gamers to help ensure the game s accessibility Players can casually run and gun through the game but the game rewards those who take a stealthy more tactical approach The game includes enemies that are easy to overcome game difficulty arises from presenting these enemies in large numbers that can wear down the player s character Additionally enemies learn from the player s character s attacks using the same attack on different characters can sometimes lead to the player s character doing less damage The enemies which number over have various strengths and weaknesses developers faced the difficulty of effectively placing them throughout the game s varied environments Players must also carefully manage their automatically regenerating Force energy when using exceptionally strong Force abilities as overuse of them can drop the Force meter below zero to a negative level incurring Force debt that disables all Force powers for a period of time until the auto regeneration removes the debt the more Force debt incurred the longer the player will be without Force abilities br br br Version differences br The Force Unleashed has different features across platforms The PlayStation and Xbox versions powered by the Ronin engine utilize high definition graphics and advanced dynamic destruction effects These versions also support downloadable content in the form of two expansions that expand upon the game s plot The Nintendo versions use motion controls to implement Starkiller s attacks with the Wii version using the Wii Remote to execute lightsaber attacks and the Nunchuk to wield Force powers while the Nintendo DS version utilizes the touchscreen to execute attacks where single actions can be executed by tapping a certain region of the screen with each region corresponding to a particular action such as jumping or Force pushing while more advanced attacks can be performed by dragging the stylus across neighboring regions of the screen br The PlayStation and PlayStation Portable versions are identical in content to the Wii version which is different than the PS and Xbox version Since these versions don t support or use downloadable content they exclusively intersperse certain levels with three of the five Jedi trials that Starkiller completes at the Jedi temple in Coruscant to further hone his abilities which are all included in a DLC pack for the PS and Xbox versions The PSP version also exclusively features five additional historical bonus levels that re enact pivotal scenes and duels throughout the Star Wars saga as well as special scenarios that can be played with as different Star Wars characters who have the same abilities in the standard single player mode The Nintendo DS version utilizes D graphics like all other major versions but lacks voice acting br The Wii and handheld versions support multiplayer Two players duel against each other as famous Jedi and Sith in the Star Wars saga in the Wii version while the handheld versions utilize wireless multiplayer for a four player battle mode br The Switch version is a port of the Wii version with an option to use button controls instead of motion controls These optional motion controls are available in both the Single Player and Dual Modes The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is also supported br br br Plot br Shortly into the Galactic Empire s rule Imperial spies locate a Jedi survivor of the Great Purge named Kento Marek on Kashyyyk Darth Vader arrives as the planet is invaded and eliminates any Wookie resistance between him and the fugitive Jedi Reaching Kento s home Vader easily defeats him in a lightsaber duel but senses someone far more powerful nearby Initially believing it to be Kento s Jedi Master Vader prepares to execute the defiant Jedi until his lightsaber is suddenly force pulled from his hand by Kento s son Galen Sensing the boy s strong connection to the Force Vader proceeds to kill Kento and an Imperial squadron after they try to execute Galen and secretly takes him as his apprentice with only a select few knowing of his existence br Years later an adult Galen given the alias Starkiller completes his Sith training He s sent by Vader to eliminate several Jedi survivors across the galaxy in preparation for

Starkiller and Imperial pilot Juno Eclipse Starkiller s targets include Rahm Kota a Clone Wars veteran and leader of a militia Kazdan Paratus insane after years of isolation on Raxus Prime and Shaak Ti who s hiding on Felucia Two of these three Jedi masters Kota and Ti inform Starkiller that they have foreseen that soon Vader will no longer be his master before he finishes them After the latter s death Starkiller returns to Vader once more but the Emperor arrives his spies having uncovered Starkiller s existence To prove his loyalty to the Emperor Vader appears to kill his apprentice by stabbing him and hurling him through space br Unbeknownst to the Emperor Vader has Starkiller recovered and resuscitated Vader sends Starkiller to foster a rebellion among the Empire s enemies hoping

trust Starkiller rescues his captive daughter Princess Leia Organa and liberates the enslaved Wookiees at her request Starkiller learns from Kota that Bail went missing on Felucia after searching for Shaak Ti in the hope that she would rescue Leia Starkiller travels to Felucia to find Bail discovering that he d been captured by Shaak Ti s former apprentice Maris Brood who succumbed to the Dark Side after her master s death Starkiller defeats Brood but spares her life and convinces Bail to join the rebellion br To convince more dissidents to do the same Vader suggests that Starkiller attack a Star Destroyer facility on Raxus Prime to show that the Empire is vulnerable Juno learns that Starkiller is still serving Vader and chastises him but agrees to keep silent On Raxus Prime Starkiller is attacked by PROXY who attempts to fulfill his programming by killing him but Starkiller defeats him destroys the facility and pulls a falling Star Destroyer out of the sky using the Force Bail meets with fellow senators Mon Mothma and Garm Bel Iblis on Corellia to formally organize a rebellion only for Vader to arrive and arrest them and Kota After overpowering Starkiller Vader reveals that he was merely a tool to lure out the Empire s enemies and had never intended to use him to overthrow the Emperor Starkiller escapes after PROXY sacrifices himself by attacking Vader br Juno rescues Starkiller who uses the Force to see that Kota and the senators are being held on the Death Star After Juno kisses him and he bids farewell Starkiller battles his way through the station to reach the Emperor s throne room Vader confronts him but Starkiller defeats his former master and faces the Emperor who tries to goad him into killing Vader so Starkiller can take his place Kota tries to attack the Emperor but is subdued with Force lightning At this point the player must choose between saving Kota Light Side or killing Vader Dark Side br br If the player chooses the Light Side Starkiller defeats the Emperor but spares him at Kota s urging The Emperor unleashes Force lightning at Kota but Starkiller absorbs it sacrificing himself to allow Kota and the senators to escape on the Rogue Shadow The Emperor and Vader become concerned that Starkiller has become a martyr to inspire the newly formed Rebel Alliance On Kashyyyk the senators proceed with the rebellion and Leia chooses Starkiller s family crest as their symbol Kota tells Juno that among Starkiller s dark thoughts Juno herself was one bright spot that he held onto right until his death br If the player chooses the Dark Side Starkiller kills Vader and is congratulated by the Emperor who commands him to kill Kota to sever his ties to the Jedi and become a Sith Lord Starkiller instead attacks the Emperor who foils his attempt and then crushes him with the Rogue Shadow severely injuring Starkiller and killing Juno Kota and the senators Starkiller later awakens to find his body being grafted with armor to continue serving the Emperor though he assures Starkiller that he ll be replaced once he finds a new apprentice just as Vader before him br br br Downloadable content br Three downloadable content DLC levels for the game were released for the PS Xbox and computer versions of the game The first one is set during the events of the main story and explores more of Starkiller s background while the second and third ones expand upon the non canonical Dark Side ending of the game taking place in their own alternate timeline All three DLC packs are included on disc in the Ultimate Sith Edition for all abovementioned three platforms br The Coruscant DLC depicts Starkiller at some point before traveling to Kashyyyk deciding to visit the abandoned Jedi Temple to learn more about his identity and connection to the Force After fighting his way past the Imperial security forces he reaches the old Council Chambers where he meets Kento Marek s spirit who tells him that he needs to pass three Jedi trials Upon doing so Starkiller is faced with a mysterious Sith warrior revealed to be a dark reflection of himself created by his own fear Following his defeat Starkiller finds a holocron left by Marek who reveals himself as his father and implores him to return to the light side Starkiller then returns to the Rogue Shadow to resume his current mission br The Tatooine and Hoth DLC s are set during alternate depictions of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back respectively and present Starkiller as the Emperor s trusted assassin referred to as Lord Starkiller br In the Tatooine DLC he s tasked with retrieving the Death Star plans stolen by the Rebel Alliance which have been tracked to Tatooine He visits Jabba the Hutt who has knowledge on the plans whereabouts revealing that they re in the possession of two droids at Mos Eisley When Starkiller refuses to work for him Jabba attempts to have Starkiller eaten by his rancor Killing the beast Starkiller escapes from Jabba s palace after massacring Jabba s mercenaries including Boba Fett At Mos Eisley Starkiller kills Jedi Master Obi Wan Kenobi after a duel which allows the droids to board the Millennium Falcon though Starkiller

battle Starkiller infiltrates the base with orders to capture Luke Skywalker who had begun training as a Jedi Starkiller finds and defeats Skywalker in the base s hangar severing his right hand When the Falcon tries to take off Starkiller seizes the ship with the Force while goading Skywalker to give into the Dark Side to rescue his friends Skywalker attacks Starkiller with Force lightning causing him to let go of the ship and congratulate Skywalker for embracing the Dark Side planning to make him his apprentice the same way that Vader did to him br br br Cast and characters br br Sam Witwer as Galen Marek Starkiller The forbidden child of a Jedi Starkiller was adopted by his father s killer Darth Vader who aware of his strong connection to the Force raised him to be his secret apprentice Once his training is complete Starkiller is dispatched by his master to kill several prominent Jedi who survived the Great Jedi Purge Although initially acting as a villain Starkiller is really just a damaged kid Developers decided not to give Starkiller a name in the game but the novelization reveals his real name as Galen Marek Although Starkiller starts as Vader s apprentice a focus of the game is to allow the character to evolve into something more heroic something greater Audio director David Collins saw a resemblance between Starkiller concept art and his friend Witwer Collins asked for Witwer s headshot and an audition reel and a few weeks later Witwer sat for a minute audition Witwer secured the role by demonstrating to developers his deep understanding of the character in portraying Starkiller Witwer brought many new ideas about the character and imbued him with a sense of humanity Developers tried not to make Starkiller so evil that players would have difficulty connecting to him aiming to strike a balance between loyalty to his master and his growing sense of disillusionment with the Empire The character s name is an homage to Anakin Starkiller the original name of the character that eventually became Luke Skywalker br Matt Sloan as Darth Vader A powerful Dark Lord of the Sith high ranking enforcer of the Empire and Starkiller s master who discovers Starkiller as a child and trains him In training Starkiller by having him hunt the few remaining Jedi survivors Vader intends to prepare him to overthrow the Emperor although there are twists and turns in this scheme The events depicted in The Force Unleashed are pivotal to Darth Vader s history and development depicting him as being largely responsible for the events leading to the Galactic Civil War depicted in the original Star Wars trilogy br Nathalie Cox as Juno Eclipse Rogue Shadow s pilot and Starkiller s love interest Eclipse was not originally part of the game early concepts had the apprentice as an older character who develops a connection with a young Princess Leia Star Wars creator George Lucas uncomfortable with this idea encouraged the developers to create a love interest The apprentice who has had limited interaction with women when the game begins does not at first know how to act around her Her introduction early in the game allows the relationship with Starkiller to develop and her inclusion helps recapture that rich ensemble feel of the original Star Wars According to Sean Williams who wrote the novelization the romantic storyline is the key to The Force Unleashed The name Juno Eclipse was originally proposed as a name for the character eventually called Asajj Ventress it was ultimately rejected as insufficiently villainous The Force Unleashed project lead Haden Blackman brought the name back for the mythic quality of the name Juno and the duality suggested by an eclipse Cox in addition to strongly resembling the character s concept art had integrity and poise appropriate to Juno Eclipse that helped the actor secure the role br Cully Fredricksen as General Rahm Kota A Jedi Master and Clone Wars veteran who provides Starkiller with additional insight into the Force and helps connect him to his Jedi heritage Developers realized early that Starkiller would require insight into the Force from someone other than Darth Vader after rejecting the idea of this coming from the spirit of Qui Gon Jinn or some version of Darth Plagueis they decided to fill this role with one of Starkiller s Jedi opponents The character was conceived as a tough as nails contrast to the more traditional image of a Jedi represented by Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi Senior concept artist Amy Beth Christianson drew upon samurai influences for Kota s appearance The character changed little after being conceived Fredricksen s own traits made the character tougher Fredricksen was the first actor cast for the project br Adrienne Wilkinson as Maris Brood A Zabrak survivor of the Jedi Purge and Shaak Ti s apprentice After her master s death at Starkiller s hands Brood falls to the dark side and uses Felucia s inhabitants to wage war on the Imperial forces trying to occupy the planet The character was originally conceived as a pirate captain and Christianson s early art included Brood s distinctive lightsaber tonfas Wilkinson brought strength to her performance leading to an expansion of the role with more dialogue br David W Collins as PROXY Starkiller s droid sidekick designed to constantly test his lightsaber and Force abilities as well as deliver important messages through holographic projection Collins said PROXY has C PO s innocence but also is really dangerous The companion trade paperback describes the conflict between PROXY s primary programming to kill Starkiller and its self imposed desire to help him PROXY is eager to please Starkiller but does not know how dangerous it can be or that there is a conflict between its programming and Starkiller s wishes Trying to avoid having PROXY s dialogue become too reminiscent of either C PO or the villainous HK of Knights of the Old Republic developers focused on PROXY s friendly na vety br Jimmy Smits as Bail Organa Smits voices the character he played in the prequels trilogy a Galactic Senator from Alderaan and Princess Leia s adoptive father who becomes a founding member of the Rebel Alliance br Sam Witwer as Emperor Palpatine br Tom Kane as Kento Marek Captain Ozzik Sturn br Larry Drake as Kazdan Paratus br Susan Eisenberg as Shaak Ti br Catherine Taber as Princess Leia Organa br David W Collins as Jabba the Hutt br Dee Bradley Baker as Boba Fett br Rob Rackstraw as Obi Wan Kenobi br Lloyd Floyd as Luke Skywalker br br br Development br br br Concept br br Game planning began in summer Initially about six developers started with a clean slate to conceptualize a new Star Wars game the small group of engineers artists and designers spent more than a year brainstorming ideas for what might make a good game Over initial concepts were whittled down to to that included making the game the third entry in the Knights of the Old Republic series or having the protagonist be a Wookiee superhero Darth Maul a bounty hunter a smuggler a mercenary or the last member of the Skywalker family living years after the events of Return of the Jedi The decision to focus on the largely unexplored period between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope helped energize the design team Consumer feedback helped the developers narrow in on seven concepts and elements from those seven went into The Force Unleashed s overall concept br Production was greatly aided by concept art which was intended to visually bridge the two Star Wars trilogies convey the impression of a lived in universe show how the galaxy changes under Imperial rule and to seem familiar yet new An off hand comment about the Force in the game being powerful enough to pull a Star Destroyer out of the sky inspired an image by senior concept artist Amy Beth Christenson that became an important part of the developers idea pitches and evolved into a major moment in the game These illustrations also inspired the creation of dozens of simple three dimensional animations Eventually a one minute previsualization video highlighting the idea of kicking someone s ass with the Force helped convince the designers that The Force Unleashed would be a great game George Lucas upon seeing the one minute video told the designers to go make that game Once the concept was solidified the development team grew from ten to twenty people The idea of reimagining the Force as amped up in The Force Unleashed aligned with LucasArts overall goal of harnessing the power of the latest video game consoles to dramatically change gaming specifically through the use of simulation based gameplay br br br Story br In April after several months of planning the LucasArts team received Lucas encouragement to create a game centered on Darth Vader s secret apprentice in the largely unexplored period between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope drawing the two trilogies together LucasArts spent six months developing the story Lucas spent hours discussing with the developers the relationship between Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine and provided feedback on what Vader would want out of and how he would motivate an apprentice Lucas Licensing reviewed many game details to ensure they fit into canon Focus group feedback indicated that while hunting down Jedi at Vader s order would be fun the character should be redeemed in keeping with a major Star Wars motif Before the game s release Lucasfilm claimed it would unveil new revelations about the Star Wars galaxy with a redemption motif The story progresses through a combination of scripted events in game cinematics cutscenes and dialogue br Looking over a number of unexplored already existing characters the creative team considered bringing Darth Plagueis Emperor Palpatine s enigmatic master only mentioned in Revenge of the Sith into the game s story through various methods one was for Plagueis spirit to serve as the guide for Vader s secret apprentice to provide players with information about their character s powers another had Plagueis as the story s MacGuffin by having Vader send his apprentice to search for Plagueis to resurrect his beloved Padm Amidala making Vader s apprentice actually a reincarnated Plagueis or having a redeemed Plagueis become the apprentice s mentor Knight and the developers explored different possible looks for Plagueis depicting him as a human resembling actor Michael Gambon a zombie a time traveler a cyborg etc Although the game introduces new characters developers felt the presence of characters already part of Star Wars would help anchor the game within the official continuity br br br Technology br br During pre production about people were on the project team LucasArts spent several years developing the tools and technology to create The Force Unleashed Prototyping level construction marketing and public relations took about a year Until late the production team was ascertaining how many polygons lights and characters next generation platforms supported a year of full production began in early A series of quickly produced play blast videos helped the developers focus on mechanics the user interface and finishing moves Development of the Xbox version came first PlayStation development started when the production team had enough development kits Making the game run on both the PlayStation and Xbox was a monumental task br The game is based on LucasArts proprietary Ronin game engine but also integrates third party technology Havok for rigid body physics Pixelux Entertainment s Digital Molecular Matter DMM for dynamically destructible objects and NaturalMotion s Euphoria for realistic non player character artificial intelligence The focus of employing Euphoria to develop The Force Unleashed caused LucasArts to sideline Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings an Indiana Jones title that had been in development since two years ago for a while until development on the Star Wars title concluded LucasArts programmers had to overcome technical hurdles to get Havok DMM and Euphoria coded components to interact Developers also had to strike a balance between realistic and entertaining physics LucasArts initially opted not to release a personal computer version of The Force Unleashed stating that doing the game well would be too processor intensive for typical PCs and that scaling down the game s procedural physics for the PC platform would fundamentally change The Force Unleashed s gameplay However LucasArts later announced Windows and Mac versions of the game developed in conjunction with Aspyr Media for release in Fall br Lacking Havok Euphoria and DMM Krome s Wii version relies on the company s in house physics engine Some character animations may be ragdoll while others are preset in developing the game Krome tried to blur the distinction between the two The lighting system in the Wii version is more advanced than that in the PS version which Krome also built the PS includes more graphic details than their PSP version br br br ILM collaboration and cast performance br The Force Unleashed is intended to make players think they are actually finally in a Star Wars movie It is the first game on which LucasArts and Industrial Light Magic ILM collaborated since they both relocated to the Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco California This collaboration allowed the companies to co develop tools to make film quality effects LucasArts worked with ILM s Zeno tool framework and helped ILM build its Zed game editor Lucas said having the two companies working together in the same building was a great collaboration br It took Senior Manager of Voice and Audio Darragh O Farrell four months to cast The Force Unleashed ILM s face and motion capture CloneCam technology recorded actors voice and physical performances This led to a change in LucasArts casting process for the first time actors needed to match characters age and gender Actors performed their lines together rather than in isolation to better get the sense of their characters interacting with each other Consequently the script s dialogue was reduced while reliance on characters expressions captured through the CloneCam increased CloneCam technology had previously been used in producing the Pirates of the Caribbean movies br br br Music br LucasArts music supervisor Jesse Harlin said the music matches the game s motif of redemption and goal of bridging the gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope br br We had to make sure that the game s score started off rooted within the Prequel Trilogy feel of ethnic percussion and sweeping themes that spoke to the nobility and grandeur of the old Jedi Order As the game progresses however the Empire gains more control the Jedi are hunted and the ordered control of the Prequels gives way to the more romantic temperament of the Original Trilogy br The game s soundtrack includes material composed by John Williams for the films in addition to material created specifically for The Force Unleashed Jesse Harlin composed the game s main theme while Mark Griskey composed the score Griskey made use of several motifs from the film scores as well as Harlin s main theme The minute soundtrack was recorded by the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra and mixed at Skywalker Sound in Lucas Valley in September and October During gameplay a proprietary engine combines musical elements according to the pace plot and environment of the game at any given moment resulting in a unique musical experience A promotional soundtrack album was made available online through Tracksounds com in br br br Other media br br br Print works br Sean Williams novelization was released in the United States on August It spent one week as on both Publishers Weekly s and The New York Times hardcover fiction bestsellers lists slipping to and respectively the following week It also reached on USA Today s bestsellers list br Williams took on the writing project in part because of the catchy description of The Force Unleashed being Episode of the Star Wars saga The novel focuses on the dark side of the Force and its practitioners Williams found it interesting to portray the Jedi as bad guys The author most enjoyed developing the character of Juno Eclipse exploring the feminine side of The Force Unleashed in a way the video game does not Williams also said that while the game allows the player to do Starkiller s actions the novel allows readers to experience Starkiller s thoughts about those actions adding another dimension to the story br Dark Horse s The Force Unleashed graphic novel was published August Newsarama called the graphic novel a solid story that matches the video game source material in both structure and plot IGN gave the graphic novel a score of for art for the writing praising the overall story but faulting inconsistency in the art and questioning whether the comic medium was the best way to convey the story br br br Merchandise br At Toy Fair Hasbro showed seven figures from their action figure line based on the game Lego released a model of the Starkiller s ship the Rogue Shadow br br br Expansion br Two weeks after the game s release LucasArts announced development on two downloadable expansion packs for the PlayStation and Xbox versions of the game The first expansion added skins that allow the player s character to appear as Star Wars figures other than Starkiller such as Obi Wan Kenobi Anakin Skywalker Qui Gon Jinn Jango Fett C PO Luke Skywalker Darth Maul Darth Sion Mace Windu Plo Koon Kit Fisto and Ki Adi Mundi The skins chosen to be part of the expansion were based in part on fans feedback and many skins of such prior Star Wars characters were also implemented as cheat codes for the Wii PlayStation and PlayStation Portable versions of the game with no additional downloads required The second expansion pack added a new mission that expands on Starkiller s background Although a moment in the game s main story was considered as a jumping off point for the expansion LucasArts decided instead to make the new mission instantly accessible to players The mission s location the Jedi Temple on Coruscant appears in the Wii PlayStation and PlayStation Portable versions of The Force Unleashed but was cut during planning from the PS and Xbox platforms br The Tatooine Downloadable Content released August is the first of two expansions that occur in an Infinities storyline an alternate history in which Starkiller kills Vader and becomes Palpatine s assassin The second Infinities expansion which takes place on Hoth was originally only available as part of the Ultimate Sith Edition which also includes all previous downloadable content However the Hoth expansion was later made available for download on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live br br br Reception br br million

fairly positive reviews Electronic Gaming Monthly said the game is ambitious yet dissatisfying however GameSpot said the game gets more right than it does wrong GameSpot said the PC port of the game retained all of the game s strengths and weaknesses but that the port failed to take advantage of the PC platform br GameSpot called the game s story more intimate and more powerful than the Star Wars franchise s prequel trilogy X Play identified the game s story as one of the game s few bright spots and said the game s visuals successfully convey Star Wars classic used universe feel GamePro and GameSpot praised the game s art and physics and GamePro also commended Starkiller s cool powers IGN praised the game s voice acting particularly Witwer s performance as Starkiller The Washington Times

best video game of The game received GameSpot s award for Best Use of a Creative License and was nominated for Best Voice Acting Gaming Target selected the game as one of their Games We ll Still Be Playing From br Conversely Entertainment Weekly called The Force Unleashed the second worst game of and GameTrailers called it the most disappointing game that year it was also a nominee for GameSpot s Most Disappointing Game recognition Official Xbox Magazine cited the game s linear gameplay and lack of multiplayer as reasons the game falls short of being an all engrossing Star Wars experience gamesTM suggested that allowing players to take a hack and slash approach means many will never view the title s full potential IGN and X Play criticized some boss battles and enemies behavior GamePro also faulted disappointing boss battles and the game s uneven combat Rather than feeling more powerful as the game progresses GamePro felt that increases in Starkiller s powers were dampened by increasingly difficult enemy abilities and positions X Play commented that despite a good level up system Starkiller and his enemies are pretty much on even ground most of the time Wired com X Play and GameSpot criticized the game s third person camera and the sequence that requires the player to make Starkiller pull a Star Destroyer out of the sky Wired com speculated that LucasArts could have recognized the frustration of the Star Destroyer sequence and removed it but left it in because they hyped the sequence before the game s release Wired com and GameSpot further criticized the load times and abrupt gameplay cinematic transitions GameSpot also faulted loose targeting and some visual and audio glitches IGN which also identified problems with targeting speculated that DMM s processor intensiveness limited its use throughout the game detracting from players ability to feel immersed GameTrailers and IGN were disappointed with the lack of variety within and between levels X Play pointing to Default Text as the bonus objective description in the Xbox version s final mission and other glitches said it seems the developers one day just stopped working on the game GameSpot cited the port s lack of visual options and poor framerate as evidence the PC edition had been rushed br IGN described the Jedi Academy expansion as pretty decent GameSpot said LucasArts seems to have acknowledged some of the game s criticisms in developing the Tatooine expansion but IGN called the level s boss fights a joke in light of the player s high Force powers IGN found the level design in The Ultimate Sith Edition s Hoth scenario uninteresting and called the boss fight against Luke Skywalker tough but not nearly as fun as it could have been br The demo was the fourth most played Xbox Live game during the week of August trailing Grand Theft Auto IV Halo and Call of Duty Modern Warfare it was the ninth most played Xbox Live title throughout all of The week it was released The Force Unleashed was the sixth most played game on Xbox Live and it rose to fifth the following week In its first week on sale in Australia the PS and Xbox versions of The Force Unleashed were the top and second best sellers respectively In the United States the PlayStation and Xbox version sold and copies respectively in September that month the Xbox version was the best selling game and the PlayStation version was the fifth best selling game for their respective consoles br br br Other platforms br Nintendo Power praised the story and the number of lightsaber combos but criticized the game s easiness and hack and slash gameplay It also praised the Wii version for its story and Force powers but criticized the game s lightsaber controls and linear gameplay GameSpot noticed visual glitches and problematic audio compression that detracted from the Wii version s mature and exciting story adding that the reduced number of Force manipulable objects helps mitigate the targeting problems experienced on other platforms Referring to the Wii remote and nunchuck controls GameSpot also speculated that The Force Unleashed is possibly the most waggle heavy Wii game Zero Punctuation criticized the Wii version s graphics and compared lightsaber combat to trying to follow an aerobics routine with both your arms tied to different windmills The ability to upgrade Starkiller s abilities in the PS version according to IGN is not as robust as it should be and the game s targeting system is sometimes frustrating IGN said the PS s real time cutscene rendering made Starkiller seem emotionless and that pre rendered cutscenes would have been better GameSpot found the DS version s plot interesting but the storytelling itself lackluster While the DS version is easy with Starkiller killing enemies like a hot knife through butter GameSpot said the player s sense of power is not matched by a sense of freedom GameSpot called the PSP version s camera unwieldy but added that smaller and less cluttered environments make the targeting system less frustrating than on other platforms The Wii version was a nominee for multiple Wii specific awards from IGN in its video
