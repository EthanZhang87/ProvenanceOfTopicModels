titled Journal of the Whills After United Artists Universal Studios and Disney rejected the film th Century Fox decided to invest in it Lucas felt his original story was too difficult to understand so on April he began writing a page script titled The Star Wars sharing strong similarities with Akira Kurosawa s The Hidden Fortress By May he had expanded the script into the first draft of a screenplay adding elements such as the Sith and the Death Star but found that the script had grown too long for a single film Subsequent drafts evolved into the script of the original film br Lucas negotiated to retain the sequel rights Tom Pollock then Lucas s lawyer writes We came to an agreement that George would retain the sequel rights Not all the merchandising rights that came later mind you just the sequel rights And Fox would get a first opportunity and last refusal right to make the movie Lucas was offered to write another to produce and to direct the film his directing compensation was later increased to He also negotiated the sequel rights and ownership of of the merchandising profits American Graffiti cast member Harrison Ford had given up on acting to try to

characters from the Marvel Universe who were popular in the s to come up with many plot points and ideas for various designs br br br Casting br Thousands of actors were assessed in the search for the trilogy s main cast The selected actors are considered by many viewers to have onscreen chemistry even though some of them were inexperienced with the notable exceptions of Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing Some like Ford have called the dialogue in the scripts clunky and several lines were unscripted some of these are considered the most memorable moments in the films br br br Films br Star Wars was released on May unlikely hero Luke Skywalker is drawn into a galactic conflict between the Empire and Rebel Alliance by two droids and an old Jedi Knight he helps make one of the Rebellion s most significant victories The film s unanticipated success led Lucas to make it the basis of an elaborate serial With the backstory he created for the sequel Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies with the original film given the subtitle Episode IV A New Hope to establish it as the first part of the second trilogy The first sequel Star Wars Episode V The Empire Strikes Back was released on May and sees Luke begin training as a Jedi under the last living Jedi master Yoda Luke confronts Sith Lord Darth Vader who is revealed to be Luke s father Vader attempts to convert Luke to the dark side of the Force The third film Episode VI Return of the Jedi was released on May and follows Luke as a full fledged Jedi Luke succeeds in redeeming Vader thereby saving the

exploiting a weakness and launch an attack on the Death Star br br The first rough draft titled The Star Wars introduced the Force and the young hero Luke Starkiller Annikin sic appeared as Luke s father a wise Jedi knight Between drafts Lucas read Joseph Campbell s The Hero with a Thousand Faces and was surprised to find that his story was following classical motifs The third draft replaced a deceased Annikin with Ben Kenobi Some months later Lucas had negotiated a contract that gave him rights to two sequels Lucas hired Alan Dean Foster who was ghostwriting the novelization of the first film to write them with the main creative restriction that they could be filmed on a low budget By a fourth draft had been prepared for principal photography The film was titled The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills Saga I The Star Wars During production Lucas changed Luke s name to Skywalker and shortened the title to The Star Wars and finally just Star Wars At that point Lucas was not expecting the film to warrant full scale sequels The fourth draft of the script underwent subtle changes to become a self contained story ending with the destruction of the Empire in the Death Star The intention was that if the film was successful Lucas could adapt Foster s novels into low budget sequels By that point Lucas had developed a tentative backstory to aid in developing the saga br Star Wars exceeded all expectations The success of the film and its merchandise sales led Lucas to make Star Wars the basis of an elaborate film serial and use the profits to finance his filmmaking center Skywalker Ranch After the release of the first sequel the original film was subtitled Episode IV A New Hope in the screenplay released in the book The Art of Star Wars and for all subsequent rereleases beginning with a theatrical rerelease in br br br The Empire Strikes Back br br Three years after the destruction of the Death Star the Empire forces the Rebel

Vader who lures him into a trap by capturing Han and Leia at Cloud City governed by Han s old friend Lando During a fierce duel Vader reveals that he is Luke s father br Owing to financial concerns Alan Dean Foster s sequel novel Splinter of the Mind s Eye restricted the story to Luke Leia and Darth Vader After the success of the original film Lucas knew a sequel would be granted a reasonable budget and hired Leigh Brackett to write it from Lucas s story She finished a draft by early but died of cancer before Lucas was able to discuss changes he wanted her to make His disappointment with the first draft may have made him consider new directions Lucas penned the next draft the first screenplay to feature episodic numbering for a Star Wars story Lucas found this draft enjoyable to write as opposed to the yearlong struggle writing the first film and quickly wrote two more in April The plot twist of Vader being Luke s father had drastic effects on the series After writing these drafts Lucas fleshed out the backstory between Anakin Obi Wan and the Emperor br With this new backstory in place Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies designating the first sequel Episode V The Empire Strikes Back in the next draft Lawrence Kasdan who had just completed writing Raiders of the Lost Ark was hired to write the next drafts and given additional input from director Irvin Kershner Kasdan Kershner and producer Gary Kurtz saw the film as a more serious and adult story and developed the sequel from the light adventure roots of the first film br br br Return of the Jedi br br About a year after Han s capture Luke joins Leia and Lando in a rescue attempt to save him from the gangster Jabba the Hutt Afterward Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training only to find Yoda on his deathbed In his last words Yoda confirms the truth about Luke s father and that Luke must confront Vader again in order to complete his training As the Rebels lead an attack on the second Death Star Luke engages Vader in a lightsaber duel as the Emperor watches both Sith Lords intend to turn Luke to the dark side and take him as their apprentice br Ford had originally not signed on to appear in a second sequel but was convinced to return under the condition that his character would die Kurtz wanted a bittersweet and nuanced ending outlined with Lucas that not only saw Han dead but also depicted the Rebel forces in pieces Leia struggling as a queen and Luke walking off alone as in a Spaghetti Western while Lucas wanted a happier ending partly to encourage toy sales This led to tension between the two resulting in Kurtz leaving the production br br br Themes br The Star Wars trilogy unlike science fiction that features sleek and futuristic settings portrays the galaxy as dirty and grimy in Lucas s concept of a used universe This was in part inspired by the period films of Akira Kurosawa which like the original Star Wars trilogy often begin in medias res without explaining a complete backstory br Political science has been an important element of Star Wars since the franchise launched in focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship Darth Vader s design initially inspired by Samurai armor also incorporated a German military helmet Lucas originally conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the Schutzstaffel SS served Adolf Hitler this was condensed into one character in the form of Vader Lucas has also drawn parallels between Palpatine and historical dictators such as Julius Caesar Napoleon Bonaparte and politicians like Richard Nixon Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I shock troopers Imperial officers wear uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II and political and security officers resemble the black clad SS down to the stylized silver death s head on their caps World War II terms were used for names in the films e g the planets Kessel a term that refers to a group of encircled forces and Hoth after Hermann Hoth a German general who served on the snow laden Eastern Front Shots of the commanders looking through AT AT walker viewscreens in The
