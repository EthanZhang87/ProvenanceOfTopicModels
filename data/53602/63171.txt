first appears in the film The Empire Strikes Back in which he is voiced and puppeteered by Frank Oz who reprises the role in Return of the Jedi the prequel trilogy and the sequel trilogy In addition to films the character appears in animated series comics novels video games and commercials br In the original trilogy Yoda lives in solitude on the swamp planet Dagobah He is introduced as a former mentor of Obi Wan Kenobi and he trains Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force until his death at the age of In the prequel trilogy Yoda leads the Jedi High Council and trains young Jedi until they are assigned to a master When the Clone Wars break out he becomes a general in the army of the Republic and leads several legions of clone troopers Yoda is one of the few Jedi to survive the events of Order at the end of the war when he battles Darth Sidious and is forced to go into hiding Yoda s Force spirit appears again in the sequel trilogy advising an older Luke on his training of Rey br br br Creation br The Star Wars franchise was created by George Lucas who wrote and directed the original Star Wars film He created the character Obi Wan Kenobi as a mentor for Luke Skywalker and originally planned for Obi Wan to continue training Luke in the sequel The Empire Strikes Back However Lucas ultimately decided that Obi Wan would die in the first film Lucas then introduced a new mentor character who was originally a diminutive frog like creature called Minch Yoda The name Yoda was chosen because Lucas envisioned the character as a little Dalai Lama and he wanted him to have an Eastern sounding name One of the film s screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan said that Yoda was based on Shimada the lead samurai from the Akira Kurosawa film Seven Samurai According to Lucas the narrative goal of Yoda s design was to teach Luke to respect everybody and pay attention to the poorest person Lucas wanted the Jedi Master to be the exact opposite of what audiences would expect br The film s visual effects art director Joe Johnston sketched hundreds of different versions of Yoda The design that Lucas finally settled on was described by Johnston as a combination of a leprechaun a troll and a gnome Lucas gave Yoda a backward speech pattern because he felt the character needed a unique way of speaking that was more dramatic than an accent The filmmakers considered several ways of portraying Yoda before they decided on a sophisticated puppet These potential methods included dressing a monkey a child or a dwarf in a Yoda costume or using stop motion animation br br br Portrayals br Yoda was originally portrayed by a puppet created by Stuart Freeborn and Wendy Froud Freeborn based Yoda s face on his own facial features and those of Albert Einstein hoping the latter inspiration would make the character appear intelligent Lucas asked Jim Henson the creator of the Muppets to perform the puppeteering for Yoda Henson was busy with another project however and recommended Frank Oz for the role To perform Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back Oz inserted his hand into the puppet s head to manipulate the mouth and brow Kathryn Mullen Wendy Froud and David Barclay operated Yoda s eyes ears and other body parts using cables strings hydraulics and electronic mechanisms There was also a radio controlled Yoda puppet that was used when the Jedi Master is riding on Luke s back Lucas had intended for a different actor to provide Yoda s voice but ultimately decided that Oz was the best performer for the role In the original release of The Phantom Menace Yoda was portrayed by a new puppet in all but two shots In these two wide shots the character was created using computer generated imagery CGI The puppet was replaced with a digital Yoda in the Blu ray release and the theatrical D release In Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith Yoda is entirely computer generated The digital character accomplishes movements not possible with the puppet such as fighting with a lightsaber In Revenge of the Sith his face is shown in several close ups which required highly detailed CGI work br Oz puppeteers Yoda and provides his voice in The Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi The Phantom Menace and The Last Jedi and voices a digital Yoda in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith He performs vocal cameos as Yoda in The Force Awakens and The Rise of Skywalker Oz also voices the character in the animated series Star Wars Rebels Yoda is voiced by John Lithgow in the radio dramatizations of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi by Tom Kane in video games and animated productions and by Piotr Michael in the animated series Young Jedi Adventures Tony Pope and Peter McConnell also voice the character in video games br br br Reception br Yoda was well received by several prominent critics when he debuted in The Empire Strikes Back in Vincent Canby of The New York Times called him delightful and the hit of the movie but felt he was only a success when used sparingly In her review of the film Joy Gould Boyum of The Wall Street Journal praised the exquisitely constructed Yoda puppet and said that Oz so finely put together the character as to make us wonder continually if he isn t real Arthur Knight of The Hollywood Reporter and Gary Arnold of The Washington Post similarly felt that Yoda was incredibly lifelike with Arnold comparing his face to that of a human actor Writing in the Chicago Tribune Gene Siskel called Yoda the highlight of the film In his review of the re release of The Empire Strikes Back Roger Ebert praised the range of emotions conveyed by Yoda and said his acting was possibly the best in the film br Yoda has been a popular character since his introduction more than forty years ago Brandon Katz of Observer
