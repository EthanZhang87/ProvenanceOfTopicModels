and a kick button while in hand to hand mode a button is assigned to each limb br Characters have an array of melee moves and also a few ranged attacks The Force does not make an appearance in the

Internal company hopes were high during the development cycle Tony Hsieh project lead on Masters of Ter s K si felt that it would be hard to go wrong While promoting the game in an issue of Star Wars Insider writer Jack Lyon stated Short attention span Star Wars freaks will surely dig Masters of Ter s K si LucasArts first fighting game Tekken was cited as one of the main influences on the game A backstory was developed in which Darth Vader uses a mysterious master of Ter s K si Arden Lyn to eliminate high ranking members of the rebellion in hand to hand combat Development of the game took approximately months according to lead artist Craig Rundels Softimage was used for character creation It was the first LucasArts title developed for the PlayStation No one had programmed a game on the PlayStation We were learning the hardware how to make art on it how to program on it while we were developing Ter s K si A demo was released on disc in the third issue of Official U S PlayStation Magazine br br The motion capture facilities and software of LucasFilm partner Industrial Light Magic ILM were used to generate the animation for the characters The varying heights of the characters presented issues during development and developers had to find ways to adjust the collision detection based on the opponent To create the character s reactions to hits the motion capture data was supplemented with hand drawn animation Each character was made up of at least polygons In developing the button combo system the staff wanted buttons to have context with the character s movements We want to make it so that when you hit the left button you really hit with your left arm in a combo br The character Arden Lyn was created specifically for the game The character s design was initially much more androgynous than how she appears in the final game Some obscure characters such as Jodo Kast were included in the game for no more reason than that a member of the development team liked the character and was able to build a compelling model Jango Fett began life as an alternate costume for Boba Fett before later being cut from the final lineup Gammorean guard Thok had previously had a film appearance within Jabba s palace in Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi Hoar was another new character created for the game He was later given additional backstory including ties to characters in Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones and the video game Star Wars Jedi Knight Dark Forces II In an interview with Destructoid Capcom s Seth Killian mentioned that Star Gladiator was originally pitched as a Star Wars fighting game Ultimately the pitch did not succeed and LucasArts instead developed Masters of Ter s K si To promote the game Star Wars The Official Magazine ran a contest in June in which a black PlayStation console with the Star Wars Masters of Ter s K si logo on the top was given out br Ter s K si refers to a martial art used in the game both words have been borrowed from Finnish and they literally mean steel hand The developers learned of Ter s K si from West End Games Shadows of the Empire Source Book Steve Perry who came up with the concept of Ter s K si said he did not speak Finnish but wanted something with a certain kind of sound and the Norse languages have the kind of rhythm I like br br br Reception and legacy br br Star Wars Masters of Ter s K si received mixed to negative reviews from critics GameSpot s Jeff Gerstmann felt that the game played like it was stuck in slow motion He cited sluggish movement uninteresting combos and overpowered force moves as weak points of the game Adam Douglas of IGN similarly found the characters move too slowly I ended up mashing the buttons more than one time hoping the harder I pressed the quicker they d respond No such luck GamePro while echoing Gerstmann s criticism that the force moves are overpowered and citing difficulty entering in combos called the game a near perfect blend of Star Wars imagery and solid fighting game physics They gave it a out of for control and a perfect for graphics sound and fun factor praising the character detail animation music and combination of armed and unarmed combat br Matt Skorupa of Gamezilla also gave it a more positive review He stated that the game s character roster and varied environments were selling points for the game Unlike most reviewers Skorupa found the button combos simple and easy to pull off However he noted that the main appeal was the Star Wars licensing and that the game did not stand out enough from other fighting games to appeal to non fans of the franchise Next Generation s review of the game likewise judged Masters of Teras Kasi to be generic apart from its license While they acknowledged that the combination of hand to hand and weapons based combat was innovative they found the use of different control schemes for the two modes cumbersome They also shared Gerstmann and Douglas s opinion that the characters move too slowly Douglas felt the game had solid graphics and that the characters match their film and comic counterparts He also said the game s hidden characters were cool as well Sushi X of Electronic Gaming Monthly actually cited the Star Wars license as the game s primary weakness arguing that in the Star Wars universe any character without a lightsaber would be quickly dismembered by any character with one He and the other three members of the magazine s review crew criticized the overpowered force moves difficult controls and the gameplay s general tendency to devolve into using cheap and or repetitive tactics while praising the graphics animation and use of Star Wars elements with all four assessing the game as overall decent but disappointing br In the book Rogue Leaders The Story of LucasArts author Rob Smith said the game served as a reminder that simply attaching the Star Wars name to a game wasn t enough but noted that Ter s K si had successful sales during the holiday season leaving it ambiguous what it wasn t enough for In March GMR placed Masters of Ter s K si in its top five Star Wars game of all time Kotaku s Patrick Klepek described it as Sluggish boring and without much depth His colleague Luke Plunkett called Masters of Ter s K si possibly the worst Star Wars game ever made Plunkett felt that it was a wasted opportunity It was something that could have been worthwhile he said br Since the release of Masters of Ter s K si some attempts have been made to re introduce Star Wars to the fighting game genre An untitled prototype Star Wars fighter was under development at Studio Gigante in but ultimately was rejected The idea of using Star Wars characters in a fighting game would resurface when Yoda Starkiller and Darth Vader became playable characters in Soulcalibur IV Another Star Wars fighting game Star Wars The Clone Wars Lightsaber Duels was released in Like Masters of Ter s K si it received mixed reviews br In the film Solo A Star Wars Story the character Qi ra mentions she is trained in the art of Ter s K si The second season of The Mandalorian also appears to depict some elements from the game br br br Notes
