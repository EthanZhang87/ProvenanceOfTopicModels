br Concept and creation br After getting frustrated with a drawing by The Phantom Menace production designer Gavin Bocquet concept artist Iain McCaig started covering it in tape Both he and director George Lucas liked the result described as a kind of Rorschach pattern The final drawing had McCaig s own face with the skin removed and some Rorschach experimentation dropping ink onto paper folding it in half then opening Maul s facial tattoos were inspired by the indigenous peoples of Brazil Maul was described as a thing of nightmares when his art design was finished br Maul s head originally had feathers based on prayer totems but the Creature Effects crew led by Nick Dudman interpreted those feathers as horns modifying his features into those common in popular depictions of the devil br His clothing was also modified from a tight body suit with a muscle pattern to the Sith robe based on samurai pleats because the lightsaber battles involved much jumping spinning running and rolling Another concept had Maul a masked figure something that could rival Darth Vader while the senatorial characters would sport painted and tattooed faces It was later decided to apply the painted and tattooed faces to Maul rather than the senator br George Lucas decided to resurrect Darth Maul for The Clone Wars after developing the character of Savage Opress Series co creator Dave Filoni
