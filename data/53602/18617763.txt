Imperial stormtroopers serve as the army of the Galactic Empire establishing Imperial authority and putting down any revolts br In the prequel film Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones the first clone troopers are cloned from bounty hunter Jango Fett to be the Army of the Republic in the Clone Wars In Episode III Revenge of the Sith Chancellor Palpatine orders them to slay their Jedi generals in the Great Jedi Purge After the change in regimes from the Galactic Republic to the Galactic Empire the clone troopers who had served the Republic became the first generation of stormtroopers enforcing the Emperor s will as military units and law enforcement policing the Emperor s ever increasingly oppressive laws br The Imperial Stormtrooper Corps swell in size in The Bad Batch present after Palpatine almost completely replaces the clones with recruits and conscripts of the Empire though the replacement of clones with natural beings lowered the effectiveness of the Empire s soldiers With the Empire firmly stabilized and an Imperial Army and Navy established the stormtroopers are integrated into Palpatine s personal army and stationed on Imperial bases and cruisers as well as on the Death Star br As established in The Force Awakens after Palpatine s death stormtroopers continue to serve under the factions that broke apart from the Empire With redesigned armor they eventually serve under the leadership of the First Order In the First Order an undisclosed number of stormtroopers are abducted as young children given serial numbers for names and mentally conditioned for loyal

and early s featured Shadow Troopers Other specialists have included commandos and troopers equipped to work in the vacuum of outer space such as the zero gravity Spacetroopers depicted engaging in extra vehicular battle in the novel Star Wars Heir to the Empire and its Dark Horse Comics adaptation br A distinct variant known as Shadowtroopers appear in Star Wars Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast wearing black armour that incorporates a lightsaber resistant mineral called cortosis As a project of the Dark Jedi named Desann aligned with a Remnant of the Empire the Shadowtroopers themselves had been immersed in a Force nexus on Ruusan temporarily empowering them with Force sensitivity This armour has a green synthetic gem set into the breastplate which sustained the otherwise temporary effect of their Force empowerment and combines with their abilities to render them near invisible with only a faint area of blue discoloration giving them away In conjunction with their Force granted telekinesis reflexes and agility the Shadowtroopers are armed and trained in the use of mass produced red lightsabers Their combination of abilities allow them to lie in wait and ambush the enemy representing formidable opponents even for trained Jedi most often the game s Jedi protagonist Kyle Katarn Shadow stormtroopers appear in Star Wars The Force Unleashed and wear exactly the same type of Phase III armor as normal stormtroopers but not white in color but rather a mixture of silver grey and red detailing These troopers also possess the invisible feature and use this tactic to ambush their enemies but only if stormtrooper officers call out for support br In Lego Star Wars II The Original Trilogy Speedo clad and stormtrooper helmet wearing Beach Troopers appear relaxing at the beach In Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga they also wear life jackets br Stormtroopers made their canonical debut in the Star Wars The Bad Batch Season episode War Mantle which was released on July br br br Description br br According to Star Wars lore Imperial stormtroopers are men and women who have been recruited or conscripted at a young age to serve as expendable foot soldiers of the Empire gradually replacing clone troopers as their accelerated aging forces them to retire These recruits are trained at Imperial Academies spread out across the galaxy where they undergo intense conditioning that instills fierce loyalty strict discipline and ruthless efficiency while removing any sense of individualism or empathy As the backbone of the Imperial Army stormtroopers are dreaded for their brutality carrying out atrocities in the name of Emperor Palpatine and their fanaticism engaging the enemy with no regard to casualties Inevitably some use their position for personal gain against a civilian population too terrified to resist However inconsistencies in academy standards led to stormtroopers of varying combat skill and ability compared to the superior clone troopers which among other things can be seen in the stormtroopers mainly variable sometimes even weak ability to hit the target in firefights After subduing any remaining Separatist holdouts left over from the Clone Wars stormtroopers primarily serve as an internal security and peacekeeping force until the Galactic Civil War where they start to engage the Rebel Alliance in large scale battles br Unable to conscript noventillions of soldiers to fill its stormtrooper ranks yet unwilling to switch back to using rapidly produced clone troopers First Order stormtroopers are bred trained and indoctrinated from birth raised their entire lives for no other purpose First Order soldiers and crews have constantly trained for combat in war games and simulations making them much more effective one on one than the endless waves of stormtrooper conscripts fielded by the Galactic Empire First Order stormtroopers are regularly put through mental indoctrination and propaganda programs to make sure that they remain fanatically loyal and never hesitate or question orders Being taken from their families at birth these soldiers are not even given individual names for themselves but merely serial numbers such as FN br br br Equipment br Standard Imperial stormtrooper armor is white and has a utility belt and helmet br br br Vehicles br br br Weapons br br The standard firearm for Imperial stormtroopers is the BlasTech E blaster rifle described in Star Wars sources as combining excellent range and firepower in a compact and rugged design Features include a telescopic range finding sight accessory mounting rail power setting adjuster three point folding stock magnatomic adhesive pistol grip and advanced cooling system Plasma cartridges provide enough gas for shots though a standard power cell which energizes the gas to produce blaster bolts will last for approximately shots In addition to the E stormtroopers employ a variety of different weapons as seen in the Star Wars films and other media Examples include thermal detonators sniper rifles crew served heavy repeating blasters and mortars br Both firing and non firing prop models of the E were based on the Mk Sterling submachine gun with approximately models built for the first Star Wars movie A New Hope External modifications to the Sterlings to transform them into blaster rifles varied based on the parts available but most were similar in design This included an American Mk azimuth tank scope and a Hengstler industrial counter box affixed to the top and left side of the receiver respectively The Sterling would continue to serve as the basis for or inspire other blaster rifle designs in the rest of the Star Wars films br Background literature explains how the First Order s stormtroopers were armed in secret by the Sonn Blas Corporation a subsidiary of BlasTech Industries and Merr Sonn Munitions created to circumvent the New Republic s disarmament treaties Building on classic design templates they are meant to possess greater battlefield accuracy ammunition yields and operational lifespans Examples include the F D blaster rifle SE C blaster pistol and FWMB repeating blaster cannon For subduing civilian populations First Order stormtroopers will also carry ballistic riot shields and riot control batons br br br Armor br As established in the original Star Wars trilogy of films the troopers most distinctive equipment is their white battle armor which completely encases the body and typically has no individually distinguishing markings According to in universe reference material this armor was developed and manufactured by the Imperial Department of Military Research and consists of white plastoid armor plates magnatomically attached to a black body glove These plates are generally impervious to most projectile weapons and blast shrapnel and will protect against glancing hits by other blaster rifles though a direct hit will penetrate The armor also provides protection against inhospitable environments including the vacuum of space for a short period of time Their helmets are fitted with filtration systems for polluted environments with hookups for incorporating an external atmospheric tank while operating in space or to filter potent toxins The helmets also include built in communication system and multi frequency targeting and acquisition system linked to in lens displays that provide tactical information protection from excessive brightness and vision modes for seeing through smoke fire and darkness br Based on conceptual drawings by Ralph McQuarrie Liz Moore and Nick Pemberton sculpted designs for the helmet Brian Muir sculpted armor pieces for the stormtrooper costume Muir who was also responsible for sculpting the Darth Vader costume worked out of the Art Department at Elstree Studios The suit was molded and initially cast in plaster with Muir sharpening the detail at the plaster stage The plaster casts were then remolded and cast in fiberglass to use as the tools for the vacuum forming process The suits were produced in house by Tashy Baines the resident vacuum former but then a problem developed with the machine As Shepperton Design Studios had already been used to vacuum form the helmets the fiberglass molds for the armor were then sent to them for vacuum forming the suits By the end of production two different helmets were produced one for the common stunt trooper and a second design for close ups Fifty stunt helmets were produced in white painted HDPE and six hero helmets were produced in white ABS plastic Besides the material used the two designs can be differentiated by differences in the eyes the ears and the mouth area br The copyright status of the armor design has undergone legal challenges A lawsuit by Lucasfilm against one of the original prop designers Andrew Ainsworth who had been selling helmet replicas confirmed the design to be under copyright in the US However a UK court decision in Ainsworth s favor deemed the costume to be industrial design which is protected there only for years This puts the armor design in the public domain in the UK and likely throughout the European Union br To differentiate the First Order stormtroopers from their earlier Imperial counterparts the helmet and armor were redesigned for the film Star Wars The Force Awakens by costume designer Michael Kaplan with input from director J J Abrams Within the Star Wars setting this armor is described as being an improvement over the previous iteration including better joint design for greater flexibility stronger betaplast armor plating and upgraded helmet communication and targeting systems br br br st Legion br br The st Legion Elite Stormtrooper Unit or Vader s Fist is a stormtrooper unit from the Star Wars movies and Star Wars Legends continuity Commanded by the ruthlessly cunning General Maximilian Veers and composed of the best trained soldiers in the Star Wars galaxy the legion earned a fierce reputation
