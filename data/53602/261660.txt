Hoth is the sixth planet of a remote system of the same name It is a small terrestrial planet with three orbiting moons and blanketed by entirely snow and ice The freezing climate although habitable

lizards known as tauntauns Both appear in The Empire Strikes Back br br br Appearances br br br Film br In the film The Empire Strikes Back Hoth is the home of the Rebel Alliance s secret Echo Base which is partially installed in natural caves formed by giant ice bubbles The Rebels patrol the planet by riding indigenous tauntauns At the start of the film Luke Skywalker and his tauntaun are attacked by a wampa Skywalker eventually escapes and is rescued by Han Solo When one of the Galactic Empire s probe droids uncovers the base the Rebels are forced to evacuate The Empire arrives and deploys ground forces to destroy the base but the Rebels battle the AT ATs with ground artillery and snowspeeders to stall them and effectively evacuate This conflict is commonly referred to as the Battle of Hoth br The original draft of The Empire Strikes Back written by Leigh Brackett depicted an opening scene with Luke Skywalker on the ridge of an ice planet though the name Hoth was given to the cloud planet at the time later called Bespin The draft also depicted Hoth s wampas attacking the Rebel base br The Hardangerj kulen glacier near Finse Norway served as the filming location for Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back Scenes were filmed in subzero temperatures For the ground battle scene miniatures were used on a set that used microscopic glass bubbles and baking soda to mimic the snowy territory br br br Legends br br Hoth has also appeared in Star Wars comics books and video games In the Marvel Star Wars comic Hoth Stuff it is revealed that Wedge Antilles went missing during the Battle of Hoth In the novel Darksaber Luke Skywalker and his lover Callista Ming travel to Hoth where they encounter the same wampa that attacked Luke in Empire but he swiftly kills it In Shadows

maps and in the Lego themed games Lego Star Wars II The Original Trilogy and Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga during the first two story levels of Episode V It also appears as an explorable hub world in the game Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga br br br Scientific accuracy br The planetary attributes of the fictional planet Hoth have been scrutinized for scientific accuracy Space com said Hoth most resembled the extrasolar planet OGLE BLG Lb With a surface temperature of degrees Fahrenheit degrees Celsius it is nearly as frigid as Pluto Bruce Betts of The Planetary Society said the asteroid belt near Hoth meant that the planet would have difficulty staying in place With Hoth being bombarded frequently by asteroids Betts said it would be unlikely for natural lifeforms like the wampa and the tauntaun shown in the film to evolve on the planet br Jeanne Cavelos theorized in The Science of Star Wars that the frequency of meteoroids bombarding Hoth indicated that the planet was relatively young since in older solar systems the debris is more cleared out Since Hoth has complex lifeforms Cavolos said the planet s age may be older in the range of several billion years The author said Hoth could be similar to Earth in age but lack neighboring planets like Jupiter and Saturn to shelter it from meteoroid impacts She also said with the asteroid belt depicted in the film as close to Hoth that the belt was a likely source for meteoroids The asteroid belt itself is unrealistically depicted as being closely clustered which would normally mean that the asteroids would be reduced to sand sized rubble over a long enough timespan br CJ Miozzi writing for The Escapist said that Hoth was realistic as a single biome planet among numerous such planets in Star Wars citing Jupiter s moon Europa as a similar example Miozzi said the planet was depicted in the Star Wars books as being geologically active and having additional smaller lifeforms including lichen The author said lichen on Earth was an important part of the food chain during winter months but that it could grow back outside these months With Hoth perpetually iced over Miozzi said lichen likely would not be sufficient to support a multi tiered food chain that includes an apex predator the wampa br br br Theme park attraction br Hoth appears in the theme park attraction Star Tours The Adventures Continue in Disney s
