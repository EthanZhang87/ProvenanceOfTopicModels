In ancient Greek religion and mythology Artemis Greek is the goddess of the hunt the wilderness wild animals nature vegetation childbirth care of children and chastity In later times she was identified with Selene the personification of the Moon She was often said to roam the forests and mountains attended by her entourage of nymphs The goddess Diana is her Roman equivalent br In Greek tradition Artemis is the daughter of Zeus and Leto and the twin sister of Apollo In most accounts the twins are the products of an extramarital liaison For this Zeus wife Hera forbade Leto from giving birth anywhere on solid land Only the island of Delos gave refuge to Leto allowing her to give birth to her children In most accounts Artemis is born first and then proceeds to assist Leto in the birth of the second twin Apollo Artemis was a kourotrophic child nurturing deity that is the patron and protector of young children especially young girls Artemis was worshipped as one of the primary goddesses of childbirth and midwifery along with Eileithyia and Hera br Artemis was also a patron of healing and disease particularly among women and children and believed to send both good health and illness upon women and children br Artemis was one of the three major virgin goddesses alongside Athena and Hestia Artemis preferred to remain an unmarried maiden and was one of the three Greek goddesses over whom Aphrodite had no power br In myth and literature Artemis is presented as a hunting goddess of the woods surrounded by her chaste band of nymphs In the myth of Actaeon when the young hunter sees her bathing naked he is transformed into a deer by the angered goddess and is then devoured by his own hunting dogs who do not recognize their master In the story of Callisto the girl is driven away from Artemis company after breaking her vow of virginity having lain with and been impregnated by Zeus In the Epic tradition Artemis halted the winds blowing the Greek ships during the Trojan War stranding the Greek fleet in Aulis after King Agamemnon the leader of the expedition shot and killed her sacred deer Artemis demanded the sacrifice of Iphigenia Agamemnon s young daughter as compensation for her slain deer In most versions when Iphigenia is led to the altar to be offered as a sacrifice Artemis pities her and takes her away leaving a deer in her place In the war that followed Artemis supported the Trojans against the Greeks and she challenged Hera in battle br Artemis was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities her worship spread throughout ancient Greece with her multiple temples altars shrines and local veneration found everywhere in the ancient world Her great temple at Ephesus was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World before it was burnt to the ground Artemis symbols included a bow and arrow a quiver and hunting knives and the deer and the cypress were sacred to her Diana her Roman equivalent was especially worshipped on the Aventine Hill in Rome near Lake Nemi in the Alban Hills and in Campania br br The name Artemis n f is of unknown or uncertain etymology although various sources have been proposed R S P Beekes suggested that the e i interchange points to a Pre Greek origin Artemis was venerated in Lydia as Artimus Georgios Babiniotis while accepting that the etymology is unknown also states that the name is already attested in Mycenean Greek and is possibly of pre Greek origin br The name may be related to Greek rktos bear from PIE h t os supported by the bear cult the goddess had in Attica Brauronia and the Neolithic remains at the Arkoudiotissa Cave as well as the story of Callisto which was originally about Artemis Arcadian epithet kallisto this cult was a survival of very old totemic and shamanistic rituals and formed part of a larger bear cult found further afield in other Indo European cultures e g Gaulish Artio It is believed that a precursor of Artemis was worshipped in Minoan Crete as the goddess of mountains and hunting Britomartis While connection with Anatolian names has been suggested the earliest attested forms of the name Artemis are the Mycenaean Greek a te mi to Artemitos gen and a ti mi te Artimitei dat written in Linear B at Pylos br According to J T Jablonski the name is also Phrygian and could be compared with the royal appellation Artemas of Xenophon Charles Anthon argued that the primitive root of the name is probably of Persian origin from arta art arte all meaning great excellent holy thus Artemis becomes identical with the great mother of Nature even as she was worshipped at Ephesus Anton Goebel suggests the root or to shake and makes Artemis mean the thrower of the dart or the shooter br Ancient Greek writers by way of folk etymology and some modern scholars have linked Artemis Doric Artamis to artamos i e butcher or like Plato did in Cratylus to artem s i e safe unharmed uninjured pure the stainless maiden A J Van Windekens tried to explain both and Artemis from atrem s meaning unmoved calm stable firm via metathesis br br Artemis is presented as a goddess who delights in hunting and punishes harshly those who cross her Artemis wrath is proverbial and represents the hostility of wild nature to humans Homer calls her the mistress of animals a title associated with representations in art going back as far as the Bronze Age showing a woman between a pair of animals Artemis carries with her certain functions and characteristics of a Minoan form whose history was lost in the myths br Artemis was one of the most popular goddesses in Ancient Greece The most frequent name of a month in the Greek calendars was Artemision in Ionic territories Artemisios or Artamitios in the Doric and Aeolic territories and in Macedonia Also Elaphios in Elis Elaphebolion in Athens Iasos Apollonia of Chalkidice and Munichion in Attica In the calendars of Aetolia Phocis and Gytheion there was the month Laphrios and in Thebes Corcyra and Byzantion the month Eucleios The goddess was venerated in festivals during spring br In some cults she retains the theriomorphic form of a Pre Greek goddess who was conceived with the shape of a bear rktos bear Kallisto in Arcadia is a hypostasis of Artemis with the shape of a bear and her cults at Brauron and at Piraeus Munichia are remarkable for the arkteia where virgin girls before marriage were disguised as she bears br The ancient Greeks called potnia theron the representation of the goddess between animals on a Greek vase from circa BCE a winged Artemis stands between a spotted panther and a deer Potnia theron is very close to the daimons and this differentiates her from the other Greek divinities This is the reason that Artemis was later identified with Hecate since the daimons were tutelary deities Hecate was the goddess of crossroads and she was the queen of the witches br br Laphria is the Pre Greek mistress of the animals at Delphi and Patras There was a custom to throw animals alive into the annual fire of the fest The festival at Patras was introduced from Calydon and this relates Artemis to the Greek heroine Atalanta who symbolizes freedom and independence Other epithets that relate Artemis to the animals are Amarynthia and Kolainis br In the Homeric poems Artemis is mainly the goddess of hunting because it was the most important sport in Mycenean Greece An almost formulaic epithet used in the Iliad and Odyssey to describe her is iocheaira she who shoots arrows often translated as she who delights in arrows or she who showers arrows She is called Artemis Chrysilakatos of the golden shafts or Chrysinios of the golden reins as a goddess of hunting in her chariot The Homeric Hymn to Artemis paints this picture of the goddess br br I sing of Artemis whose shafts are of gold who cheers on the hounds the pure maiden shooter of stags who delights in archery own sister to Apollo with the golden sword Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow rejoicing in the chase and sends out grievous shafts The tops of the high mountains tremble and the tangled wood echoes awesomely with the outcry of beasts earthquakes and the sea also where fishes shoal br According to the beliefs of the first Greeks in Arcadia Artemis is the first nymph a goddess of free nature She is an independent free woman and she doesn t need any partner She is hunting surrounded by her nymphs This idea of freedom and women s skill is expressed in many Greek myths br br In Peloponnese the temples of Artemis were built near springs rivers and marshes Artemis was closely related to the waters and especially to Poseidon the god of the waters Her common epithets are Limnnaia Limnatis relation to waters and Potamia and Alphaea relation to rivers In some cults she is the healer goddess of women with the surnames Lousia and Thermia br Artemis is the leader of the nymphs Hegemone and she is hunting surrounded by them The nymphs appear during the festival of the marriage and they are appealed by the pregnant women Artemis became goddess of marriage and childbirth She was worshipped with the surname Eucleia in several cities Women consecrated clothes to Artemis for a happy childbirth and she had the epithets Lochia and Lecho br The Dorians interpreted Artemis mainly as goddess of vegetation who was worshipped in an orgiastic cult with lascivious dances with the common epithets Orthia Korythalia and Dereatis The female dancers wore masks and were famous in antiquity The goddess of vegetation was also related to the tree cult with temples near the holy trees and the surnames Apanchomene Caryatis and Cedreatis br According to Greek beliefs the image of a god or a goddess gave signs or tokens and had divine and magic powers With these conceptions she was worshipped as Tauria the Tauric goddess Aricina Italy and Anaitis Lydia In the bucolic pastoral songs the image of the goddess was discovered in bundles of leaves or dry sticks and she had the surnames Lygodesma and Phakelitis br br In the European folklore a wild hunter is chasing an elfish woman who falls in the water In the Greek myths the hunter is chasing a female deer doe and both disappear into the waters In relation to these myths Artemis was worshipped as Saronia and Stymphalia The myth of a goddess who is chased and then falls in the sea is related to the cults of Aphaea and Diktynna br Artemis carrying torches was identified with Hecate and she had the surnames Phosphoros and Selasphoros In Athens and Tegea she was worshipped as Artemis Kalliste the most beautiful Sometimes the goddess had the name of an Amazon like Lyceia with a helmet of a wolf skin and Molpadia The female warriors Amazons embody the idea of freedom and women s independence br In spite of her status as a virgin who avoided potential lovers there are multiple references to Artemis beauty and erotic aspect in the Odyssey Odysseus compares Nausicaa to Artemis in terms of appearance when trying to win her favor Libanius when praising the city of Antioch wrote that Ptolemy was smitten by the beauty of the statue of Artemis whereas her mother Leto often took pride in her daughter s beauty She has several stories surrounding her where men such as Actaeon Orion and Alpheus tried to couple with her forcibly only to be thwarted or killed Ancient poets note Artemis height and imposing stature as she stands taller and more impressive than all the nymphs accompanying her br br Artemis is rooted to the less developed personality of the Mycenean goddess of nature The goddess of nature was concerned with birth and vegetation and had certain chthonic aspects The Mycenean goddess was related to the Minoan mistress of the animals who can be traced later in local cults however we don t know to what extent we can differentiate the Minoan from the Mycenean religion Artemis carries with her certain functions and characteristics of a Minoan form whose history was lost in the myths According to the beliefs of the first Greeks in Arcadia Artemis is the first nymph a divinity of free nature She was a great goddess and her temples were built near springs marshes and rivers where the nymphs live and they are appealed by the pregnant women In Greek religion we must see less tractable elements which have nothing to do with the Olympians but come from an old less organized world exorcisms rituals to raise crops gods and goddesses conceived not quite in human shape Some cults of Artemis retained the pre Greek features which were consecrated by immemorial practices and connected with daily tasks Artemis shows sometimes the wild and darker side of her character and can bring immediate death with her arrows however she embodies the idea of the free nature which was introduced by the first Greeks The Dorians came later in the area probably from Epirus and the goddess of nature was mostly interpreted as a vegetation goddess who was related to the ecstatic Minoan tree cult She was worshipped in orgiastic cults with lascivious and sometimes obscene dances which have pure Greek elements introduced by the Dorians The feminine sometimes male dancers wore usually masks and they were famous in the antiquity The great popularity of Artemis corresponds to the Greek belief in freedom and she is mainly the goddess of women in a patriarchal society The goddess of free nature is an independent woman and doesn t need a partner Artemis is frequently depicted carrying a torch and she was occasionally identified with Hecate Like other Greek deities she had a number of other names applied to her reflecting the variety of roles duties and aspects ascribed to the goddess br br Aeginaea probably huntress of chamois or the wielder of the

with her husband Zeus for impregnating Leto forbade her from giving birth on either terra firma the mainland or on an island but the island of Delos disobeyed and allowed Leto to give birth there According to some this rooted the once freely floating island to one place br According to the Homeric Hymn to Artemis however the island where she and her twin were born was Ortygia In ancient Cretan history Leto was worshipped at Phaistos and in Cretan mythology Leto gave birth to Apollo and Artemis on the islands known today as Paximadia br A scholium of Servius on Aeneid iii accounts for the island s archaic name Ortygia by asserting that Zeus transformed Leto into a quail ortux to prevent Hera from finding out about his infidelity and Kenneth McLeish suggested further that in quail form Leto would have given birth with as few birth pains as a mother quail suffers when she lays an egg br br The myths also differ as to whether Artemis was born first or Apollo Most stories depict Artemis as firstborn becoming her mother s midwife upon the birth of her brother Apollo Servius a late fourth early fifth century grammarian wrote that Artemis was born first because at first it was night whose instrument is the Moon which Artemis represents and then day whose instrument is the Sun which Apollo represents Pindar however writes that both twins shone like the Sun when they came into the bright light br After their troubling childbirth Leto took the twin infants and crossed over to Lycia in the southwest corner of Asia Minor where she tried to drink from and bathe the babies in a spring she found there However the local Lycian peasants tried to prevent the twins and their mother from making use of the water by stirring up the muddy bottom of the spring so the three of them could not drink it Leto in her anger that the impious Lycians had refused to offer hospitality to a fatigued mother and her thirsty infants transformed them all into frogs forever doomed to swim and hop around the spring br br The river god Alpheus was in love with Artemis but as he realized he could do nothing to win her heart he decided to capture her When Artemis and her companions at Letrenoi go to Alpheus she becomes suspicious of his motives and covers her face with mud so he does not recognize her In another story Alphaeus tries to rape Artemis attendant Arethusa Artemis pities the girl and saves her transforming her into a spring in the temple Artemis Alphaea in Letrini where the goddess and her attendant drink br Bouphagos son of the Titan Iapetus sees Artemis and thinks about raping her Reading his sinful thoughts Artemis strikes him down at Mount Pholoe br Daphnis was a young boy a son of Hermes who was accepted by and became a follower of the goddess Artemis Daphnis would often accompany her in hunting and entertain her with his singing of pastoral songs and playing of the panpipes br Artemis taught a man Scamandrius how to be a great archer and he excelled in the use of a bow and arrow with her guidance br Broteas was a famous hunter who refused to honour Artemis and boasted that nothing could harm him not even fire Artemis then drove him mad causing him to walk into fire ending his life br According to Antoninus Liberalis Siproites was a Cretan who was metamorphized into a woman by Artemis for while hunting seeing the goddess bathing Artemis also changed a Calydonian man named Calydon the son of Ares and Astynome into stone when he saw the goddess bathing naked br br Multiple versions of the Actaeon myth survive though many are fragmentary The details vary but at the core they involve the great hunter Actaeon whom Artemis turns into a stag for a transgression and who is then killed by hunting dogs Usually the dogs are his own but no longer recognize their master Occasionally they are said to be the hounds of Artemis br Various tellings diverge in terms of the hunter s transgression sometimes merely seeing the virgin goddess naked sometimes boasting he is a better hunter than she or even merely being a rival of Zeus for the affections of Semele Apollodorus who records the Semele version notes that the ones with Artemis are more common br According to Lamar Ronald Lacey s The Myth of Aktaion Literary and Iconographic Studies the standard modern text on the work the most likely original version of the myth portrays Actaeon as the hunting companion of the goddess who seeing her naked in her sacred spring attempts to force himself on her For this hubris he is turned into a stag and devoured by his own hounds However in some surviving versions Actaeon is a stranger who happens upon Artemis br br A single line from Aeschylus s now lost play Toxotides female archers is among the earlier attestations of Actaeon s myth stating that the dogs destroyed their master utterly with no confirmation of Actaeon s metamorphosis or the god he offended but it is heavily implied to be Artemis due to the title Ancient artwork depicting the myth of Actaeon predate Aeschylus Euripides coming in a bit later wrote in the Bacchae that Actaeon was torn to shreds and perhaps devoured by his flesh eating hunting dogs when he claimed to be a better hunter than Artemis Like Aeschylus he does not mention Actaeon being deer shaped when that happens Callimachus writes that Actaeon chanced upon Artemis bathing in the woods and she caused him to be devoured by his own hounds for the sacrilege and he makes no mention of transformation into a deer either br Diodorus Siculus wrote that Actaeon dedicated his prizes in hunting to Artemis proposed marriage to her and even tried to forcefully consummate said marriage inside the very sacred temple of the goddess for this he was given the form of one of the animals which he was wont to hunt and then torn to shreds by his hunting dogs Diodorus also mentioned the alternative of Actaeon claiming to be a better hunter than the goddess of the hunt Hyginus also mentions Actaeon attempting to rape Artemis when he finds her bathing naked and her transforming him into the doomed deer br br Apollodorus wrote that when Actaeon saw Artemis bathing she turned him into a deer on the spot and intentionally drove his dogs into a frenzy so that they would kill and devour him Afterward Chiron built a sculpture of Actaeon to comfort his dogs in their grief as they could not find their master no matter how much they looked for him br According to the Latin version of the story told by the Roman Ovid Actaeon was a hunter who after returning home from a long day s hunting in the woods he stumbled upon Artemis and her retinue of nymphs bathing in her sacred grotto The nymphs panicking rushed to cover Artemis naked body with their own as Artemis splashed some water on Actaeon saying he was welcome to share with everyone the tale of seeing her without any clothes as long as he could share it at all Immediately he was transformed into a deer and in panic ran away But he did not go far as he was hunted down and eventually caught and devoured by his own fifty hunting dogs who could not recognize their own master br Pausanias says that Actaeon saw Artemis naked and that she threw a deerskin on him so that his hounds would kill him in order to prevent him from marrying Semele br br The story of Niobe queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion who blasphemously boasted of being superior to Leto This myth is very old Homer knew of it and wrote that Niobe had given birth to twelve children equally divided in six sons and six daughters the Niobids br Other sources speak of fourteen children seven sons and seven daughters Niobe claimed of being a better mother than Leto for having more children than Leto s own two but the two though they were only two destroyed all those others Leto was not slow to catch up on that and grew angry at the queen s hubris She summoned her children and commanded them to avenge the slight against her br br Swiftly Apollo and Artemis descended on Thebes While the sons were hunting in the woods Apollo crept up on them and slew all seven with his silver bow The dead bodies were brought to the palace Niobe wept for them but did not relent saying that even now she was better than Leto for she still had seven children her daughters br On cue Artemis then started shooting the daughters one by one Right as Niobe begged for her youngest one to be spared Artemis killed that last one Niobe cried bitter tears and was turned into a rock Amphion at the sight of his dead sons killed himself The gods themselves entombed them In some versions Apollo and Artemis spared a single son and daughter each for they prayed to Leto for help thus Niobe had as many children as Leto did but no more br br br Orion was Artemis hunting companion after giving up on trying to find Oenopion Orion met Artemis and her mother Leto and joined the goddess in hunting A great hunter himself he bragged that he would kill every beast on earth Gaia the earth was not too pleased to hear that and sent a giant scorpion to sting him Artemis then transferred him into the stars as the constellation Orion In one version Orion died after pushing Leto out of the scorpion s way br In another version Orion tries to violate Opis one of Artemis followers from Hyperborea and Artemis kills him In a version by Aratus Orion grabs Artemis robe and she kills him in self defense Other writers have Artemis kill him for trying to rape her or one of her attendants br Istrus wrote a version in which Artemis fell in love with Orion apparently the only time Artemis ever fell in love She meant to marry him and no talk from her brother Apollo would change her mind Apollo then decided to trick Artemis and while Orion was off swimming in the sea he pointed at him barely a spot in the horizon and wagered that Artemis could not hit that small dot Artemis ever eager to prove she was the better archer shot Orion killing him She then placed him among the stars br In Homer s Iliad the goddess of the dawn Eos seduces Orion angering the gods who did not approve of immortal goddesses taking mortal men for lovers causing Artemis to shoot and kill him on the island of Ortygia br br Callisto the daughter of Lycaon King of Arcadia br was one of Artemis hunting attendants and as a companion of Artemis took a vow of chastity br According to Hesiod in his lost poem Astronomia Zeus appeared to Callisto and seduced her resulting in her becoming pregnant Though she was able to hide her pregnancy for a time she was soon found out while bathing Enraged Artemis transformed Callisto into a bear and in this form she gave birth to her son Arcas Both of them were then captured by shepherds and given to Lycaon and Callisto thus lost her child Sometime later Callisto thought fit to go into a forbidden sanctuary of Zeus and was hunted by the Arcadians her son among them When she was about to be killed Zeus saved her by placing her in the heavens as a constellation of a bear br In his De Astronomica Hyginus after recounting the version from Hesiod presents several other alternative versions The first which he attributes to Amphis says that Zeus seduced Callisto by disguising himself as Artemis during a hunting session and that when Artemis found out that Callisto was pregnant she replied saying that it was the goddess s fault causing Artemis to transform her into a bear This version also has both Callisto and Arcas placed in the heavens as the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor br Hyginus then presents another version in which after Zeus lay with Callisto it was Hera who transformed her into a bear Artemis later while hunting kills the bear and later on being recognized Callisto was placed among the stars Hyginus also gives another version in which Hera tries to catch Zeus and Callisto in the act causing Zeus to transform her into a bear Hera finding the bear points it out to Artemis who is hunting Zeus in panic places Callisto in the heavens as a constellation br br Ovid gives a somewhat different version Zeus seduced Callisto once again disguised as Artemis but she seems to realise that it is not the real Artemis and she thus does not blame Artemis when during bathing she is found out Callisto is rather than being transformed simply ousted from the company of the huntresses and she thus gives birth to Arcas as a human Only later is she transformed into a bear this time by Hera When Arcas fully grown is out hunting he nearly kills his mother who is saved only by Zeus placing her in the heavens br In the Bibliotheca a version is presented in which Zeus raped Callisto having assumed the likeness as some say of Artemis or as others say of Apollo He then turned her into a bear himself so as to hide the event from Hera Artemis then shot the bear either upon the persuasion of Hera or out of anger at Callisto for breaking her virginity Once Callisto was dead Zeus made her into a constellation took the child named him Arcas and gave him to Maia who raised him br Pausanias in his Description of Greece presents another version in which after Zeus seduced Callisto Hera turned her into a bear which Artemis killed to please Hera Hermes was then sent by Zeus to take Arcas and Zeus himself placed Callisto in the heavens br br When Zeus gigantic son Tityos tried to rape Leto she called out to her children for help and both Artemis and Apollo were quick to respond by raining down their arrows on Tityos killing him br Chione was a princess of Phokis She was beloved by two gods Hermes and Apollo and boasted that she was more beautiful than Artemis because she had made two gods fall in love with her at once Artemis was furious and killed Chione with an arrow or struck her mute by shooting off her tongue However some versions of this myth say Apollo and Hermes protected her from Artemis wrath br Artemis saved the infant Atalanta from dying of exposure after her father abandoned her She sent a female bear to nurse the baby who was then raised by hunters In some stories Artemis later sent a bear to injure Atalanta because others claimed Atalanta was a superior hunter Among other adventures Atalanta participated in the Calydonian boar hunt which Artemis had sent to destroy Calydon because King Oeneus had forgotten her at the harvest sacrifices br In the hunt Atalanta drew the first blood and was awarded the prize of the boar s hide She hung it in a sacred grove at Tegea as a dedication to Artemis Meleager was a hero of Aetolia King Oeneus ordered him to gather heroes from all over Greece to hunt the Calydonian boar After the death of Meleager Artemis turns his grieving sisters the Meleagrids into guineafowl that Artemis favoured br In Nonnus Dionysiaca Aura the daughter of Lelantos and Periboia was a companion of Artemis When out hunting one day with Artemis she asserts that the goddess s voluptuous body and breasts are too womanly and sensual and doubts her virginity arguing that her own lithe body and man like breasts are better than Artemis and a true symbol of her own chastity In anger Artemis asks Nemesis for help to avenge her dignity Nemesis agrees telling Artemis that Aura s punishment will be to lose her virginity since she dared question that of Artemis br br Nemesis then arranges for Eros to make Dionysus fall in love with Aura Dionysus intoxicates Aura and rapes her as she lies unconscious after which she becomes a deranged killer While pregnant she tries to kill herself or cut open her belly as Artemis mocks her over it When she bore twin sons she ate one while the other Iacchus was saved by Artemis br The twin sons of Poseidon and Iphimedeia Otos and Ephialtes grew enormously at a young age They were aggressive and skilled hunters who could not be killed except by each other The growth of the Aloadae never stopped and they boasted that as soon as they could reach heaven they would kidnap Artemis and Hera and take them as wives The gods were afraid of them except for Artemis who captured a fine deer that jumped out between them In another version of the story she changed herself into a doe and jumped between them br br The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed one another In another version Apollo sent the deer into the Aloadae s midst causing their accidental killing of each other In another version they start pilling up mountains to reach Mount Olympus in order to catch Hera and Artemis but the gods spot them and attack When the twins had retreated the gods learnt that Ares had been captured The Aloadae not sure about what to do with Ares lock him up in a pot Artemis then turns into a deer and causes them to kill each other br In some versions of the story of Adonis Artemis sent a wild boar to kill him as punishment for boasting that he was a better hunter than her In other versions Artemis killed Adonis for revenge In later myths Adonis is a favorite of Aphrodite who was responsible for the death of Hippolytus who had been a hunter of Artemis Therefore Artemis killed Adonis to avenge Hippolytus s death In yet another version Adonis was not killed by Artemis but by Ares as punishment for being with Aphrodite br Polyphonte was a young woman who fled home in pursuit of a free virginal life with Artemis as opposed to the conventional life of marriage and children favoured by Aphrodite As a punishment Aphrodite cursed her causing her to mate and have children with a bear Artemis seeing that was disgusted and sent a horde of wild animals against her causing Polyphonte to flee to her father s house Her resulting offspring Agrius and Oreius were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus Ultimately the entire family was transformed into birds who became ill portents for mankind br Coronis was a princess from Thessaly who became the lover of Apollo and fell pregnant While Apollo was away Coronis began an affair with a mortal man named Ischys When Apollo learnt of this he sent Artemis to kill the pregnant Coronis or Artemis had the initiative to kill Coronis on her own accord for the insult done against her brother The unborn child Asclepius was later removed from his dead mother s womb br When two of her hunting companions who had sworn to remain chaste and be devoted to her Rhodopis and Euthynicus fell in love with each other and broke their vows in a cavern Artemis turned Rhodopis into a fountain inside that very cavern as punishment The two had fallen in love not on their own but only after Eros had struck them with his love arrows commanded by his mother Aphrodite who had taken offence in that Rhodopis and Euthynicus rejected love and marriage in favour of a chaste life br When the monstrous Typhon attacked Olympus all the terrified gods transformed into various animals and fled to Egypt Artemis became a cat as she was identified by the Greeks with the Egyptian feline goddess Bastet br When the queen of Kos Echemeia ceased to worship Artemis she shot her with an arrow Persephone then snatched the still living Euthemia and brought her to the Underworld br br Artemis may have been represented as a supporter of Troy because her brother Apollo was the patron god of the city and she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times Artemis plays a significant role in the war like Leto and Apollo Artemis took the side of the Trojans In Iliad Artemis on her chariot with the golden reins kills the daughter of Bellerophon Bellorophone was a divine Greek hero who killed the monster Chimera At the beginning of the Greek s journey to Troy Artemis punished Agamemnon after he killed a sacred stag in a sacred grove and boasted that he was a better hunter than the goddess br br When the Greek fleet was preparing at Aulis to depart for Troy to commence the Trojan War Artemis becalmed the winds The seer Calchas erroneously advised Agamemnon that the only way to appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia In some version of the myth Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer in others Artemis allowed Iphigenia to be sacrificed In versions where Iphigenia survived a number of different myths have been told about what happened after Artemis took her either she was brought to Tauris and led the priests there or she became Artemis immortal companion Aeneas was also helped by Artemis Leto and Apollo Apollo found him wounded by Diomedes and lifted him to heaven There the three deities secretly healed him in a great chamber br During the theomachy Artemis found herself standing opposite of Hera on which a scholium to the Iliad wrote that they represent the Moon versus the air around the Earth Artemis chided her brother Apollo for not fighting Poseidon and told him never to brag again Apollo did not answer her An angry Hera berated Artemis for daring to fight her br br How now art thou fain thou bold and shameless thing to stand forth against me No easy foe I tell thee am I that thou shouldst vie with me in might albeit thou bearest the bow since it was against women that Zeus made thee a lion and granted thee to slay whomsoever of them thou wilt In good sooth it is better on the mountains to be slaying beasts and wild deer than to fight amain with those mightier than thou Howbeit if thou wilt learn thou of war that thou mayest know full well how much mightier am I seeing thou matchest thy strength with mine br br Hera then grabbed Artemis hands by the wrists and holding her in place beat her with her own bow Crying Artemis left her bow and arrows where they lay and ran to Olympus to cry at her father Zeus knees while her mother Leto picked up her bow and arrows and followed her weeping daughter br br Artemis the goddess of forests and hills was worshipped throughout ancient Greece Her best known cults were on the island of Delos br her birthplace in Attica at Brauron and Mounikhia near Piraeus and in Sparta She was often depicted in paintings and statues in a forest setting carrying a bow and arrows and accompanied by a deer br The ancient Spartans used to sacrifice to her as one of their patron goddesses before starting a new military campaign br Athenian festivals in honor of Artemis included Elaphebolia Mounikhia Kharisteria and Brauronia The festival of Artemis Orthia was observed in Sparta br Pre pubescent and adolescent Athenian girls were sent to the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron to serve the Goddess for one year During this time the girls were known as arktoi or little she bears br br A myth explaining this servitude states that a bear had formed the habit of regularly visiting the town of Brauron and the people there fed it so that over time the bear became tame A girl teased the bear and in some versions of the myth it killed her while in other versions it clawed out her eyes Either way the girl s brothers killed the bear and Artemis was enraged She demanded that young girls act the bear at her sanctuary in atonement for the bear s death br Artemis was worshipped as one of the primary goddesses of childbirth and midwifery along with Eileithyia Dedications of clothing to her sanctuaries after a successful birth was common in the Classical era Artemis could be a deity to be feared by pregnant women as deaths during this time were attributed to her As childbirth and pregnancy was a very common and important event there were numerous other deities associated with it many localized to a particular geographic area including but not limited to Aphrodite Hera and Hekate br br It was considered a good sign when Artemis appeared in the dreams of hunters and pregnant women but a naked Artemis was seen as an ill omen According to Pseudo Apollodorus she assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin Older sources such as Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo in Line have the arrival of Eileithyia on Delos as the event that allows Leto to give birth to her children Contradictory is Hesiod s presentation of the myth in Theogony where he states that Leto bore her children before Zeus marriage to Hera with no commentary on any drama related to their birth br Despite her being primarily known as a goddess of hunting and the wilderness she was also connected to dancing music and song like her brother Apollo she is often seen singing and dancing with her nymphs or leading the chorus of the Muses and the Graces at Delphi In Sparta girls of marriageable age performed the partheneia choral maiden songs in her honor An ancient Greek proverb written down by Aesop went For where did Artemis not dance signifying the goddess connection to dancing and festivity br During the Classical period in Athens she was identified with Hekate Artemis also assimilated Caryatis Carya br There was a women s cult at Cyzicus worshiping Artemis which was called Dolon br br Artemis was born on the sixth day of the month Thargelion around May which made it

for the arkteia where girls aged between five and ten were dressed in saffron robes and played at being bears or act the bear to appease the goddess after she sent the plague when her bear was killed

br Tauromenion in Sicily Festival of Artemis Eucleia in the month Eucleios br Festival of Artemis Korythalia The male dancers wore wooden masks br br br An important aspect of Artemis persona and worship was her virginity which may seem contradictory given her role as a goddess associated with childbirth The idea of Artemis as a virgin goddess likely is related to her primary role as a huntress Hunters traditionally abstained from sex prior to the hunt as a form of ritual purity and out of a belief that the scent would scare off potential prey The ancient cultural context in which Artemis worship emerged also held that virginity was a prerequisite to marriage and that a married woman became subservient to her husband br In this light Artemis virginity is also related to her power and independence Rather than a form of asexuality it is an attribute that signals Artemis as her own master with power equal to that of male gods Her virginity also possibly represents a concentration of fertility that can be spread among her followers in the manner of earlier mother goddess figures However some later Greek writers did come to treat Artemis as inherently asexual and as an opposite to Aphrodite Furthermore some have described Artemis along with the goddesses Hestia and Athena as being asexual this is mainly supported by the fact that in the Homeric Hymns To Aphrodite Aphrodite is described as having no power over the three goddesses br br Despite her virginity both modern scholars and ancient commentaries have linked Artemis to the archetype of the mother goddess Artemis was traditionally linked to fertility and was petitioned to assist women with childbirth According to Herodotus Greek playwright Aeschylus identified Artemis with Persephone as a daughter of Demeter Her worshipers in Arcadia also traditionally associated her with Demeter and Persephone In Asia Minor she was often conflated with local mother goddess figures such as Cybele and Anahita in Iran br br The archetype of the mother goddess though was not highly compatible with the Greek pantheon and though the Greeks had adopted the worship of Cybele and other Anatolian mother goddesses as early as the seventh century BCE she was not directly conflated with any Greek goddesses Instead bits and pieces of her worship and aspects were absorbed variously by Artemis Aphrodite and others as Eastern influence spread br br At Ephesus in Ionia Turkey her temple became one of the Seven Wonders of the World It was probably the best known center of her worship except for Delos There the Lady whom the Ionians associated with Artemis through interpretatio graeca was worshipped primarily as a mother goddess akin to the Phrygian goddess Cybele in an ancient sanctuary where her cult image depicted the Lady of Ephesus adorned with multiple large beads Excavation at the site of the Artemision in identified a multitude of tear shaped amber beads that had been hung on the original wooden statue xoanon and these were probably carried over into later sculpted copies br In Acts of the Apostles Ephesian metalsmiths who felt threatened by Saint Paul s preaching of Christianity jealously rioted in her defense shouting Great is Artemis of the Ephesians Of the columns of her temple only one composite made up of fragments still stands as a marker of the temple s location br br No records have been found of the Greeks referring to Artemis as a lunar deity as their lunar deity was Selene but the Romans identified Artemis with Selene leading them to perceive her as a lunar deity though the Greeks did not refer to her or worship her as such As the Romans began to associate Apollo more with Helios the personification of the Sun it was only natural that the Romans would then begin to identify Apollo s twin sister Artemis with Helios own sister Selene the personification of the Moon br Evidence of the syncretism of Artemis and Selene is found early on a scholium on the Iliad claiming to be reporting sixth century BCE author Theagenes s interpretation of the theomachy in Book says that in the fight between Artemis and Hera Artemis represents the Moon while Hera represents the earthly air br Active references to Artemis as an illuminating goddess start much later Notably Roman era author Plutarch writes how during the Battle of Salamis Artemis led the Athenians to victory by shining with the full moon but all lunar related narratives of this event come from Roman times and none of the contemporary writers such as Herodotus makes any mention of the night or the Moon br br Artemis connection to childbed and women s labour naturally led to her becoming associated with the menstrual cycle in course of time thus the Moon Selene just like Artemis was linked to childbirth as it was believed that women had the easiest labours during the full moon paving thus the way for the two goddesses to be seen as the same On that Cicero writes br br Apollo a Greek name is called Sol the sun and Diana Luna the moon Luna the moon is so called a lucendo from shining she bears the name also of Lucina and as in Greece the women in labor invoke Diana Lucifera br Association to health was another reason Artemis and Selene were syncretized Strabo wrote that Apollo and Artemis were connected to the Sun and the Moon respectively which was due to the changes the two celestial bodies caused in the temperature of the air as the twins were gods of pestilential diseases and sudden deaths br Roman authors applied Artemis Diana s byname Phoebe to Luna Selene the same way as Phoebus was given to Helios due to his identification with Apollo Another epithet of Artemis that Selene appropriated is Cynthia meaning born in Mount Cynthus The goddesses Artemis Selene and Hecate formed a triad identified as the same goddess with three avatars Selene in the sky moon Artemis on earth hunting and Hecate beneath the earth Underworld br In Italy those three goddesses became a ubiquitous feature in depictions of sacred groves where Hecate Trivia marked intersections and crossroads along with other liminal deities The Romans enthusiastically celebrated the multiple identities of Diana as Hecate Luna and Trivia br Roman poet Horace in his odes enjoins Apollo to listen to the prayers of the boys as he asks Luna the two horned queen of the stars to listen to those of the girls in place of Diana due to their role as protectors of the young In Virgil s Aeneid when Nisus addresses Luna the Moon he calls her daughter of Latona br In works of art the two goddesses were mostly distinguished Selene is usually depicted as being shorter than Artemis with a rounder face and wearing a long robe instead of a short hunting chiton with a billowing cloak forming an arc above her head Artemis was sometimes depicted with a lunate crown br br Hecate was the goddess of crossroads boundaries ghosts and witchcraft She is the queen of the witches Artemis absorbed the Pre Greek goddess Potnia Theron who was closely associated with the daimons In the Mycenean age daimons were lesser deities of ghosts divine spirits and tutelary deities br Some scholars believe that Hecate was an aspect of Artemis prior to the latter s adoption into the Olympian pantheon br Artemis would have at that point become more strongly associated with purity and maidenhood on the one hand while her originally darker attributes like her association with magic the souls of the dead and the night would have continued to be worshipped separately under her title Hecate br Both goddesses carried torches and were accompanied by a dog It seems that the character of Artemis in Arcadia was original At Acacesium Artemis Hegemone is depicted br holding two torches and at Lycosura Artemis is depicted holding a snake and a torch A bitch suitable for hunting was lying down by her side br Sophocles calles Artemis Amphipyros carrying a torch in each hand however the adjective refers also to the twin fire on the two peaks of the mountain Parnassus behind Delphi In the fest of Laphria at Delphi Artemis is related to the Pre Greek mistress of the animals with barbaric sacrifices and possible connections with magic and ghosts since Potnia Theron was close to the daimons The annual fire was the characteristique custom of the fest br At Kerameikos in Athens Artemis is clearly identified with Hecate Pausanias believes that Kalliste the most beautiful is a surname of Artemis carrying a torch In Thessaly the distinctly local goddess Enodia with the surname Pheraia is identified with Hecate Artemis Pheraia was worshipped in Argos Athens and Sicyon br br Homer uses the epithet Chrisinios of the golden reigns to illustrate the chariot of the goddess of hunting At the fest of Laphria at Delphi the priestess followed the parade on a chariot which was covered with the skin of a deer br br Artemis is rarely portrayed with a hunting spear In her cult in Aetolia the Artemis Aetole was depicted with a hunting spear or javelin br Artemis is also sometimes depicted with a fishing spear connected with her cult as a patron goddess of fishing This conception relates her with Diktynna Britomartis As a goddess of maiden dances and songs Artemis is often portrayed with a lyre in ancient art br br Deer were the only animals held sacred to Artemis herself On seeing a deer larger than a bull with horns shining she fell in love with these creatures and held them sacred Deer were also the first animals she captured She caught five golden horned deer and harnessed them to her chariot At Lycosura in isolated Arcadia Artemis is depicted holding a snake and a torch and dressed with a deer skin besides Demeter and Persephone It seems that the depictions of Artemis and Demeter Melaina black in Arcadia correspond to the earliest conceptions of the first Greeks in Greece At the fest of Laphria at Delphi the priestess followed the parade on a chariot which was covered with the skin of a deer br The third labour of Heracles commanded by Eurystheus consisted of chasing and catching the terrible Ceryneian Hind The hind was a female deer with golden andlers and hooves of bronze and was sacred to Artemis Heracles begged Artemis for forgiveness and promised to return it alive Artemis forgave him but targeted Eurystheus for her wrath br br In a legend Artemis got her hunting dogs from Pan in the forest of Arcadia Pan gave Artemis two black and white dogs three reddish ones and one spotted one these dogs were able to hunt even lions Pan also gave Artemis seven bitches of the finest Arcadian race but Artemis only ever brought seven dogs hunting with her at any one time In the earliest conceptions of Artemis at Lycosura a bitch suitable for hunting was lying down by her side br br In a Pre Greek cult Artemis was conceived as a bear Kallisto was transformed into a bear and she is a hypostasis of Artemis with a theriomorph form In the cults of Artemis at Brauron and at Piraeus Munichia arkteia young virgin girls were disguished to she bears arktoi in a ritual and they served the goddess before marriage br br An etiological myth tries to explain the origin of the Arkteia Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis temple at Brauron A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced to the people of Athens They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them A brother of one of the girls killed the bear so Artemis sent a plague in revenge The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague The oracle suggested that in payment for the bear s blood no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple played the bear for the goddess br In a legend of the cult of Munichia if someone killed a bear then they were to be punished by sacrificing their daughter in the sanctuary Embaros disguised his daughter dressing her like a bear arktos and hid her in the adyton He placed a goat on the altar and he sacrificed the goat instead of his daughter br br The boar is one of the favorite animals of the hunters and also hard to tame In honor of Artemis skill they sacrificed it to her Oeneus and Adonis were both killed by Artemis boar In The Odyssey she descends from a peak and she travels along the ridges of Mount Erymanthos that was sacred to the Mistress of the animals When the goddess became wrathful she would send the terrible Erymanthian boar to laid waste the farmer s fields Heracles managed to kill the terrible creature during his Twelve Labors br In one legend the Calydonian boar had terrorized the territory of Calydon because Artemis the mistress of the animals was offended The Calydonian boar hunt is one of the great heroic adventures in Greek legend The most famous Greek heroes including Meleager and Atalanta took part in the expedition The fierce hunter virgin Atalanta allied to the goddess Artemis was the first who wounded the Calydonian boar br Ovid describes the boar as follows br br A dreadful boar His burning bloodshot eyes br seemed coals of living fire and his rough neck br was knotted with stiff muscles and thick set br with bristles like sharp spikes A seething froth br dripped on his shoulders and his tusks br were like the spoils of Ind India Discordant roars br reverberated from his hideous jaws br and lightning belched forth from his horrid throat br scorched the green fields br Ovid Metamorphoses Brookes More translation br br Artemis felt pity for the Calydonian princesses Meleagrids as they mourned for their lost brother Meleager so she transformed them into Guinea fowl to be her favorite animals br br Hawks were the favored birds of many of the gods Artemis included br br Artemis is sometimes identified with the mythical bull goddess in a cult foreign in Greece The cult can be identified in Halae Araphenides in Attica At the end of the peculiar fest the sacrifice of a man was represented in a ritual br br Euripides relates her cult with Tauris tauros bull and with the myth of Iphigenia at Brauron Orestes brought the image of the goddess from Tauris to Brauron Sparta or Aricia br br Artemis is often depicted holding one or two torches There is not any sufficient explanation for this depiction The character of the goddess in Arcadia seems to be original At Acacesium Artemis Hegemone the leader is depicted holding two torches At Lycosura the goddess is depicted holding a snake and a torch and a bitch suitable for hunting was lying down by her sideSophocles calls Artemis Elaphebolos deer slayer Amphipyros with a fire in each end reminding the annual fire of the fest Laphria at Delphi The adjective refers also to the twin fires of the two peaks of the Mount Parnassus above Delphi Phaedriades Heshychius believes that Kalliste is the name of Hecate established at Kerameikos of Athens who some call Artemis torch bearing On a relief from Sicily the goddess is depicted holding a torch in one hand and an offering on the other The torch was used for the ignition of the fire on the altar br br During the Bronze Age the mistress of the animals is usually depicted between two lions with a peculiar crown on her head br The oldest representations of Artemis in Greek Archaic art circa BC portray her as Potnia Theron Queen of the Beasts a winged goddess holding a stag and lioness in her hands or sometimes a lioness and a lion Potnia theron is the only Greek goddess close to the daimons and sometimes is depicted with a Gorgon head and the Gorgon is her distant ancestor This winged Artemis lingered in ex votos as Artemis Orthia with a sanctuary close by Sparta br In Greek classical art she is usually portrayed as a maiden huntress young tall and slim clothed in a girl s short skirt with hunting boots a quiver a golden or silver bow and arrows br Often she is shown in the shooting pose and is accompanied by a hunting dog or stag When portrayed as a lunar deity Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings where she is shown as the death bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women such as the daughters of Niobe br Artemis was sometimes represented in Classical art with the crown of the crescent moon
