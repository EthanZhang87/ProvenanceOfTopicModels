almost million residents it is the fourth most populous state in the United States and eighth most densely populated as of New York is the th largest U S state by area with a total area of square miles km br New York has a varied geography The southeastern part of the state known as Downstate encompasses New York City the most populous city in the United States with over twice the population of Los Angeles the nation s second largest city Long Island the nation s most populous island and the suburbs and wealthy enclaves of the lower Hudson Valley These areas are the center of the New York metropolitan area a sprawling urban landmass and account for approximately two thirds of the state s population The much larger Upstate area spreads from the Great Lakes to Lake Champlain and includes the Adirondack Mountains and the Catskill Mountains part of the wider Appalachian Mountains The east west Mohawk River Valley bisects the more mountainous regions of Upstate and flows into the north south Hudson River valley near the state capital of Albany Western New York home to the cities of Buffalo and Rochester is part of the Great Lakes region and borders Lake Ontario and Lake Erie Central New York is anchored by the city of Syracuse between the central and western parts of the state New York is dominated by the Finger Lakes a popular tourist destination To the south along the state border with Pennsylvania the Southern Tier sits atop the Allegheny Plateau representing the northernmost reaches of Appalachia br New York was one of the original Thirteen Colonies that went on to form the United States The area of present day New York had been inhabited by tribes of the Algonquians and the Iroquois Confederacy Native Americans for several thousand years by the time the earliest Europeans arrived Stemming from Henry Hudson s expedition in the Dutch established the multiethnic colony of New Netherland in England seized the colony from the Dutch in renaming it the Province of New York During the American Revolutionary War a group of colonists eventually succeeded in establishing independence and the state ratified the then new United States Constitution in From the early th century New York s development of its interior beginning with the construction of the Erie Canal gave it incomparable advantages over other regions of the United States The state built its political cultural and economic ascendancy over the next century earning it the nickname of the Empire State Although deindustrialization eroded a portion of the state s economy in the second half of the th century New York in the st century continues to be considered as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship social tolerance and environmental sustainability br br The state attracts visitors from all over the globe with the highest count of any U S state in Many of its landmarks are well known including four of the world s ten most visited tourist attractions in Times Square Central Park Niagara Falls and Grand Central Terminal New York is home to approximately colleges and universities including Ivy League members Columbia University and Cornell University and the expansive State University of New York which is among the largest university systems in the nation New York City is home to the headquarters of the United Nations and it is sometimes described as the world s most important city the cultural financial and media epicenter and the capital of the world br br The Native American tribes in what is now New York were predominantly Iroquois and Algonquian Long Island was divided roughly in half between the Algonquian Wampanoag and Lenape peoples The Lenape also controlled most of the region surrounding New York Harbor North of the Lenape was a third Algonquian nation the Mohicans Starting north of them from east to west were two Iroquoian nations the Mohawk part of the original Iroquois Five Nations and the Petun South of them divided roughly along Appalachia were the Susquehannock and the Erie br Many of the Wampanoag and Mohican peoples were caught up in King Philip s War a joint effort of many New England tribes to push Europeans off their land After the death of their leader Chief Philip Metacomet most of those peoples fled inland splitting into the Abenaki and the Schaghticoke Many of the Mohicans remained in the region until the s however a small group known as the Ouabano migrated southwest into West Virginia at an earlier time They may have merged with the Shawnee br The Mohawk and Susquehannock were the most militaristic Trying to corner trade with the Europeans they targeted other tribes The Mohawk were also known for refusing white settlement on their land and discriminating against any of their people who converted to Christianity They posed a major threat to the Abenaki and Mohicans while the Susquehannock briefly conquered the Lenape in the s The most devastating event of the century however was the Beaver Wars br From approximately the Iroquois peoples waged campaigns which extended from modern day Michigan to Virginia against Algonquian and Siouan tribes as well as each other The aim was to control more land for animal trapping a career most natives had turned to in hopes of trading with whites first This completely changed the ethnography of the region and most large game was hunted out before whites ever fully explored the land Still afterward the Iroquois Confederacy offered shelter to refugees of the Mascouten Erie Chonnonton Tutelo Saponi and Tuscarora nations The Tuscarora became the sixth nation of the Iroquois br In the s Iroquoian peoples would take in the remaining Susquehannock of Pennsylvania after they were decimated in the French and Indian War Most of these other groups assimilated and eventually ceased to exist as separate tribes Then after the American Revolution a large group of Seneca split off and returned to Ohio becoming known as the Mingo Seneca The current Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy include the Seneca Cayuga Onondaga Oneida Tuscarora and Mohawk The Iroquois fought for both sides during the Revolutionary War afterwards many pro British Iroquois migrated to Canada Today the Iroquois still live in several enclaves across New York and Ontario br Meanwhile the Lenape formed a close relationship with William Penn However upon Penn s death his sons managed to take over much of their lands and banish them to Ohio When the U S drafted the Indian Removal Act the Lenape were further moved to Missouri whereas their cousins the Mohicans were sent to Wisconsin br Also in the United States relocated the Nanticoke from the Delmarva Peninsula to the former Iroquois lands south of Lake Ontario though they did not stay long Mostly they chose to migrate into Canada and merge with the Iroquois although some moved west and merged with the Lenape br br In Giovanni da Verrazzano an Italian explorer in the service of the French crown explored the Atlantic coast of North America between the Carolinas and Newfoundland including New York Harbor and Narragansett Bay On April Verrazzano entered New York Bay by way of the strait now called the Narrows into the northern bay which he named Santa Margherita in honor of the King of France s sister Verrazzano described it as a vast coastline with a deep delta in which every kind of ship could pass and he adds that it extends inland for a league and opens up to form a beautiful lake This vast sheet of water swarmed with native boats He landed on the tip of Manhattan and possibly on the furthest point of Long Island Verrazzano s stay was interrupted by a storm which pushed him north towards Martha s Vineyard br In French traders from New France built a chateau on Castle Island within present day Albany it was abandoned the following year due to flooding In the Dutch under the command of Hendrick Corstiaensen rebuilt the French chateau which they called Fort Nassau Fort Nassau was the first Dutch settlement in North America and was located along the Hudson River also within present day Albany The small fort served as a trading post and warehouse Located on the Hudson River flood plain the rudimentary fort was washed away by flooding in and abandoned for good after Fort Orange New Netherland was built nearby in br br Henry Hudson s voyage marked the beginning of European involvement in the area Sailing for the Dutch East India Company and looking for a passage to Asia he entered the Upper New York Bay on September of that year Word of his findings encouraged Dutch merchants to explore the coast in search of profitable fur trading with local Native American tribes br During the th century Dutch trading posts established for the trade of pelts from the Lenape Iroquois and other tribes were founded in the colony of New Netherland The first of these trading posts were Fort Nassau near present day Albany Fort Orange on the Hudson River just south of the current city of Albany and created to replace Fort Nassau developing into settlement Beverwijck and into what became Albany Fort Amsterdam to develop into the town New Amsterdam which is present day New York City and Esopus now Kingston The success of the patroonship of Rensselaerswyck which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid th century was also a key factor in the early success of the colony The English captured the colony during the Second Anglo Dutch War and governed it as the Province of New York The city of New York was recaptured by the Dutch in during the Third Anglo Dutch War and renamed New Orange It was returned to the English under the terms of the Treaty of Westminster a year later br br The Sons of Liberty were organized in New York City during the s largely in response to the oppressive Stamp Act passed by the British Parliament in The Stamp Act Congress met in the city on October of that year composed of representatives from across the Thirteen Colonies who set the stage for the Continental Congress to follow The Stamp Act Congress resulted in the Declaration of Rights and Grievances which was the first written expression by representatives of the Americans of many of the rights and complaints later expressed in the United States Declaration of Independence This included the right to representative government At the same time given strong commercial personal and sentimental links to Britain many New York residents were Loyalists The Capture of Fort Ticonderoga provided the cannon and gunpowder necessary to force a British withdrawal from the siege of Boston in br New York was the only colony not to vote for independence as the delegates were not authorized to do so New York then endorsed the Declaration of Independence on July The New York State Constitution was framed by a convention which assembled at White Plains on July and after repeated adjournments and changes of location finished its work at Kingston on Sunday evening April when the new constitution drafted by John Jay was adopted with but one dissenting vote It was not submitted to the people for ratification On July George Clinton was inaugurated as the first Governor of New York at Kingston br Approximately a third of the battles of the American Revolutionary War took place in New York the first major one and largest of the entire war was the Battle of Long Island also known as the Battle of Brooklyn in August After their victory the British occupied present day New York City making it their military and political base of operations in North America for the duration of the conflict and consequently the focus of General George Washington s intelligence network On the notorious British prison ships of Wallabout Bay more American combatants died than were killed in combat in every battle of the war combined Both sides of combatants lost more soldiers to disease than to outright wounds The first of two major British armies were captured by the Continental Army at the Battle of Saratoga in a success that influenced France to ally with the revolutionaries the state constitution was enacted in New York became the th state to ratify the United States Constitution on July br In an attempt to retain their sovereignty and remain an independent nation positioned between the new United States and British North America four of the Iroquois Nations fought on the side of the British only the Oneida and their dependents the Tuscarora allied themselves with the Americans In retaliation for attacks on the frontier led by Joseph Brant and Loyalist Mohawk forces the Sullivan Expedition of destroyed nearly Iroquois villages adjacent croplands and winter stores forcing many refugees to British held Niagara br As allies of the British the Iroquois were forced out of New York although they had not been part of treaty negotiations They resettled in Canada after the war and were given land grants by the Crown In the treaty settlement the British ceded most Indian lands to the new United States Because New York made a treaty with the Iroquois without getting Congressional approval some of the land purchases have been subject to land claim suits since the late th century by the federally recognized tribes New York put up more than million acres km of former Iroquois territory for sale in the years after the Revolutionary War leading to rapid development in Upstate New York As per the Treaty of Paris the last vestige of British authority in the former Thirteen Colonies their troops in New York City departed in which was long afterward celebrated as Evacuation Day br br New York City was the national capital under the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union the first national government That organization was found to be inadequate and prominent New Yorker Alexander Hamilton advocated for a new government that would include an executive national courts and the power to tax Hamilton led the Annapolis Convention that called for the Philadelphia Convention which drafted the United States Constitution in which he also took part The new government was to be a strong federal national government to replace the relatively weaker confederation of individual states Following heated debate which included the publication of The Federalist Papers as a series of installments in New York City newspapers New York was the th state to ratify the United States Constitution on July br New York City remained the national capital under the new constitution until when it was moved to Philadelphia until when it was relocated to its current location in Washington D C and was the site of the inauguration of President George Washington In the first session of the Supreme Court of the United States the United States Bill of Rights were drafted br br Transportation in Western New York was by expensive wagons on muddy roads before canals opened up the rich farmlands to long distance traffic Governor DeWitt Clinton promoted the Erie Canal which connected New York City to the Great Lakes by the Hudson River the new canal and the rivers and lakes Work commenced in and the Erie Canal opened eight years later in Packet boats pulled by horses on tow paths traveled slowly over the canal carrying passengers and freight Farm products came in from the Midwest and finished manufactured goods moved west It was an engineering marvel which opened up vast areas of New York to commerce and settlement It enabled Great Lakes port cities such as Buffalo and Rochester to grow and prosper It also connected the burgeoning agricultural production of the Midwest and shipping on the Great Lakes with the port of New York City Improving transportation it enabled additional population migration to territories west of New York After railroads largely replaced the canal br The connectivity offered by the canal and subsequently the railroads led to an economic boom across the entire state through the s Major corporations that got their start in New York during this time include American Express AT T Bristol Myers Squibb Carrier Chase General Electric Goldman Sachs IBM Kodak Macy s NBC Pfizer Random House RCA Tiffany Co Wells Fargo Western Union and Xerox br New York City was a major ocean port and had extensive traffic importing cotton from the South and exporting manufacturing goods Nearly half of the state s exports were related to cotton Southern cotton factors planters and bankers visited so often that they had favorite hotels At the same time activism for abolitionism was strong upstate where some communities provided stops on the Underground Railroad Upstate and New York City gave strong support for the American Civil War in terms of finances volunteer soldiers and supplies The state provided more than soldiers to the Union armies Over New Yorkers died in service roughly one of every seven who served However Irish draft riots in were a significant embarrassment br br Since the early th century New York City has been the largest port of entry for legal immigration into the United States In the United States the federal government did not assume direct jurisdiction for immigration until Prior to this time the matter was delegated to the individual states then via contract between the states and the federal government Most immigrants to New York would disembark at the bustling docks along the Hudson and East Rivers in the eventual Lower Manhattan On May the New York State Legislature created the Board of Commissioners of Immigration to regulate immigration br The first permanent immigration depot in New York was established in at Castle Garden a converted War of era fort located within what is now Battery Park at the tip of Lower Manhattan The first immigrants to arrive at the new depot were aboard three ships that had just been released from quarantine Castle Garden served as New York s immigrant depot until it closed on April when the federal government assumed control over immigration During that period more than eight million immigrants passed through its doors two of every three U S immigrants br When the federal government assumed control it established the Bureau of Immigration which chose the three acre ha Ellis Island in Upper New York Harbor for an entry depot Already federally controlled the island had served as an ammunition depot It was chosen due its relative isolation with proximity to New York City and the rail lines of Jersey City New Jersey via a short ferry ride While the island was being developed and expanded via land reclamation the federal government operated a temporary depot at the Barge Office at the Battery br Ellis Island opened on January and operated as a central immigration center until the National Origins Act was passed in reducing immigration After that date the only immigrants to pass through were displaced persons or war refugees The island ceased all immigration processing on November when the last person detained on the island Norwegian seaman Arne Peterssen was released He had overstayed his shore leave and left on the a m Manhattan bound ferry to return to his ship br More than million immigrants passed through Ellis Island between and More than million Americans across the United States can trace their ancestry to these immigrants Ellis Island was the subject of a contentious and long running border and jurisdictional dispute between the State of New York and the State of New Jersey as both claimed it The issue was officially settled in by the U S Supreme Court which ruled that the original acre ha island was New York state territory and that the balance of the acres ha added after by landfill was in New Jersey In May Ellis Island was added to the National Park Service by President Lyndon B Johnson and is still owned by the federal government as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument In Ellis Island was opened to the public as a museum of immigration br br On September two of four hijacked planes were flown into the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan and the towers collapsed World Trade Center also collapsed due to damage from fires The other buildings of the World Trade Center complex were damaged beyond repair and demolished soon thereafter The collapse of the Twin Towers caused extensive damage and resulted in the deaths of victims including aboard the two planes Since September most of Lower Manhattan has been restored In the years since over rescue workers and residents of the area have developed several life threatening illnesses and some have died br A memorial at the site the National September Memorial Museum was opened to the public on September A permanent museum later opened at the site on March Upon its completion in the new One World Trade Center became the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere at feet m meant to symbolize the year America gained its independence From to World Trade Center World Trade Center World Trade Center the World Trade Center Transportation Hub Liberty Park and Fiterman Hall were completed St Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and Ronald O Perelman Performing Arts Center are under construction at the World Trade Center site br br On October and Hurricane Sandy caused extensive destruction of the state s shorelines ravaging portions of New York City Long Island and southern Westchester with record high storm surge with severe flooding and high winds causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers and leading to gasoline shortages and disruption of mass transit systems The storm and its profound effects have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of New York City and Long Island to minimize the risk from another such future event Such risk is considered highly probable due to global warming and rising sea levels br br On March New York had its first confirmed case of COVID after Washington state two months prior Since March New York had the highest number of confirmed cases of any state in the United States which is outpaced the state as of February Nearly percent of known national cases were in the state as of March with one third of total known U S cases being in New York City br From May Western New York and the Capital Region entered Phase of reopening On May the Hudson Valley began Phase and New York City partially reopened on June br During July a federal judge ruled Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de

Adirondack High Peaks in Northern New York at feet meters above sea level while the state s lowest point is at sea level on the Atlantic Ocean in Downstate New York br In contrast with New York City s urban landscape the vast majority of the state s geographic area is dominated by meadows forests rivers farms mountains and lakes Most of the southern part of the state rests on the Allegheny Plateau which extends from the southeastern United States to the Catskill Mountains the section in the State of New York is known as the Southern Tier The rugged Adirondack Mountains with vast tracts of wilderness lie west of the Lake Champlain Valley The Great Appalachian Valley dominates eastern New York and contains Lake Champlain Valley as its northern half and the Hudson Valley as its southern half within the state The Tug Hill region arises as a cuesta east of Lake Ontario The state of New York contains a part of the Marcellus shale which extends into Ohio and Pennsylvania br Upstate and Downstate are often used informally to distinguish New York City or its greater metropolitan area from the rest of the State of New York The placement of a boundary between the two is a matter of great contention Unofficial and loosely defined regions of Upstate New York include from the Southern Tier which includes many of the counties along the border with Pennsylvania to the North Country region above or sometimes including parts of the Adirondack region br br Among the total area of New York state consists of water Much of New York s boundaries are in water as is true for New York City four of its five boroughs are situated on three islands at the mouth of the Hudson River Manhattan Island Staten Island and Long Island which contains Brooklyn and Queens at its western end The

Lakes George or Champlain Lake George empties at its north end into Lake Champlain whose northern end extends into Canada where it drains into the Richelieu River and then ultimately the Saint Lawrence River The western section of the state is drained by the Allegheny River and rivers of the Susquehanna and Delaware River systems Niagara Falls is shared between New York and Ontario as it flows on the Niagara River from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario The Delaware River Basin Compact signed in by New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Delaware and the federal government regulates the utilization of water of the Delaware system br br Under the K ppen climate classification most of New York has a humid continental climate though New York City and Long Island have a humid subtropical climate Weather in New York is heavily influenced by two continental air masses a warm humid one from the southwest and a cold dry one from the northwest Downstate New York comprising New York City Long Island and lower portions of the Hudson Valley have rather hot summers with some periods of high humidity and cold damp winters which are relatively mild compared to temperatures in Upstate New York due to the downstate region s lower elevation proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and relatively lower latitude br Upstate New York experiences warm summers marred by only occasional brief intervals of sultry conditions with long and cold winters Western New York particularly the Tug Hill region receives heavy lake effect snows especially during the earlier portions of winter before the surface of Lake Ontario itself is covered by ice The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks Catskills and at higher elevations of the Southern Tier Buffalo and its metropolitan area are described as climate change havens for their weather pattern in Western New York br Summer daytime temperatures range from the high s to low s F to C over most of the state In the majority of winter seasons a temperature of F C or lower can be expected in the northern highlands Northern Plateau and F C or colder in the southwestern and east central highlands of the Southern Tier New York had a record high temperature of F C on July in the Albany area Its record lowest temperature during the winter was F C in Governors Island Manhattan in New York Harbor is planned to host a US billion research and education center poised to make New York the global leader in addressing the climate crisis br br Due to New York s relatively large land area and unique geography compared to other eastern states there are several distinct ecoregions present in the state many of them reduced heavily due to urbanization and other human activities Southern Great Lakes forests in Western New York New England Acadian forests on the New England border Northeastern coastal forests in the lower Hudson Valley and western Long Island Atlantic coastal pine barrens in southern Long Island Northeastern interior dry mesic oak forest in

making the state of New York home to a rich array of marine life including shellfish such as oysters and clams as well as fish microorganisms and sea birds br br Due to its long history New York has several overlapping and often conflicting definitions of regions within the state The regions are also not fully definable due to the colloquial use of regional labels The New York State Department of Economic Development provides two distinct definitions of these regions It divides the state into ten economic regions which approximately correspond to terminology used by residents br br The department also groups the counties into eleven regions for tourism purposes br br New York has many state parks and two major forest preserves Niagara Falls State Park established in is the oldest
