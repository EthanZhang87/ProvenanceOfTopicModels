USA Today often stylized in all caps is an American daily middle market newspaper and news broadcasting company Founded by Al Neuharth in and launched on September the newspaper operates from Gannett s corporate headquarters in Tysons Virginia Its newspaper is printed at sites across the United States and at five additional sites internationally The paper s dynamic design influenced the style of local regional and national newspapers worldwide through its use of concise reports colorized images informational graphics and inclusion of popular culture stories among other distinct features br With an average print circulation of as of a digital only subscriber base of as of and an approximate daily readership of million USA Today has the fourth largest circulation of any newspaper in the United States It has been shown to maintain a generally center left audience in regards to political persuasion USA Today is distributed in all states Washington D C and Puerto Rico and an international edition is distributed in Asia Canada Europe and the Pacific Islands br br br History br USA Today was first conceived on February when a company task force known as Project NN met with the then chairman of Gannett Al Neuharth in Cocoa Beach Florida Early regional prototypes of USA Today included East Bay Today an Oakland California based publication published in the late s to serve as the morning edition of the Oakland Tribune an afternoon newspaper that Gannett owned at the time On June Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication The two proposed design layouts were mailed to newsmakers and prominent leaders in journalism for review and feedback Gannett s board of directors approved the launch of the national newspaper titled USA Today on December At launch Neuharth was appointed president and publisher of the newspaper adding those responsibilities to his existing position as Gannett s chief executive officer br Gannett announced the launch of the paper on April USA Today began publishing on September initially in the Baltimore and Washington D C metropolitan areas for a newsstand price of equivalent to in After selling out the first issue Gannett gradually expanded the national distribution of the paper reaching an estimated circulation of copies by the end of double the amount of sales that Gannett projected br br The design uniquely incorporated color graphics and photographs Initially only its front news section pages were rendered in four color while the remaining pages were printed in a spot color format The paper s overall style and elevated use of graphics developed by Neuharth in collaboration with staff graphics designers George Rorick Sam Ward Suzy Parker John Sherlock and Web Brya were derided by critics who referred to it as a McPaper or television you can wrap fish in because it opted to incorporate concise nuggets of information more akin to the style of television news rather than in depth stories like traditional newspapers which many in the newspaper industry considered to be a dumbing down of content Although USA Today had been profitable for just ten years as of it changed the appearance and feel of newspapers around the world br Gannett invested in an expensive network of printing factories and distribution during the rollout of USA Today meaning that the paper could be printed and distributed quickly One of the results of this was USA Today having the luxury of a later time cutoff for journalists to submit stories such that the paper was able to include sports scores from games that finished late in the next morning s paper The sports section of USA Today with its complete set of results was well regarded and generally seen as one of the main selling points of the paper br On July the newspaper switched from predominantly black and white to full color photography and graphics in all four sections The following week on July USA Today launched an international edition intended for U S readers abroad followed four months later on October with the rollout of the first transmission via satellite of its international version to Singapore On April the paper published its first special bonus section a page section called Baseball which previewed the Major League Baseball season br By the fourth quarter of USA Today had become the second largest newspaper in the United States reaching a daily circulation of million copies Total daily readership of the paper by according to Simmons Market Research Bureau statistics had reached million the largest of any daily newspaper in the U S On May USA Today began production of its international edition in Switzerland USA Today operated at a loss for most of its first four years of operation accumulating a total deficit of million after taxes According to figures released by Gannett in July the newspaper began turning its first profit in May six months ahead of Gannett s corporate revenue projections br On January USA Today published the largest edition in its history a page weekend edition featuring a section previewing Super Bowl XXII the edition included pages of advertising and sold copies setting a single day record for an American newspaper and surpassed seven months later on September when its Labor Day weekend edition sold copies On April USA Today launched a third international printing site based in Hong Kong The international edition set circulation and advertising records during August with coverage of the Summer Olympics selling more than copies and pages of advertising br By July Simmons Market Research Bureau estimated that USA Today had a total daily readership of nearly million an all time high and the largest readership of any daily newspaper in the United States On September USA Today launched a fourth printsite for its international edition in London for the United Kingdom and the British Isles The international edition s schedule was changed as of April to Monday through Friday rather than from Tuesday through Saturday in order to accommodate business travelers on February USA Today opened its first editorial bureau outside the United States at its Hong Kong publishing facility additional editorial bureaus were launched in London and Moscow in br On April USA Today launched its website to provide real time news coverage in June the site expanded to

throughout most of Europe br On October USA Today began running advertisements on its front page for the first time In some pages of USA Today s website features Auto Play functionality for video or audio aided stories br On February Gannett launched USA Today Live a broadcast and Internet initiative designed to provide coverage from the newspaper to broadcast television stations nationwide for use in their local newscasts and their websites the venture also provided integration with the USA Today website which transitioned from a text based format to feature audio and video clips of news content br The paper launched a sixth printing site for its international edition on May in Milan Italy followed on July by the launch of an international printing facility in Charleroi Belgium br In two interactive units were launched on June USA Today and Gannett Newspapers launched the USA Today Careers Network now Careers com a website featuring localized employment listings then on July the USA Today News Center was launched as an interactive television news service developed through a joint venture with the On Command Corporation that was distributed to hotels around the United States On September of that year the newspaper set an all time single day circulation record selling copies for its edition covering the September attacks That November USA Today migrated its operations from Gannett s previous corporate headquarters in Arlington Virginia to the company s new headquarters in nearby McLean br In Jack Kelley a senior foreign correspondent for USA Today was found to have fabricated foreign news reports over the past decade Kelley resigned br On December Gannett announced that it would combine the separate newsroom operations of the online and print entities of USA Today with USAToday com s vice president and editor in chief Kinsey Wilson promoted to co executive editor alongside existing executive editor John Hillkirk br In December USA Today launched the USA Today API for sharing data with partners of all types br br br Newsroom restructuring and graphical tweaks br On August USA Today announced that it would undergo a reorganization of its newsroom announcing the layoffs of staffers It also announced that the paper would shift its focus away from print and place more emphasis on its digital platforms including USAToday com and its related mobile applications and launch of a new publication called USA Today Sports br On January to reverse a revenue slide the paper introduced a tweaked format that modified the appearance of its front section pages which included a larger logo at the top of each page coloring tweaks to section front pages a new sans serif font called Prelo for certain headlines of main stories replacing the Gulliver typeface that had been implemented for story headers in April an updated Newsline feature featuring larger newsier headline entry points and the increasing and decreasing of mastheads and white space to present a cleaner style br br br redesign br br On September USA Today underwent the first major redesign in its history in commemoration for the th anniversary of the paper s first edition Developed in conjunction with brand design firm Wolff Olins the print edition of USA Today added a page covering technology stories expanded travel coverage within the Life section and increased the number of color pages included in each edition while retaining longtime elements The globe logo used since the paper s inception was replaced with a new logo featuring a large circle rendered in colors corresponding to each of the sections serving as an infographic that changes with news stories containing images representing that day s top stories br The paper s website was also extensively overhauled using a new in house content management system known as Presto and a design created by Fantasy Interactive that incorporates flipboard style navigation to switch between individual stories which obscure most of the main and section pages clickable video advertising and a responsive design layout The site was designed and developed to be more interactive faster provide high impact advertising units known as Gravity and provide the ability for Gannett to syndicate USA Today content to the websites of its local properties and vice versa To accomplish this goal Gannett Digital migrated its newspaper and television station websites to the Presto platform Developers built a separate platform to provide optimizations for mobile and touchscreen devices The Gravity ad won Digiday s Best Publishing Innovation in Advertising in thanks to an full watch user engagement rate on desktop and on mobile br Following the relaunch the editorial team behind USA Today Investigations ramped up its longread article plans following the success of the series Ghost Factories With differing platform requirements USA Today s mobile website did not offer any specialized support for these multi chapter stories Nearing the end of more than one third of USA Today s readership was browsing only using their mobile phones and the majority of these users were accessing the mobile website as opposed to the iOS and Android applications with the newer less obtrusive advertising strategy Gannet Digital designed developed and released the longread mobile experience to coincide with the launch of Brad Heath s series Locked Up which won the Investigative Reporters and Editors Tom Renner Award in October br Gannett Digital s focus on its mobile content experience paid off in with multiple awards including the Eppy for Best Mobile Application the Mobile Excellence award for Best User Experience the MOBI award for Editorial Content and Mobile Publisher of the Year br The USA Today site design was launched on desktop mobile and TV throughout and although archive content accessible through search engines remains available through the pre relaunch design br br br Mid s expansion and restructuring br On October Gannett test launched a condensed daily edition of USA Today part of what was internally known within Gannett as the Butterfly initiative for distribution as an insert in four of its newspapers The Indianapolis Star the Rochester Democrat Chronicle the Fort Myers based The News Press and the Appleton Wisconsin based The Post Crescent The launch of the syndicated insert caused USA Today to restructure its operations to allow seven day a week production to accommodate the packaging of its national and international news content and enterprise stories comprising about pages for the weekday and Saturday editions and up to pages for the Sunday edition into the pilot insert Gannett later announced on December that it would formally launch the condensed daily edition of USA Today in additional local newspapers nationwide through April with the Palm Springs California based The Desert Sun and the Lafayette Louisiana based Advertiser being the first newspapers outside of the pilot program participants to add the supplement on December citing positive feedback to the feature from readers and advertisers of the initial four papers Gannett was given permission from the Alliance for Audited Media to count the circulation figures from the syndicated local insert with the total circulation count for the flagship national edition of USA Today br On January USA Today acquired the consumer product review website Reviewed In the first quarter of Gannett launched a condensed USA Today insert into other newspapers in its network thereby increasing the number of inserts to in an effort to shore up circulation after it regained its position as the highest circulated weekday newspaper in the United States in October On September USA Today announced that it would lay off roughly employees in a restructuring of its newsroom and business operations In October USA Today and OpenWager Inc entered into a partnership to release a Bingo mobile app called USA Today Bingo Cruise br On December Gannett formally launched the USA Today Network a national digital newsgathering service providing shared content between USA Today and the company s local newspapers throughout the United States as well as pooling advertising services on both a hyperlocal and national scale The Courier Journal had earlier soft launched the service as part of a pilot program started on November coinciding with an imaging rebrand for the Louisville Kentucky based newspaper Gannett s other local newspaper properties as well as those it acquired through its merger with the Journal Media Group gradually began identifying themselves as part of the USA Today Network foregoing use of the Gannett name outside of requisite ownership references through early January br In the late s as the print run declined Gannett pulled back from the extensive and expensive distribution network opting to have shorter deadlines and printing the remaining copies from fewer facilities while potentially trucking them longer distances to still be available in the morning br In May USA Today introduced a paywall for some of its online stories br On June it was reported that USA Today removed articles written by journalist Gabriela Miranda after an inquiry related to one of her articles triggered an internal investigation and found that Miranda had fabricated sources on articles pertaining to the Texas Heartbeat Act Ukrainian women s issues due to the Russian invasion and an article on sunscreen Miranda resigned br br br Layout and format br br USA Today is known for news in compact easy to read and comprehend stories In the main edition circulated in the United States and Canada each edition consists of four sections News the front page section Money Sports and Life Since March the Friday edition of Life has been split into two sections the regular Life focusing on entertainment subtitled Weekend section E which features television reviews and listings a DVD column film reviews and trends and a travel supplement called Destinations Diversions section D The international edition of the paper features two sections News and Money in one and Sports and Life in the other br Atypical of most daily newspapers the paper does not print on Saturdays and Sundays the Friday edition serves as the weekend edition USA Today has published special Saturday and Sunday editions in the past the first issue released during the standard calendar weekend was published on January when it released a Saturday Extra edition updating coverage of the Gulf War from the previous day the paper published special seven day a week editions for the first time on July when it published special editions for exclusive distribution in the host city of Atlanta and surrounding areas for the two week duration of the Summer Olympics USA Today prints each complete story on the front page of the respective section with the exception of the cover story The cover story is a longer story that requires a jump readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the story usually the next page of that section On certain days the news or sports section will take up two paper sections and there will be a second cover story within the second section br Each section is differentiated by a certain color in a box on the top left corner of the first page the principal section colors are blue for News section A green for Money section B red for Sports section C and purple for Life section D in the paper s early years the Life and Money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot colors as the presses used at USA Today s printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections Orange is used for bonus sections sections E which are published occasionally for business travel trends and the Olympics Other bonus sections for sports such as for the PGA Tour preview NCAA basketball tournaments Memorial Day auto races Indianapolis and Coca Cola NFL opening weekend and the Super Bowl previously used the orange color but later changed to the regular sports red in their sports bonus sections To strengthen their association with USA Today Gannett incorporated the USA Today color scheme into a standardized broadcast graphics package that was phased in across its television station group which was spun off in July into the separate broadcast and digital media company Tegna starting in late The package used the color scheme in a rundown graphic on most stations persisting throughout their newscasts as well as bumpers for individual story topics br In many ways USA Today breaks the traditional newspaper layout Some examples of its divergence from tradition include using the left hand quarter of each section as reefers front page paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages sometimes using sentence length blurbs to describe stories inside The lead reefer is the cover page feature Newsline which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections As a national newspaper USA Today cannot focus on the weather for any one city Therefore the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps of the continental United States Puerto Rico and the U S Virgin Islands as well as temperature lists for many cities throughout the U S and the world Temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one or two letter code such as t for thunderstorms referencing the expected weather conditions The colorized forecast map was created by staff designer George Rorick who left USA Today for a similar position at The Detroit News in and was copied by newspapers around the world breaking from the traditional style of monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges National precipitation maps for the next three days the next five days before the redesign and four day forecasts and air quality indexes for major U S cities cities prior to with individual cities color coded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given area on the forecast map are also featured Weather data is provided by AccuWeather which has served as the forecast provider for USA Today for most of the paper s existence except from January to September when forecast data was provided by The Weather Channel through a long term multimedia content agreement with Gannett In the bottom left hand corner of the weather page is Weather Focus a graphic which explains various meteorological phenomena On some days the Weather Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event br On business holidays or days when bonus sections are included in the issue the Money and Life sections are usually combined into one section while combinations of the Friday Life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks Advertising is often covered in the Monday Money section with a review of a recent television ad and after Super Bowl Sunday a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the Ad Track live survey Stock tables for individual stock exchanges comprising one subsection for companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange and another for companies trading on NASDAQ and the American Stock Exchange and mutual indexes were discontinued with the redesign due to the myriad electronic ways to check individual stock prices in line with most newspapers br Book coverage including reviews and a national sales chart which debuted on October is seen on Thursdays in Life with the full A C Nielsen television ratings chart printed on Wednesdays or Thursdays depending on release The paper also publishes the Mediabase survey for several genres of music based on radio airplay on Tuesdays along with their own chart of the top ten singles in general on Wednesdays Because of the same limitations as its nationalized forecasts the television page in Life which provides prime time and late night listings running from p m to a m Eastern Time incorporates boilerplate Local news or Local programming descriptions to denote time periods in which the five major English language broadcast networks ABC NBC CBS Fox and The CW cede airtime to allow their owned and affiliated stations to carry syndicated programs or local newscasts The television page has never carried local scheduling information similar to those in local newspapers Like most national papers USA Today has no comic strips br br One of the staples of the News section is Across the USA a state by state roundup of headlines The summaries consist of paragraph length Associated Press reports highlighting one story in each state the District of Columbia and one U S territory Similarly the For the Record page of the Sports section which features sports scores for the previous four days of league play plus individual non league events seasonal league statistics and wagering lines for that day s games previously featured a rundown of winning numbers from the previous deadline date for all participating state lotteries and individual multi state lotteries br Some traditions have been retained The lead story still appears on the upper right side of the front page Commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the News section Stock and mutual fund data are presented in the Money section But USA Today is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight even in a mix of other newspapers such as at a newsstand The overall design and layout of USA Today have been described as neo Victorian br On most of the sections front pages in the lower left hand corner are USA Today Snapshots graphs which offer statistics on lifestyle interests according to the section for example a snapshot in Life could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon their mood These Snapshots graphs employ icons roughly pertaining to the graph s subject using the example above the graph s bars could be made up of several TV sets or ended by one Snapshots are loosely based on research by a national institute with the credited source in fine print below the graph br The newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called Open Air which launched on March and appears several times a year Other advertorials appear throughout the year mainly on Fridays br br br Opinion section br The opinion section prints USA Today editorials columns by guest writers and members of the editorial board of contributors letters to the editor and editorial cartoons One unique feature of the USA Today editorial page is the publication of opposing points of view alongside the editorial board s piece on the day s topic runs an opposing view by a guest writer often an expert in the field The Board of Contributors which is distinct from the paper s news staff chooses the opinion pieces that appear in each edition br From to and again from to the editorial page editor was Brian Gallagher who has worked for the newspaper since its founding Other members of the editorial board included deputy editorial page editor Bill Sternberg executive forum editor John Siniff op ed forum page editor Glen Nishimura operations editor Thuan Le Elston letters editor Michelle Poblete web content editor Eileen Rivers and editorial writers Dan Carney George Hager and Saundra Torry The newspaper s website calls this group demographically and ideologically diverse br Beginning with the United States presidential election USA Today did not endorse candidates for the President of the United States or any other state or federal political office a policy which has been re evaluated during each four year election cycle by the paper s Board of Contributors through an independent process with any decision to override the policy based on a consensus vote in which fewer than two of the editorial board s members dissent or hold differing opinions For most of its history the paper s political editorials most of them linked to the presidential election cycle had focused instead on major issues based on the differing concerns of voters the vast array of information on these themes and the board s aim to offer a fair viewpoint through the diverse political ideologies of its members and avoid reader perceptions of bias br The avoidance of political editorials played a great part in USA Today s long standing reputation for fluff but after its th anniversary revamp the paper took a more active stance on political issues calling for stronger gun laws after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in It heavily criticized the Republican Party for both the government shutdown and the revolts in the United States House of Representatives that ended with the resignation of John Boehner as House Speaker It also called out then President Barack Obama and other top members of the Democratic Party for what it perceived as inaction during particularly over the NSA scandal and the ISIL beheading incidents br The editorial board broke from its non endorsement policy for the first time on September when it published an op ed piece condemning the candidacy of Republican nominee Donald Trump calling him unfit for the presidency due to his inflammatory campaign rhetoric particularly that aimed at the press with certain media organizations being openly targeted and even banned from campaign rallies including The New York Times The Washington Post CNN and the BBC military veterans who had been prisoners of war including Republican presidential candidate and Vietnam War veteran John McCain immigrants and various ethnic and religious groups his temperament and lack of financial transparency his checkered business record his use of false and hyperbolic statements the inconsistency of his viewpoints and issues with his vision on domestic and foreign policy and based on comments he had made during his campaign and criticisms by both Democrats and Republicans on these views the potential risks to national security and constitutional ethics under a Trump administration asking voters to resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue The board wrote that the piece was not a qualified endorsement of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for whom it was unable to reach a consensus some editorial board members expressed that Clinton s public service record would help her serve the nation ably as its president while others had serious reservations about her sense of entitlement lack of candor and extreme carelessness in handling classified information suggesting instead tactical voting against Trump and GOP seats in swing states advising voters to decide whether to vote for either Clinton Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson Green Party nominee Jill Stein or a write in candidate for president or to focus on Senate House and other down ballot political races br In February USA Today published an op ed by Jerome Corsi the DC bureau chief for the fringe conspiracy website InfoWars Corsi a prominent conspiracy theorist was described by USA Today as an author and investigative journalist Corsi was a prominent proponent of the false conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not a US citizen and Infowars has promoted conspiracy theories such as being an inside job br In October USA Today was criticized by NBC News for publishing an editorial by President Trump that was replete with inaccuracies The Washington Post fact checker said that almost every sentence contained a misleading statement or a falsehood br In USA Today endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time Democratic nominee Joe Biden The newspaper also published an opposing editorial by Vice President Mike Pence which called for his and Trump s re election br br br Personnel br In May Larry Kramer a year media industry veteran and former president of CBS Digital Media was appointed president and publisher of USA Today replacing David Hunke who had been publisher of the newspaper since Kramer was tasked with developing a new strategy for the paper as it sought to increase revenue from its digital operations br In July Kramer hired David Callaway whom he had hired as lead editor of MarketWatch in two years after Kramer founded that website as the paper s editor in chief Callaway had previously worked at Bloomberg News covering banking investment banking and asset management businesses throughout Europe and at the Boston Herald where he co wrote a daily financial column on comings and goings in the Boston business district br The editor in chief as of February is Nicole Carroll br br br Related publications and services br br br USA Weekend br br USA Weekend was a sister publication that launched in as Family Weekly a national Sunday magazine supplement intended for the Sunday editions of U S newspapers It adopted its final title following Gannett s purchase of the magazine in The magazine was distributed to approximately newspapers nationwide at its peak with most Gannett owned local newspapers carrying it by default within their Sunday editions It focused on social issues entertainment health food and travel On December Gannett announced the end of USA Weekend after the December

but also provides news and commentary on other news topics ranging from politics to pop culture br br br USA Today The Television Show br In Gannett and producer former NBC CEO Grant Tinker began developing a news magazine series for broadcast syndication that attempted to bring the breezy style of USA Today to television The result was USA Today The Television Show later USA Today on TV then shortened to simply USA Today which premiered on September Correspondents on the program included Edie Magnus Robin Young Boyd Matson Kenneth Walker Dale Harimoto Ann Abernathy Bill Macatee and Beth Ruyak As with the newspaper the show was divided into four sections corresponding to the respective parts of the paper News the major headlines Money financial news and consumer reports Sports sports news and scores and Life entertainment and lifestyle stories The series was syndicated by GTG Marketing a subsidiary of GTG Entertainment which promoted it as a prime access magazine show hoping that stations would air it in a prime time slot br Throughout its run the series received poor reviews and low ratings The program also suffered from being scheduled in poor timeslots in certain markets like New York City the country s largest media market where CBS O O station WCBS TV channel aired the program in a pre dawn slot before it was picked up by NBC O O WNBC five months into its run After airing in the equally weak a m slot the series was moved to the more clear eyed a m but fared no better in contrast CITY DT in Toronto Ontario Canada which became the flagship of the Citytv television
