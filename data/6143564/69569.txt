In Norse mythology the Vanir Old Norse singular Vanr are a group of gods associated with fertility wisdom and the ability to see the future The Vanir are one of two groups of gods the other being the sir and are the namesake of the location Vanaheimr Old Norse Home of the Vanir After the sir Vanir War the Vanir became a subgroup of the sir Subsequently members of the Vanir are sometimes also referred to as members of the sir br The Vanir are attested in the Poetic Edda compiled in the th century from earlier traditional sources the Prose Edda and Heimskringla both written in the th century by Snorri Sturluson and in the poetry of skalds The Vanir are only attested in these Old Norse sources br All sources describe the god Nj r r and his children Freyr and Freyja as members of the Vanir A euhemerized prose account in Heimskringla adds that Nj r r s sister whose name is not provided and Kvasir were Vanir In addition Heimskringla reports a tale involving king Sveig ir s visit to Vanaheimr where he meets a woman by the name of Vana and the two produce a child named Vanlandi whose name means Man from the Land of the Vanir br While not attested as Vanir the gods Heimdall and Ullr have been theorized as potential members of the group In the Prose Edda a name listed for boars is Van child Scholars have theorized that the Vanir may be connected to small pieces of gold foil found in Scandinavia at some building sites from the Migration Period to the Viking Age and occasionally in graves They have speculated whether the Vanir originally represented pre Indo European deities or Indo European fertility gods and have theorized a form of the gods as venerated by the pagan Anglo Saxons br br Numerous theories have been proposed for the etymology of Vanir Scholar R I Page says that while there is no shortage of etymologies for the word it is tempting to link the word with Old Norse vinr friend and Latin Venus goddess of physical love Vanir is sometimes anglicized to Wanes singular Wane br br In the Poetic Edda the Vanir as a group are specifically referenced in the poems V lusp Vaf r nism l Sk rnism l rymskvi a Alv ssm l and Sigrdr fum l In V lusp a stanza describes the events of the sir Vanir War noting that during the war the Vanir broke the walls of the stronghold of the sir and that the Vanir were indomitable trampling the plain br In Vaf r nism l Gagnr r the god Odin in disguise engages in a game of wits with the j tunn Vaf r nir Gagnr r asks Vaf r nir where the Van god Nj r r came from for though he rules over many hofs and h rgrs Nj r r was not raised among the sir Vaf r nir responds that Nj r r was created in Vanaheimr home of the Vanir by wise powers and details that during the sir Vanir War Nj r r was exchanged as a hostage In addition when the world ends Ragnar k Nj r r will return to the wise Vanir br Alv ssm l consists of question and answer exchanges between the dwarf Alv ss and the god Thor In the poem Alv ss supplies terms that various groups including the Vanir use to refer to various subjects Alv ss attributes nine terms to the Vanir one for Earth The Ways Heaven The Weaver of Winds clouds Kites of the Wind calm The Hush of the Winds the sea The Wave fire Wildfire wood The Wand seed growth and ale The Foaming br The poem rymskvi a states that the god Heimdallr possesses foreknowledge as the Vanir also can Sigrdr fum l records that the Vanir are in possession of a sacred mead In the poem the valkyrie Sigrdr fa provides mystical lore about runes to the hero Sigurd Sigrdr fa notes that runes were once carved on to various creatures deities and other figures and then shaved off and mixed with a sacred mead This mead is possessed by the sir the elves mankind and the Vanir br In Sk rnism l the beautiful j tunn Ger r first encounters the god Freyr s messenger Sk rnir and asks him if he is of the elves of the sir or of the wise Vanir Sk rnir responds that he is not of any of the three groups Later in the poem Sk rnir is successful in his threats against Ger r to have Ger r accept Freyr s affections and Ger r offers Sk rnir a crystal cup full of mead noting that she never thought that she would love one of the Vanir br br The Vanir are mentioned in the Prose Edda books Gylfaginning and Sk ldskaparm l In chapter of Gylfaginning the enthroned figure of High relates that Nj r r was raised in Vanaheimr High says that during the sir Vanir War the Vanir sent Nj r r as a hostage to the sir and the sir sent to the Vanir the god H nir The sending of Nj r r as a hostage resulted in a peace agreement between the sir and the Vanir br Chapter provides information regarding the goddess Freyja including that one of her names is Dis of the Vanir In the same chapter High tells that the goddess Gn rides the horse H fvarpnir and that this horse has the ability to ride through the air and atop the sea High continues that once some Vanir saw her path as she rode through the air and that an unnamed one of these Vanir says in verse for which no source is provided br br What flies there br What fares there br or moves through the air br br Gn responds br br I fly not br though I fare br and move through the air br on Hofvarpnir br the one whom Hamskerpir got br with Gardrofa br br In chapter of Sk ldskaparm l the god Bragi explains the origin of poetry Bragi says the origin of poetry lies in the sir Vanir War During the peace conference held to end the war both the sir and the Vanir formed a truce by spitting into a vat When they left the gods decided that it shouldn t be poured out but rather kept as a symbol of their peace and so from the contents they made a man Kvasir Kvasir is later murdered by dwarves and from his blood the Mead of Poetry is made br In chapter poetic names for Nj r r are provided including descendant of Vanir or a Van As reference a poem by the th century skald r r Sj reksson is provided where Nj r r is described as a Vanr In chapter poetic names for Freyr are listed including names that reference his association with the Vanir Vanir god descendant of Vanir and a Van Freyja is also repeatedly cited as a Vanr In chapter some of Freyja s names are listed and include Van deity and Van lady and chapter provides skaldic verse referring to Freyja as Van bride In chapter names for pigs are provided including Van child a name shared with Freyr br br The Heimskringla book Ynglinga saga chapter provides an euhemerized account of the sir Vanir War As a peace agreement the two sides agreed to trade hostages The Vanir sent Nj r r and Freyr to the sir and in turn the sir sent H nir and M mir to the Vanir br Upon receiving M mir the Vanir sent the cleverest amongst them Kvasir In Vanaheimr the Vanir made H nir a chieftain However whenever H nir appeared at assemblies or meetings where the Vanir asked him his opinion on difficult issues his response was let others decide The Vanir suspected that they had been cheated by the sir in the hostage exchange and so grabbed hold of M mir cut off M mir s head and sent it to the sir br The same chapter describes that while Nj r r lived among the Vanir his wife unnamed was his sister and the couple had two children Freyr and Freyja However among the sir it was forbidden to marry so near a kin By Odin s appointment Nj r r and his son Freyr became priests over offerings of sacrifice and they were recognized as gods among the sir Freyja was priestess at the sacrifices and it was she who first taught the sir magic as was practiced among the Vanir br In chapter the king Sveig ir is recorded as having married a woman named Vana in Vanaland located in Sweden The two produced a child who they named Vanlandi Old Norse Man from the Land of the Vanir br br Small pieces of gold foil decorated with pictures of figures dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age known as gullgubber have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia in one case almost The foil pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings only rarely in graves br The figures are sometimes single occasionally an animal sometimes a man and a woman with a leafy bough between them facing or embracing one another The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are partaking in a dance and that they may have been connected with weddings and linked to the Vanir representing the notion of a divine marriage such as in the Poetic Edda poem Sk rnism l the coming together of the Vanir god Freyr and his love Ger r br br Much of the discussion among scholars on the topic of the Vanir has historically been on the question of whether the Vanir are the reflection of a purported historic meeting between different peoples in the ancient past historicists or an extension of Proto Indo European mythology where such a narrative may have existed for complex social reasons structuralists among the early Indo European peoples and thereafter spread to their descendants Notable proponents of the historicist position include Karl Helm Ernst Alfred Philippson Lotte Motz and Lotte Headegger whereas notable proponents of the structuralist view include Georges Dum zil Jan de Vries and Gabriel Turville Petre The structuralist view has generally gained the most support among academics although with caveats including among Jens Peter Schj dt Margaret Clunies Ross and Thomas DuBois br Like the Vanr goddess Freyja the Vanir as a group are not attested outside Scandinavia Traditionally following V lusp and the Prose Edda scholarship on the Vanir has focused on the sir Vanir War its possible basis in a war between peoples and whether the Vanir originated as the deities of a distinct people Some scholars have doubted that they were known outside Scandinavia however there is evidence that the god Freyr is the same god as the Germanic deity Ing reconstructed as Proto Germanic Ingwaz and that if so he is attested as having been known among the Goths br br Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes that all of the wives of the gods may have originally been members of the Vanir noting that many of them appear to have originally been children of j tnar Davidson additionally notes that it is the Vanir and Odin who seem to receive the most hostile treatment in Christian stories about mythological personages br Joseph S Hopkins and Haukur orgeirsson building on suggestions by archaeologist Ole Crumlin Pedersen and others link the Vanir to ship burial customs among the North Germanic peoples proposing an early Germanic model of a ship in a field of the dead that may be represented both by Freyja s afterlife field F lkvangr and by the Old English Neorxnawang the mysterious first element of which may be linked to the name of Freyja s father Nj r r br Richard North theorizes that glossing Latin vanitates vanities idols for gods in Old English sources implies the existence of uuani a reconstructed cognate to Old Norse Vanir in Deiran dialect and hence that the gods that Edwin of Northumbria and the northern Angles worshiped in pre Christian Anglo Saxon England were likely to have been the uuani He comments that they likely shared not only the name but also the orgiastic character of the Old Icelandic Vanir br Alaric Hall has equated the Vanir with the elves br br In a piece building on an earlier proposal by Lotte Motz Rudolf Simek argues that vanir was originally nothing more than a general term for deities like sir and that its employment as a name for a distinct group of deities was an invention of Snorri whom he identifies as the author of the Prose Edda According to Simek the Vanir are therefore a figment of imagination from the th to th centuries Simek states that he believe s that these are not mistakes that we are dealing with here but a deliberate invention on the part of Snorri br Simek s argument receive some level of support from Frog and Jonathan Roper who analyze the small corpus of poetic usages of Vanir The authors suggest that this implies that vanir was a suspended archaism used as a metrical alternative to sir but with the caveat that These observations should not however be considered to present a solution to the riddle of vanir In a collection of papers in honor of Simek Frog states support for Simek s proposal br However Simek s proposal has been rejected by several scholars including Clive Tolley Leszek P S upecki Jens Peter Schj dt and Terry Gunnell Tolley argues that the term must have originated in historical usage and that it is something of a misrepresentation of the evidence to suggest that Snorri is the main source for the vanir Tolley continues br br the evidence affords opportunity to interpret the vanir as a class of beings with a cohesive functionality as I have attempted to show In turn since this functionality can be shown to mirror concerns with a widespread occurrence within comparative religious studies there is good reason for maintaining the importance of the vanir as a discrete group of divine beings I would even venture to suggest that far from being minor characters in the Norse pantheon as Simek and others believe the vanir are likely to have been involved in the most intimate and central aspects of human existence as my analysis of their functions shows br It may well be for this very reason that Christian missionaries such as St l fr were intent upon their eradication leaving us so little information If as V lusp intimates the vanir were particularly the sweet scent the darlings of women there may have been even greater incentive for the new muscular and masculine Christianity to ensure their demise as a cult fostered by the guardians of the home would be a serious threat to the spread of the new religion br S upecki argues that the Vanir remained distinct from the sir except for Freyja and Freyr whom he follows the Prose Edda in seeing as having been born after Nj r r became a hostage among the sir and thus regards as sir and therefore that Ragnar k has no importance for their world br According to Jens Peter Schj dt br br even if the term Vanir were not in existence in pagan times it does not change substantially the fact that in pre Christian Scandinavian mythology we deal with two groups of gods who sometimes overlap whereas at other times they are clearly distinguished just as to be expected in an anthropomorphic mythology It would be wrong to look for coherence in any mythology As I have considered in more detail elsewhere what we can realistically hope to reconstruct is not a coherent mythological or theological system as this seems to be more of an ideal dream among scholars who are strongly influenced by an older sort of theology but rather a set of variants that may be part of a deep structure although with internal contradictions among the various myth complexes and various loose ends In the real world among real people such coherence is as a general rule absent br Schj dt in response to Simek s piece says br br the conclusion in relation to Simek s article would be then that even if he should be right about the Vanir we would still be better off if we had a designation for the gods we have traditionally seen as belonging to the Vanir group And perhaps Vanir then in spite of all the uncertainties that accrue to it would still be the most convenient term br Terry Gunnell proposes that the Vanir s br br recurring patterns in the narratives nonetheless imply that in the oral traditions of Norway and Iceland people seem to have viewed the religious activities connected with the Vanir with their center in Sweden as having been different in nature to those encountered elsewhere They also seem to have been envisioned closer connections between the Vanir and the landscape than existed between the sir and the natural environment br Gunnell concludes that br br this evidence lends weight to the argument that in spite of recent arguments to the contrary the religion associated with the Vanir and sir gods had a different nature and origin br br The Vanir are featured in the poem Om vanerne by Oehlenschl ger Some Germanic Neopagans refer to their beliefs as Vanatr meaning those who honor the Vanir br br Common Germanic deities br List of Germanic deities br Titan mythology
