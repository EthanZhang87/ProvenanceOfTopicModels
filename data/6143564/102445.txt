Magazine in the fall of The Sinister House of Secret Love Jan one of DC Comics line of extra length page comics specifically used the phrase a graphic novel of Gothic terror on its cover br The term graphic novel began to grow in popularity months after it appeared on the cover of the trade paperback edition though not the hardcover edition of Will Eisner s A Contract with God October This collection of short stories was a mature complex work focusing on the lives of ordinary people in the real world based on Eisner s own experiences br One scholar used graphic novels to introduce the concept of graphiation the theory that the entire personality of an artist is visible through his or her visual representation of a certain character setting event or object in a novel and can work as a means to examine and analyze drawing style br Even though Eisner s A Contract with God was published in by a smaller company Baronet Press it took Eisner over a year to find a publishing house that would allow his work to reach the mass market In its introduction Eisner cited Lynd Ward s s woodcuts as an inspiration br The critical and commercial success of A Contract with God helped to establish the term graphic novel in common usage and many sources have incorrectly credited Eisner with being the first to use it These included the Time magazine website in which said in its correction Eisner acknowledges that the term graphic novel had been coined prior to his book But he says I had not known at the time that someone had used that term before Nor does he take credit for creating the first graphic book br br One of the earliest contemporaneous applications of the term post Eisner came in when Blackmark s sequel published a year after A Contract with God though written and drawn in the early s was labeled a graphic novel on the cover of Marvel Comics black and white comics magazine Marvel Preview Winter where Blackmark The Mind Demons premiered its page contents

adaptations of literary stories or characters and one Sam Glanzman s A Sailor s Story was a true life World War II naval tale br br Cartoonist Art Spiegelman s Pulitzer Prize winning Maus helped establish both the term and the concept of graphic novels in the minds of the mainstream public Two DC Comics book reprints of self contained miniseries did likewise though they were not originally published as graphic novels Batman The Dark Knight Returns a collection of Frank Miller s four part comic book series featuring an older Batman faced with the problems of a dystopian future and Watchmen a collection of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons issue limited series in which Moore notes he set out to explore amongst other things the dynamics of power in a post Hiroshima world These works and others were reviewed in newspapers and magazines leading to increased coverage Sales of graphic novels increased with Batman The Dark Knight Returns for example lasting weeks on a UK best seller list br br br European adoption of the term br Outside North America Eisner s A Contract with God and Spiegelman s Maus led to the popularization of the expression graphic novel as well Until then most European countries used neutral descriptive terminology that referred to the form of the medium not the contents or the publishing form In Francophone Europe for example the expression bandes dessin es which literally translates as drawn strips is used while the terms stripverhaal strip story and tegneserie drawn series are used by the Dutch Flemish and Scandinavians respectively European comics studies scholars have observed that Americans originally used graphic novel for everything that deviated from their standard page comic book format meaning that all larger sized longer Franco Belgian comic albums regardless of their contents fell under the heading br Writer artist Bryan Talbot claims that the first collection of his The Adventures of Luther Arkwright published by Proutt in was the first British graphic novel br American comic critics have occasionally referred to European graphic novels as Euro comics and attempts were made in the late s to cross fertilize the American market with these works American publishers Catalan Communications and NBM Publishing released translated titles predominantly from the backlog catalogs of Casterman and Les Humano des Associ s br br br Criticism of the term br Some in the comics community have objected to the term graphic novel on the grounds that it is unnecessary or that its usage has been corrupted by commercial interests Watchmen writer Alan Moore believes br br It s a marketing term that I never had any sympathy with The term comic does just as well for me The problem is that graphic novel just came to mean expensive comic book and so what you d get is people like DC Comics or Marvel Comics because graphic novels were getting some attention they d stick six issues of whatever worthless piece of crap they happened to be publishing lately under a glossy cover and call it The She Hulk Graphic Novel br Glen Weldon author and cultural critic writes br br It s a perfect time to retire terms like graphic novel and sequential art which piggyback on the language of other wholly separate mediums What s more both terms have their roots in the need to dissemble and justify thus both exude a sense of desperation a gnawing hunger to be accepted br Author Daniel Raeburn wrote I snicker at the neologism first for its insecure pretension the literary equivalent of calling a garbage man a sanitation engineer and second because a graphic novel is in fact the very thing it is ashamed to admit a comic book rather than a comic pamphlet or comic magazine br Writer Neil Gaiman responding to a claim that he does not write comic books but graphic novels said the commenter meant it as a compliment I suppose But all of a sudden I felt like someone who d been informed that she wasn t actually a hooker that in fact she was a lady of the evening br Responding to writer Douglas Wolk s quip that the difference between a graphic novel and a comic book is the binding Bone creator Jeff Smith said I kind of like that answer Because graphic novel I don t like that name It s trying too hard It is a comic book But there is a difference And the difference is a graphic novel is a novel in the sense that there is a beginning a middle and an end The Times writer Giles Coren said To call them graphic novels is to presume that the novel is in some way higher than the karmicbwurk comic book and that only by being thought of as a sort of novel can it be understood as an art form br Some alternative cartoonists have coined their own terms for extended comics narratives The cover of Daniel Clowes Ice Haven refers to the book as a comic strip novel with Clowes having noted that he never saw anything wrong with the comic book The cover of Craig Thompson s Blankets calls it an illustrated novel br br br See also
