In Greek mythology the Minotaur MY n tor MIN tor US MIN tar oh Ancient Greek mi n tau ros in Latin as Minotaurus mi no tau r s is a mythical creature portrayed during classical antiquity with the head and tail of a bull and the body of a man p or as described by Roman poet Ovid a being part man and part bull br He dwelt at the center of the Labyrinth which was an elaborate maze like construction br designed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus upon command of King Minos of Crete The Minotaur was eventually killed by the Athenian hero Theseus br br The word Minotaur derives from the Ancient Greek a compound of the name Minos and the noun bull translated as the Bull of Minos In Crete the Minotaur was known by the name Asterion a name shared with Minos s foster father br Minotaur was originally a proper noun in reference to this mythic figure That is there was only the one Minotaur In contrast the use of minotaur as a common noun to refer to members of a generic species of bull headed creatures developed much later in th century fantasy genre fiction br The Minotaur was called evrumine in Etruscan br English pronunciation of the word Minotaur is varied The following can be found in dictionaries MY n tor noh MIN tar MIN oh MIN tor MIN oh br br After ascending the throne of the island of Crete Minos competed with his brothers as ruler Minos prayed to the sea god Poseidon to send him a snow white bull as a sign of the god s favour Minos was to sacrifice the bull to honor Poseidon but owing to the bull s beauty he decided instead to keep him Minos believed that the god would accept a substitute sacrifice To punish Minos Poseidon made Minos s wife Pasipha fall in love with the bull Pasipha had the craftsman Daedalus fashion a hollow wooden cow which she climbed into to mate with the bull She then bore Asterius the Minotaur Pasipha nursed the Minotaur but he grew in size and became ferocious As the unnatural offspring of a woman and a beast the Minotaur had no natural source of nourishment and thus devoured humans for sustenance Minos following advice from the oracle at Delphi had Daedalus construct a gigantic Labyrinth to hold the Minotaur Its location was near Minos s palace in Knossos br br The Minotaur is commonly represented in Classical art with the body of a man and the head and tail of a bull According to Sophocles s Trachiniai when the river spirit Achelous seduced Deianira one of the guises he assumed was a man with the head of a bull From classical antiquity through the Renaissance the Minotaur appears at the center of many depictions of the Labyrinth Ovid s Latin account of the Minotaur which did not describe which half was bull and which half man was the most widely available during the Middle Ages and several later versions show a man s head and torso on a bull s body the reverse of the Classical configuration reminiscent of a centaur This alternative tradition survived into the Renaissance and is reflected in Dryden s elaborated translation of Virgil s description of the Minotaur in Book VI of the Aeneid The lower part a beast a man above The monument of their polluted love It still figures in some modern depictions such as Steele Savage s illustrations for Edith Hamilton s Mythology br br All the stories agree that prince Androgeus son of King Minos died and that the fault lay with the Athenians The sacrifice of young Athenian men and women was a penalty for his death br In some versions he was killed by the Athenians because of their jealousy of the victories he had won at the Panathenaic Games in others he was killed at Marathon by the Cretan Bull his mother s former taurine lover because Aegeus king of Athens had commanded Androgeus to slay it The common tradition holds that Minos waged a war of revenge for the death of his son and won The consequence of Athens losing the war was the regular sacrifice of several of their youths and maidens Pausanias account of the myth said that Minos had led a fleet against Athens and simply harassed the Athenians until they had agreed to send children as sacrifices In his account of the Minotaur s birth Catullus refers to yet another version in which Athens was compelled by the cruel plague to pay penalties for the killing of Androgeon To avert a plague caused by divine retribution for the Cretan prince s death Aegeus had to send into the Labyrinth young men at the same time as the best of unwed girls as a feast for the Minotaur Some accounts declare that Minos required seven Athenian youths and seven maidens chosen by lots to be sent every seventh year or ninth some versions say every year br When the time for the third sacrifice approached the Athenian prince Theseus volunteered to slay the Minotaur Isocrates orates that Theseus thought that he would rather die than rule a city that paid a tribute of children s lives to their enemy He promised his father Aegeus that he would change the somber black sail of the boat carrying the victims from Athens to Crete and put up a white sail for his return journey if he was successful the crew would leave up the black sail if he was killed br br In Crete Minos s daughter Ariadne fell madly in love with Theseus and helped him navigate the Labyrinth In most accounts she gave him a ball of thread allowing him to retrace his path According to various classical sources and representations Theseus killed the Minotaur with his bare hands sometimes with a club or a sword He then led the Athenians out of the Labyrinth and they sailed with Ariadne away from Crete On the way home Theseus abandoned Ariadne on the island of Naxos and continued to Athens The returning group neglected to replace the black sail with the promised white sail and from his lookout on Cape Sounion King Aegeus saw the black sailed ship approach Presuming his son dead he killed himself by leaping into the sea that is since named after him His death secured the throne for Theseus br br The contest between Theseus and the Minotaur was frequently represented in Greek art A Knossian didrachm exhibits on one side the Labyrinth on the other the Minotaur surrounded by a semicircle of small balls probably intended for stars one of the monster s names was Asterion or Asterius star Pasipha gave birth to Asterius who was called the Minotaur He had the face of a bull but the rest of him was human and Minos in compliance with certain oracles shut him up and guarded him in the Labyrinth While the ruins of Minos s palace at Knossos were discovered the Labyrinth never was The multiplicity of rooms staircases and corridors in the palace has led some archaeologists to suggest that the palace itself was the source of the Labyrinth myth with over maze like compartments an idea that is now generally discredited br Homer describing the shield of Achilles remarked that Daedalus had constructed a ceremonial dancing ground for Ariadne but does not associate this with the term labyrinth br Some th century mythologists proposed that the Minotaur was a personification of the sun and a Minoan adaptation of the Baal Moloch of the Phoenicians The slaying of the Minotaur by Theseus in that case could be interpreted as a memory of Athens breaking tributary relations with Minoan Crete br br According to A B Cook Minos and Minotaur were different forms of the same personage representing the sun god of the Cretans who depicted the sun as a bull He and J G Frazer both explain Pasipha s union with the bull as a sacred ceremony at which the queen of Knossos was wedded to a bull formed god just as the wife of the Tyrant in Athens was wedded to Dionysus E Pottier who does not dispute the historical personality of Minos in view of the story of Phalaris considers it probable that in Crete where a bull cult may have existed by the side of that of the labrys victims were tortured by being shut up in the belly of a red hot brazen bull The story of Talos the Cretan man of brass who heated himself red hot and clasped strangers in his embrace as soon as they landed on the island is probably of similar origin br Karl Kerenyi viewed the Minotaur or Asterios as a god associated with stars comparable to Dionysus Coins minted at Knossos from the fifth century showed labyrinth patterns encircling a goddess head crowned with a wreath of grain a bull s head or a star Kerenyi argued that the star in the Labyrinth was in fact Asterios making the Minotaur a luminous deity in Crete associated with a goddess known as the Mistress of the Labyrinth br A geological interpretation also exists Citing early descriptions of the minotaur by Callimachus as being entirely focused on the cruel bellowing br it made from its underground labyrinth and the extensive tectonic activity in the region science journalist Matt Kaplan has theorised that the myth may well stem from geology br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

find themselves picking their way among boulders dislodged on the slope and preparing to enter into the seventh circle of hell Dante and Virgil encounter the beast first among the men of blood those damned for their violent natures Some commentators believe that Dante in a reversal of classical tradition bestowed the beast with a man s head upon a bull s body though this representation had already appeared in the Middle Ages pp br br In these lines Virgil taunts the Minotaur to distract him and reminds the Minotaur that he was killed by Theseus the Duke of Athens with the help of the monster s half sister Ariadne The Minotaur is the first infernal guardian whom Virgil and Dante encounter within the walls of Dis br The Minotaur seems to represent the entire zone of Violence much as Geryon represents Fraud in Canto XVI and serves a similar role as gatekeeper for the entire seventh Circle br Giovanni Boccaccio writes of the Minotaur in his literary commentary of the Commedia When he had grown up and become a most ferocious animal and of incredible strength they tell that Minos had him shut up in a prison called the labyrinth and that he had sent to him there all those whom he wanted to die a cruel death Dante Gabriel Rossetti in his own commentary compares the Minotaur with all three sins of violence within the seventh circle The Minotaur who is situated at the rim of the tripartite circle fed according to the poem was biting himself violence against one s body and was conceived in the false cow violence against nature daughter of God br Virgil and Dante then pass
