In Greek mythology the Hesperides Ancient Greek Greek pronunciation hesper des are the nymphs of evening and golden light of sunsets who were the Daughters of the Evening or Nymphs of the West They were also called the Atlantides Ancient Greek romanized Atlant des from their reputed father Atlas br br br Etymology br The name means originating from Hesperos evening Hesperos or Vesper in Latin is the origin of the name Hesperus the evening star i e the planet Venus as well as having a shared root with the English word west br br br Mythology br br br The nymphs of the evening br Ordinarily the Hesperides number three like the other Greek triads the Three Graces and the Three Fates Since the Hesperides themselves are mere symbols of the gifts the apples embody they cannot be actors in a human drama Their abstract interchangeable names are a symptom of their impersonality classicist Evelyn Byrd Harrison has observed br They are sometimes portrayed as the evening daughters of Night Nyx either alone or with Darkness Erebus in accord with the way Eos in the farthermost east in Colchis is the daughter of the titan Hyperion The Hesperides are also listed as the daughters of Atlas and Hesperis or of Phorcys and Ceto or of Zeus and Themis In a Roman literary source the nymphs are simply said to be the daughters of Hesperus embodiment of the west br br Nevertheless among the names given to them though never all at once there were either three four or seven Hesperides Apollonius of Rhodes gives the number of three with their names as Aigle Erytheis and Hespere or Hespera Hyginus in his preface to the Fabulae names them as Aegle Hesperie and Aerica In another source they are named Aegle Arethusa and Hesperethusa the three daughters of Hesperus br Hesiod says that these clear voiced Hesperides daughters of Nyx night guarded the golden apples beyond Ocean in the far west of the world gives the number of the Hesperides as four and their names as Aigle or Aegle dazzling light Erytheia or Erytheis Hesperia sunset glow whose name refers to the colour of the setting sun red yellow or gold and lastly Arethusa In addition Hesperia and Arethusa the so called ox eyed Hesperethusa Apollodorus gives the number of the Hesperides also as four namely Aigle Erytheia Hesperia or Hesperie and Arethusa while Fulgentius named them as Aegle Hesperie Medusa and Arethusa However the historiographer Diodorus in his account stated that they are seven in number with no information of their names An ancient vase painting attests the following names as four Asterope Chrysothemis Hygieia and Lipara on another seven names as Aiopis Antheia Donakis Calypso Mermesa Nelisa and Tara A pyxis has Hippolyte Mapsaura and Thetis Petrus Apianus attributed to these stars a mythical connection of their own He believed that they were the seven Hesperides nymph daughters of Atlas and Hesperis Their names were Aegle Erythea Arethusa Hestia Hespera Hesperusa and Hespereia A certain Crete possible eponym of the island of Crete was also called one of the Hesperides br They are sometimes called the Western Maidens the Daughters of Evening or Erythrai and the Sunset Goddesses designations all apparently tied to their imagined location in the distant west Hesperis is appropriately the personification of the evening as Eos is of the dawn and the Evening Star is Hesperus br In addition to their tending of the garden they have taken great pleasure in singing Euripides calls them minstrel maids as they possess the power of sweet song The Hesperides could be hamadryad nymphs or epimeliads as suggested by a passage in which they change into trees Hespere became a poplar and Eretheis an elm and Aegle a willow s sacred trunk and in the same account they are described figuratively or literally to have white arms and golden heads br Erytheia the red one is one of the Hesperides The name was applied to an island close to the coast of southern Hispania which was the site of the original Punic colony of Gades modern Cadiz Pliny s Natural History VI records of the island of Gades br br On the side which looks towards Spain at about paces distance is another long island three miles wide on which the original city of Gades stood By Ephorus and Philistides it is called Erythia by Tim us and Silenus Aphrodisias and by the natives the Isle of Juno br The island was the home of Geryon who was overcome by Heracles br br br Land of Hesperides br The Hesperides tend a blissful garden in a far western corner of the world located near the Atlas mountains in North Africa at the edge of the encircling Oceanus the world ocean According to Pliny the Elder the garden was located at Lixus Morocco which was also the location where Heracles fought against Antaeus br According to the Sicilian Greek poet Stesichorus in his poem the Song of Geryon and the Greek geographer Strabo in his book Geographika volume III the garden of the Hesperides is located in Tartessos a location placed in the south of the Iberian peninsula br Euesperides in modern day Benghazi which was probably founded by people from Cyrene or Barca from both of which it lies to the west might have mythological associations with the garden of Hesperides br By Ancient Roman times the garden of the Hesperides had lost its archaic place in religion and had dwindled to a poetic convention in which form it was revived in Renaissance poetry to refer both to the garden and to the nymphs that dwelt there br br br The Garden of the Hesperides br br The Garden of the Hesperides is Hera s orchard in the west where either a single apple tree or a grove grows producing golden apples According to the legend when the marriage of Zeus and Hera took place the different deities came with nuptial presents for the latter and among them the goddess Gaia with branches having golden apples growing on them as a wedding gift Hera greatly admiring these begged of Gaia to plant them in her gardens which extended as far as Mount Atlas br The Hesperides were given the task of tending to the grove but occasionally picked apples from it themselves Not trusting them Hera also placed in the garden an immortal never sleeping hundred headed dragon named Ladon as an additional safeguard In the myth of the Judgement of Paris it was from the Garden that Eris Goddess of Discord obtained the Apple of Discord which led to the Trojan War br In later years it was thought that the golden apples might have actually been oranges a fruit unknown to Europe and the Mediterranean before the Middle Ages Under this assumption the Greek botanical name chosen for all citrus species was Hesperidoeid hesperidoids and even today the Greek word for the orange fruit is Portok li after the country of Portugal in Iberia near where the Garden of the Hesperides grew br br br The Eleventh Labour of Heracles br br After Heracles completed his first ten Labours Eurystheus gave him two more claiming that neither the Hydra counted because Iolaus helped Heracles nor the Augean stables either because he received payment for the job or because the rivers did the work The first of these two additional Labours was to steal the apples from the garden of the Hesperides Heracles first caught the Old Man of the Sea the shape shifting sea god to learn where the Garden of the Hesperides was located In some versions of the tale Heracles went to the Caucasus where Prometheus was confined The Titan directed him concerning his course through the land of the peoples in the farthest north and the perils to be encountered on his homeward march after slaying Geryon in the farthest west br br Follow this straight road and first of all thou shalt come to the Boreades where do thou beware the roaring hurricane lest unawares it twist thee up and snatch thee away in wintry whirlwind br As payment Heracles freed Prometheus from his daily torture This tale is more usually found in the position of the Erymanthian Boar since it is associated with Chiron choosing to forgo immortality and taking Prometheus place br Another story recounts how Heracles either at the start or at the end of his task meets Antaeus who was immortal as long as he touched his mother Gaia the earth Heracles killed Antaeus by holding him aloft and crushing him in a bearhug Herodotus claims that Heracles stopped in Egypt where King Busiris decided to make him the yearly sacrifice but Heracles burst out of his chains br Finally making his way to the Garden of the Hesperides Heracles tricked Atlas into retrieving some of the golden apples for him by offering to hold up the heavens for a little while Atlas was able to take them as in this version he was the father or otherwise related to the Hesperides This would have made this task like the Hydra and Augean stables void because he had received help Upon his return Atlas decided that he did not want to take the heavens back and instead offered to deliver the apples himself but Heracles tricked him again by agreeing to take his place on condition that Atlas relieve him temporarily so that Heracles could make his cloak more comfortable Atlas agreed but Heracles reneged and walked away carrying the apples According to an alternative version Heracles slew Ladon instead and stole the apples br There is another variation to the story where Heracles was the only person to steal the apples other than Perseus although Athena later returned the apples to their rightful place in the garden They are considered by some to be the same apples of joy that tempted Atalanta as opposed to the apple of discord used by Eris to start a beauty contest on Olympus which caused The Siege of Troy br On Attic pottery especially from the late fifth century Heracles is depicted sitting in bliss in the Gardens of the Hesperides attended by the maidens br br br Argonauts encounter br After the hero Heracles killed Ladon and stole the golden apples the Argonauts during their journey came to the Hesperian plain the next day The band of heroes asked for the mercy of the Hesperides to guide them to a source of water in order to replenish their thirst The goddesses pitying the young men directed them to a spring created by Heracles who likewise longing for a draught while wandering the land smote a rock near Lake Triton after which the water gushed out The following passage recounts this meeting of the Argonauts and the nymphs br br Then like raging hounds they i e Argonauts rushed to search for a spring for besides their suffering and anguish a parching thirst lay upon them and not in vain did they wander but they came to the sacred plain where Ladon the serpent of the land till yesterday kept watch over the golden apples in the garden of Atlas and all around the nymphs the Hesperides were busied chanting their lovely song But at that time stricken by Heracles he lay fallen by the trunk of the apple tree only the tip of his tail was still writhing but from his head down his dark spine he lay lifeless and where the arrows had left in his blood the bitter gall of the Lernaean hydra flies withered and died over the festering wounds And close at hand the Hesperides their white arms flung over their golden heads lamented shrilly and the heroes drew near suddenly but the maidens at their quick approach at once became dust and earth where they stood Orpheus marked the divine portent and for his comrades addressed them in prayer O divine ones fair and kind be gracious O queens whether ye be numbered among the heavenly goddesses or those beneath the earth or be called the Solitary nymphs come O nymphs sacred race of Oceanus appear manifest to our longing eyes and show us some spring of water from the rock or some sacred flow gushing from the earth goddesses wherewith we may quench the thirst that burns us unceasingly And if ever again we return in our voyaging to the Achaean land then to you among the first of goddesses with willing hearts will we bring countless gifts libations and banquets br So he spake beseeching them with plaintive voice and they from their station near pitied their pain and lo First of all they caused grass to spring from the earth and above the grass rose up tall shoots and then flourishing saplings grew standing upright far above the earth Hespere became a poplar and Eretheis an elm and Aegle a willow s sacred trunk And forth from these trees their forms looked out as clear as they were before a marvel exceeding great and Aegle spake with gentle words answering their longing looks Surely there has come hither a mighty succour to your toils that most accursed man who robbed our guardian serpent of life and plucked the golden apples of the goddesses and is gone and has left bitter grief for us For yesterday came a man most fell in wanton violence most grim in form and his eyes flashed beneath his scowling brow a ruthless wretch and he was clad in the skin of a monstrous lion of raw hide untanned and he bare a sturdy bow of olive and a bow wherewith he shot and killed this monster here So he too came as one traversing the land on foot parched with thirst and he rushed wildly through this spot searching for water but nowhere was he like to see it Now here stood a rock near the Tritonian lake and of his own device or by the prompting of some god he smote it below with his foot and the water gushed out in full flow And he leaning both his hands and chest upon the ground drank a huge draught from the rifted rock until stooping like a beast of the field he had satisfied his mighty maw br Thus she spake and they gladly with joyful steps ran to the spot where Aegle had pointed out to them the spring until they reached it And as when earth burrowing ants gather in swarms round a narrow cleft or when flies lighting upon a tiny drop of sweet honey cluster round with insatiate eagerness so at that time huddled together the Minyae thronged about the spring from the rock And thus with wet lips one cried to another in his delight Strange In very truth Heracles though far away has saved his comrades fordone with thirst Would that we might find him on his way as we pass through the mainland br br br Variation of the myth br According to Diodorus account the Hesperides did not have the golden apples Instead they possessed flocks of sheep which excelled in beauty and were therefore called for their beauty as the poets might do golden apples just as Aphrodit is called golden because of her loveliness Others also say that it was because the sheep had a peculiar colour like gold that they got this designation This version further states that Dracon dragon was the name of the shepherd of the sheep a man who excelled in strength of body and courage who guarded the sheep and slew any who might dare to carry them off br br br In the Renaissance br With the revival of classical allusions in the Renaissance the Hesperides returned to their prominent position and the garden itself took on the name of its nymphs Robert Greene wrote of The fearful Dragon that watched the garden called Hesperides Shakespeare inserted the comically insistent
