Rhea or Rheia Ancient Greek r a or r a is a mother goddess in ancient Greek religion and mythology the Titan daughter of the earth goddess Gaia and the sky god Uranus himself a son of Gaia She is the older sister of Cronus who was also her consort and the mother of the five eldest Olympian gods Hestia Demeter Hera Poseidon and Zeus and Hades king of the underworld br When Cronus learnt that he was destined to be overthrown by one of his children like his father before him he swallowed all the children Rhea bore as soon as they were born When Rhea had her sixth and final child Zeus she spirited him away and hid him in Crete giving Cronus a rock to swallow instead thus saving her youngest son who would go on to challenge his father s rule and rescue the rest of his siblings Following Zeus s defeat of Cronus and the rise of the Olympian gods into power Rhea withdraws from her role as the queen of the gods to become a supporting figure on Mount Olympus She has some roles in the new Olympian era She attended the birth of her grandson Apollo and raised her other grandson Dionysus After Persephone was abducted by Hades Rhea was sent to Demeter by Zeus In the myth of Pelops she resurrects the unfortunate youth after he has been slain br In early traditions she is known as the mother of gods and therefore is strongly associated with Gaia and Cybele who have similar functions The classical Greeks saw her as the mother of the Olympian gods and goddesses The Romans identified her with Magna Mater their form of Cybele and the Goddess Ops br br Some ancient etymologists derived Rhea by metathesis from ra ground earth the same is suggested also by modern scholars such as Robert Graves br A different tradition embodied in Plato and in Chrysippus connected the word with rh o flow discharge which is what A Greek English Lexicon supports Alternatively the name Rhea may be connected with words for the pomegranate rh a and later rhoi br The name Rhea may ultimately derive from a Pre Greek or Minoan source br br Rhea is the sister of the Titans Oceanus Crius Hyperion Iapetus Coeus Themis Theia Phoebe Tethys Mnemosyne Cronus and sometimes Dione the Cyclopes the Hecatoncheires the Giants the Meliae and the Erinyes and the half sister of Aphrodite in some versions Typhon Python Pontus Thaumas Phorcys Nereus Eurybia and Ceto br According to Hesiod Rhea had six children with Cronus Hestia Demeter Hera Hades Poseidon and Zeus The philosopher Plato recounts that Rhea Cronus and Phorcys were the eldest children of Oceanus and Tethys br According to the Orphic myths Zeus wanted to marry his mother Rhea After Rhea refused to marry him Zeus turned into a snake and raped her She had Persephone with Zeus br br Rhea was born to the earth goddess Gaia and the sky god Uranus one of their twelve or thirteen Titan children According to Hesiod Uranus imprisoned all his children while Apollodorus states he only imprisoned the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires not the Titans With the help of Gaia the youngest child Cronus overthrew his father became king in his place freed his siblings and took his sister Rhea to wife Ophion and Eurynome a daughter of Oceanus were said to have ruled snowy Mount Olympus in the early age Rhea and Cronus fought them and threw them into the waves of the Ocean thus becoming rulers in their place Rhea skilled in wrestling battled Eurynome specifically br br Gaia and Uranus told Cronus that just as he had overthrown his own father and become ruler of the cosmos he was destined to be overcome by his own child so as each of his children was born he swallowed them Rhea Uranus and Gaia devised a plan to save the last child Zeus Rhea gave birth to Zeus in a cavern on the island of Crete and gave Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes which he promptly swallowed Rhea hid Zeus in a cave on Mount Ida Her attendants the warrior like Kouretes and Dactyls acted as bodyguards for the infant Zeus helping to conceal his whereabouts from his father In some accounts by the will of Rhea a golden dog guarded a goat which offered her udder and gave nourishment to the infant Zeus Later on Zeus changed the goat into an immortal among the stars while the golden dog that guarded the sacred spot in Crete was stolen by Pandareus br In an obscure version attested only on the east frieze of a temple at Lagina the goddess of crossroads Hecate assisted Rhea in saving Zeus from his father The frieze shows Hecate presenting to Cronus the swaddled stone while the real infant is being whisked away in safety br While Zeus was still an infant hidden in Crete Rhea caught her husband Cronus with his mistress the nymph Philyra in the act Cronus then transformed into a horse and galloped away in order not to be seen by his wife br In some accounts Rhea along with Metis gave Cronus the potion that made him disgorge the children he had eaten br br Following Zeus s ascension Rhea withdrew from spotlight as she was no longer queen of gods but remained an ally of her children and their families br In some traditions Rhea disapproved of her children Hera and Zeus getting married so the two had to elope in order to be together Rhea was present in the birth of her grandson Apollo along with many other goddesses the most notable exceptions being Hera and Eileithyia the goddess of childbirth whose absence left Leto in terrible agony Rhea was said to be a goddess who eased childbirth for women br After Demeter reunited with her daughter Persephone Zeus sent Rhea to persuade Demeter to return to Olympus and rejoin the gods br Rhea raised another one of her grandsons Dionysus after the fiery death of his mother the mortal princess Semele Later on she went on to heal Dionysus raging madness which had been inflicted on him by the jealous Hera causing him to wander around aimlessly for some time Rhea gave Dionysus the amethyst which was thought to prevent drunkenness Rhea sometimes joined Dionysus and his Maenads in their frenzy dances br According to Bacchylides it was Rhea herself who restored Pelops to life after his father Tantalus cut him down br Rhea and Aphrodite rescued Creusa the wife of Aphrodite s son Aeneas from the slavery the Greeks would have subjected her to after the fall of Troy As for Aeneas when he landed in Italy a local warlord named Turnus set his pine framed vessels ablaze Rhea or Cybele remembering that those hulls had been crafted from trees felled on her holy mountains transformed the vessels into sea nymphs br After Melanion won the hand of Atalanta in marriage thanks to the help he received from Aphrodite he neglected to thank her Thus the goddess inflicted them with great passion for each other when they were near a temple of Rhea The two then proceeded to have sex inside the temple In anger Rhea turned them into lions br At some point a mortal man named Sangas offended the goddess and she turned him into a river that bore his name Sangarius now Sakarya River in Asia Minor In a similar manner a Phrygian man named Pyrrhus tried to rape her but the goddess changed him into stone for his hubris br In one Orphic myth Zeus was filled with desire for his mother and pursued her only for Rhea to refuse him and change into a serpent to flee Zeus also turned himself into a serpent and raped her The child born from that union was their daughter Persephone and afterwards Rhea became Demeter The child Persephone was born so deformed that Rhea ran away from her frightened and did not breastfeed her daughter br br Rhea had no strong local cult or identifiable activity under her control She was originally worshiped on the island of Crete identified in mythology as the site of Zeus s infancy and upbringing Her cults employed rhythmic raucous chants and dances accompanied by the tympanon a wide handheld drum to provoke a religious ecstasy Her priests impersonated her mythical attendants the Curetes and Dactyls with a clashing of bronze shields and cymbals br The tympanon s use in Rhea s rites may have been the source for its use in Cybele s in historical times the resemblances between the two goddesses were so marked that some Greeks regarded Cybele as their own Rhea who had deserted her original home on Mount Ida in Crete and fled to the wilds of Phrygia to escape Cronus br Rhea was often referred to as Meter Theon Mother of the Gods and there were several temples around Ancient Greece dedicated to her under that name Pausanias mentioned temples dedicated to Rhea under the name Meter Theon in Anagyros in Attika Megalopolis in Arkadia on the Acropolis of Ancient Corinth and in the district of Keramaikos in Athens where the statue was made by Pheidias In Sparta there was furthermore a sanctuary to Meter Megale the Great Mother Olympia had both an altar and a temple to the Meter Theon br br A temple of no great size at Olympia in the Doric style they have called down to the present day Metroion Temple of the Mother keeping its ancient name No image lies in it of the Meter Theon Mother of the Gods but there stand in it statues of Roman emperors br Her temple in Akriai Lakedaimon was said to be her oldest sanctuary in the Peloponnese br br Well worth seeing here at Akriai Lakedaimon are a temple and marble image of the Meter Theon Mother of the Gods The people of Akriai say that this is the oldest sanctuary of this goddess in the Peloponnesus br Statues of her were also standing in the sanctuaries of other gods and in other places such as a statue of Parian marble by Damophon in Messene The scene in which Rhea gave Chronos a stone in the place of Zeus after his birth was assigned to have taken place on Petrakhos Mountain in Arcadia as well as on Mount Thaumasios in Arcadia both of which were holy places br br Mount Thaumasios Wonderful lies beyond the river Maloitas in Arkadia and the Methydrians hold that when Rhea was pregnant with Zeus she came to this mountain and enlisted as her allies in case Kronos should attack her Hopladamos and his few Gigantes They allow that she gave birth to her son on some part of Mount Lykaios but they claim that here Kronos was deceived and here took place the substitution of a stone for the child that is spoken of in the Greek legend On the summit of the mountain is Rhea s Cave into which no human beings may enter save only the women who are sacred to the goddess br The center of the worship of Rhea was however on Crete where Mount Ida was said to be the birthplace of Zeus Reportedly there was a House of Rhea in Knossos br br The Titanes had their dwelling in the land about Knosos in Krete at the place where even to this day men point out foundations of a house of Rhea and a cypress grove which has been consecrated to her from ancient times br Upon Mount Ida there was a cave sacred to Rhea br br In Crete there is said to be a sacred cave full of bees In it as storytellers say Rhea gave birth to Zeus it is a sacred place and no one is to go near it whether god or mortal At the appointed time each year a great blaze is seen to come out of the cave Their story goes on to say that this happens whenever the blood from the birth of Zeus begins to boil up The sacred bees that were the nurses of Zeus occupy this cave br br Rhea only appears in Greek art from the fourth century BC when her iconography draws on that of Cybele the two therefore are often indistinguishable both can be shown wearing a crown either a Mural crown or a Polos seated on a throne flanked by lions riding a lion and on a chariot drawn by two lions In Roman religion her counterpart Cybele was Magna Mater deorum Idaea who was brought to Rome and was identified in as an ancestral Trojan deity On a functional level Rhea was thought equivalent to Roman Ops or Opis br br In Homer Rhea is the mother of the gods although not a universal mother like Cybele the Phrygian Great Mother with whom she was later identified br In the Argonautica by Apollonius of Rhodes the fusion of Rhea and Phrygian Cybele is completed Upon the Mother depend the winds the ocean the whole earth beneath the snowy seat of Olympus whenever she leaves the mountains and climbs to the great vault of heaven Zeus himself the son of Cronus makes way and all the other immortal gods likewise make way for the dread goddess the seer Mopsus tells Jason in Argonautica Jason climbed to the sanctuary high on Mount Dindymon to offer sacrifice and libations to placate the goddess so that the Argonauts might continue on their way For her temenos they wrought an image of the goddess a xoanon from a vine stump There they called upon the mother of Dindymon mistress of all the dweller in Phrygia and with her Titias and Kyllenos who alone of the many Cretan Daktyls of Ida are called guiders of destiny and those who sit beside the Idaean Mother They leapt and danced in their armour For this reason the Phrygians still worship Rhea with tambourines and drums br br The name of the bird species Rhea is derived from the goddess s name Rhea br Rhea the second largest moon of the planet Saturn is named after her br br Media
