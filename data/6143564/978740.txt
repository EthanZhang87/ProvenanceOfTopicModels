Fantasy literature is literature set in an imaginary universe often but not always without any locations events or people from the real world Magic the supernatural and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds Fantasy literature may be directed at both children and adults br Fantasy is considered a genre of speculative fiction and is distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the absence of scientific or macabre themes respectively though these may overlap Historically most works of fantasy were in written form but since the s a growing segment of the fantasy genre has taken the form of films television programs graphic novels video games music and art br Many fantasy novels originally written for children and adolescents also attract an adult audience Examples include Alice s Adventures in Wonderland the Harry Potter series The Chronicles of Narnia and The Hobbit br br br History br br br Beginnings br Stories involving magic and terrible monsters have existed in spoken forms before the advent of printed literature Classical mythology is replete with fantastical stories and characters the best known and perhaps the most relevant to modern fantasy being the works of Homer Greek and Virgil Roman br The philosophy of Plato has had great influence on the fantasy genre In the Christian Platonic tradition the reality of other worlds and an overarching structure of great metaphysical and moral importance has lent substance to the fantasy worlds of modern works br With Empedocles c c BC elements are often used in fantasy works as personifications of the forces of nature br India has a long tradition of fantastical stories and characters dating back to Vedic mythology The Panchatantra Fables of Bidpai which some scholars believe was composed around the rd century BC It is based on older oral traditions including animal fables that are as old as we are able to imagine br It was influential in Europe and the Middle East It used various animal fables and magical tales to illustrate the central Indian principles of political science Talking animals endowed with human qualities have now become a staple of modern fantasy br The Baital Pachisi Vikram and the Vampire a collection of various fantasy tales set within a frame story is according to Richard Francis Burton and Isabel Burton the germ which culminated in the Arabian Nights and which also inspired the Golden Ass of Apuleius nd century A D Boccacio s Decamerone c the Pentamerone and all that class of facetious fictitious literature br The Book of One Thousand and One Nights Arabian Nights from the Middle East has been influential in the West since it was translated from the Arabic into French in by Antoine Galland Many imitations were written especially in France br The Fornaldarsagas Norse and Icelandic sagas both of which are based on ancient oral tradition influenced the German Romantics as well as William Morris and J R R Tolkien The Anglo Saxon epic poem Beowulf has also had deep influence on the fantasy genre although it was unknown for centuries and so not developed in medieval legend and romance several fantasy works have retold the tale such as John Gardner s Grendel br Celtic folklore and legend has been an inspiration for many fantasy works br The Welsh tradition has been particularly influential owing to its connection to King Arthur and its collection in a single work the epic Mabinogion One influential retelling of this was the fantasy work of Evangeline Walton The Irish Ulster Cycle and Fenian Cycle have also been plentifully mined for fantasy Its greatest influence was however indirect Celtic folklore and mythology provided a major source for the Arthurian cycle of chivalric romance the Matter of Britain Although the subject matter was heavily reworked by the authors these romances developed marvels until they became independent of the original folklore and fictional an important stage in the development of fantasy br br br From the th century br Romance or chivalric romance is a type of prose and verse narrative that reworked legends fairy tales and history to suit the readers and hearers tastes but by c they were out of fashion and Miguel de Cervantes famously burlesqued them in his novel Don Quixote Still the modern image of medieval is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre and the word medieval evokes knights distressed damsels dragons and other romantic tropes br br br Renaissance br At the time of the Renaissance romance continued to be popular and the trend was to more fantastic fiction The English Le Morte d Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory c was written in prose and the work dominates the Arthurian literature Arthurian motifs have appeared steadily in literature from its publication though the works have been a mix of fantasy and non fantasy works At the time it and the Spanish Amadis de Gaula which was also written in prose spawned many imitators and the genre was popularly well received It later produced such masterpieces of Renaissance poetry as Ludovico Ariosto s Orlando furioso and Torquato Tasso s Gerusalemme Liberata Ariosto s tale in particular was a source text for many fantasies of adventure br During the Renaissance Giovanni Francesco Straparola wrote and published The Facetious Nights of Straparola a collection of stories of which many are literary fairy tales Giambattista Basile wrote and published the Pentamerone which was the first collection of stories to contain solely what would later be known as fairy tales The two works include the oldest recorded form of many well known and some more obscure European fairy tales This was the beginning of a tradition that would both influence the fantasy genre and be incorporated in it as many works of fairytale fantasy appear to this day br In a work on alchemy in the th century Paracelsus identified four types of beings with the four elements of alchemy gnomes earth elementals undines water sylphs air and salamanders fire Most of these beings are found in folklore as well as alchemy and their names are often used interchangeably with similar beings from folklore br br br Enlightenment br Literary fairy tales such as those written by Charles Perrault and Madame d Aulnoy c became very popular early in the Age of Enlightenment Many of Perrault s tales became fairy tale staples and were influential to later fantasy When d Aulnoy termed her works contes de f e fairy tales she invented the term that is now generally used for the genre thus distinguishing such tales from those involving no marvels This approach influenced later writers who took up the folk fairy tales in the same manner during the Romantic era br Several fantasies aimed at an adult readership were also published in th century France including Voltaire s br contes philosophique The Princess of Babylon and The White Bull This era however was notably hostile to fantasy Writers of the new types of fiction such as Defoe Richardson and Fielding were realistic in style and many early realistic works were critical of fantastical elements in fiction br However in the Elizabethan era in England fantasy literature became extraordinarily popular and fueled populist and anti authoritarian sentiment during the s Topics that were written about included fairylands in which the sexes traded places and men and immortals mingl ing br br br Romanticism br Romanticism a movement of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was a dramatic reaction to rationalism challenging the priority of reason and promoting the importance of imagination and spirituality Its success in rehabilitating imagination was of fundamental importance to the evolution of fantasy and its interest in medieval romances provided many motifs to modern fantasy br The Romantics invoked the medieval romance as a model for the works they wanted to produce in contrast to the realism of the Enlightenment One of the first literary results of this trend was the Gothic novel a genre that began in Britain with The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole That work is considered the predecessor to both modern fantasy and modern horror fiction Another noted Gothic novel which also contains a large amount of Arabian Nights influenced fantasy elements is Vathek by William Thomas Beckford br br In the later part of the Romantic period folklorists collected folktales epic poems and ballads and released them in printed form The Brothers Grimm were inspired by the movement of German Romanticism in their collection Grimm s Fairy Tales and they in turn inspired other collectors Frequently their motivation stemmed not merely from Romanticism but from Romantic nationalism in that many were inspired to save their own country s folklore Sometimes as in the Kalevala they compiled existing folklore into an epic to match other nation s and sometimes as in The Poems of Ossian they fabricated folklore that should have been there These works whether fairy tale ballads or folk epics were a major source for later fantasy works br The Romantic interest in medievalism also resulted in a revival of interest in the literary fairy tale The tradition begun with Giovanni Francesco Straparola and Giambattista Basile and developed by Charles Perrault and the French pr cieuses was taken up by the German Romantic movement The German author Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu created medieval set stories such as Undine and Sintram and his Companions which would later inspire British writers such as George MacDonald and William Morris br E T A Hoffmann s tales such as The Golden Pot and The Nutcracker and the Mouse King were notable additions to the canon of German fantasy Ludwig Tieck s collection Phantasus contained several short fairy tales including The Elves br In France the main writers of Romantic era fantasy were Charles Nodier with Smarra and Trilby and Th ophile Gautier who penned such stories as Omphale and One of Cleopatra s Nights as well as the novel Spirite br br br Victorian era br br Fantasy literature was popular in Victorian times with the works of writers such as Mary Shelley William Morris George MacDonald and Charles Dodgson reaching wider audiences br Hans Christian Andersen took a new approach to fairy tales by creating original stories told in a serious fashion From this origin John Ruskin wrote The King of the Golden River a fairy tale that included complex levels of characterization and created in the Southwest Wind an irascible but kindly character similar to J R R Tolkien s later Gandalf br The history of modern fantasy literature began with George MacDonald author of such novels as The Princess and the Goblin and Phantastes the latter of which is widely considered to be the first fantasy novel written for adults MacDonald also wrote one of the first critical essays about the fantasy genre The Fantastic Imagination in his book A Dish of Orts MacDonald was a major influence on both Tolkien and C S Lewis br The other major fantasy author of this era was William Morris an admirer of the Middle Ages and a poet who wrote several fantastic romances and novels in the latter part of the th century including The Well at the World s End Morris was inspired by the medieval sagas and his writing was deliberately archaic in the style of the chivalric romances Morris s work represented an important milestone in the history of fantasy as while other writers wrote of foreign lands or of dream worlds Morris was the first to set his stories in an entirely invented world br Authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Oscar Wilde also contributed to the development of fantasy with their writing of horror stories Wilde also wrote a large number of children s fantasies collected in The Happy Prince and Other Stories and A House of Pomegranates H Rider Haggard developed the conventions of the lost world subgenre with his novel King Solomon s Mines which presented a fantastical Africa to a European audience still unfamiliar with the continent Other writers including Edgar Rice Burroughs and Abraham Merritt further developed the style br Several classic children s fantasies such as Lewis Carroll s Alice s Adventures in Wonderland L Frank Baum s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz as well as the work of E Nesbit and Frank R Stockton were also published around this time C S Lewis noted that in the earlier part of the th century fantasy was more accepted in juvenile literature and therefore a writer interested in fantasy often wrote for that audience despite using concepts and themes that could form a work aimed at adults br At this time the terminology for the genre was not settled Many fantasies in this era were termed fairy tales including Max Beerbohm s The Happy Hypocrite and MacDonald s Phantastes It was not until that the term fantasist was used to describe a writer in this case Oscar Wilde who wrote fantasy fiction The name fantasy was not developed until later as late as J R R Tolkien s The Hobbit the term fairy tale was still being used br br br After br An important factor in the development of the fantasy genre was the arrival of magazines devoted to fantasy fiction The first such publication was the German magazine Der Orchideengarten which ran from to In the first English language fantasy fiction magazine Weird Tales was created Many other similar magazines eventually followed and The Magazine of Fantasy Science Fiction br H P Lovecraft was deeply influenced by Edgar Allan Poe and to a somewhat lesser extent by Lord Dunsany with his Cthulhu Mythos stories he became one of the most influential writers of fantasy and horror in the th century br Despite MacDonald s future influence and Morris popularity at the time it was not until around the start of the th century that fantasy fiction began to reach a large audience with authors such as Lord Dunsany who following Morris s example wrote fantasy novels but also in the short story form He was particularly noted for his vivid and evocative style His style greatly influenced many writers not always happily Ursula K Le Guin in her essay on style in fantasy From Elfland to Poughkeepsie wryly referred to Lord Dunsany as the First Terrible Fate that Awaiteth Unwary Beginners in Fantasy alluding to young writers attempting to write in Lord Dunsany s style According to S T Joshi Dunsany s work had the effect of segregating fantasy a mode whereby the author creates his own realm of pure imagination from supernatural horror From the foundations he established came the later work of E R Eddison Mervyn Peake and J R R Tolkien br In Britain in the aftermath of World War I a notably large number of fantasy books aimed at an adult readership were published including Living Alone by Stella Benson A Voyage to Arcturus by David Lindsay Lady into Fox by David Garnett Lud in the Mist by Hope Mirrlees and Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner E R Eddison was another influential writer who wrote during this era He drew inspiration from Northern sagas as Morris did but his prose style was modeled more on Tudor and Elizabethan English and his stories were filled with vigorous characters in glorious adventures Eddison s most famous work is The Worm Ouroboros a long heroic fantasy set on an imaginary version of the planet Mercury br Literary critics of the era began to take an interest in fantasy as a genre of writing and also to argue that it was a genre worthy of serious consideration Herbert Read devoted a chapter of his book English Prose Style to discussing Fantasy as an aspect of literature arguing it was unjustly considered suitable only for children The Western World does not seem to have conceived the necessity of Fairy Tales for Grown Ups br In with the publication of The Sword in the Stone T H White introduced one of the most notable works of comic fantasy br The first major contribution to the genre after World War II was Mervyn Peake s Titus Groan the book that launched the Gormenghast series J R R Tolkien played a large role in the popularization and accessibility of the fantasy genre with his highly successful publications The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Tolkien was largely influenced by an ancient body of Anglo Saxon myths particularly Beowulf as well as William Morris s romances and E R Eddison s novel The Worm Ouroboros Tolkien s close friend C S Lewis author of The Chronicles of Narnia and a fellow English professor with a similar array of interests also helped to publicize the fantasy genre Tove Jansson author of The Moomins was also a strong contributor to the popularity of fantasy literature in the field of children and adults br br The tradition established by these predecessors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries has continued to thrive and be adapted by new authors The influence of J R R Tolkien s fiction has particularly over the genre of high fantasy prompted a reaction br In China the idea of fantasy literature as a distinct genre first became prevalent in the early st century China has long had pre genre stories with fantastical elements including zhiguai ghost stories and miracle tales among others br It is not uncommon for fantasy novels to be ranked on The New York Times Best Seller list and some have been at number one on the list including most recently Brandon Sanderson in Neil Gaiman in Patrick Rothfuss and George R R Martin in and Terry Goodkind in br br br Style br Symbolism often plays a significant role in fantasy literature often through the use of archetypal figures inspired by earlier texts or folklore Some argue that fantasy literature and its archetypes fulfill a function for individuals and society and the messages are continually updated for current societies br Ursula K Le Guin in her essay From Elfland to Poughkeepsie presented the idea that language is the most crucial element of high fantasy because it creates a sense of place She analyzed the misuse of a formal olden day style saying that it was a dangerous trap for fantasy writers because it was ridiculous when done wrong She warns writers away from trying to base their style on that of masters such as Lord Dunsany and E R Eddison emphasizing that language that is too bland or simplistic creates the impression that the fantasy setting is simply a modern world in disguise and presents examples of clear effective fantasy writing in brief excerpts from Tolkien and Evangeline Walton br Michael Moorcock observed that many writers use archaic language for its sonority and to lend color to a lifeless story Brian Peters writes that in various forms of fairytale fantasy even the villain s language might be inappropriate if vulgar br br br See also br br Children s literature br Fantastique br List of fantasy novels br Mythology br
