id: 81240
The New York Times Best Seller list is widely considered the preeminent list of best selling books in the United States Since October The New York Times Book Review has published the list weekly In the st century it has evolved into multiple lists grouped by genre and format including fiction and nonfiction hardcover paperback and electronic br The list is based on a proprietary method that uses sales figures other data and internal guidelines that are unpublished how the Times compiles the list is a trade secret In during a legal case in which the Times was being sued it was ruled that the list is not mathematically objective but rather editorial in nature In a Times representative said that the goal is that the lists reflect authentic best sellers The list has been a source of controversy When the Times believes a book has reached the list in a suspicious way such as through bulk purchases the book s entry on the list is marked with a dagger symbol br br br History br br Although the first best seller list in America was published in in The Bookman a best seller list was not published in The New York Times until October years later with little fanfare It listed five fiction and four nonfiction books for New York City only The next month the list was expanded to eight cities each with its own list By the early s fourteen city lists were included A national list was created on April in the Sunday New York Times Book Review as a supplement to the Monday edition regular city lists The national list was ranked according to how many times the book appeared in the city lists Eventually the city lists were eliminated leaving only the national ranking list which was compiled according to reports from leading booksellers in cities Ranking by bookseller sales figures continues today although the process has remained proprietary br By the s The Times s list had become the leading best seller list for book professionals to monitor along with that of Publishers Weekly In the s and s shopping mall chain bookstores B Dalton Crown Books and Waldenbooks came to the forefront with a business model of selling newly published best sellers with mass market appeal They used the best selling status of titles to market the books and not just as a measure of sales thus placing increased emphasis on the New York Times list for book readers and book sellers br br br Composition br The list is compiled by the editors of the News Surveys department not by The New York Times Book Review department where it is published It is based on weekly sales reports obtained from selected samples of independent and chain bookstores and wholesalers throughout the United States The sales figures are widely believed to represent books that have actually been sold at retail rather than wholesale as the Times surveys booksellers in an attempt to better reflect what is purchased by individual buyers Some books are flagged with a dagger indicating that a significant number of bulk orders had been received by retail bookstores br The New York Times reported in that we generally do not track the sales of classic literature and thus for example new translations of Dante s Inferno would not be found on the bestseller list br The exact method for compiling the data obtained from the booksellers is classified as a trade secret Book Review staff editor Gregory Cowles explained the method is a secret both to protect our product and to make sure people can t try to rig the system Even in the Book Review itself we don t know the news surveys department s precise methods In the survey encompassed over bookstores as well as representative wholesalers with more than other retail outlets including variety stores and supermarkets By the number was bookstores as well as an unstated number of wholesalers Data is adjusted to give more weight to independent book stores which are underrepresented in the sample br The lists are divided among fiction and nonfiction print and e book paperback and hardcover each list contains to titles The lists have been subdivided several times Advice How To and Miscellaneous debuted as a list of five on January It was created because advice best sellers were sometimes crowding the general nonfiction list Its inaugural number one bestseller The Body Principal by Victoria Principal had been number and number on the nonfiction lists for the two preceding weeks In July the Children s Best Sellers was created after the Harry Potter series had stayed in the top spots on the fiction list for an extended period of time The children s list was printed monthly until February when it was changed to once an issue weekly In September the paperback fiction list was divided into trade and mass market sections in order to give more visibility to the trade paperbacks that were more often reviewed by the newspaper itself In November The New York Times announced it would be tracking e book best seller lists in fiction and nonfiction starting in early RoyaltyShare a San Diego based company that tracks data and aggregates sales information for publishers will provide e book data The two new e book lists were first published with the February issue the first tracks combined print and e book sales the second tracks e book sales only both lists are further sub divided into Fiction and Nonfiction In addition a third new list was published on the web only which tracks combined print sales hardcover and paperback in fiction and nonfiction On December the children s chapter books list was divided into two new lists middle grade ages and young adult age both which include sales across all platforms hard paper and e book br br br Statistics br According to an EPJ Data Science study that used big data to analyze every New York Times bestselling book from to of the new hardcover print books published each year fewer than make it on to The New York Times Best Seller list percent Many novels percent appear on the list for only one week To make the list it is estimated that novels sell from to copies per week depending on competition Median sales fluctuate between and in fiction and in nonfiction The majority of New York Times bestselling books sell from to copies in their first year br During the period studied August to March Dan Brown s book The Lost Symbol held the record with million copies sold in one year followed by The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest by Stieg Larsson and Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee which sold million copies each In nonfiction more than half of the hardcover books that make the list are in the biography category The autobiography of George W Bush Decision Points sold the most copies in one year followed by the biography Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson br br br Criticisms br The list has been criticized by authors publishers book industry executives and others for not providing an accurate accounting of true best seller status These criticisms have been ongoing ever since the list originated A book industry report in the s found that best seller lists were a poor indicator of sales since they were based on misleading data and were only measuring fast sales A report quoted a senior book marketing executive who said the rankings were smoke and mirrors while a report in Book History found that many professionals in the book industry scoffed at the notion that the lists are accurate br Specific criticisms include br br Fast sales A book that never makes the list can actually outsell books on the best seller list This is because the best seller list reflects sales in a given week not total sales Thus one book may sell heavily in a given week making the list while another may sell at a slower pace never making the list but selling more copies over time br Double counting By including wholesalers in the polls along with retail bookstores books may be double counted Wholesalers report how much they sell to retailers and retailers report how much they sell to customers thus there can be overlap with the same reported book being sold twice within a given time frame In addition retailers may return books to wholesalers months later if they never sell thus resulting in a sale being reported that never came to fruition For example mass market paperbacks can see as high as return rates from the retailer back to the wholesaler br Manipulation by authors and publishers In author Jean Shepherd created the fake novel I Libertine to illustrate how easy it was to manipulate the best seller lists based on demand as well as sales Fans of Shepherd s radio show planted references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to claims of it being on the Times list Author Jacqueline Susann Valley of the Dolls attempted to butter up Times reporting booksellers and personally bought large quantities of her own book Author Wayne Dyer Your Erroneous Zones purchased thousands of copies of his own book Al Neuharth Confessions of an S O B former head of Gannett Company had his Gannett Foundation buy two thousand copies of his own autobiography In authors Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema spent to buy ten thousand copies of The Discipline of Market Leaders from dozens of bookstores Although they denied any wrongdoing the book spent weeks on the list As a result of this scandal the Times began placing a dagger symbol next to any title for which bookstores reported bulk orders However daggers do not always appear for example Tony Hsieh s Delivering Happiness was known to have been manipulated with bulk orders but did not have a dagger Companies that contract with authors to manipulate the bestseller list through bestseller campaigns include ResultSource br Manipulation by retailers and wholesalers It happens with regularity that wholesalers and retailers deliberately or inadvertently manipulate the sales data they report to the Times Since being on the Times best seller list increases the sales of a book bookstores and wholesalers may report a book is a best seller before it actually is one in order that it might later become a legitimate best seller through increased sales due to its inclusion on the best seller list leading to the best seller list becoming a self fulfilling prophecy for the booksellers br Leading data collection The Times provides booksellers with a form containing a list of books it believes might be bestsellers to check off with an alternative Other column to fill in manually It has been criticized as a leading technique to create a best seller list based on books the Times thinks might be included One bookseller compared it to a voting card in which two options for president are provided Bill Clinton and Other br Self fulfilling Once a book makes it onto the list it is heavily marketed as a best seller purchased by readers who seek out best sellers given preferential treatment by retailers online and offline who create special best seller categories including special in store placement and price discounts and is carried by retailers that generally do not carry other books e g supermarkets Thus the list can become self fulfilling in determining which books have high sales and remain on the list br Conflicts of interest Due to high financial impact of making the list since the s publishers have created escalator clauses for major authors stipulating that if a book makes the list the author will receive extra money based on where it ranks and for how long Authors may also be able to charge higher speaking fees for the status of being a best seller As Book History said With so much at stake then it is no wonder that enormous marketing effort goes into getting a book access to this major marketing tool br Political bias A investigation by The Economist concluded that the list was likely politically biased reporting that accusations of bias against conservative books may have merit br br br Controversies br In author William Peter Blatty sued The New York Times for million claiming that his book Legion filmed as The Exorcist III had not been included in the list due to either negligence or intentional falsehood saying it should have been included due to high sales The Times countered that the list was not mathematically objective but rather was editorial content and thus protected under the Constitution as free speech Blatty appealed it to the Supreme Court which declined to hear the case Thus the lower court ruling stood that the list is editorial content not objective factual content so the Times had the legal right to exclude the book from the list br In Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema the authors of a book called The Discipline of Market Leaders colluded to manipulate their book onto the best seller charts The authors allegedly purchased over copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to BookScan Because of the benefits of making The New York Times Best Seller list speaking engagements more book deals and consulting the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself The book climbed to No on the list where it sat for weeks it also peaked at No on the BusinessWeek best seller list Since such lists hold the power of cumulative advantage chart success often begets more chart success Although such efforts are not illegal publishers consider them unethical br In Amazon com announced a decrease in price for books on the Best Seller List to beat its competition Barnes Noble After a legal dispute between Amazon and The New York Times Amazon was permitted to keep using the list on condition that it displayed it in alphabetical rather than numerical order By this was no longer the case Amazon now displays the best seller list in order of best selling titles first br In Forbes published a story titled Here s How You Buy Your Way Onto The New York Times Bestsellers List The article discusses how ResultSource a San Diego based marketing consultancy specializes in ensuring books make a bestseller list even guaranteeing a No spot for those willing to pay enough The New York Times was informed of this practice and responded The New York Times comprehensively tracks and tabulates the weekly unit sales of all titles reported by book retailers as their general interest bestsellers We will not comment beyond our methodology on the other questions The New York Times did not alert its readers to this unlike The Wall Street Journal which admitted that books had landed on its bestseller list due to ResultSource s campaign Soren Kaplan the source who admitted he had paid ResultSource to land his book Leapfrogging on The Wall Street Journal s bestseller list revealed the methodology on his blog he posted If I could obtain bulk orders before Leapfrogging was released ResultSource would purchase the books on my behalf using their tried and true formula Three thousand books sold would get me on The Wall Street Journal bestseller list Eleven thousand would secure a spot on the biggest prize of them all The New York Times list br In the Los Angeles Times published a story titled Can bestseller lists be bought It describes how author and pastor Mark Driscoll contracted the company ResultSource to place his book Real Marriage on The New York Times Best Seller list for a fee The contract was for ResultSource to conduct a bestseller campaign for your book Real Marriage on the week of January The bestseller campaign is intended to place Real Marriage on The New York Times bestseller list for the Advice How to list To achieve this the contract stated that RSI will be purchasing at least total orders in one week This took place and the book successfully reached No on the hardcover advice bestseller list on January br In July Ted Cruz s book A Time For Truth was excluded from the list because the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales of Cruz s book were limited to strategic bulk purchases to artificially increase sales and entry onto the list In response Cruz called the Times a liar and demanded an apology The Times said it stood by its statement and evidence of manipulation br In August a young adult fiction book Handbook for Mortals by previously unpublished author Lani Sarem was removed from the list where it was in initially in the No spot According to a statement issued by the Times after investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle we decided that the sales for Handbook for Mortals did not meet our criteria for inclusion We ve issued an updated Young Adult Hardcover list for September which does not include that title It was uncovered by author Phil Stamper that there had been unusual bulk ordering patterns which inflated the number of sales The book is published by GeekNation an entertainment website based in Los Angeles The book was originally written as a script and was rewritten as a novel in an attempt to launch a film franchise br In August conservative publisher Regnery Publishing said it would no longer allow its writers to claim to be New York Times best selling authors due to its belief that the Times favors liberal books on the list The Times responded that the political views of authors have no bearing on the list and noted conservative authors routinely rank highly on the list The Associated Press noted the Times is a frequent target of conservatives and Republicans The Washington Post called Regnery s ban a stunt designed to increase sales What better way to sell a book to a conservative audience than to promote the idea that the New York Times doesn t like it The Post compared the list to best seller lists from Publishers Weekly looking for bias but could not find anything convincing br In February the Toronto Star published a story by books editor Deborah Dundas who found that the best selling book Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson who topped Publishers Weekly chart list did not even chart on The New York Times bestsellers list without reliable answers from the New York Times The Times stated it was not counted because it was published by a Canadian company According to Random House Canada the book was handled properly for the U S market American conservative commentator Dennis Prager wrote an article for National Review titled The Times Best Seller List Another Reason Americans Don t Trust the Media in which he contends that the issue with Peterson s book as well his The Rational Bible Exodus is their conservative context and the lack of inclusion is the American mainstream media s manipulation The Times denied any bias br In the release of Donald Trump Jr s book Triggered was shown to have only reached the best seller list through approximately in behind the scenes bulk purchases meant to pump up its sales numbers illegitimately Vanity Fair reported in October that this sort of gaming of the system has been a common practice among American conservative political figures and has also included the use of political campaign funds to purchase the books in bulk in order to boost their rank on the list br br br Studies br A Stanford Business School analysis suggests that the majority of book buyers seem to use the Times list as a signal of what s worth reading The study concluded that lesser known writers get the biggest benefit from being on the list while perennial best selling authors such as John Grisham or Danielle Steel see no benefit of additional sales br br br See also br br Lists of The New York Times number one books br Lists of The New York Times Manga Best Sellers br Oprah s Book Club br Publishers Weekly
