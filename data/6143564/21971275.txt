scenes were filmed on location in Brooklyn New York during the first week of August Digital intermediate work began in San Francisco in November Christophe Beck composed the score Columbus has stated that the cast was chosen specifically with sequels in mind I think with Percy Jackson it was a matter of finding the right cast to fit into these roles sort of the perfect cast for these roles because hopefully God willing we will go on to do other Percy Jackson films and you want the cast to grow with their characters br During production Riordan was disappointed with the changes made to the story and warned the studio that it would likely alienate the readers of the book series that it was depending on to buy tickets In two emails commenting at length on a draft of the script that he posted to his blog in he specifically warned the studio that trying to make the story more attractive to a teenage audience by aging the characters and including some profanity in the script might move a significant portion of the books readers to leave the theater in disgust long before the movie ended He also felt the introduction of Persephone s pearls as a plot device made no sense having no basis in mythology and distracting Percy from his goal of recovering the stolen lightning br br br Reception br br br Box office br The film opened on February in theaters its opening weekend box office

br The author Rick Riordan publicly criticized the final script He revealed email recommendations for script changes with names redacted Regarding future support for a reboot Riordan said In the future if some project actually does get underway I may not be able to comment on it for contractual reasons but you can tell how I m feeling about it by what I do or don t say Am I talking about it Promoting it Sharing cool things I am probably happy Am I completely ignoring it and never mentioning it on social media Yeah that s probably not a good sign For instance check out my website rickriordan com Do you see any indication there that the Percy Jackson movies ever existed No No you do not He also shared in the same email The script as a whole is terrible I don t simply mean that it deviates from the book though certainly it does that to point of being almost unrecognizable as the same story Fans of the books will be angry and disappointed br br br Accolades br br br
