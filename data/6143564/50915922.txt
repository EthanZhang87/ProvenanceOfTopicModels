has the magic touch School Library Journal explained the book s success with its comment With an epic plot engaging and diverse characters and tons of wise cracking humor Riordan s latest is a page turner fans of his previous works will also be happy to see clever nods and references to the other in universe books While reviewer Jody Mitori said Riordan s pop culture references may date the book in years to come she went on to assert that for now they make the trek entertaining Among overall children s book sales in The Sword of Summer did very well but was not a big front runner among other bestselling books br The Sword of Summer has been praised especially as an excellent example of a Riordan novel Kirkus Reviews for example wrote First there were the Greek gods then the Egyptian gods then the Roman gods now Riordan takes on the Norse gods A fast paced eventful and largely successful pivot More specific aspects of the novel have also been noted by critics Author Cassandra Clare s review praised Riordan s effervescent world building in addition to the novel s humour and breakneck plot Author Michael Grant lauded the novel as a propulsive kinetic witty rebooting of Norse mythology with all the charm of the Percy Jackson novels KidsReads s review praised the characters and their development saying Magnus Chase feels fresh and exciting even with its oft used mythological themes Reviewers such as Publishers Weekly have praised the book saying Riordan plays much of the material for laughs and brings the Norse gods into the st century The sensibility is right in line with the Percy Jackson novels and the audience will be just as large br A few reviews most notably Adam Gopnik s in The New York Times have expressed disappointment at the novel s failing to rise above Riordan s previous work however Gopnik s review acknowledged the difficulties modern myth authors like Riordan face in writing for a young audience such as the required action scenes fantastic powers and drama but went on to question Riordan s inadequate portrayal of the special quiddity that separates Norse mythology from other kinds its fatalism A similar review from the St Louis Post Dispatch asserted that at nearly pages Sword of Summer is too long and loses some of its charm from the overuse of quests within a quest While Gopnik and others accept The Sword of Summer as of passable quality and certain to appeal to many readers Gopnik summarizes their views in his review s concluding lines The marvels of myth Riordan recreates here as before the mystery of myth remains unactualized in his work or sadder and more likely unasked for by his time br On a more positive note some critics appreciated Riordan s new turn towards multiculturalism Other reviewers have shown interest in Riordan s choice to kill his main character and other signs of his newest story being more mature than the famous Percy Jackson the Olympians Kirkus praised Riordan s interesting choice to make the main female protagonist Samirah al Abbas happily betrothed and thus blessedly free of romantic tension with Magnus The Sword of Summer won the Goodreads Choice Award for
