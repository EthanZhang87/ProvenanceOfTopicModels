id: 3410788
Yellow Submarine is the tenth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles released in January It is the soundtrack to the animated film of the same name which premiered in London in July The album contains six songs by the Beatles including four new songs and the previously released Yellow Submarine and All You Need Is Love The remainder of the album is a re recording of selections from the film s orchestral soundtrack by the band s producer George Martin br The project was regarded as a contractual obligation by the Beatles who were asked to supply four new songs for the film Some were written and recorded specifically for the soundtrack while others were unreleased tracks from other projects The album was recorded before and issued two months after the band s self titled double LP also known as the White Album and was not viewed by the band as a significant release An EP containing only the new songs had been considered and was mastered but left unreleased The original mono mixes were later included in the compilation Mono Masters br Yellow Submarine reached the top in the UK and the US It has since been afforded a mixed reception from music critics some of whom consider that it falls short of the high standard generally associated with the Beatles work Another version of the album Yellow Submarine Songtrack was issued on the film s th anniversary It dispenses with the George Martin orchestral works and includes the six Beatles songs from the original album along with an additional nine songs heard in the film all newly remixed br br br Background and recording br The album arose from contractual obligations as part of the Beatles three picture deal with United Artists With the band having disliked Help it was agreed that an animated film Yellow Submarine would fulfil their obligation as it reduced their involvement though they reluctantly agreed to record four new songs for the film Having recently completed their album Sgt Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band in April the group showed minimal enthusiasm for the project Along with the music for their Magical Mystery Tour TV film the Yellow Submarine soundtrack was part of a period that author Ian MacDonald later described as the band s regime of continuous low intensity recording it had a workaday quality about it an intrinsic lack of tension which was bound to colour the resulting material br br br Soundtrack songs br br Only one side of the album contains songs performed by the Beatles of the six two of them were previously released Yellow Submarine had been issued in August as a single topping the UK chart for four weeks and had also been released on the album Revolver Following the Beatles performance of the song on the Our World international television broadcast All You Need Is Love had been issued as a single as well in July and had also been included on the Capitol Records LP release of Magical Mystery Tour in November A stereo mix was made of this song on October for release on this album br Of the unreleased tracks the first to be recorded was George Harrison s Only a Northern Song taped in February but rejected for inclusion on Sgt Pepper The group performed overdubs on this basic track in April immediately after completing the stereo mixes for that album Among the sounds added during what Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn describes as a curious session were trumpet glockenspiel and spoken voices Harrison s lyrics reflect his displeasure at being merely a contracted songwriter to the Beatles publishing company Northern Songs br All Together Now was recorded in a single session on May specifically for the film project The title came from a phrase Paul McCartney had heard as a child to encourage everyone to sing music hall songs He later described the song as a throwaway br The band recorded Harrison s It s All Too Much in late May at De Lane Lea Studios in central London Inspired by its author s experimentation with the drug LSD and originally running to over eight minutes in length the song reflects the Summer of Love philosophy of and makes extensive use of guitar feedback As with the later recorded All You Need Is Love the track includes musical and lyrical quotations from other works in this case a trumpet passage from Jeremiah Clarke s Prince of Denmark s March and a lyric from the Merseys hit Sorrow br John Lennon s Hey Bulldog was recorded on February and evolved from an initial intent to shoot a promotional film for the single Lady Madonna Like All Together Now it was specifically recorded with the film soundtrack in mind The track s ending contained a jam session after the point where a fade out was intended in the final mix which was kept in the finished version Lennon later described the song as a good sounding record that means nothing br br br George Martin orchestral works br Side consists of re recordings of the symphonic film score composed by the Beatles producer George Martin specifically for the album The recording took place with a piece orchestra over two three hour sessions on and October in Abbey Road and was edited down to the length on the LP on November br In some of his compositions Martin referenced his past work with the Beatles for example Sea of Time includes what MacDonald terms an affectionate quotation from the Indian styled Within You Without You from Sgt Pepper and Yellow Submarine in Pepperland reprises the film s title track In Sea of Monsters Martin included the beginning of Bach s Air on the G String while in other selections he parodies works by Stravinsky MacDonald also detects the influence of Mozart and Webern among the classical allusions in Martin s score br br br Release br The film received its worldwide premiere in London in July by which time the Beatles were busy working on their self titled double album commonly called the White Album After viewing the finished film the Beatles were much more enthusiastic and did more to associate themselves with it after its release Having been delayed so that it would not clash with the release of The Beatles and to allow for the re recording of Martin s contributions Yellow Submarine was issued by Apple Records on January in the U S and on January in the UK The album was issued in stereo only in the U S while the UK album was available in both stereo and mono although the mono version is simply a fold down a combination of two stereo channels into one mono rather than a specific mix br Since All You Need Is Love had been rush released as a single it did not have an official stereo mix Although the track was released on the U S LP Magical Mystery Tour an official stereo mix of the track was not made until October for the album In the U S track tape and cassette tape versions included Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds which was also heard in the film as an additional song br In contrast to the animated film Yellow Submarine was not generally considered to be a significant release Issued two months after The Beatles it was one of the few Beatles releases that failed to top the charts in either the United Kingdom or the United States peaking instead at number and number respectively In Canada Yellow Submarine topped the RPM national albums chart for two weeks ending the White Album s week run at number On America s Billboard Top LPs chart it was kept from the top by the same album br br br Artwork br The artwork on the sleeve contains a drawing of the Beatles as it appeared on trailer posters created by Heinz Edelman The same basic design was used for the UK and U S covers though the UK jacket contains the words Nothing Is Real taken from Strawberry Fields Forever just below the album s title while the U S version did not br On the back of the cover the UK album contained a review of the White Album written for The Observer by Tony Palmer The review was introduced by a few liner notes by Apple press officer Derek Taylor The U S cover contained a fictitious illustrated biography by Dan Davis of Sgt Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band in which the ensemble s battle with the Blue Meanies was compared to three other epic struggles in the history of the English speaking world Beowulf s struggle to save the Heorot mead hall King John s signing of the Magna Carta and Thomas Jefferson s writing of the Declaration of Independence br br br Unreleased EP br An EP containing the new songs had been considered for release in September but any plan to issue the soundtrack music from Yellow Submarine was then postponed to allow for the White Album s unveiling Following the delayed release of the soundtrack album however Lewisohn writes that the Beatles were mildly criticised for issuing a new LP with just four new songs and having ceded a full LP side to Martin s music and thereby failing to provide their customary excellent value for money As a result the band decided to reissue Yellow Submarine as a five track mono EP without the film score but including the then unreleased Across the Universe as a bonus track This EP was mastered in March but was never issued The original running order for the EP was Only a Northern Song Hey Bulldog and Across the Universe on side one with All Together Now and It s All Too Much on side two br Lennon later dismissed Martin s contributions as all this terrible shit and blamed Brian Epstein the Beatles manager for allowing Martin to participate in the project According to author and music journalist Peter Doggett neither the proposed EP format nor an expanded soundtrack album containing other previously issued Beatles songs that appear in the film was possible at the time since both options would have denied George Martin his contractual right to appear alongside The Beatles and robbed him of potentially the largest royalty payment of his career br br br Reissues br The first compact disc release of the album appeared in August It was consistent with the British version of the LP with Sea of Time and Sea of Holes as separate tracks the Nothing Is Real subtitle remained and the review of the White Album with Taylor s introduction was reproduced inside the CD insert The soundtrack album returned to the UK charts peaking at number br A th anniversary version of the album was released on September coinciding with the remastered re release of the film Titled Yellow Submarine Songtrack it does not include the George Martin film score but features the six Beatles songs from the original album along with an additional nine songs heard in the film all completely remixed for this disc br The original album remained available and was remastered and reissued along with the rest of the Beatles catalogue on September This release included both the UK and US sleeve notes The mono mixes of the four songs that were intended for the unreleased EP along with Across the Universe were released for the first time on the Mono Masters collection as part of the box set The Beatles in Mono br br br Critical reception br br Recalling the album s release in a special edition issue of Mojo magazine Peter Doggett writes that The papers got all trippy for Yellow Submarine Beat Instrumental bemoaned the paucity of new material by the band but added be not of bad cheer The George Martin score to the film is really very nice and two tracks by George Harrison redeem the first side Both songs are superb pieces considerably more enthralling than the most draggy All Together Now a rather wet track In a review for International Times Barry Miles considered Martin s score superbly produced and of the songs wrote only of It s All Too Much which he described as variously Endless mantric a round interwoven trellised tessellated filigreed gidouiled spiralling and Happy singalong music Record Mirror s reviewer said that given the longstanding demand for a soundtrack album the release of Yellow Submarine would evoke the ecstasy of fans the world over The reviewer added that the four new Beatles songs matched the quality of the two excellent hit singles and Martin s side represented a tremendous achievement that also justified any complaints about the price Writing in their book The Beatles An Illustrated Record NME critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler bemoaned the commercial considerations that had resulted in the release of a full soundtrack album saying that the four new tracks would have made a superb EP br More recently AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger has written of Yellow Submarine The album would have been far better value if it had been released as a four song EP with the addition of a bonus track in Across the Universe No one would argue that there s a huge amount more than meets the eye or ear there but listening to the original album anew years on one is still struck by how mostly second rate and recycled and rejected Beatles material still sounds so good Writing for Pitchfork Media Mark Richardson opines that the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn t really be bothered and describes Hey Bulldog as a tough and funky piano driven rocker and by a good margin the best song here Richardson concludes But as an album it s ultimately forgettable which is something the Beatles so rarely were otherwise br PopMatters David Gassman views Martin s selections as kind of twee and inconsequential and the four new songs on side one as fascinating adding that The material s tossed off origins give it a character unlike any other Beatles album While noting that the soundtrack was superseded with the release of Yellow Submarine Songtrack Gassman writes No matter how you get them though the otherwise unavailable songs on this album ought to be part of any thinking Beatles fan s collection Alex Young of Consequence of Sound writes as a whole Yellow Submarine is a delightful album even if it s still a less than acceptable inclusion in the Beatles canon though he criticised the inclusion of Martin s score which he felt should have been sold as a separate release br br br Track listing br br br Personnel br The Beatles br br John Lennon lead and
