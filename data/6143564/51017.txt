id: 51017
In Greek mythology sirens Ancient Greek singular Seir n plural Seir nes are humanlike beings with alluring voices they appear in a scene in the Odyssey in which Odysseus saves his crew s lives Roman poets place them on some small islands called Sirenum scopuli In some later rationalized traditions the literal geography of the flowery island of Anthemoessa or Anthemusa is fixed sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in the islands known as the Sirenuse near Paestum or in Capreae All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks br Sirens continued to be used as a symbol for the dangerous temptation embodied by women regularly throughout Christian art of the medieval era Siren can also be used as a slang term for a woman considered both very attractive and dangerous br br br Nomenclature br br The etymology of the name is contested Robert S P Beekes has suggested a Pre Greek origin Others connect the name to seir rope cord and e r to tie join fasten resulting in the meaning binder entangler i e one who binds or entangles through magic song This could be connected to the famous scene of Odysseus being bound to the mast of his ship in order to resist their song br Sirens were later often used as a synonym for mermaids and portrayed with upper human bodies and fish tails This combination became iconic in the medieval period The circumstances leading to the commingling involve the treatment of sirens in the medieval Physiologus and bestiaries both iconographically as well as textually in translations from Latin to vulgar languages as described below br br br Iconography br br br Classical iconography br br The sirens of Greek mythology first appeared in Homer s Odyssey where Homer did not provide any physical descriptions and their visual appearance was left to the readers imagination It was Apollonius of Rhodes in Argonautica rd century BC who described the sirens in writing as part woman and part bird By the th century BC sirens were regularly depicted in art as human headed birds They may have been influenced by the ba bird of Egyptian religion In early Greek art the sirens were generally represented as large birds with women s heads bird feathers and scaly feet Later depictions shifted to show sirens with human upper bodies and bird legs with or without wings They were often shown playing a variety of musical instruments especially the lyre kithara and aulos br The tenth century Byzantine dictionary Suda stated that sirens Greek had the form of sparrows from their chests up and below they were women or alternatively that they were little birds with women s faces br Originally sirens were shown as male or female but the male siren disappeared from art around the fifth century BC br br br Early siren mermaids br br Some surviving Classical period examples had already depicted the siren as mermaid like The sirens are depicted as mermaids or tritonesses in examples dating to the rd century BC including an earthenware bowl found in Athens and a terracotta oil lamp possibly from the Roman period br The first known literary attestation of siren as a mermaid appeared in the Anglo Latin catalogue Liber Monstrorum early th century AD where it says that sirens were sea girls with the body of a maiden but have scaly fishes tails br br br Medieval Iconography br br The siren appeared in a number of illustrated manuscripts of the Physiologus and its successors called the bestiaries The siren was depicted as a half woman and half fish mermaid in the th century Berne Physiologus as an early example but continued to be illustrated with both bird like parts wings clawed feet and fish like tail br br br Modern paintings br br br Classical literature br br br Family tree br Although a Sophocles fragment makes Phorcys their father when sirens are named they are usually as daughters of the river god Achelous either by the Muse Terpsichore Melpomene or Calliope or lastly by Sterope daughter of King Porthaon of Calydon br In Euripides s play Helen Helen in her anguish calls upon Winged maidens daughters of the Earth Chthon Although they lured mariners the Greeks portrayed the sirens in their meadow starred with flowers and not as sea deities Epimenides claimed that the sirens were children of Oceanus and Ge Sirens are found in many Greek stories notably in Homer s Odyssey br br br List of sirens br Their number is variously reported as from two to eight In the Odyssey Homer says nothing of their origin or names but gives the number of the sirens as two Later writers mention both their names and number some state that there were three Peisinoe Aglaope and Thelxiepeia or Aglaonoe Aglaopheme and Thelxiepeia Parthenope Ligeia and Leucosia Apollonius followed Hesiod gives their names as Thelxinoe Molpe and Aglaophonos Suidas gives their names as Thelxiepeia Peisinoe and Ligeia Hyginus gives the number of the sirens as four Teles Raidne Molpe and Thelxiope Eustathius states that they were two Aglaopheme and Thelxiepeia an ancient vase painting attests the two names as Himerope and Thelxiepeia br Their individual names are variously rendered in the later sources as Thelxiepeia Thelxiope Thelxinoe Molpe Himerope Aglaophonos Aglaope Aglaopheme Pisinoe Peisino Peisithoe Parthenope Ligeia Leucosia Raidne and Teles br br Molpe br Thelxiepeia or Thelxiope eye pleasing br br br Mythology br br br Demeter br br According to Ovid BC AD the sirens were the companions of young Persephone Demeter gave them wings to search for Persephone when she was abducted by Hades However the Fabulae of Hyginus BC AD has Demeter cursing the sirens for failing to intervene in the abduction of Persephone According to Hyginus sirens were fated to live only until the mortals who heard their songs were able to pass by them br br br The Muses br One legend says that Hera queen of the gods persuaded the sirens to enter a singing contest with the Muses The Muses won the competition and then plucked out all of the sirens feathers and made crowns out of them Out of their anguish from losing the competition writes Stephanus of Byzantium the sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera featherless where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Leukai the white ones modern Souda br br br Argonautica br In the Argonautica third century BC Jason had been warned by Chiron that Orpheus would be necessary in his journey When Orpheus heard their voices he drew out his lyre and played his music more beautifully than they drowning out their voices One of the crew however the sharp eared hero Butes heard the song and leapt into the sea but he was caught up and carried safely away by the goddess Aphrodite br br br Odyssey br br Odysseus was curious as to what the sirens sang to him and so on the advice of Circe he had all of his sailors plug their ears with beeswax and tie him to the mast He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast no matter how much he might beg When he heard their beautiful song he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter When they had passed out of earshot Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released Some post Homeric authors state that the sirens were fated to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished br br br Pliny br The first century Roman historian Pliny the Elder discounted sirens as a pure fable although Dinon the father of Clearchus a celebrated writer asserts that they exist in India and that they charm men by their song and having first lulled them to sleep tear them to pieces br br br Sirens and death br br Statues of sirens in a funerary context are attested since the classical era in mainland Greece as well as Asia Minor and Magna Graecia The so called Siren of Canosa Canosa di Puglia is a site in Apulia that was part of Magna Graecia was said to accompany the dead among grave goods in a burial She appeared to have some psychopomp characteristics guiding the dead on the afterlife journey The cast terracotta figure bears traces of its original white pigment The woman bears the feet wings and tail of a bird The sculpture is conserved in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid br The sirens were called the Muses of the lower world Classical scholar Walter Copland Perry observed Their song though irresistibly sweet was no less sad than sweet and lapped both body and soul in a fatal lethargy the forerunner of death and corruption Their song is continually calling on Persephone br br The term siren song refers to an appeal that is hard to resist but that if heeded will lead to a bad conclusion Later writers have implied that the sirens ate humans based on Circe s description of them lolling there in their meadow round them heaps of corpses rotting away rags of skin shriveling on their bones As linguist Jane Ellen Harrison notes of The Ker as siren It is strange and beautiful that Homer should make the sirens appeal to the spirit not to the flesh The siren song is a promise to Odysseus of mantic truths with a false promise that he will live to tell them they sing Once he hears to his heart s content sails on a wiser man We know all the pains that the Greeks and Trojans once enduredon the spreading plain of Troy when the gods willed it so all that comes to pass on the fertile earth we know it all br They are mantic creatures like the Sphinx with whom they have much in common knowing both the past and the future Harrison observed Their song takes effect at midday in a windless calm The end of that song is death That the sailors flesh is rotting away suggests it has not been eaten It has been suggested that with their feathers stolen their divine nature kept them alive but unable to provide food for their visitors who starved to death by refusing to leave br br br Early Christian to Medieval br br br Book of Enoch br According to the ancient Hebrew Book of Enoch the women who were led astray by the fallen angels will be turned into sirens br br br Late antiquity br By the fourth century when pagan beliefs were overtaken by Christianity the belief in literal sirens was discouraged br Saint Jerome who produced the Latin Vulgate version of the bible used the word sirens to translate Hebrew tann m jackals in the Book of Isaiah and also to translate a word for owls in the Book of Jeremiah br The siren is allegorically described as a beautiful courtesan or prostitute who sings pleasant melody to men and is symbolic vice of Pleasure in the preaching of Clement of Alexandria nd century Later writers such as Ambrose th century reiterated the notion that the siren stood as symbol or allegory for worldly temptations and not an endorsement of the Greek myth br br br Isidorus br The early Christian euhemerist interpretation of mythologized human beings received a long lasting boost from the Etymologiae by Isidore of Seville c br br They the Greeks imagine that there were three sirens part virgins part birds with wings and claws One of them sang another played the flute the third the lyre They drew sailors decoyed by song to shipwreck According to the truth however they were prostitutes who led travelers down to poverty and were said to impose shipwreck on them They had wings and claws because Love flies and wounds They are said to have stayed in the waves because a wave created Venus br br br Physiologus and bestiaries br br br The allegorical texts br The siren and the onocentaur two hybrid creatures appear as the subject of a single chapter in the Physiologus owing to the fact that they appear together in the Septuagint translation of the aforementioned Isaiah and They also appear together in some Latin bestiaries of the First Family subgroup called B Isidore B Is br br br The miniatures br br The siren s bird like description from classical sources was retained in the Latin version of the Physiologus th century and a number of subsequent bestiaries into the th century but at some time during the interim the mermaid shape was introduced to this body of works br br As woman fish or mermaid br br The siren was illustrated as a woman fish mermaid in the Bern Physiologus dated to the mid th century even though this contradicted the accompanying text which described it as avian An English made Latin bestiary dated also depicted a group of sirens as mermaids with fishtails swimming in the sea even though the text stated they resembled winged fowl volatilis habet figuram down to their feet br Illustrating the siren as a pure mermaid became commonplace in the second family bestiaries and she was shown holding a musical instrument in the classical tradition but also sometimes holding apparently an eel fish An example of the siren mermaid holding such a fish is found in one of the earlier codices in this group dated the late th century br br As bird like br A counterexample is also given where the illustrated sirens group of three are bird like conforming to the text br br As hybrid br The siren was sometimes drawn as a hybrid with a human torso a fish like lower body and bird like wings and feet While in the Harley cf fig top right the wings sprout from around the shoulders in other hybrid types the style places the siren s wings hanging at the waist br br Comb and mirror br Also a siren may be holding a comb or a mirror br Thus the comb and mirror which are now emblematic of mermaids across Europe derive from the bestiaries that describe the siren as a vain creature requiring those accoutrements br br br Verse bestiaries br Later bestiary texts appeared which were modified to accommodate the artistic conventions br It is explained that the siren s other part may be like fish or like bird in Guillaume le clerc s Old French verse bestiary or as well as Philippe de Thaun s Anglo Norman verse bestiary c br br br Derivative literature br There also appeared medieval works that conflated sirens with mermaids while citing Physiologus as their source br Italian poet Dante Alighieri depicts a siren in Canto of Purgatorio the second canticle of the Divine Comedy Here the pilgrim dreams of a female that is described as stuttering cross eyed and crooked on her feet with stunted hands and pallid in color It is not until the pilgrim gazes upon her that she is turned desirable and is revealed by herself to be a siren This siren then claims that she turned Ulysses from his course desirous of my song and whoever becomes used to me rarely leaves me so wholly do I satisfy him Given that Dante did not have access to the Odyssey the siren s claim that she turned Ulysses from his course is inherently false because the sirens in the Odyssey do not manage to turn Ulysses from his path Ulysses and his men were warned by Circe and prepared for their encounter by stuffing their ears full of wax except for Ulysses who wishes to be bound to the ship s mast as he wants to hear the siren s song Scholars claim that Dante may have misinterpreted the siren s claim from an episode in Cicero s De finibus The pilgrim s dream comes to an end when a lady holy and quick who had not yet been present before suddenly appears and says O Virgil Virgil who is this Virgil the pilgrim s guide then steps forward and tears the clothes from the siren s belly which awakened me the pilgrim with the stench that issued from it This marks ending the encounter between the pilgrim and the siren br In Geoffrey of Monmouth s Historia Regum Britanniae c Brutus of Troy encounters sirens at the Pillars of Hercules on his way to Britain to fulfil a prophecy that he will establish an empire there The sirens surround and nearly overturn his ships until Brutus escapes to the Tyrrhenian Sea br br br Renaissance br By the time of the Renaissance female court musicians known as courtesans filled the role of an unmarried companion and musical performances by unmarried women could be seen as immoral Seen as a creature who could control a man s reason female singers became associated with the mythological figure of the siren who usually took a half human half animal form somewhere on the cusp between nature and culture br Leonardo da Vinci wrote of them in his notebooks stating The siren sings so sweetly that she lulls the mariners to sleep then she climbs upon the ships and kills the sleeping mariners br br br Age of Exploration br However in the th century some Jesuit writers began to assert their actual existence including Cornelius a Lapide who said of woman her glance is that of the fabled basilisk her voice a siren s voice with her voice she enchants with her beauty she deprives of reason voice and sight alike deal destruction and death Antonio de Lorea also argued for their existence and Athanasius Kircher argued that compartments must have been built for them aboard Noah s Ark br br br Late Modernity br Charles Burney expounded c in A General History of Music The name according to Bochart who derives it from the Phoenician implies a songstress Hence it is probable that in ancient times there may have been excellent singers but of corrupt morals on the coast of Sicily who by seducing voyagers gave rise to this fable br John Lempri re in his Classical Dictionary wrote Some suppose that the sirens were a number of lascivious women in Sicily who prostituted themselves to strangers and made them forget their pursuits while drowned in unlawful pleasures The etymology of Bochart who deduces the name from a Phoenician term denoting a songstress favors the explanation given of the fable by Damm This distinguished critic makes the sirens to have been excellent singers and divesting the fables respecting them of all their terrific features he supposes that by the charms of music and song they detained travellers and made them altogether forgetful of their native land br br br Arts and influence br The French impressionist composer Claude Debussy composed the orchestral work Nocturnes in which the third movement Sir nes depicts sirens According to Debussy Sir nes depicts the sea and its countless rhythms and presently amongst the waves silvered by the moonlight is heard the mysterious song of the Sirens as they laugh and pass on br In French composer Lili Boulanger composed Les sir nes for mezzo soprano soloist choir and piano br Contemporary British composer and former child prodigy Alma Deutscher composed Waltz of the Sirens an orchestral work based on the mythology creature br English artist William Etty portrayed the sirens as young women in fully human form in his painting The Sirens and Ulysses a practice copied by
