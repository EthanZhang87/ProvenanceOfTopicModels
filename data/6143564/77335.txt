In Greek mythology the Golden Fleece Ancient Greek romanized Khrys mallon d ras lit Golden haired pelt is the fleece of the golden woolled winged ram Chrysomallos that rescued Phrixus and brought him to Colchis where Phrixus then sacrificed it to Zeus Phrixus gave the fleece to King Ae tes who kept it in a sacred grove whence Jason and the Argonauts stole it with the help of Medea Ae tes daughter The fleece is a symbol of authority and kingship br In the historical account the hero Jason and his crew of Argonauts set out on a quest for the fleece by order of King Pelias in order to place Jason rightfully on the throne of Iolcus in Thessaly Through the help of Medea they acquire the Golden Fleece The story is of great antiquity and was current in the time of Homer eighth century BC It survives in various forms among which the details vary br Nowadays the heraldic variations of the Golden Fleece are featured frequently in Georgia especially for Coats of Arms and Flags associated with Western Georgian Historical Colchis municipalities and cities including the Coats of Arms of City of Kutaisi the ancient capital city of Colchis br br Athamas the founder of Thessaly but also king of the city of Orchomenus in Boeotia a region of southeastern Greece took the goddess Nephele as his first wife They had two children the boy Phrixus whose name means curly as in the texture of the ram s fleece and the girl Helle Later Athamas became enamored of and married Ino the daughter of Cadmus When Nephele left in anger drought came upon the land br Ino was jealous of her stepchildren and plotted their deaths in some versions she persuaded Athamas that sacrificing Phrixus was the only way to end the drought Nephele or her spirit appeared to the children with a winged ram whose fleece was of gold The ram had been sired by Poseidon in his primitive ram form upon Theophane a nymph and the granddaughter of Helios the sun god According to Hyginus Poseidon carried Theophane to an island where he made her into a ewe so that he could have his way with her among the flocks There Theophane s other suitors could not distinguish the ram god and his consort br Nephele s children escaped on the yellow ram over the sea but Helle fell off and drowned in the strait now named after her the Hellespont The ram spoke to Phrixus encouraging him and took the boy safely to Colchis modern day south east coastal region of the Black Sea on the easternmost shore of the Euxine Black Sea br There the ram was sacrificed to gods br In essence this act returned the ram to the god Poseidon and the ram became the constellation Aries br Phrixus settled in the house of Ae tes son of Helios the sun god He hung the Golden Fleece preserved from the ram on an oak in a grove sacred to Ares the god of war and one of the Twelve Olympians The fleece was guarded by a never sleeping dragon with teeth that could become soldiers when planted in the ground The dragon was at the foot of the tree on which the fleece was placed br In some versions of the story Jason attempts to put the guard serpent to sleep br br Pindar employed the quest for the Golden Fleece in his Fourth Pythian Ode written in BC though the fleece is not in the foreground When Ae tes challenges Jason to yoke the fire breathing bulls the fleece is the prize Let the King do this the captain of the ship Let him do this I say and have for his own the immortal coverlet the fleece glowing with matted skeins of gold br In later versions of the story the ram is said to have been the offspring of the sea god Poseidon and Themisto less often Nephele or Theophane The classic telling is the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes composed in the mid third century BC Alexandria recasting early sources that have not survived Another much less known Argonautica using the same body of myth was composed in Latin by Valerius Flaccus during the time of Vespasian br Where the written sources fail through accidents of history sometimes the continuity of a mythic tradition can be found among the vase painters The story of the Golden Fleece appeared to have little resonance for Athenians of the Classic age for only two representations of it on Attic painted wares of the fifth century have been identified a krater at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a kylix in the Vatican collections In the kylix painted by Douris c Jason is being disgorged from the mouth of the dragon a detail that does not fit easily into the literary sources behind the dragon the fleece hangs from an apple tree Jason s helper in the Athenian vase paintings is not Medea who had a history in Athens as the opponent of Theseus but Athena br br A long time ago fleeces were considered very important br Several euhemeristic attempts to interpret the Golden Fleece realistically as reflecting some physical cultural object or alleged historical practice have been made For example in the th century some scholars suggested that the story of the Golden Fleece signified the bringing of sheep husbandry to Greece from the east in other readings scholars theorized it referred to golden grain or to the Sun br br A more widespread interpretation relates the myth of the fleece to a method of washing gold from streams which was well attested but only from c th century BC in the region of Georgia to the east of the Black Sea Sheep fleeces sometimes stretched over a wooden frame would be submerged in the stream and gold flecks borne down from upstream placer deposits would collect in them The fleeces would be hung in trees to dry before the gold was shaken or combed out Alternatively the fleeces would be used on washing tables in alluvial mining of gold or on washing tables at deep gold mines Judging by the very early gold objects from a range of cultures washing for gold is a very old human activity br Strabo describes the way in which gold could be washed br br It is said that in their country gold is carried down by the mountain torrents and that the barbarians obtain it by means of perforated troughs and fleecy skins and that this is the origin of the myth of the golden fleece unless they call them Iberians by the same name as the western Iberians from the gold mines in both countries br Another interpretation is based on the references in some versions to purple or purple dyed cloth The purple dye extracted from the purple dye murex snail and related species was highly prized in ancient times Clothing made of cloth dyed with Tyrian purple was a mark of great wealth and high station hence the phrase royal purple The association of gold with purple is natural and occurs frequently in literature br br The following are the chief among the various interpretations of the fleece with notes on sources and major critical discussions br br It represents royal power br It represents the flayed skin of Krios Ram companion of Phrixus br It represents a book on alchemy br It represents a technique of writing in gold on parchment br It represents a form of placer mining practiced in Georgia for example br It represents the forgiveness of the Gods br It represents a rain cloud br It represents a land of golden grain br It represents the spring hero br It represents the sea reflecting the sun br It represents the gilded prow of Phrixus ship br It represents a breed of sheep in ancient Georgia br It represents the riches imported from the East br It represents the wealth or technology of Colchis br It was a covering for a cult image of Zeus in the form of a ram br It represents a fabric woven from sea silk br It is about a voyage from Greece through the Mediterranean across the Atlantic to the Americas br It represents trading fleece dyed murex purple for Georgian
