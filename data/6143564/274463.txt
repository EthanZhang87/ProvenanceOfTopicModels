polytheistic religions Figuratively it is used to describe a person whose talents or abilities are so superlative that they appear to approach being divine br br The English term demi god is a calque of the Latin word semideus half god The Roman poet Ovid probably coined semideus to refer to less important gods such as dryads br Compare the Greek hemitheos The term demigod first appeared in English in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century when it was used to render the Greek and Roman concepts of semideus and daemon Since then it has frequently been applied figuratively to people of extraordinary ability br br In the ancient Greek and Roman world the concept of a demigod did not have a consistent definition and associated terminology rarely appeared br The earliest recorded use of the term occurs in texts attributed to the archaic Greek poets Homer and Hesiod Both describe dead heroes as hemitheoi or half gods In these cases the word did not literally mean that these figures had one parent who was divine and one who was mortal Instead those who demonstrated strength power good family and good behavior were termed heroes and after death they could be called hemitheoi a process that has been referred to as heroization Pindar also used the term frequently as a synonym for hero br According to the Roman author Cassius Dio the Roman Senate declared Julius Caesar a demigod after his BCE victory at Thapsus However Dio was writing in the third century CE centuries after the death of Caesar and modern critics have cast doubt on whether the Senate really did this br The first Roman to employ the term demigod may have been the poet Ovid or CE who used the Latin semideus several times in reference to minor deities The poet Lucan also uses the term to speak of Pompey attaining divinity upon his death in BCE In later antiquity the Roman writer Martianus Capella fl proposed a hierarchy of gods as follows br br the gods proper or major gods br the genii or daemones br the demigods or semones who dwell in the upper atmosphere br the manes and ghosts of heroes who dwell in the lower atmosphere br the earth dwelling gods like fauns and satyrs br

of what is today Northern Portugal and Galicia br br In Hinduism the term demigod is used to refer to deities who were once human and later became devas gods There are two notable demigods in Vedic Scriptures br Nandi the divine vehicle of Shiva and Garuda the divine steed of Vishnu Examples of demigods worshiped in South India are Madurai Veeran and Karuppu Sami br The heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata the five Pandava brothers and their half brother Karna fit the Western definition of demigods though they are generally not referred to as such Queen Kunti the wife of King Pandu was given a mantra that when recited meant that one of the Gods would give her his child When her husband was cursed to die if he ever engaged in sexual relations Kunti used this mantra to provide her husband with children fathered by various deities These children were Yudhishthira child of Dharmaraj Bhima child of Vayu and Arjuna child of Indra She taught this mantra to Madri King Pandu s other wife and she immaculately conceived twin boys named Nakula and Sahadeva children of the Ashvins Queen Kunti had previously conceived another son Karna when she had tested the mantra out Despite her protests Surya the sun god was compelled by the mantra to impregnate her Bhishma is another figures who fits the western definition of demigod as he was the son of king Shantanu and Goddess Ganga br The Vaishnavites who often translate deva as demigod cite various verses that speak of the devas subordinate status For example the Rig Veda reads o tad vi o paramam padam sad pa yanti s raya which translates to All the suras i e the devas look always toward the feet of Lord Vishnu Similarly in the Vishnu Sahasranama the concluding verses read The Rishis great sages the ancestors the devas the great elements in fact all things moving and unmoving constituting this universe have originated from Narayana i e Vishnu Thus the Devas are stated to be subordinate to Vishnu or God br A C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness ISKCON translates the Sanskrit word deva as demigod in his literature when the term referred to a God other than the Supreme Lord This is because the Vaishnava tradition teaches that there is only one Supreme Lord and that all others are but His servants In an effort to emphasize their subservience Prabhupada uses the word demigod as a translation of deva However there are at least three occurrences in the eleventh chapter of Bhagavad Gita where the word deva used in reference to Lord Krishna is translated as Lord The word deva can be used to refer to the Supreme Lord celestial beings and saintly souls depending on the context This is similar to the word Bhagavan which is translated according to different contexts br br Among the demigods in Chinese mythology Erlang Shen and Chen Xiang are most prominent In the Journey to the West the Jade Emperor s younger sister Yaoji is mentioned to have descended to the mortal realm and given birth to a child named Yang Jian He would eventually grow up to become a deity himself known as Erlang Shen br Chen Xiang is nephew of Erlang Shen birth by
