id: 574742
In ancient Greek religion and mythology the twelve Olympians are the major deities of the Greek pantheon commonly considered to be Zeus Poseidon Hera Demeter Aphrodite Athena Artemis Apollo Ares Hephaestus Hermes and either Hestia or Dionysus They were called Olympians because according to tradition they resided on Mount Olympus br Besides the twelve Olympians there were many other cultic groupings of twelve gods br br br Olympians br The Olympians were a race of deities primarily consisting of a third and fourth generation of immortal beings worshipped as the principal gods of the Greek pantheon and so named because of their residency atop Mount Olympus They gained their supremacy in a ten year long war of gods in which Zeus led his siblings to victory over the previous generation of ruling immortal beings the Titans children of the primordial deities Gaia and Uranus They were a family of gods the most important consisting of the first generation of Olympians offspring of the Titans Cronus and Rhea Zeus Poseidon Hera Demeter and Hestia along with the principal offspring of Zeus Aphrodite Athena Artemis Apollo Ares Hephaestus Hermes and Dionysus Although Hades was a major deity in the Greek pantheon and was the brother of Zeus and the other first generation of Olympians his realm was far away from Olympus in the underworld and thus he was not usually considered to be one of the Olympians Olympic gods can be contrasted to chthonic gods including Hades and his wife Persephone by mode of sacrifice the latter receiving sacrifices in a bothros pit or megaron sunken chamber rather than at an altar br The canonical number of Olympian gods was twelve but besides the thirteen principal Olympians listed above there were many other residents of Olympus who thus might be considered to be Olympians Heracles became a resident of Olympus after his apotheosis and married another Olympian resident Hebe According to Diodorus Siculus some said that Heracles was offered a place among the twelve but refused as it would mean one of the original twelve being cast out In the Iliad the goddess Themis who is listed among the twelve Titans dwells on Olympus alongside the other gods making her a Titan and an Olympian at the same time According to Hesiod the children of Styx Zelus Envy Nike Victory Kratos Strength and Bia Force have no house apart from Zeus nor any dwelling nor path except that wherein God leads them but they dwell always with Zeus Some others who might be considered Olympians include the Horae the Graces the Muses Eileithyia Iris Dione and Ganymede br br br Twelve gods br Besides the twelve Olympians there were many other various cultic groupings of twelve gods throughout ancient Greece The earliest evidence of Greek religious practice involving twelve gods Greek d dek theon from d deka twelve and theoi gods comes no earlier than the late sixth century BC According to Thucydides an altar of the twelve gods was established in the agora of Athens by the archon Pisistratus son of Hippias and the grandson of the tyrant Pisistratus around BC The altar became the central point from which distances from Athens were measured and a place of supplication and refuge br Olympia apparently also had an early tradition of twelve gods The Homeric Hymn to Hermes c BC has the god Hermes divide a sacrifice of two cows he has stolen from Apollo into twelve parts on the banks of the river Alpheus presumably at Olympia br br Next glad hearted Hermes dragged the rich meats he had prepared and put them on a smooth flat stone and divided them into twelve portions distributed by lot making each portion wholly honorable br Pindar in an ode written to be sung at Olympia c BC has Heracles sacrificing alongside the Alpheus to the twelve ruling gods br br Heracles enclosed the Altis all around and marked it off in the open and he made the encircling area a resting place for feasting honoring the stream of the Alpheus along with the twelve ruling gods br Another of Pindar s Olympian odes mentions six double altars Herodorus of Heraclea c BC also has Heracles founding a shrine at Olympia with six pairs of gods each pair sharing a single altar br Many other places had cults of the twelve gods including Delos Chalcedon Magnesia on the Maeander and Leontinoi in Sicily As with the twelve Olympians although the number of gods was fixed at twelve the membership varied While the majority of the gods included as members of these other cults of twelve gods were Olympians non Olympians were also sometimes included For example Herodorus of Heraclea identified the six pairs of gods at Olympia as Zeus and Poseidon Hera and Athena Hermes and Apollo the Graces and Dionysus Artemis and Alpheus and Cronus and Rhea Thus while this list includes the eight Olympians Zeus Poseidon Hera Athena Hermes Apollo Artemis and Dionysus it also contains three clear non Olympians the Titan parents of the first generation of Olympians Cronus and Rhea and the river god Alpheus with the status of the Graces here apparently counted as one god being unclear br Plato connected twelve gods with the twelve months and implies that he considered Pluto Or Hades one of the twelve in proposing that the final month be devoted to him and the spirits of the dead br The Roman poet Ennius gives the Roman equivalents the Dii Consentes as six male female complements preserving the place of Vesta Greek Hestia who played a crucial role in Roman religion as a state goddess maintained by the Vestals br br br List br There is
