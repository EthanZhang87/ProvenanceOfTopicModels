Narmer Ancient Egyptian n r mr may mean painful catfish stinging catfish harsh catfish or fierce catfish was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period whose reign began at a date estimated to fall in the range BC He was the successor to the Protodynastic king Ka Many scholars consider him the unifier of Egypt and founder of the First Dynasty and in turn the first king of a unified Egypt He also had a prominently noticeable presence in Canaan compared to his predecessors and successors Neithhotep is thought to be his queen consort or his daughter br A majority of Egyptologists believe that Narmer was the same person as Menes br br Although highly interrelated the questions of who was Menes and who unified Egypt are actually two separate issues Narmer is often credited with the unification of Egypt by means of the conquest of Lower Egypt by Upper Egypt Menes is traditionally considered the first king pharaoh of Ancient Egypt and is identified by the majority of Egyptologists as the same person as Narmer although a vigorous debate also proposes identification with Hor Aha Narmer s successor as a primary alternative br The issue is confusing because Narmer is a Horus name while Menes is a Sedge and Bee name personal or birth name All of the King Lists which began to appear in the New Kingdom era list the personal names of the kings and almost all begin with Menes or begin with divine and or semi divine rulers with Menes as the first human king The difficulty is aligning the contemporary archaeological evidence which lists Horus Names with the King Lists that list personal names br Two documents have been put forward as proof either that Narmer was Menes or alternatively Hor Aha was Menes The first is the Naqada Label found at the site of Naqada in the tomb of Queen Neithhotep often assumed to have been the mother of Horus Aha The label shows a serekh of Hor Aha next to an enclosure inside of which are symbols that have been interpreted by some scholars as the name Menes The second is the seal impression from Abydos that alternates between a serekh of Narmer and the chessboard symbol mn which is interpreted as an abbreviation of Menes Arguments have been made with regard to each of these documents in favour of Narmer or Hor Aha being Menes but in neither case is the argument conclusive br The second document the seal impression from Abydos shows the serekh of Narmer alternating with the gameboard sign mn together with its phonetic complement the n sign which is always shown when the full name of Menes is written again representing the name Menes At first glance this would seem to be strong evidence that Narmer was Menes However based on an analysis of other early First Dynasty seal impressions which contain the name of one or more princes the seal impression has been interpreted by other scholars as showing the name of a prince of Narmer named Menes hence Menes was Narmer s successor Hor Aha and thus Hor Aha was Menes This was refuted by Cervell Autuori pp but opinions still vary and the seal impression cannot be said to definitively support either theory br br Two necropolis sealings found in and in Abydos Umm el Qa ab in or near the tombs of Den and Qa a show Narmer as the first king on each list followed by Hor Aha The Qa a sealing lists all eight of the kings of what scholars now call the First Dynasty in the correct order starting with Narmer These necropolis sealings are strong evidence that Narmer was the first king of the First Dynasty hence the same person as Menes br br The complete spelling of Narmer s name consists of the hieroglyphs for a catfish n r and a chisel mr hence the reading Narmer using the rebus principle This word is sometimes translated as raging catfish However there is no consensus on this reading Other translations of the adjective before catfish include angry fighting fierce painful furious bad evil biting menacing and stinging Some scholars have taken entirely different approaches to reading the name that do not include catfish in the name at all but these approaches have not been generally accepted br Rather than incorporating both hieroglyphs Narmer s name is often shown in an abbreviated form with just the catfish symbol sometimes stylized even in some cases represented by just a horizontal line This simplified spelling appears to be related to the formality of the context In every case that a serekh is shown on a work of stone or an official seal impression it has both symbols But in most cases where the name is shown on a piece of pottery or a rock inscription just the catfish or a simplified version of it appears br Two alternative spellings of Narmer s name have also been found On a mud sealing from Tarkhan the symbol for the j bird Gardiner sign G duckling has been added to the two symbols for Narmer within the serekh This has been interpreted as meaning Narmer the masculine however according to Ilona Regulski The third sign the j bird is not an integral part of the royal name since it occurs so infrequently Godron suggested that the extra sign is not part of the name but was put inside the serekh for compositional convenience br In addition two necropolis seals from Abydos show the name in a unique way While the chisel is shown conventionally where the catfish would be expected there is a symbol that has been interpreted by several scholars as an animal skin According to Dreyer it is probably a catfish with a bull s tail similar to the image of Narmer on the Narmer Palette in which he is shown wearing a bull s tail as a symbol of power br br The date commonly given for the beginning of Narmer s reign is c BC Other mainstream estimates using both the historical method and radiocarbon dating are in the range c BC br br The famous Narmer Palette discovered by James E Quibell in the season at Hierakonpolis shows Narmer wearing the crown of Upper Egypt on one side of the palette and the crown of Lower Egypt on the other side giving rise to the theory that Narmer unified the two lands Since its discovery however it has been debated whether the Narmer Palette represents an actual historic event or is purely symbolic Of course the Narmer Palette could represent an actual historical event while at the same time having a symbolic significance br In G nter Dreyer discovered a year label of Narmer at Abydos depicting the same event that is depicted on the Narmer Palette In the First Dynasty years were identified by the name of the king and an important event that occurred in that year A year label was typically attached to a container of goods and included the name of the king a description or representation of the event that identified the year and a description of the attached goods This year label shows that the Narmer Palette depicts an actual historical event Support for this conclusion in addition to Dreyer includes Wilkinson and Davies Friedman Although this interpretation of the year label is the dominant opinion among Egyptologists there are exceptions including Baines and Wengrow br br Archaeological evidence suggests that Egypt was at least partially unified during the reigns of Ka and Iry Hor Narmer s immediate predecessors and perhaps as early as Scorpion I Tax collection is probably documented for Ka and Iry Hor The evidence for a role for Scorpion I in Lower Egypt comes from his tomb Uj in Abydos Upper Egypt where labels were found identifying goods from Lower Egypt These are not tax documents however so they are probably indications of trade rather than subjugation There is a substantial difference in the quantity and distribution of inscriptions with the names of those earlier kings in Lower Egypt and Canaan which was reached through Lower Egypt compared to the inscriptions of Narmer Ka s inscriptions have been found in three sites in Lower Egypt and one in Canaan Iry Hor inscriptions have also been found in two sites in Lower Egypt and one in Canaan This must be compared to Narmer whose serekhs have been found in ten sites in Lower Egypt and nine sites in Canaan see discussion in Tomb and Artefacts section This demonstrates a qualitative difference between Narmer s role in Lower Egypt compared to his two immediate predecessors There is no evidence in Lower Egypt of any Upper Egyptian king s presence before Iry Hor The archaeological evidence suggest that the unification began before Narmer but was completed by him through the conquest of a polity in the north west Delta as depicted on the Narmer Palette br The importance that Narmer attached to his unification of Egypt is shown by the fact that it is commemorated not only on the Narmer Palette but on a cylinder seal the Narmer Year Label and the Narmer Boxes and the consequences of the event are commemorated on the Narmer Macehead The importance of the unification to ancient Egyptians is shown by the fact that Narmer is shown as the first king on the two necropolis seals and under the name Menes the first king in the later King Lists Although there is archaeological evidence of a few kings before Narmer none of them are mentioned in any of those sources It can be accurately said that from the point of view of Ancient Egyptians history began with Narmer and the unification of Egypt and that everything before him was relegated to the realm of myth br br According to Manetho quoted in Eusebius Fr a Menes made a foreign expedition and won renown If this is correct and assuming it refers to Narmer it was undoubtedly to the land of Canaan where Narmer s serekh has been identified at nine different sites An Egyptian presence in Canaan predates Narmer but after about years of active presence in Canaan Egyptian presence peaked during Narmer s reign and quickly declined afterwards The relationship between Egypt and Canaan began around the end of the fifth millennium and apparently came to an end sometime during the Second Dynasty when it ceased altogether It peaked during Dynasty through the reign of Narmer Dating to this period are Egyptian serekhs found in Canaan among which have been attributed to Narmer Prior to Narmer only one serekh of Ka and one inscription with Iry Hor s name have been found in Canaan The serekhs earlier than Iry Hor are either generic serekhs that do not refer to a specific king or are for kings not attested in Abydos Indicative of the decline of Egyptian presence in the region after Narmer only one serekh attributed to his successor Hor Aha has been found in Canaan Even this one example is questionable Wilkinson does not believe there are any serekhs of Hor Aha outside Egypt and very few serekhs of kings for the rest of the first two dynasties have been found in Canaan br The Egyptian presence in Canaan is best demonstrated by the presence of pottery made from Egyptian Nile clay and found in Canaan as well as pottery made from local clay but in the Egyptian style The latter suggests the existence of Egyptian colonies rather than just trade br The nature of Egypt s role in Canaan has been vigorously debated between scholars who suggest a military invasion and others proposing that only trade and colonization were involved Although the latter has gained predominance the presence of fortifications at Tell es Sakan dating to Dynasty through early Dynasty period and built almost entirely using an Egyptian style of construction demonstrate that there must have also been some kind of Egyptian military presence br Regardless of the nature of Egypt s presence in Canaan control of trade to and through Canaan was important to Ancient Egypt Narmer probably did not establish Egypt s initial influence in Canaan by a military invasion but a military campaign by Narmer to re assert Egyptian authority or to increase its sphere of influence in the region is certainly plausible In addition to the quote by Manetho and the large number of Narmer serekhs found in Canaan a recent reconstruction of a box of Narmer s by Dreyer may have commemorated a military campaign in Canaan It may also represent just the presentation of tribute to Narmer by Canaanites br br Narmer and Hor Aha s names were both found in what is believed to be Neithhotep s tomb which led Egyptologists to conclude that she was Narmer s queen and mother of Hor Aha Neithhotep s name means Neith is satisfied This suggests that she was a princess of Lower Egypt based on the fact that Neith is the patron goddess of Sais in the Western Delta exactly the area Narmer conquered to complete the unification of Egypt and that this was a marriage to consolidate the two regions of Egypt The fact that her tomb is in Naqada in Upper Egypt has led some to the conclusion that she was a descendant of the predynastic rulers of Naqada who ruled prior to its incorporation into a united Upper Egypt It has also been suggested that the Narmer Macehead commemorates this wedding However the discovery in of rock inscriptions in Sinai by Pierre Tallet raise questions about whether she was really Narmer s wife Neithhotep is probably the earliest non mythical woman in history whose name is known to us today br br Narmer s tomb in Umm el Qa ab near Abydos in Upper Egypt consists of two joined chambers B and B lined in mud brick Although both mile Am lineau and Petrie excavated tombs B and B it was only in that Kaiser identified them as being Narmer s Narmer s tomb is located next to the tombs of Ka who likely ruled Upper Egypt just before Narmer and Hor Aha who was his immediate successor br As the tomb dates back more than years and has been pillaged repeatedly from antiquity to modern times it is amazing that anything useful could be discovered in it Because of the repeated disturbances in Umm el Qa ab many articles of Narmer s were found in other graves and objects of other kings were recovered in Narmer s grave However Flinders Petrie during the period and starting in the s the German Archaeological Institute DAI have made discoveries of the greatest importance to the history of Early Egypt by their re excavation of the tombs of Umm el Qa ab br Despite the chaotic condition of the cemetery inscriptions on both wood and bone seal impressions as well as dozens of flint arrowheads were found Petrie says with dismay that hundreds of arrowheads were discovered by the French presumably Am lineau What happened to them is not clear but none ended up in the Cairo Museum Flint knives and a fragment of an ebony chair leg were also discovered in Narmer s tomb all of which might be part of the original funerary assemblage The flint knives and fragment of a chair leg were not included in any of Petrie s publications but are now at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology University College London registration numbers UC UC and UC According to Dreyer these arrowheads are probably from the tomb of Djer where similar arrowheads were found br It is likely that all of the kings of Ancient Egypt buried in Umm el Qa ab had funerary enclosures in Abydos northern cemetery near the cultivation line These were characterized by large mud brick walls that enclosed space in which funerary ceremonies are believed to have taken place Eight enclosures have been excavated two of which have not been definitely identified While it has yet to be confirmed one of these unidentified funerary enclosures may have belonged to Narmer br br Narmer is well attested throughout Egypt southern Canaan and Sinai altogether inscriptions at sites At Abydos and Hierakonpolis Narmer s name appears both within a serekh and without reference to a serekh At every other site except Coptos Narmer s name appears in a serekh In Egypt his name has been found at sites br br in Upper Egypt Hierakonpolis Naqada Abydos and Coptos br in Lower Egypt Tarkhan Helwan Zawyet el Aryan Tell Ibrahim Awad Ezbet el Tell Minshat Abu Omar Saqqara Buto Tell el Farkha and Kafr Hassan Dawood br in the Eastern Desert Wadi el Qaash br in the Western Desert Kharga Oasis and Gebel Tjauti br During Narmer s reign Egypt had an active economic presence in southern Canaan Pottery sherds have been discovered at several sites both from pots made in Egypt and imported to Canaan and others made in the Egyptian style out of local materials Twenty serekhs have been found in Canaan that may belong to Narmer but seven of those are uncertain or controversial These serekhs came from eight different sites Tel Arad En Besor Ein HaBesor Tell es Sakan Nahal Tillah Halif Terrace Tel Erani Tel Gat Small Tel Malhata Tel Ma ahaz and Tel Lod br Narmer s serekh along with those of other Predynastic and Early Dynastic kings has been found at the Wadi Ameyra in the southern Sinai where inscriptions commemorate Egyptian mining expeditions to the area br br First recorded at the end of the th century an important series of rock carvings at Nag el Hamdulab near Aswan was rediscovered in and its importance only realized then Among the many inscriptions tableau a shows a man wearing a headdress similar to the White Crown of Upper Egypt and carrying a scepter He is followed by a man with a fan He is then preceded by two men with standards and accompanied by a dog Apart from the dog motif this scene is similar to scenes on the Scorpion Macehead and the recto of the Narmer Palette The man equipped with pharaonic regalia the crown and scepter can clearly be identified as a king Although no name appears in the tableau Darnell attributes it to Narmer based on the iconography and suggests that it might represent an actual visit to the region by Narmer for a Following of Horus ritual In an interview in Gatto also describes the king in the inscription as Narmer However Hendricks places the scene slightly before Narmer based in part on the uncharacteristic absence of Narmer s royal name in the inscription br br The First Pharaoh The First Dynasty Book
