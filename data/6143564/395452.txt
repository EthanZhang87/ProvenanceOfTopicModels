id: 395452
In Greek mythology Calypso Ancient Greek romanized Kalups lit she who conceals was a nymph who lived on the island of Ogygia where according to Homer s Odyssey she detained Odysseus for seven years against his will She promised Odysseus immortality if he would stay with her but Odysseus preferred to return home Eventually after the intervention of the other gods Calypso was forced to let Odysseus go br br The name Calypso may derive from the Ancient Greek kalypt meaning to cover to conceal or to hide According to Etymologicum Magnum her name means concealing the knowledge kal ptousa to dianoo menon which combined with the Homeric epithet dol essa meaning subtle or wily justifies the reclusive character of Calypso and her island An alternative explanation is that Calypso derives from versions of Kal psis meaning Beautiful Sight br br Calypso is generally said to be the daughter of the Titan Atlas Her mother is mostly unnamed but Hyginus wrote that it was Pleione mother of the Pleiades Hesiod and the Homeric Hymn to Demeter mention either a different Calypso or possibly the same Calypso as one of the Oceanid daughters of Tethys and Oceanus Apollodorus includes the name Calypso in his list of Nereids the daughters of Nereus and Doris John Tzetzes makes her a daughter of Helios and the Oceanid nymph Perse the parents of Circe perhaps due to her association with Circe the two goddesses were sometimes confused due to their behaviour and connection to Odysseus According to a fragment from the Catalogue of Women Calypso bore the Cephalonians to Hermes as suggested by Hermes visits to her island in the Odyssey br br In Homer s Odyssey Calypso tries to keep the fabled Greek hero Odysseus on her island to make him her immortal husband while he also gets to enjoy her sensual pleasures forever According to Homer Calypso kept Odysseus prisoner by force at Ogygia for seven years Calypso enchants Odysseus with her singing as she moves to and fro weaving on her loom with a golden shuttle br Odysseus comes to wish for circumstances to change He can no longer bear being separated from his wife Penelope and wants to tell Calypso He is seen sitting on a headland crying and at night he is forced to have sexual intercourse with her against his will His patron goddess Athena asks Zeus to order the release of Odysseus from the island Zeus orders the messenger Hermes to tell Calypso to set Odysseus free for it was not Odysseus s destiny to live with her forever She angrily comments on how the gods hate goddesses having affairs with mortals br Calypso provides Odysseus with an axe drill and adze to build a boat Calypso leads Odysseus to an island where he can chop down trees and make planks for his boat Calypso also provides him with wine bread clothing and more materials for his boat The goddess then sets wind at his back when he sets sail After seven years Odysseus has built his boat and leaves Calypso br br Homer does not mention any children by Calypso By some accounts that came after the Odyssey Calypso bore Odysseus a son Latinus though Circe is usually given as Latinus mother In other accounts Calypso bore Odysseus two children Nausithous and Nausinous br The story of Odysseus and Calypso has some close resemblances to the interactions between Gilgamesh and Siduri in the Epic of Gilgamesh in that the lone female plies the inconsolable hero wanderer with drink and sends him off to a place beyond the sea reserved for a special class of honoured people and to prepare for the voyage he has to cut down and trim timbers br A fragment from the Catalogue of Women erroneously attributed to Hesiod claimed that Calypso detained Odysseus for years as a favour to Poseidon the sea god who detested Odysseus for blinding his son Polyphemus br According to Hyginus Calypso killed herself because of her love for Odysseus br br In her poem Calypso Watching the Ocean Letitia Landon describes her as eternally yearning for Odysseus return and comments on the folly of such obsession br br Philosophers have written about the meaning of Calypso in the world of ancient Greece Ryan Patrick Hanley commented on the interpretation of Calypso in Les Aventures de T l maque written by F nelon Hanley says that the story of Calypso illustrates the link between Eros and pride Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer brought attention to the combination of power over fate and the sensibility of bourgeois housewives in the depiction of Calypso br br Calypso in Art br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
