Ares Ancient Greek r s r s is the Greek god of war and courage He is one of the Twelve Olympians and the son of Zeus and Hera The Greeks were ambivalent towards him He embodies the physical valor necessary for success in war but can also personify sheer brutality and bloodlust in contrast to his sister Athena whose martial functions include military strategy and generalship An association with Ares endows places objects and other deities with a savage dangerous or militarized quality br Although Ares name shows his origins as Mycenaean his reputation for savagery was thought by some to reflect his likely origins as a Thracian deity Some cities in Greece and several in Asia Minor held annual festivals to bind and detain him as their protector In parts of Asia Minor he was an oracular deity Still further away from Greece the Scythians were said to ritually kill one in a hundred prisoners of war as an offering to their equivalent of Ares The later belief that ancient Spartans had offered human sacrifice to Ares may owe more to mythical prehistory misunderstandings and reputation than to reality br Though there are many literary allusions to Ares love affairs and children he has a limited role in Greek mythology When he does appear he is often humiliated In the Trojan War Aphrodite protector of Troy persuades Ares to take the Trojans side The Trojans lose while Ares sister Athena helps the Greeks to victory Most famously when the craftsman god Hephaestus discovers his wife Aphrodite is having an affair with Ares he traps the lovers in a net and exposes them to the ridicule of the other gods br Ares nearest counterpart in Roman religion is Mars who was given a more important and dignified place in ancient Roman religion as ancestral protector of the Roman people and state During the Hellenization of Latin literature the myths of Ares were reinterpreted by Roman writers under the name of Mars and in later Western art and literature the mythology of the two figures became virtually indistinguishable br br The etymology of the name Ares is traditionally connected with the Greek word ar the Ionic form of the Doric ara bane ruin curse imprecation Walter Burkert notes that Ares is apparently an ancient abstract noun meaning throng of battle war R S P Beekes has suggested a Pre Greek origin of the name The earliest attested form of the name is the Mycenaean Greek a re written in the Linear B syllabic script br The adjectival epithet Areios warlike was frequently appended to the names of other gods when they took on a warrior aspect or became involved in warfare Zeus Areios Athena Areia even Aphrodite Areia Aphrodite within Ares or feminine Ares who was warlike fully armoured and armed partnered with Athena in Sparta and represented at Kythira s temple to Aphrodite Urania br In the Iliad the word ares is used as a common noun synonymous with battle br In the Classical period Ares is given the epithet Enyalios which seems to appear on the Mycenaean KN V tablet as e nu wa ri jo Enyalios was sometimes identified with Ares and sometimes differentiated from him as another war god with separate cult even in the same town Burkert describes them as doubles almost br br In mainland Greece and the Peloponnese only a few places are known to have had a formal temple and cult of Ares Pausanias nd century AD notes an altar to Ares at Olympia and the moving of a Temple of Ares to the Athenian agora during the reign of Augustus essentially rededicating it AD as a Roman temple to the Augustan Mars Ultor The Areopagus mount of Ares a natural rock outcrop in Athens some distance from the Acropolis was supposedly where Ares was tried and acquitted by the gods for his revenge killing of Poseidon s son Halirrhothius who had raped Ares daughter Alcippe Its name was used for the court that met there mostly to investigate and try potential cases of treason br Numismatist M Jessop Price states that Ares typified the traditional Spartan character but had no important cult in Sparta and he never occurs on Spartan coins Pausanias gives two examples of his cult both of them conjointly with or within a warlike Aphrodite on the Spartan acropolis Gonzalez observes in his survey of Ares cults in Asia Minor that cults to Ares on the Greek mainland may have been more common than some sources assert Wars between Greek states were endemic war and warriors provided Ares s tribute and fed his insatiable appetite for battle br Ares attributes are instruments of war a helmet shield and sword or spear Libanius makes the apple sacred to Ares but offers no further comment nor connections to any aetiological myth Apples are one of Aphrodites sacred or symbolic fruits Littlewood follows Artemidorus claim that to dream of sour apples presages conflict and lists Ares alongside Eris and the mythological Apples of Discord br br Gods were immortal but could be bound and restrained both in mythic narrative and in cult practice There was an archaic Spartan statue of Ares in chains in the temple of Enyalios sometimes regarded as the son of Ares sometimes as Ares himself which Pausanias claimed meant that the spirit of war and victory was to be kept in the city The Spartans are known to have ritually bound the images of other deities including Aphrodite and Artemis cf Ares and Aphrodite bound by Hephaestus and in other places there were chained statues of Artemis and Dionysos br Statues of Ares in chains are described in the instructions given by an oracle of the late Hellenistic era to various cities of Pamphylia in Anatolia including Syedra Lycia and Cilicia places almost perpetually under threat from pirates Each was told to set up a statue of bloody man slaying Ares and provide it with an annual festival in which it was ritually bound with iron fetters by Dike and Hermes as if a supplicant for justice put on trial and offered sacrifice The oracle promises that thus will he become a peaceful deity for you once he has driven the enemy horde far from your country and he will give rise to prosperity much prayed for This Ares karpodotes giver of Fruits is well attested in Lycia and Pisidia br br Like most Greek deities Ares was given animal sacrifice in Sparta after battle he was given an ox for a victory by stratagem or a rooster for victory through onslaught The usual recipient of sacrifice before battle was Athena Reports of historic human sacrifice to Ares in an obscure rite known as the Hekatomphonia represent a very long standing error repeated through several centuries and well into the modern era The hekatomphonia was an animal sacrifice to Zeus it could be offered by any warrior who had personally slain one hundred of the enemy Pausanias reports that in Sparta each company of youths sacrificed a puppy to Enyalios before engaging in a hand to hand fight without rules at the Phoebaeum The chthonic night time sacrifice of a dog to Enyalios became assimilated to the cult of Ares Porphyry claims without detail that Apollodorus of Athens circa second century BC says the Spartans made human sacrifices to Ares but this may be a reference to mythic pre history br br A Thracian god identified by Herodotus c c BC as Ares through interpretatio Graeca was one of three otherwise unnamed deities that Thracian commoners were said to worship Herodotus recognises and names the other two as Dionysus and Artemis and claims that the Thracian aristocracy exclusively worshiped Hermes In Herodotus Histories the Scythians worship an indigenous form of Greek Ares who is otherwise unnamed but ranked beneath Tabiti whom Herodotus claims as a form of Hestia Api and Papaios in Scythia s divine hierarchy His cult object was an iron sword The Scythian Ares was offered blood sacrifices or ritual killings of cattle horses and one in every hundred human war captives whose blood was used to douse the sword Statues and complex platform altars made of heaped brushwood were devoted to him This sword cult or one very similar is said to have persisted among the Alans Some have posited that the Sword of Mars in later European history alludes to the Huns having adopted Ares br br In some parts of Asia Minor Ares was a prominent oracular deity something not found in any Hellennic cult to Ares or Roman cult to Mars Ares was linked in some regions or polities with a local god or cultic hero and recognised as a higher more prestigious deity than in mainland Greece His cults in southern Asia Minor are attested from the th century BC and well into the later Roman Imperial era at different sites and on over local coin issues He is sometimes represented on coinage of the region by the Helmet of Ares or carrying a spear and a shield or as a fully armed warrior sometimes accompanied by a female deity In what is now western Turkey the Hellenistic city of Metropolis built a monumental temple to Ares as the city s protector not before the rd century BC It is now lost but the names of some of its priests and priestesses survive along with the temple s likely depictions on coins of the province br br A sanctuary of Aphrodite was established at Sta Lenika on Crete between the cities of Lato and Olus possibly during the Geometric period It was rebuilt in the late nd century BC as a double sanctuary to Ares and Aphrodite Inscriptions record disputes over the ownership of the sanctuary The names of Ares and Aphrodite appear as witness to sworn oaths and there is a Victory thanks offering to Aphrodite whom Millington believes had capacity as a warrior protector acting in the realm of Ares There were cultic links between the Sta Lenika sanctuary Knossos and other Cretan states and perhaps with Argos on the mainland While the Greek literary and artistic record from both the Archaic and Classical eras connects Ares and Aphrodite as complementary companions and ideal though adulterous lovers their cult pairing and Aphrodite as warrior protector is localised to Crete br br In Africa Ma rem the principal god of the kings of Aksum prior to the th century AD was invoked as Ares in Greek inscriptions The anonymous king who commissioned the Monumentum Adulitanum in the late nd or early rd century refers to my greatest god Ares who also begat me through whom I brought under my sway various peoples The monumental throne celebrating the king s conquests was itself dedicated to Ares In the early th century the last pagan king of Aksum Ezana referred to the one who brought me forth the invincible Ares br br Ares was one of the Twelve Olympians in the archaic tradition represented by the Iliad and Odyssey In Greek literature Ares often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war and is the personification of sheer brutality and bloodlust overwhelming insatiable in battle destructive and man slaughtering as Burkert puts it in contrast to his sister the armored Athena whose functions as a goddess of intelligence include military strategy and generalship An association with Ares endows places and objects with a savage dangerous or militarized quality but when Ares does appear in myths he typically faces humiliation br In the Iliad Zeus expresses a recurring Greek revulsion toward the god when Ares returns wounded and complaining from the battlefield at Troy br br Then looking at him darkly Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him Do not sit beside me and whine you double faced liar To me you are the most hateful of all gods who hold Olympus Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart wars and battles And yet I will not long endure to see you in pain sinceyou are my child and it was to me that your mother bore you But were you born of some other god and proved so ruinouslong since you would have been dropped beneath the gods of the bright sky br This ambivalence is expressed also in the Greeks association of Ares with the Thracians whom they regarded as a barbarous and warlike people Thrace was considered to be Ares s birthplace and his refuge after the affair with Aphrodite was exposed to the general mockery of the other gods br br A late th century BC funerary inscription from Attica emphasizes the consequences of coming under Ares s sway Stay and mourn at the tomb of dead KroisosWhom raging Ares destroyed one day fighting in the foremost ranks br br Homeric Hymn to Ares trans Evelyn White Greek epic th to th centuries BC br Ares exceeding in strength chariot rider golden helmed doughty in heart shield bearer Saviour of cities harnessed in bronze strong of arm unwearying mighty with the spear O defence of Olympus father of warlike Victory ally of Themis stern governor of the rebellious leader of righteous men sceptred King of manliness who whirl your fiery sphere among the planets in their sevenfold courses through the aether wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above the third firmament of heaven hear me helper of men giver of dauntless youth Shed down a kindly ray from above upon my life and strength of war that I may be able to drive away bitter cowardice from my head and crush down the deceitful impulses of my soul Restrain also the keen fury of my heart which provokes me to tread the ways of blood curdling strife Rather O blessed one give you me boldness to abide within the harmless laws of peace avoiding strife and hatred and the violent fiends of death br Orphic Hymn to Ares trans Taylor Greek hymns rd century BCE to nd century CE br To Ares Fumigation from Frankincense Magnanimous unconquered boisterous Ares in darts rejoicing and in bloody wars fierce and untamed whose mighty power can make the strongest walls from their foundations shake mortal destroying king defiled with gore pleased with war s dreadful and tumultuous roar Thee human blood and swords and spears delight and the dire ruin of mad savage fight Stay furious contests and avenging strife whose works with woe embitter human life to lovely Kyrpis Aphrodite and to Lyaios Dionysos yield for arms exchange the labours of the field encourage peace to gentle works inclined and give abundance with benignant mind br br He is one of the Twelve Olympians and the son of Zeus and Hera br br In the Argonautica the Golden Fleece hangs in a grove sacred to Ares until its theft by Jason The Birds of Ares Ornithes Areioi drop feather darts in defense of the Amazons shrine to Ares as father of their queen on a coastal island in the Black Sea br br Ares plays a central role in the founding myth of Thebes as the progenitor of the water dragon slain by Cadmus The dragon s teeth were sown into the ground as if a crop and sprang up as the fully armored autochthonic Spartoi Cadmus placed himself in the god s service for eight years to atone for killing the dragon To further propitiate Ares Cadmus married Harmonia a daughter of Ares s union with Aphrodite In this way Cadmus harmonized all strife and founded the city of Thebes In reality Thebes came to dominate Boeotia s great and fertile plain which in both history and myth was a battleground for competing polities According to Plutarch the plain was anciently described as The dancing floor of Ares br br In Homer s Odyssey in the tale sung by the bard in the hall of Alcinous the Sun god Helios once spied Ares and Aphrodite having sex secretly in the hall of Hephaestus her husband Helios reported the incident to Hephaestus Contriving to catch the illicit couple in the act Hephaestus fashioned a finely knitted and nearly invisible net with which to snare them At the appropriate time this net was sprung and trapped Ares and Aphrodite locked in very private embrace br But Hephaestus was not satisfied with his revenge so he invited the Olympian gods and goddesses to view the unfortunate pair For the sake of modesty the goddesses demurred but the male gods went to witness the sight Some commented on the beauty of Aphrodite others remarked that they would eagerly trade places with Ares but all who were present mocked the two Once the couple was released the embarrassed Ares returned to his homeland Thrace and Aphrodite went to Paphos br In a much later interpolated detail Ares put the young soldier Alectryon who was Ares companion in drinking and even love making by his door to warn them of Helios s arrival as Helios would tell Hephaestus of Aphrodite s infidelity if the two were discovered but Alectryon fell asleep on guard duty Helios discovered the two and alerted Hephaestus The furious Ares turned the sleepy Alectryon into a rooster which now always announces the arrival of the sun in the morning as a way of apologizing to Ares br The Chorus of Aeschylus Suppliants written BC refers to Ares as Aphrodite s mortal destroying bedfellow In the Illiad Ares helps the Trojans because of his affection for their divine protector Aphrodite she thus redirects his innate destructive savagery to her own purposes br br In one archaic myth related only in the Iliad by the goddess Dione to her daughter Aphrodite two chthonic giants the Aloadae named Otus and Ephialtes bound Ares in chains and imprisoned him in a bronze urn where he remained for thirteen months a lunar year And that would have been the end of Ares and his appetite for war if the beautiful Eriboea the young giants stepmother had not told Hermes what they had done she related In this Burkert suspects a festival of licence which is unleashed in the thirteenth month Ares was held screaming and howling in the urn until Hermes rescued him and Artemis tricked the Aloadae into slaying each other In Nonnus s Dionysiaca in the war between Cronus and Zeus Ares killed an unnamed giant son of Echidna who was allied with Cronus and described as spitting horrible poison and having snaky feet br In the nd century AD Metamorphoses of Antoninus Liberalis when the monstrous Typhon attacked Olympus the gods transformed into animals and fled to Egypt Ares changed into a fish the Lepidotus sacred to the Egyptian war god Anhur Liberalis s koine Greek text is a completely inartistic epitome of Nicander s now lost Heteroeumena nd century BC br br In Homer s Iliad Ares has no fixed allegiance He promises Athena and Hera that he will fight for the Achaeans but Aphrodite persuades him to side with the Trojans During the war Diomedes fights Hector and sees Ares fighting on the Trojans side Diomedes calls for his soldiers to withdraw Zeus grants Athena permission to drive Ares from the battlefield Encouraged by Hera and Athena Diomedes thrusts with his spear at Ares Athena drives the spear home and all sides tremble at Ares s cries Ares flees to Mount Olympus forcing the Trojans to fall back Ares overhears that his son Ascalaphus has been killed and wants to change sides again rejoining the Achaeans for vengeance disregarding Zeus s order that no Olympian should join the battle Athena stops him Later when Zeus allows the gods to fight in the war again Ares attacks Athena to avenge his previous injury Athena overpowers him by striking him with a boulder br br Deimos Terror or Dread and Phobos Fear are Ares companions in war and according to Hesiod are also his children by Aphrodite Eris the goddess of discord or Enyo the goddess of war bloodshed and violence was considered the sister and companion of the violent Ares In at least one tradition Enyalius rather than another name for Ares was his son by Enyo br Ares may also be accompanied by Kydoimos the daemon of the din of battle the Makhai Battles the Hysminai Acts of manslaughter Polemos a minor spirit of war or only an epithet of Ares since it has no specific dominion and Polemos s daughter Alala the goddess or personification of the Greek war cry whose name Ares uses as his own war cry Ares s sister Hebe Youth also draws baths for him br According to Pausanias local inhabitants of Therapne Sparta recognized Thero feral savage as a nurse of Ares br br Though Ares plays a relatively limited role in Greek mythology as represented in literary narratives his numerous love affairs and abundant offspring are often alluded to br The union of Ares and Aphrodite created the gods Eros Anteros Phobos Deimos and Harmonia Other versions include Alcippe as one of his daughters br Cycnus of Macedonia was a son of Ares who tried to build a temple to his father with the skulls and bones of guests and travellers Heracles fought him and in one account killed him In another account Ares fought his son s killer but Zeus parted the combatants with a thunderbolt br Ares had a romantic liaison with Eos the goddess of the dawn Aphrodite discovered them and in anger she cursed Eos with insatiable lust for men br By a woman named Teirene he had a daughter named Thrassa who in turn had a daughter named Polyphonte Polyphonte was cursed by Aphrodite to love and mate with a bear producing two sons Agrius and Oreius who were hubristic toward the gods and had a habit of eating their guests Zeus sent Hermes to punish them and he chose to chop off their hands and feet Since Polyphonte was descended from him Ares stopped Hermes and the two brothers came into an agreement to turn Polyphonte s family into birds instead Oreius became an eagle owl Agrius a vulture and Polyphonte a strix possibly a small owl certainly a portent of war Polyphonte s servant prayed not to become a bird of evil omen and Ares and Hermes fulfilled her wish by choosing the woodpecker for her a good omen for hunters br br Sometimes poets and dramatists recounted ancient traditions which varied and sometimes they invented new details later scholiasts might draw on either or simply guess Thus while Phobos and Deimos were regularly described as offspring of Ares others listed here such as Meleager Sinope and Solymus were sometimes said to be children of Ares and sometimes given other fathers br The following is a list of Ares offspring by various mothers Beside each offspring the earliest source to record the parentage is given along with the century to which the source dates br br The nearest counterpart of Ares among the Roman gods is Mars a son of Jupiter and Juno pre eminent among the Roman army s military gods but originally an agricultural deity As a father of Romulus Rome s legendary founder Mars was given an important and dignified place in ancient Roman religion as a guardian deity of the entire Roman state and its people Under the influence of Greek culture Mars was identified with Ares but the character and dignity of the two deities differed fundamentally Mars was represented as a means to secure peace and he was a father pater of the Roman people In one tradition he fathered Romulus and Remus through his rape of Rhea Silvia In another his lover the goddess Venus gave birth to Aeneas the Trojan prince and refugee who founded Rome several generations before Romulus br In the Hellenization of Latin literature the myths of Ares were reinterpreted by Roman writers under the name of Mars Greek writers under Roman rule also recorded cult practices and beliefs pertaining to Mars under the name of Ares Thus in the classical tradition of later Western art and literature the mythology of the two figures later became virtually indistinguishable br br In Renaissance and Neoclassical works of art Ares s symbols are a spear and helmet his animal is a dog and his bird is the vulture In literary works of these eras Ares is replaced by the Roman Mars a romantic emblem of manly valor rather than the cruel and blood thirsty god of Greek mythology br br Family tree of the Greek gods
