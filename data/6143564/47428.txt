In Greek mythology Atlas Greek tl s is a Titan condemned to hold up the heavens or sky for eternity after the Titanomachy Atlas also plays a role in the myths of two of the greatest Greek heroes Heracles Hercules in Roman mythology and Perseus According to the ancient Greek poet Hesiod Atlas stood at the ends of the earth in the extreme west Later he became commonly identified with the Atlas Mountains in northwest Africa and was said to be the first King of Mauretania modern day Morocco and much later including west Algeria not to be confused with the modern day country of Mauritania Atlas was said to have been skilled in philosophy mathematics and astronomy In antiquity he was credited with inventing the first celestial sphere In some texts he is even credited with the invention of astronomy itself br Atlas was the son of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Asia or Clymene He was a brother of Epimetheus and Prometheus He had many children mostly daughters the Hesperides the Hyades the Pleiades and the nymph Calypso who lived on the island Ogygia br The term atlas has been used to describe a collection of maps since the th century when Flemish geographer Gerardus Mercator published his work in honour of the mythological Titan br The Atlantic Ocean is derived from Sea of Atlas The name of Atlantis mentioned in Plato s Timaeus dialogue derives from Atlantis nesos Ancient Greek literally meaning Atlas s Island br br The etymology of the name Atlas is uncertain Virgil took pleasure in translating etymologies of Greek names by combining them with adjectives that explained them for Atlas his adjective is durus hard enduring which suggested to George Doig that Virgil was aware of the Greek to endure Doig offers the further possibility that Virgil was aware of Strabo s remark that the native North African name for this mountain was Douris Since the Atlas mountains rise in the region inhabited by Berbers it has been suggested that the name might be taken from one of the Berber languages specifically from the word dr r mountain br Traditionally historical linguists etymologize the Ancient Greek word genitive as comprised from copulative and the Proto Indo European root telh to uphold support whence also and which was later reshaped to an nt stem However Robert S P Beekes argues that it cannot be expected that this ancient Titan carries an Indo European name and he suggests instead that the word is of Pre Greek origin as such words often end in ant br br Atlas and his brother Menoetius sided with the Titans in their war against the Olympians the Titanomachy When the Titans were defeated many of them including Menoetius were confined to Tartarus but Zeus condemned Atlas to stand at the western edge of the earth and hold up the sky on his shoulders Thus he was Atlas Telamon enduring Atlas and became a doublet of Coeus the embodiment of the celestial axis around which the heavens revolve br A common misconception today is that Atlas was forced to hold the Earth on his shoulders but Classical art shows Atlas holding the celestial spheres not the terrestrial globe the solidity of the marble globe borne by the renowned Farnese Atlas may have aided the conflation reinforced in the th century by the developing usage of atlas to describe a corpus of terrestrial maps br br The Greek poet Polyidus c BC tells a tale of Atlas then a shepherd encountering Perseus who turned him to stone Ovid later gives a more detailed account of the incident combining it with the myth of Heracles In this account Atlas is not a shepherd but a king According to Ovid Perseus arrives in Atlas s Kingdom and asks for shelter declaring he is a son of Zeus Atlas fearful of a prophecy that warned of a son of Zeus stealing his golden apples from his orchard refuses Perseus hospitality In this account Atlas is turned not just into stone by Perseus but an entire mountain range Atlas s head the peak his shoulders ridges and his hair woods The prophecy did not relate to Perseus stealing the golden apples but to Heracles another son of Zeus and Perseus s great grandson br br One of the Twelve Labours of the hero Heracles was to fetch some of the golden apples that grow in Hera s garden tended by Atlas s reputed daughters the Hesperides which were also called the Atlantides and guarded by the dragon Ladon Heracles went to Atlas and offered to hold up the heavens while Atlas got the apples from his daughters br Upon his return with the apples however Atlas attempted to trick Heracles into carrying the sky permanently by offering to deliver the apples himself as anyone who purposely took the burden must carry it forever or until someone else took it away Heracles suspecting Atlas did not intend to return pretended to agree to Atlas s offer asking only that Atlas take the sky again for a few minutes so Heracles could rearrange his cloak as padding on his shoulders When Atlas set down the apples and took the heavens upon his shoulders again Heracles took the apples and ran away br In some versions Heracles instead built the two great Pillars of Hercules to hold the sky away from the earth liberating Atlas much as he liberated Prometheus br br Besides the Titan there are other mythological characters who were also called Atlas br br According to Plato the first king of Atlantis was also named Atlas but that Atlas was a son of Poseidon and the mortal woman Cleito The works of Eusebius and Diodorus also give an Atlantean account of Atlas In these accounts Atlas father was Uranus and his mother was Gaia His grandfather was Elium King of Phoenicia who lived in Byblos with his wife Beruth Atlas was raised by his sister Basilia br br Atlas was also a legendary king of Mauretania the land of the Mauri in antiquity roughly corresponding with modern Morocco and Algeria In the th century Gerardus Mercator put together the first collection of maps to be called an Atlas and devoted his book to the King of Mauretania br Atlas became associated with Northwest Africa over time He had been connected with the Hesperides or Nymphs which guarded the golden apples and Gorgons both of which were said to live beyond Ocean in the extreme west of the world since Hesiod s Theogony Diodorus and Palaephatus mention that the Gorgons lived in the Gorgades islands in the Aethiopian Sea The main island was called Cerna and modern day arguments have been advanced that these islands may correspond to Cape Verde due to Phoenician exploration The Northwest Africa region emerged as the canonical home of the King via separate sources In particular according to Ovid after Perseus turns Atlas into a mountain range he flies over Aethiopia the blood of Medusa s head giving rise to Libyan snakes By the time of the Roman Empire the habit of associating Atlas s home to a chain of mountains the Atlas Mountains which were near Mauretania and Numidia was firmly entrenched br br The identifying name Aril is inscribed on two th century BC Etruscan bronze items a mirror from Vulci and a ring from an unknown site Both objects depict the encounter with Atlas of Hercle the Etruscan Heracles identified by the inscription they represent rare instances where a figure from Greek mythology was imported into Etruscan mythology but the name was not The Etruscan name Aril is etymologically independent br br Sources describe Atlas as the father by different goddesses of numerous children mostly daughters Some of these are assigned conflicting or overlapping identities or parentage in different sources br

an older Atlas who is the son of Aether and Gaia br br Atlas best known cultural association is in cartography The first publisher to associate the Titan Atlas with a group of maps was the print seller Antonio Lafreri who included a depiction of the Titan on the engraved title page he applied to his ad hoc assemblages of maps Tavole Moderne di Geografia de la Maggior parte del Mondo di Diversi Autori However Lafreri did not use the word Atlas in the title of his work this was an innovation of Gerardus Mercator who named his work Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati using the word Atlas as a dedication specifically to honour the Titan Atlas in his capacity as King of Mauretania a learned philosopher mathematician and astronomer br In psychology Atlas is used metaphorically to describe the personality of someone whose childhood was characterized by excessive responsibilities br Ayn Rand s political dystopian novel Atlas Shrugged references the popular misconception of Atlas holding up the entire world on his back by comparing the capitalist and intellectual class as being modern Atlases who hold the modern world up at great expense to
