Tantalus Ancient Greek T ntalos also called Atys was a Greek mythological figure most famous for his punishment in Tartarus for trying to trick the gods into eating his son he was made to stand in a pool of water beneath a fruit tree with low branches with the fruit ever eluding his grasp and the water always receding before he could take a drink br Tantalus was the father of Pelops Niobe and Broteas He was a son of Zeus and a woman named Plouto Thus like other heroes in Greek mythology such as Theseus his great great grandson and the Dioskouroi he had one divine and one mortal parent br The Greeks used the proverb Tantalean punishment Ancient Greek Tant leioi tim r ai in reference to those who have good things but are not permitted to enjoy them His name and punishment are also the source of the English word tantalize meaning to torment with the sight of something desired but out of reach tease by arousing expectations that are repeatedly disappointed br br Plato in the Cratylus e interprets T ntalos as tal ntatos acc tal ntaton in the original who has to bear much from t las wretched br The word t las is held by some to be inherited from Proto Indo European although R S P Beekes rejects an Indo European interpretation br br There may have been a historical Tantalus possibly the ruler of an Anatolian city named Tantal s the city of Tantalus or of a city named Sipylus Pausanias reports that there was a port under his name and a sepulcher of him by no means obscure in the same region br Tantalus is sometimes referred to as King of Phrygia although his city was located in the western extremity of Anatolia where Lydia was to emerge as a state before the beginning of the first millennium BC and not in the traditional heartland of Phrygia situated more inland References to his son as Pelops the Lydian led some scholars to the conclusion that there would be good grounds for believing that he belonged to a primordial house of Lydia br Other versions name his father as Tmolus the name of a king of Lydia and like Sipylus of another mountain in ancient Lydia The location of Tantalus mortal mountain fathers generally placed him in Lydia and more seldom in Phrygia or Paphlagonia all in Asia Minor br The identity of his wife is variously given generally as Dione the daughter of Atlas the Pleiad Taygete daughter of Atlas Eurythemista a daughter of the river god Xanthus Euryanassa daughter of Pactolus another river god of Anatolia like the Xanthus Clytia the child of Amphidamantes and Eupryto Tantalus was also called the father of Dascylus br Tantalus through Pelops was the progenitor of the House of Atreus which was named after his grandson Atreus Tantalus was also the great grandfather of Agamemnon and Menelaus br The geographer Strabo states that the wealth of Tantalus was derived from the mines of Phrygia and Mount Sipylus Near Mount Sipylus are archaeological features that have been associated with Tantalus and his house since Antiquity Near Mount Yamanlar in zmir ancient Smyrna where the Lake Karag l Lake Tantalus associated with the accounts surrounding him is found is a monument mentioned by Pausanias the tholos tomb of Tantalus later Christianized as Saint Charalambos tomb and another one in Mount Sipylus and where a throne of Pelops an altar or bench carved in rock and conjecturally associated with his son is found br Based on a similarity between the names Tantalus and Hantili it has been suggested that the name Tantalus may have derived from that of these two Hittite kings br br br Tantalus became one of the inhabitants of Tartarus the deepest portion of the Underworld reserved for the punishment of evildoers there Odysseus saw him The association of Tantalus with the underworld is underscored by the names of his mother Plouto riches as in gold and other mineral wealth and grandmother Chthonia earth br Tantalus was initially known for having been welcomed to Zeus table in Olympus like Ixion There he is said to have abused Zeus hospitality and stolen ambrosia and nectar to bring it back to his people and revealed the secrets of the gods br Most famously Tantalus offered up his son Pelops as a sacrifice He cut Pelops up boiled him and served him up in a banquet for several gods in order to test their omniscience The gods became aware of the gruesome nature of the menu so they did not touch the offering only Demeter distraught by the loss of her daughter Persephone absentmindedly ate part of the boy s shoulder br Clotho one of the three Fates was ordered by Zeus to bring the boy to life again She collected the parts of the body and boiled them in a sacred cauldron rebuilding his shoulder with one wrought of ivory made by Hephaestus and presented by Demeter br The revived Pelops grew to be an extraordinarily handsome youth The god Poseidon took him to Mount Olympus to teach him to use chariots Later Zeus threw Pelops out of Olympus due to his anger at Tantalus br Tantalus s punishment for his act was to stand in a pool of water beneath a fruit tree with low branches Whenever he reached for the fruit the branches raised his intended meal from his grasp Whenever he bent down to get a drink the water receded before he could get any br Over his head towers a threatening stone mentioned in Pindar s th Isthmian ode lines like the one that Sisyphus is punished to roll up a hill This fate has cursed him with eternal deprivation of nourishment br In a different story Tantalus was blamed for indirectly having stolen the gold dog which Rhea had once put to watch over infant Zeus in another version it was a mechanical dog crafted by Hephaestus to guard a temple of Zeus Tantalus s friend Pandareus stole the dog and gave it to Tantalus for safekeeping When asked later by Pandareus to return the dog Tantalus denied that he had it saying he had neither seen nor heard of a golden dog According to Robert Graves in The Greek Myths this incident is why an enormous stone hangs over Tantalus s head Others state that it was Tantalus who stole the dog and gave it to Pandareus for safekeeping br Tantalus was also the founder of the cursed House of Atreus in which variations on these atrocities continued Misfortunes also occurred as a result of these acts making the house the subject of many Greek tragedies Tantalus s grave sanctuary stood on Sipylus but honours were paid him at Argos where local tradition claimed to possess his bones In Lesbos there was another hero shrine in the small settlement of Polion and a mountain named after Tantalos br br br
