In Greek mythology the Nereids or Nereides NEER ee idz Ancient Greek romanized N r des sg N r s also are sea nymphs female spirits of sea waters the daughters of the Old Man of the Sea Nereus and the Oceanid Doris sisters to their brother Nerites They often accompany Poseidon the god of the sea and can be friendly and helpful to sailors such as the Argonauts in their search for the Golden Fleece br br It is not known whether the name Nereus was known to Homer or not but the name of the Nereids is attested before it and can be found in the Iliad Since Nereus only has relevance as the father of the Nereids it has been suggested that his name could actually be derived from that of his daughters while the derivation of the Nereids from Nereus as a patronymic has also been suggested According to Martin Litchfield West Nereus is much less important than his daughters mentioning that Herodotus offered the Nereids not Nereus as an example of a divine name not derived from Egypt br The name of the Nereids has survived in modern Greek folklore as ner ides fairies br br The Nereids symbolized everything that is beautiful and kind about the sea Their melodious voices sang as they danced around their father They are represented as beautiful women crowned with branches of red coral and dressed in white silk robes trimmed with gold br These nymphs are particularly associated with the Aegean Sea where they dwelt with their father Nereus in the depths within a golden palace The most notable of them are Thetis wife of Peleus and mother of Achilles Amphitrite wife of Poseidon and mother of Triton Galatea the vain love interest of the Cyclops Polyphemus and lastly Psamathe who became the mother of Phocus by King Aeacus of Aegina and Theoclymenus and Theonoe by Proteus a sea god or king of Egypt br In Homer s Iliad XVIII when Thetis cries out in sympathy for the grief of Achilles for the slain Patroclus her sisters appear Four of her siblings Cymodoce Thalia Nesaea and Spio were also among the nymphs in the train of Cyrene Later on these four together with their other sisters Thetis Melite and Panopea were able to help the hero Aeneas and his crew during a storm br In one account Cassiopeia boasted that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereides who were enraged by the claim Poseidon in sympathy for them sent a flood and a sea monster to the land of the Aethiopians demanding as well the sacrifice of the princess These sea goddesses also were said to reveal to men the mysteries of Dionysus and Persephone br br This list is correlated from four sources Homer s Iliad Hesiod s Theogony the Bibliotheca of Pseudo Apollodorus and the Fabulae of Hyginus Because of this the total number of names goes beyond fifty br br In ancient art the Nereides appear in the retinue of Poseidon Amphitrite Thetis and other sea divinities On black figure Greek vases they appear fully clothed such as on a Corinthian hydra sixth century BCE Paris where they stand near the bier of Achilles Later vase paintings depict them nude or partially nude mounted on dolphins sea horses or other marine creatures and often grouped together with Tritons They appear as such on Roman frescoes and sarcophagi An Etruscan bronze cista from Palestrina depicts winged Nereides br Famous is the Nereid Monument a marble tomb from Xanthos Lycia Asia Minor partially in the collection of the British Museum At the top is a small temple surrounded by pillars between which Nereides stood They were depicted in motion and with billowing transparent clothes The style is Attic Ionian and dates to c BCE br In the Renaissance and baroque periods the Nereid was frequently used to decorate fountains and garden monuments br br Nereides were worshiped in several parts of Greece but more especially in seaport towns such as Cardamyle and on the Isthmus of Corinth The epithets given them by the poets refer partly to their beauty and partly to their place of abode br br In modern Greek folklore the term nereid ner ida has come to be used for all nymphs fairies or mermaids not merely nymphs of the sea br br The neraida appears in modern Greek folktales as a kind of supernatural wife akin to the swan maiden and gives its name to the homonymous type in the Catalogue of Greek Folktales tale type ATU The Nera da She has been compared to the nymph the female character of ancient Greek mythology She is said to inhabit water sources rivers and wells similar to their ancient mythical counterpart the Nereids water nymphs However in modern speech the term also encompasses fairy maidens from mountains and woodlands br Greek folklorist Nicolaos Politis amassed a great amount of modern folkloric material regarding the neraida In modern tales from Greek tellers the neraides are said to dance at noon or at midnight to have beautiful golden hair to dress in white or rose garments and to appear wearing a veil on the head or holding a handkerchief Due to their beauty young men are drawn to the neraides and steal their veils or kerchiefs to force their stay in the mortal realm The women marry these men but later regain their piece of clothing back and disappear forever Greek scholar Anna Angeloupoulos terms this storyline The Stolen Scarf one of four narratives involving the neraida Also this sequence is the most frequent and stable introductory episode in Greek variants of tale type br In a tale from Greece a human goatherd named Demetros dances with ten fairies three nights and in the third night on a full moon he dances with them and accidentally touches the handkerchief of Katena Her companions abandon her to the mortal world and she becomes Demetros s wife bearing him a daughter For seven years Demetros has hidden the handkerchief until his wife Katena asks him for it She takes the handkerchief and dances with it in a festival taking the opportunity to return home and leave her mortal husband Years later their daughter follows her mother when she turns fifteen years old br Another introductory episode of the Greek variants is one Angelopoulos dubbed The sisters of Alexander the Great This refers to a pseudo historical or mythological account about Alexander the Great and a quest for a water of life that grants immortality His sister or sisters drinks it instead of him is thrown in the sea and becomes a gorgona a half human half fish creature with power over the storm who can sink boats and become birds They approach ships to ask if Alexander still lives and can only be appeased if answered positively In one tale a youth on a ship captures a gorgona three times or three gorgones and beats her until she promises not to threaten any more ships The youth then arrives on a deserted island and sees three birds that become human or flying maidens and steals their garments Richard MacGillivray Dawkins suggested that the modern gorgona was a merging of three mythological characters the Sirens the Gorgons and the Scylla and reported alternate tales where Alexander s sisters are replaced for his mother or a female lover br br Nereid a moon of the planet Neptune is named after the Nereids as is Nereid Lake in Antarctica br br Nereids in classical
