Ramesses II Ancient Egyptian r ms sw R a mas s Ancient Egyptian pronunciation i ama se s c BC BC commonly known as Ramesses the Great was an Egyptian pharaoh He was the third ruler of the Nineteenth Dynasty Along with Thutmose III of the Eighteenth Dynasty he is often regarded as the greatest most celebrated and most powerful pharaoh of the New Kingdom which itself was the most powerful period of ancient Egypt He is also widely considered one of ancient Egypt s most successful warrior pharaohs conducting no fewer than military campaigns all resulting in victories excluding the Battle of Kadesh generally considered a stalemate br In ancient Greek sources he is called Ozymandias derived from the first part of his Egyptian language regnal name Usermaatre Setepenre Ramesses was also referred to as the Great Ancestor by successor pharaohs and the Egyptian people br For the early part of his reign he focused on building cities temples and monuments After establishing the city of Pi Ramesses in the Nile Delta he designated it as Egypt s new capital and used it as the main staging point for his campaigns in Syria Ramesses led several military expeditions into the Levant where he reasserted Egyptian control over Canaan and Phoenicia he also led a number of expeditions into Nubia all commemorated in inscriptions at Beit el Wali and Gerf Hussein He celebrated an unprecedented thirteen or fourteen Sed festivals more than any other pharaoh br Estimates of his age at death vary although or is considered to be the most likely figure Upon his death he was buried in a tomb KV in the Valley of the Kings his body was later moved to the Royal Cache where it was discovered by archaeologists in Ramesses mummy is now on display at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization located in the city of Cairo br br br Early life br Ramesses II was born a civilian His grandfather Ramesses I was a vizier and military officer during the reign of pharaoh Horemheb who appointed Ramesses I as his successor Ramesses II was approximately eleven years old at the time of his grandfather s accession br br After Ramesses I died his son Seti I became king who designated his son Ramesses II as Egypt s prince regent Ramesses II was approximately fourteen years of age at the time br br br Reign length br Most Egyptologists believe that Ramesses formally assumed the throne on May BC based on his known accession date III Shemu day br The Jewish historian Josephus in his book Contra Apionem which translated Manetho s Aegyptiaca assigned Ramesses II whom he called Armesses Miamun a reign length of years and months This figure is essentially confirmed by Papyrus Gurob fragment L where Year I Akhet day of Ramesses II is followed on the next dated line by a year change to Year II Akhet day of Ramesses II s son Merneptah which means that Ramesses II died about months into his th Regnal year In A J Peden attempted to show that Ramesses II died in the time interval between II Akhet day and II Akhet day on the basis of Theban graffito which was dated to Merneptah s Year II Akhet day However the workman s village of Deir el Medina preserves a fragment of a mid th dynasty necropolis journal P Turin prov nr recto I unpublished which records that the date II Akhet day was a Free feast day for the Sailing of UsimaRe Setepenre ie Ramesses II As the Egyptologist Robert J Demar e notes in a paper br br The feast called nw Sailing was clearly observed in Thebes or at Deir el Medina during the Ramesside Period in remembrance of the passing of deified royals The Sailing of Ahmose Nefertari was celebrated on II Shemu the Sailing of Seti I on III Shemu and the Sailing of Ramesses II on II Akhet br The date of Ramesses II s recorded passing on II Akhet day falls perfectly within A J Peden s estimated timeline for this king s death in the interval between II Akhet day and II Akhet day This means that Ramesses II died on Year II Akhet day of his reign after ruling Egypt for years months and days br br br Military campaigns br Early in his life Ramesses II embarked on numerous campaigns to restore possession of previously held territories lost to the Nubians and Hittites and to secure Egypt s borders He was also responsible for suppressing some Nubian revolts and carrying out a campaign in Libya Though the Battle of Kadesh often dominates the scholarly view of Ramesses II s military prowess and power he nevertheless enjoyed more than a few outright victories over Egypt s enemies During his reign the Egyptian army is estimated to have totaled some men a formidable force that he used to strengthen Egyptian influence br br br Battle against Sherden pirates br In his second year Ramesses II decisively defeated the Sherden sea pirates who were wreaking havoc along Egypt s Mediterranean coast by attacking cargo laden vessels travelling the sea routes to Egypt The Sherden people probably came from the coast of Ionia from southwest Anatolia or perhaps also from the island of Sardinia Ramesses posted troops and ships at strategic points along the coast and patiently allowed the pirates to attack their perceived prey before skillfully catching them by surprise in a sea battle and capturing them all in a single action A stele from Tanis speaks of their having come in their war ships from the midst of the sea and none were able to stand before them There probably was a naval battle somewhere near the mouth of the Nile as shortly afterward many Sherden are seen among the pharaoh s body guard where they are conspicuous by their horned helmets having a ball projecting from the middle their round shields and the great Naue II swords with which they are depicted in inscriptions of the Battle of Kadesh In that sea battle together with the Sherden the pharaoh also defeated the Lukka L kkw possibly the people later known as the Lycians and the qrs w Shekelesh peoples br br br Syrian campaigns br br br First Syrian campaign br br The immediate antecedents to the Battle of Kadesh were the early campaigns of Ramesses II into Canaan His first campaign seems to have taken place in the fourth year of his reign and was commemorated by the erection of what became the first of the Commemorative stelae of Nahr el Kalb near what is now Beirut The inscription is almost totally illegible due to weathering br In the fourth year of his reign he captured the Hittite vassal state of the Amurru during his campaign in Syria br br br Second Syrian campaign br The Battle of Kadesh in his fifth regnal year was the climactic engagement in a campaign that Ramesses fought in Syria against the resurgent Hittite forces of Muwatalli II The pharaoh wanted a victory at Kadesh both to expand Egypt s frontiers into Syria and to emulate his father Seti I s triumphal entry into the city just a decade or so earlier He also constructed his new capital Pi Ramesses There he built factories to manufacture weapons chariots and shields supposedly producing some weapons in a week about chariots in two weeks and shields in a week and a half After these preparations Ramesses moved to attack territory in the Levant which belonged to a more substantial enemy than any he had ever faced in war the Hittite Empire br After advancing through Canaan for exactly a month according to the Egyptian sources Ramesses arrived at Kadesh on May BC Here Ramesses troops were caught in a Hittite ambush and were initially outnumbered by the enemy whose chariotry smashed through the second division of Ramesses forces and attacked his camp Receiving reinforcements from other Egyptian divisions arriving on the battlefield the Egyptians counterattacked and routed the Hittites whose survivors abandoned their chariots and swam the Orontes river to reach the safe city walls Although left in possession of the battlefield Ramesses logistically unable to sustain a long siege returned to Egypt While Ramesses claimed a great victory and this was technically true in terms of the actual battle it is generally considered that the Hittites were the ultimate victors as far as the overall campaign was concerned since the Egyptians retreated after the battle and Hittite forces invaded and briefly occupied the Egyptian possessions in the region of Damascus br br br Third Syrian campaign br Egypt s sphere of influence was now restricted to Canaan while Syria fell into Hittite hands Canaanite princes seemingly encouraged by the Egyptian incapacity to impose their will and goaded on by the Hittites began revolts against Egypt Ramesses II was not willing to let this stand and prepared to contest the Hittite advance with new military campaigns Because they are recorded on his monuments with few indications of precise dates or the regnal year the precise chronology of the subsequent campaigns is not entirely clear Late in the seventh year of his reign April May BC Ramesses II returned to Syria once again This time he proved more successful against his Hittite foes During this campaign he split his army into two forces One force was led by his son Amun her khepeshef and it chased warriors of the hasu tribes across the Negev as far as the Dead Sea capturing Edom Seir It then marched on to capture Moab The other force led by Ramesses himself attacked Jerusalem and Jericho He too then entered Moab where he rejoined his son The reunited army then marched on Hesbon Damascus on to Kumidi and finally recaptured Upi the land around Damascus reestablishing Egypt s former sphere of influence br br br Later Syrian campaigns br br Ramesses extended his military successes in his eighth and ninth years He crossed the Dog River Nahr al Kalb and pushed north into Amurru His armies managed to march as far north as Dapur where he had a statue of himself erected The Egyptian pharaoh thus found himself in northern Amurru well past Kadesh in Tunip where no Egyptian soldier had been seen since the time of Thutmose III almost years earlier He laid siege to Dapur before capturing it and returning to Egypt By November BC Ramesses was back in Egypt at Heliopolis His victory in the north proved ephemeral After having reasserted his power over Canaan Ramesses led his army north A mostly illegible stele at the Dog River near Beirut which appears to be dated to the king s second year was probably set up there in his tenth BC The thin strip of territory pinched between Amurru and Kadesh did not make for a stable possession Within a year they had returned to the Hittite fold so that Ramesses had to march against Dapur once more in his tenth year This time he claimed to have fought the battle without even bothering to put on his corslet until two hours after the fighting began Six of Ramesses s youthful sons still wearing their side locks took part in this conquest He took towns in Retjenu and Tunip in Naharin later recorded on the walls of the Ramesseum This second success at the location was equally as meaningless as his first as neither power could decisively defeat the other in battle In year eighteen Ramesses erected a stele at Beth Shean on January BC br br br Peace treaty with the Hittites br br In Year of Ramesses s reign he concluded a peace treaty with the Hittites known to modern scholars as the Treaty of Kadesh Though this treaty settled the disputes over Canaan its immediate impetus seems to have been a diplomatic crisis that occurred following attu ili III s accession to the Hittite throne attu ili had come to power by deposing his nephew Mur ili III in the brief and bitter Hittite Civil War Though the deposed king was initially sent into exile in Syria he subsequently attempted to regain power and fled to Egypt once these attempts were discovered br When attu ili demanded his extradition Ramesses II denied any knowledge of his wherabouts When attu ili insisted that Mur ili was in Egypt Ramesses s response suggested that attu ili was being decieved by his subjects This demand precipitated a crisis and the two empires came dangerously close to war Eventually in the twenty first year of his reign BC Ramesses decided to conclude an agreement at Kadesh to end the conflict br The peace treaty was recorded in two versions one in Egyptian hieroglyphs the other in Hittite using cuneiform script both versions survive Such dual language recording is common to many subsequent treaties This treaty differs from others in that the two language versions are worded differently While the majority of the text is identical the Hittite version says the Egyptians came suing for peace and the Egyptian version says the reverse The treaty was given to the Egyptians in the form of a silver plaque and this pocket book version was taken back to Egypt and carved into the temple at Karnak The Egyptian account records Ramesses II s receipt of the Hittite peace treaty tablets on I Peret of Year corresponding to November BC according to the standard Low Chronology used by Egyptologists br The treaty was concluded between Ramesses II and attu ili III in year of Ramesses s reign c BC Its articles call for peace between Egypt and Hatti and then proceeds to maintain that their respective deities also demand peace The frontiers are not laid down in this treaty but may be inferred from other documents The Anastasy A papyrus describes Canaan during the latter part of the reign of Ramesses II and enumerates and names the Phoenician coastal towns under Egyptian control The harbour town of Sumur north of Byblos is mentioned as the northernmost town belonging to Egypt suggesting it contained an Egyptian garrison br No further Egyptian campaigns in Canaan are mentioned after the conclusion of the peace treaty The northern border seems to have been safe and quiet so the rule of the pharaoh was strong until Ramesses II s death and the subsequent waning of the dynasty When the King of Mira attempted to involve Ramesses in a hostile act against the Hittites the Egyptian responded that the times of intrigue in support of Mursili III had passed attu ili III wrote to Kadashman Enlil II Kassite king of Kardunia Babylon in the same spirit reminding him of the time when his father Kadashman Turgu had offered to fight Ramesses II the king of Egypt The Hittite king encouraged the Babylonian to oppose another enemy which must have been the king of Assyria whose allies had killed the messenger of the Egyptian king attu ili encouraged Kadashman Enlil to come to his aid and prevent the Assyrians from cutting the link between the Canaanite province of Egypt and Mursili III the ally of Ramesses br br br Nubian campaigns br br Ramesses II also campaigned south of the first cataract of the Nile into Nubia When Ramesses was about two of his own sons including Amun her khepeshef accompanied him in at least one of those campaigns By the time of Ramesses Nubia had been a colony for years but its conquest was recalled in decoration from the temples Ramesses II built at Beit el Wali which was the subject of epigraphic work by the Oriental Institute during the Nubian salvage campaign of the s Gerf Hussein and Kalabsha in northern Nubia On the south wall of the Beit el Wali temple Ramesses II is depicted charging into battle against tribes south of Egypt in a war chariot while his two young sons Amun her khepsef and Khaemwaset are shown behind him also in war chariots A wall in one of Ramesses s temples says he had to fight one battle with those tribes without help from his soldiers br br br Libyan campaigns br During the reign of Ramesses II the Egyptians were evidently active on a kilometre mi stretch along the Mediterranean coast at least as far as Zawyet Umm El Rakham where remains of a fortress described by its texts as built on Libyans land have been found Although the exact events surrounding the foundation of the coastal forts and fortresses is not clear some degree of political and military control must have been held over the region to allow their construction br There are no detailed accounts of Ramesses II s undertaking large military actions against the Libyans only generalised records of his conquering and crushing them which may or may not refer to specific events that were otherwise unrecorded It may be that some of the records such as the Aswan Stele of his year are harking back to Ramesses s presence on his father s Libyan campaigns Perhaps it was Seti I who achieved this supposed control over the region and who planned to establish the defensive system in a manner similar to how he rebuilt those to the east the Ways of Horus across Northern Sinai br br br Sed festivals br br After reigning for years Ramesses joined a select group that included only a handful of Egypt s longest lived rulers By tradition in the th year of his reign Ramesses celebrated a jubilee called the Sed festival These were held to honour and rejuvenate the pharaoh s strength Only halfway through what would be a year reign Ramesses had already eclipsed all but a few of his greatest predecessors in his achievements He had brought peace maintained Egyptian borders and built great and numerous monuments across the empire His country was more prosperous and powerful than it had been in nearly a century br Sed festivals traditionally were held again every three years after the th year Ramesses II who sometimes held them after two years eventually celebrated an unprecedented thirteen or fourteen br br br Building projects and monuments br In the third year of his reign Ramesses started the most ambitious building project after the pyramids which were built almost years earlier The population was put to work changing the face of Egypt Ramesses built extensively from the Delta to Nubia covering the land with buildings in a way no monarch before him had br br Some of the activities undertaken were focused on remodeling or usurping existing works improving masonry techniques and using art as propaganda br br In Thebes the ancient temples were transformed so that each one of them reflected honour to Ramesses as a symbol of his putative divine nature and power br The elegant but shallow reliefs of previous pharaohs were easily transformed and so their images and words could easily be obliterated by their successors Ramesses insisted that his carvings be deeply engraved into the stone which made them not only less susceptible to later alteration but also made them more prominent in the Egyptian sun reflecting his relationship with the sun deity Ra br Ramesses used art as a means of propaganda for his victories over foreigners which are depicted on numerous temple reliefs br His cartouches are prominently displayed even in buildings that he did not construct br He founded a new capital city in the Delta during his reign called Pi Ramesses It previously had served as a summer palace during Seti I s reign br Ramesses II expanded gold mining operations in Akuyati modern day Wadi Allaqi br Ramesses also undertook many new construction projects Two of his biggest works besides Pi Ramesses were the temple complex of Abu Simbel and the Ramesseum a mortuary temple in western Thebes br br br Pi Ramesses br br Ramesses II moved the capital of his kingdom from Thebes in the Nile valley to a new site in the eastern Delta His motives are uncertain although he possibly wished to be closer to his territories in Canaan and Syria The new city of Pi Ramesses or to give the full name Pi Ramesses Aa nakhtu meaning Domain of Ramesses Great in Victory was dominated by huge temples and his vast residential palace complete with its own zoo In the th century AD the Bible exegete Rabbi Saadia Gaon believed that the biblical site of Ramesses had to be identified with Ain Shams For a time during the early th century the site was misidentified as that of Tanis due to the amount of statuary and other material from Pi Ramesses found there but it now is recognized that the Ramesside remains at Tanis were brought there from elsewhere and the real Pi Ramesses lies about km mi south near modern Qantir The colossal feet of the statue of Ramesses are almost all that remains above ground today The rest is buried in the fields br br br Ramesseum br br The temple complex built by Ramesses II between Qurna and the desert has been known as the Ramesseum since the th century The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus marveled at the gigantic temple now no more than a few ruins br Oriented northwest and southeast the temple was preceded by two courts An enormous pylon stood before the first court with the royal palace at the left and the gigantic statue of the king looming up at the back Only fragments of the base and torso remain of the syenite statue of the enthroned pharaoh metres ft high and weighing more than tonnes long tons short tons Scenes of the great pharaoh and his army triumphing over the Hittite forces fleeing before Kadesh are represented on the pylon Remains of the second court include part of the internal facade of the pylon and a portion of the Osiride portico on the right Scenes of war and the alleged rout of the Hittites at Kadesh are repeated on the walls In the upper registers feast and honor of the phallic deity Min god of fertility br On the opposite side of the court the few Osiride pillars and columns still remaining may furnish an idea of the original grandeur Scattered remains of the two statues of the seated king also may be seen one in pink granite and the other in black granite which once flanked the entrance to the temple Thirty nine out of the forty eight columns in the great hypostyle hall m still stand in the central rows They are decorated with the usual scenes of the king before various deities Part of the ceiling decorated with gold stars on a blue ground also has been preserved Ramesses s children appear in the procession on the few walls left The sanctuary was composed of three consecutive rooms with eight columns and the tetrastyle cell Part of the first room with the ceiling decorated with astral scenes and few remains of the second room are all that is left Vast storerooms built of mud bricks stretched out around the temple Traces of a school for scribes were found among the ruins br A temple of Seti I of which nothing remains beside the foundations once stood to the right of the hypostyle hall br br br Abu Simbel br br In BC Ramesses and his queen Nefertari had traveled into Nubia to inaugurate a new temple the great Abu Simbel It is ego cast into stone the man who built it intended not only to become Egypt s greatest pharaoh but also one of its deities br The great temple of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel was discovered in by the Swiss Orientalist and traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt An enormous pile of sand almost completely covered the facade and its colossal statues blocking the entrance for four more years The Paduan explorer Giovanni Battista Belzoni reached the interior on August br br br Other Nubian monuments br As well as the temples of Abu Simbel Ramesses left other monuments to himself in Nubia His early campaigns are illustrated on the walls of the Temple of Beit el Wali now relocated to New Kalabsha Other temples dedicated to Ramesses are Derr and Gerf Hussein also relocated to New Kalabsha For the temple of Amun at Jebel Barkal the temple s foundation probably occurred during the reign of Thutmose III while the temple was shaped during his reign and that of Ramesses II br br br Other archeological discoveries br br The colossal statue of Ramesses II dates back years and was originally discovered in six pieces in a temple near Memphis Weighing some tonne long ton short ton it was transported reconstructed and erected in Ramesses Square in Cairo in In August contractors relocated it to save it from exhaust fumes that were causing it to deteriorate The new site is near the future Grand Egyptian Museum br In a group of archeologists in Cairo s Matariya neighborhood discovered pieces of a booth with a seat that based on its structure and age may have been used by Ramesses The royal compartment consists of four steps leading to a cubic platform which is believed to be the base of the king s seat during celebrations or public gatherings such as Ramesses inauguration and Sed festivals It may have also gone on to be used by others in the Ramesside Period according to the mission s head The excavation mission also unearthed a collection of scarabs amulets clay pots and blocks engraved with hieroglyphic text br In December a red granite royal bust of Ramesses II was unearthed by an Egyptian archaeological mission in the village of Mit Rahina in Giza The bust depicted Ramesses II wearing a wig with the symbol Ka on his head Its measurements were cm in wide cm in thick and cm in long Alongside the bust limestone blocks appeared showing Ramesses II during the Heb Sed religious ritual This discovery is considered one of the rarest archaeological discoveries It is the first ever Ka statue made of granite to be discovered The only Ka statue that was previously found is made of wood and it belongs to one of the kings of the th dynasty of ancient Egypt which is displayed at the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square said archaeologist Mostafa Waziri br br br Death and burial br The Egyptian scholar Manetho third century BC attributed Ramesses a reign of years and months br By the time of his death aged about years Ramesses was suffering from severe dental problems and was plagued by arthritis and hardening of the arteries He had made Egypt rich from all the supplies and bounty he had collected from other empires He had outlived many of his wives and children and left great memorials all over Egypt Nine more pharaohs took the name Ramesses in his honour br br br Mummy br br Originally Ramesses II was buried in the tomb KV in the Valley of the Kings but because of looting priests later transferred the body to a holding area re wrapped it and placed it inside the tomb of queen Ahmose Inhapy Seventy two hours later it was again moved to the tomb of the high priest Pinedjem II All of this is recorded in hieroglyphics on the linen covering the body of the coffin of Ramesses II His mummy was eventually discovered in in TT inside an ordinary wooden coffin and is now in Cairo s National Museum of Egyptian Civilization until April it was in the Egyptian Museum br br The pharaoh s mummy reveals an aquiline nose and strong jaw It stands at about metres ft in Gaston Maspero who first unwrapped the mummy of Ramesses II writes on the temples there are a few sparse hairs but at the poll the hair is quite thick forming smooth straight locks about five centimeters in length White at the time of death and possibly auburn during life they have been dyed a light red by the spices henna used in embalming the moustache and beard are thin The hairs are white like those of the head and eyebrows the skin is of earthy brown splotched with black the face of the mummy gives a fair idea of the face of the living king br In Maurice Bucaille a French doctor examined the mummy at the Cairo Museum and found it in poor condition French President Val ry Giscard d Estaing succeeded in convincing Egyptian authorities to send the mummy to France for treatment In September it was greeted at Paris Le Bourget Airport with full military honours befitting a king then taken to a laboratory at the Mus e de l Homme br The mummy was forensically tested in by Pierre Fernand Ceccaldi the chief forensic scientist at the Criminal Identification Laboratory of Paris Ceccaldi observed that the mummy had slightly wavy red hair from this trait combined with cranial features he concluded that Ramesses II was of a Berber type and hence according to Ceccaldi s analysis fair skinned Subsequent microscopic inspection of the roots of Ramesses II s hair proved that the king s hair originally was red which suggests that he came from a family of redheads This has more than just cosmetic significance in ancient Egypt people with red hair were associated with the deity Set the slayer of Osiris and the name of Ramesses II s father Seti I means follower of Seth br br However Cheikh Anta Diop disputed the results of the study and argued that the structure of hair morphology cannot determine the ethnicity of a mummy and that a comparative study should have featured Nubians in Upper Egypt before a conclusive judgement was reached In French police arrested a man who tried to sell several tufts of Ramesses hair on the Internet Jean Michel Diebolt said he had gotten the relics from his late father who worked on the analysis team in the s They were returned to Egypt the following year br During the examination scientific analysis revealed battle wounds old fractures arthritis and poor circulation Ramesses II s arthritis is believed to have made him walk with a hunched back for the last decades of his life A study excluded ankylosing spondylitis as a possible cause and proposed diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis as a possible alternative which was confirmed by more recent work A significant hole in the pharaoh s mandible was detected Researchers observed an abscess by his teeth which was serious enough to have caused death by infection although this cannot be determined with certainty br After being irradiated in an attempt to eliminate fungi and insects the mummy was returned from Paris to Egypt in May br In April his mummy was moved from the Egyptian Museum to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of other kings and queens in an event termed the Pharaohs Golden Parade br br br Burial of wives and relatives br br br Tomb of Nefertari br br The tomb of the most important consort of Ramesses was discovered by Ernesto Schiaparelli in Although it had been looted in ancient times the tomb of Nefertari is extremely important because its magnificent wall painting decoration is regarded as one of the greatest achievements of ancient Egyptian art A flight of steps cut out of the rock gives access to the antechamber which is decorated with paintings based on chapter seventeen of the Book of the Dead The astronomical ceiling represents the heavens and is painted in dark blue with a myriad of golden five pointed stars The east wall of the antechamber is interrupted by a large opening flanked by representation of Osiris at the left and Anubis at the right this in turn leads to the side chamber decorated with offering scenes preceded by a vestibule in which the paintings portray Nefertari presented to the deities who welcome her On the north wall of the antechamber is the stairway down to the burial chamber a vast quadrangular room covering a surface area of about square metres sq ft its astronomical ceiling supported by four pillars entirely decorated Originally the queen s red granite sarcophagus lay in the middle of this chamber According to religious doctrines of the time it was in this chamber which the ancient Egyptians called the Golden Hall that the regeneration of the deceased took place This decorative pictogram of the walls in the burial chamber drew inspiration from chapters and of the Book of the Dead in the left half of the chamber there are passages from chapter concerning the gates and doors of the kingdom of Osiris their guardians and the magic formulas that had to be uttered by the deceased in order to go past the doors br br br Tomb KV br br In Professor Kent Weeks head of the Theban Mapping Project rediscovered Tomb KV It has proven to be the largest tomb in the Valley of the Kings and originally contained the mummified remains of some of this king s estimated sons Approximately corridors and tomb chambers have been located in this tomb as of and the tomb may contain as many as corridors and chambers It is believed that at least four of Ramesses s sons including Meryatum Sety Amun her khepeshef Ramesses s first born son and the King s Principal Son of His Body the Generalissimo Ramesses justified i e deceased were buried there from inscriptions ostraca or canopic jars discovered in the tomb Joyce Tyldesley writes that thus far br br no intact burials have been discovered and there have been little substantial funeral debris thousands of potsherds faience ushabti figures beads amulets fragments of Canopic jars of wooden coffins but no intact sarcophagi mummies or mummy cases suggesting that much of the tomb may have been unused Those burials which were made in KV were thoroughly looted in antiquity leaving little or no remains br br br In literature and the arts br Ramesses is the basis for Percy Bysshe Shelley s poem Ozymandias Diodorus Siculus gives an inscription on the base of one of his sculptures as King of Kings am I Osymandias If anyone would know how great I am and where I lie let him surpass one of my works This is paraphrased in Shelley s poem br The life of Ramesses II has inspired many fictional representations including the historical novels of the French writer Christian Jacq the Rams s series the graphic novel Watchmen in which the character of Adrian Veidt uses Ramesses II to form part of the inspiration for his alter ego Ozymandias Norman Mailer s novel Ancient Evenings which is largely concerned with the life of Ramesses II though from the perspective of Egyptians living during the reign of Ramesses IX and the Anne Rice book The Mummy or Ramses the Damned in which Ramesses was the main character In The Kane Chronicles Ramesses is an ancestor of the main characters Sadie and Carter Kane Ramesses II is one of the characters in the video game Civilization V as well as in additional downloadable content for its sequel Civilization VI br The East Village underground rock band The Fugs released their song Ramses II Is Dead My Love on their album It Crawled into My Hand Honest br Ramesses II is a main character in the fiction book The Heretic Queen by Michelle Moran published in It is a novel about the love story and beginning years of the marriage of Pharaoh Ramesses and Queen Nefertari during the time Pharaoh Rameses II is trying to decide who will be queen between his two wives Nefertari and Iset Nefertari is the daughter and orphan of Queen Mutnodjmet and General Nakhtmin niece of Queen Nefertiti and Pharaoh Ankhenaten The book is told from the perspective of Nefertari and is fiction but does deal with many historical events during the beginning of Rameses II reign and many historical people giving readers a view of what life and these historical figures may have been like br br br As the pharaoh in the Bible s Book of Exodus br br Though scholars generally do not recognize the biblical portrayal of the Exodus as an actual historical event various historical pharaohs have been proposed as the corresponding ruler at the time the story takes place with Ramesses II as the most popular candidate for Pharaoh of the Exodus He is cast in this role in the novella The Tables of the Law by Thomas Mann Although not a major character Ramesses appears in Joan Grant s So Moses Was Born a first person account from Nebunefer the brother of Ramose which paints a picture of the life of Ramose from the death of Seti replete with the power play intrigue and assassination plots of the historical record and depicting the relationships with Bintanath Tuya Nefertari and Moses br In film Ramesses is played by Yul Brynner in Cecil B DeMille s classic The Ten Commandments Here Ramesses is portrayed as a vengeful tyrant as well as the main antagonist of the film ever scornful of his father s preference for Moses over the son of his body The animated film The Prince of Egypt also features a depiction of Ramesses voiced by Ralph Fiennes for both the speaking and the singing portrayed as Moses adoptive brother and ultimately as the film s villain with essentially the same motivations as in the earlier film Joel Edgerton played Ramesses in the film Exodus Gods and Kings S rgio Marone plays Ramesses in the Brazilian telenovela
