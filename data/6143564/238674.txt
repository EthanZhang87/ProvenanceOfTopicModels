A paperback softcover softback book is one with a thick paper or paperboard cover and often held together with glue rather than stitches or staples In contrast hardback hardcover books are bound with cardboard covered with cloth leather paper or plastic br Inexpensive books bound in paper have existed since at least the th century in such forms as pamphlets yellowbacks dime novels and airport novels Modern paperbacks can be differentiated from one another by size In the United States there are mass market paperbacks and larger more durable trade paperbacks In the United Kingdom there are A format B format and the largest C format sizes br Paperback editions of books are issued when a publisher decides to release a book in a low cost format Lower quality paper glued rather than stapled or sewn bindings and the lack of a hard cover may contribute to the lower cost of paperbacks In the early days of modern paperbacks the s and s they were sold as a cheaper less permanent and more convenient alternative to traditional hardcover books as the name of the first American paperback publisher Pocket Books indicates In addition the Pocket Books edition of Wuthering Heights one of the first ten books it published in emphasized the impermanence of paperbacks by telling readers if you enjoyed it so much you may wish to own it in a more permanent edition they could return the cent book to Pocket Books with an additional cents and it would send them a copy of the cent Modern Library edition substantially bound in durable cloth br Since the mid th century paperbacks can also be the preferred medium when a book is not expected to be a major seller and the publisher wishes to release the book without a large investment Examples include many novels and newer editions or reprintings of older books br Because paperbacks tend to have smaller profit margins many publishers try to balance the profit to be made by selling fewer hardcovers against the potential profit to be made by selling more paperbacks with a smaller profit per unit First editions of many modern books especially genre fiction are issued in paperback Best selling books on the other hand may maintain sales in hardcover for an extended period to reap the greater profits that the hardcovers provide br br br History br br The early th century saw numerous improvements in the printing publishing and book distribution processes with the introduction of steam powered printing presses pulp mills automatic type setting and a network of railways These innovations enabled the likes of Simms and McIntyre of Belfast Routledge Sons founded in and Ward Lock founded in to mass produce cheap uniform yellowback or paperback editions of existing works and distribute and sell them across the British Isles principally via the ubiquitous W H Smith Sons newsagent found at most urban British railway stations These paper bound volumes were offered for sale at a fraction of the historical cost of a book and were of a smaller format mm mm in in aimed at the railway traveller The Routledge s Railway Library series of paperbacks remained in print until and offered the traveling public unique titles br The Continental market also supported examples of cheap paper bound books br Bernhard Tauchnitz started the Collection of British and American Authors in These inexpensive paperbound editions a direct precursor to mass market paperbacks eventually ran to over volumes Reclam published Shakespeare in this format from October and went on to pioneer the mass market paperbound Universal Bibliothek series from November br br br The early years br The German publisher Albatross Books revised the th century mass market paperback format in but the approach of World War II cut the experiment short Albatross s innovations included a standardized size use of new sans serif fonts use of logo and type on the cover without an illustration and color coding the covers by genre br br In British publisher Allen Lane investing his own capital initiated the paperback revolution in the English language book market by releasing ten reprint titles to launch the Penguin Books imprint They adopted many of Albatross s innovations including a conspicuous logo using only type on the cover and color coded covers for different genres br The first book on Penguin s list was Andr Maurois Ariel br Lane intended to produce inexpensive books He purchased paperback rights from publishers ordered large print runs such as copies large for the time to keep unit prices low and looked to non traditional book selling retail locations Booksellers were initially reluctant to buy his books but when Woolworths placed a large order the books sold extremely well After that initial success booksellers showed more willingness to stock paperbacks and the name Penguin became closely associated with the word paperback in Great Britain br In the United States Robert de Graaf created the Pocket Books label in partnering with Simon Schuster to issue a similar line of reprints Because at first Pocket Books was the only publisher of paperbacks the term pocket book became synonymous with paperback in English speaking North America In France the term livre de poche which translates as pocket book was used and is still in use today De Graaf like Lane negotiated paperback rights from other publishers and produced many runs His practices contrasted with those of Lane by his adoption of illustrated covers aimed at the North American market To reach an even broader market than Lane he used distributors of newspapers and magazines to distribute his books because they had a lengthy history of being aimed in format and distribution at mass audiences Pocket Books were not available in book stores because they did not carry magazines br Pocket Books established the format for all subsequent paperback publishers in the s The books measured by cm by cm had full color covers and cost cents Eventually in the s the height increased by cm to cm The width remained the same because wire display racks used in many locations could not hold wider books With the larger size came a higher price first cents and then cents br Because of its number one position in what became a very long list of pocket editions James Hilton s Lost Horizon is often cited as the first American paperback book However the first mass market pocket sized paperback book printed in the U S was an edition of Pearl Buck s The Good Earth produced by Pocket Books as a proof of concept in late and sold in New York City br The first ten Pocket Book titles published in May with a print run of about copies each were br br Lost Horizon by James Hilton br Wake Up and Live by Dorothea Brande br Five Great Tragedies by William Shakespeare br Topper by Thorne Smith br The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie br Enough Rope by Dorothy Parker br Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront br The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler br The Bridge of San Luis Rey by Thornton Wilder br Bambi English translation by Felix Salten br This list includes seven novels the most recent being six year old Lost Horizons two classics Shakespeare and Wuthering Heights both out of copyright one mystery novel one book of poetry Enough Rope and one self help book br The success of Pocket Books led to others entering the market In American News Company a magazine distributor bought a dime novel publisher partially owned by brother and sister Joseph Meyers and Edna Meyers Williams and hired them to organize a new company called Avon Publications Avon copied the basic format established by Pocket Books but differentiated itself by emphasizing as a book on collecting paperbacks says popular appeal rather than loftier concepts of literary merit In Time magazine summarized its books as westerns whodunits and the kind of boy meets girl story that can be illustrated by a ripe cheesecake jacket cover br The next year Dell Publishing which was founded in by George T Delacorte Jr to publish pulp magazines joined with Western Publishing to publish Dell Books Like Avon Dell followed the basic format established by Pocket Books But within that format Dell achieved more variety than any of its early competitors with its instantly identifiable format of vibrant airbrushed covers for its predominantly genre fiction specialized logos and special features like maps and lists of characters br World War II brought both new technology and a wide readership of men and women now in the military or employed as shift workers paperbacks were cheap readily available and easily posted and carried Furthermore people found that restrictions on travel gave them time to read more paperbacks Four color printing invented in and lamination invented in developed for military maps made the paperback cover eye catching and kept ink from running as people handled the book A revolving metal rack invented in designed to display a wide variety of paperbacks in a small space found its way into drugstores dimestores and markets br During World War II the U S military distributed some million Armed Services Editions paperback novels to the troops After the war the former servicemembers familiarity with paperbacks helped popularize the format br Two new developments changed the nature of the mass market paperback business One was the decision by publishers to publish more recent best selling books than the older books originally published by Pocket Book They sought reprint rights on new books and soon found themselves in competition for the biggest sellers leading to bidding against each other for the rights and costing them more money br The second development was the spinner rack a metal pole with a four sided wire frame designed to vertically hold rows of racks of paperback books Retail store owners no longer had to devote feet of valuable counter space to low profit paperbacks Dozens of paperbacks could be displayed vertically in five or six square feet of floor space Similar racks were available for magazines and comic books By the late s paperback spinner racks were ubiquitous in large and small towns across the United States in every local grocery store drug store dime store and bus and train station displaying everything from best sellers and mysteries and westerns to classics and Shakespeare In in William Inge s Broadway play Bus Stop it did not seem unbelievable that a long distance bus traveller stranded by a snowstorm in an out of the way cafe walks to a shelf and picks up a paperback copy of Four Tragedies of Shakespeare Sometimes one can find Shakespeare on these shelves among the many lurid novels of juvenile delinquents he comments br In Bantam Books was formed by Walter B Pitkin Jr Sidney B Kramer and husband and wife Ian and Betty Ballantine as a mass market paperback publisher br The fifth major s publisher of mass market paperbacks was New American Library Originally Penguin USA it became a separate publisher in as the New American Library of World Literature when it separated from Penguin and Victor Weybright and Kurt Enoch took over Its original focus was classics and scholarly works as well as popular and pulp fiction Eventually it shortened its name to New American Library and published books in the Mentor and Signet lines br New paperback publishers continued to enter the market Lion Books and Pyramid Books both Fawcett Gold Medal Books Ace Books and Ballantine Books both and Berkley Books br U S paperbacks quickly entered the Canadian market Canadian mass market paperback initiatives in the s included White Circle Books a subsidiary of Collins UK it was fairly successful but was soon outstripped by the success of Harlequin which began in and after a few years of publishing undistinguished novels focused on the romance genre and became one of the world s largest publishers br br br The s The paperback original fiction revolution br The term paperback original applies to paperback original publications of fiction It is not usually applied to original non fiction publications although paperback publishers also began issuing original non fiction titles br At first paperbacks consisted entirely of reprints but in Fawcett Publications Gold Medal Books began publishing original fiction in mass market paperback It was revolutionary br Fawcett an independent newsstand distributor in negotiated a contract with New American Library to distribute its Mentor and Signet titles That contract prohibited Fawcett from becoming a competitor by publishing its own paperback reprints Roscoe Kent Fawcett wanted to establish a line of Fawcett paperbacks and he felt original works would not be a violation of the contract To challenge the contract Fawcett published two anthologies The Best of True Magazine and What Today s Woman Should Know About Marriage and Sex reprinting material from Fawcett magazines not previously published in books br After these books were successfully published Fawcett announced in December that in February it would publish original fiction including westerns and mysteries at cents in a pocket sized format in a series called Gold Medal Books Publishers Weekly reported in May that Fawcett books were similar in appearance and cover allure to many of the paperback reprints but the story material was original and not reprinted from regular editions It also said the authors would be paid a advance with a guaranteed first printing of copies br That same month Fawcett released the first four Gold Medal books original novels by W R Burnett Sax Rohmer Richard Himmel and John Flagg one western and three mysteries adventure novels br Fawcett s action led to immediate controversy with an executive Vice president of Pocket Books attacking the whole idea a literary agent reporting that one hardcover publisher threatened to boycott his agency if he dealt with mass market publishers and Doubleday s LeBaron R Barker claiming that paperback originals could undermine the whole structure of publishing br Sales soared prompting Gold Medal editorial director Ralph Daigh to comment later In the past six months we have produced books and people seem to like them very well In Gold Medal published titles in br Other paperback publishers saw Gold Medal s success and began to emulate it Publishers Weekly reported in May that Avon had included three originals in its April releases and was seeking more It added that Dell was thinking about some systematic programs of original publishing Lion Books had a definite original publishing program in the works and that Graphic had begun publishing originals about a year earlier Bantam Pocket Books and New American Library said they were not going to publish originals br Also in Ace began publishing Ace Double Novel Books two books printed in one volume for cents one a reprint and one original with two covers and two title pages br In husband and wife publishers Ian and Betty Ballantine left Bantam Books and founded their own publishing house Ballantine Books to publish paperbacks simultaneously with their publication in hardcover by traditional publishers Their first book Cameron Hawley s Executive Suite published January at cents in the height simultaneously with Houghton Mifflin s hardcover edition was a success for both publishers Of their next nine novels two were published simultaneously by Houghton Mifflin and one by Farrar Straus Young and six were stand alone originals br In Dell announced its line of originals Dell First Editions and published its first novels by Walt Grove Frederic Brown and Charles Einstein br Genre categories began to emerge and mass market book covers reflected those categories Mass market paperbacks influenced slick and pulp magazines The market for cheap magazines diminished when buyers began to buy cheap books instead Authors also found themselves abandoning magazines and writing for the paperback market The leading paperback publishers often hired experienced pulp magazine cover artists including Rudolph Belarski and Earle K Bergey who helped create the look and feel of paperbacks and set an appealing visual standard that continues to this day Scores of well known authors were published in paperback including Arthur Miller and John Steinbeck br McClelland and Stewart entered the Canadian mass market book trade in the early s with its Canadian best seller library series at a time when Canadian literary culture was beginning to be popularized and a call for a Canadian author identity was discussed by the Canadian people br br br Types br br br Mass market br The mass market paperback is a small usually non illustrated inexpensive bookbinding format This includes the A format books of mm mm in in in the United Kingdom and the pocketbook format books of a similar size in the United States Mass market paperbacks usually are printed on cheap paper They are commonly released after the hardback edition and often sold not only at bookstores but also where books are not the main business such as at airports drugstores and supermarkets br In romance novels accounted for at least of all paperback sales In of paperback sales were romance Many titles especially in genre fiction have their first editions in paperback and are never published in hardcover this is particularly true of first novels by new authors br The mass market paperbacks sold in airport newsstands have given rise to the vaguely defined literary genre of the airport novel bought by travelers to read while they sit and wait Mass market paperbacks also have offered collections of comic strips and magazine cartoon series such as Ernie Bushmiller s Nancy and Chon Day s Brother Sebastian br br br B format br The term B format indicates a medium sized paperback of mm mm in in This size has been used to distinguish literary novels from genre fiction In the U S books of this size are thought of as smaller trade paperbacks see below br br br Trade paperback br A trade paperback also called trade paper edition and trade is a higher quality paperback book If it is a softcover edition of a previous hardcover edition and is published by the same house as the hardcover the text pages are normally identical with those of the hardcover edition and the book is almost the same size as the hardcover edition The pagination is the same so that references to the text will be unchanged this is particularly important for reviewers and scholars The only difference is the soft binding the paper is usually of higher quality than that of a mass market paperback often being acid free paper In the United States the term trade paperback also encompasses the medium sized paperbacks described as B format above British trade paperbacks are mm mm in in br Trade paperbacks did not enter the American market until around Unlike mass market paperbacks they are distributed by their original hard cover publishers directly to book stores not through magazine distributors to other retailers br br br Trade comics br br Trade paperbacks are often used to reprint several issues of a comic series in one volume usually an important storyline or the entire series and the name trade paperback has become synonymous with a collection of reprinted material Graphic novels may also be printed in trade paperback form Publishers sometimes release popular collections first in a hardback form followed by a trade paperback months later Examples include Marvel Comics Secret War and DC Comics Watchmen br Japanese manga when they are collected into volumes are published in the tank bon format
