Hephaestus UK hif EE st s US hif EST s eight spellings Greek translit H phaistos is the Greek god of artisans blacksmiths carpenters craftsmen fire metallurgy metalworking sculpture and volcanoes Hephaestus s Roman counterpart is Vulcan In Greek mythology Hephaestus was either the son of Zeus and Hera or he was Hera s parthenogenous child He was cast off Mount Olympus by his mother Hera because of his lameness the result of a congenital impairment or in another account by Zeus for protecting Hera from his advances in which case his lameness would have been the result of his fall rather than the reason for it br As a smithing god Hephaestus made all the weapons of the gods in Olympus He served as the blacksmith of the gods and was worshipped in the manufacturing and industrial centres of Greece particularly Athens The cult of Hephaestus was based in Lemnos Hephaestus s symbols are a smith s hammer anvil and a pair of tongs br br Hephaestus is probably associated with the Linear B Mycenaean Greek inscription A pa i ti jo found at Knossos The inscription indirectly attests his worship at that time because it is believed that it reads the theophoric name H p aistios or H phaistion The Greek theonym H phaistos is most likely of Pre Greek origin as the form without i Attic H phastos shows a typical Pre Greek variation and points to an original sy br br Hephaestus is given many epithets The meaning of each epithet is br br Amphigy eis often translated as the lame one literally lame on both sides vel sim br Kyllopod n club footed or of dragging feet br Khalke s coppersmith br Klytot khn s renowned artificer br Pol m tis shrewd crafty or of many devices br Aitna os Aetnaean owing to his workshop being supposedly located below Mount Aetna br Pol phr n ingenious inventive br Agaklyt s very famous glorious br Aithal eis the s sooty god br br Hephaestus had his own palace on Olympus containing his workshop with anvil and twenty bellows that worked at his bidding Hephaestus crafted much of the magnificent equipment of the gods and almost any finely wrought metalwork imbued with powers that appears in Greek myth is said to have been forged by Hephaestus He designed Hermes winged helmet and sandals the Aegis breastplate Aphrodite s famed girdle Agamemnon s staff of office Achilles armour Diomedes cuirass Heracles bronze clappers Helios chariot the shoulder of Pelops and Eros s bow and arrows In later accounts Hephaestus worked with the help of the Cyclopes among them his assistants in the forge Brontes Steropes and Arges br He gave to the blinded Orion his apprentice Cedalion as a guide In some versions of the myth Prometheus stole the fire that he gave to man from Hephaestus s forge Hephaestus also created the gift that the gods gave to man the woman Pandora and her pithos Being a skilled blacksmith Hephaestus created all the thrones in the Palace of Olympus br br According to Homer Hephaestus built automatons of metal to work for him or others This included tripods with golden wheels able to move at his wish in and out the assembly hall of the celestials and servant handmaidens wrought of gold in the semblance of living maids in them was understanding in their hearts and speech and strength gift of the gods They moved to support Hephaestus while walking And he put golden and silver lions and dogs at the entrance of the palace of Alkinoos in such a way that they could bite the invaders guard dogs that didn t age nor perish br A similar golden dog was set by Rhea to guard the infant Zeus and his nurse the goat Amaltheia on the island of Krete Later Tantalus was said to have stolen the automaton when it guarded Zeus temple or to have persuaded Pandareos to steal it for him Later texts attempt to replace the automaton with the idea that the golden dog was actually Rhea transformed in that way by Hephaestus br br According to Homer Iliad I Hera is mentioned as the mother of Hephaestus but there is not sufficient evidence to say that Zeus was his father although he refers to him in such way br According to Homer Odyssey VIII there is not sufficient evidence to say that Zeus was the father of Hephaestus although he refers to him in such way Hera is not mentioned as the mother br According to Hesiod Theogony Hera gave birth to Hephaestus on her own as revenge for Zeus giving birth to Athena without her Zeus lay with Metis br According to Pseudo Apollodorus Bibliotheca Hera gave birth to Hephaestus alone Pseudo Apollodorus also relates that according to Homer Hephaestus is one of the children of Zeus and Hera consciously contradicting Hesiod and Homer br Several later texts follow Hesiod s account including Hyginus and the preface to Fabulae br In the account of Attic vase painters Hephaestus was present at the birth of Athena and wields the axe with which he split Zeus head to free her In the latter account Hephaestus is there represented as older than Athena so the mythology of Hephaestus is inconsistent in this respect br br In one branch of Greek mythology Hera ejected Hephaestus from the heavens because of his congenital impairment He fell into the ocean and was raised by Thetis mother of Achilles and one of the Nereids and the Oceanid Eurynome br In another account Hephaestus attempting to rescue his mother from Zeus advances was flung down from the heavens by Zeus He fell for an entire day and landed on the island of Lemnos where he was cared for and taught to be a master craftsman by the Sintians an ancient tribe native to that island Later writers describe his physical disability as the consequence of his second fall while Homer makes him disabled from his birth br br Hephaestus was one of the Olympians to have returned to Olympus after being exiled br In an archaic story Hephaestus gained revenge against Hera for rejecting him by making her a magical golden throne which when she sat on it did not allow her to stand up again The other gods begged Hephaestus to return to Olympus to let her go but he refused saying I have no mother br br It was Ares who undertook the task of fetching Hephaestus at first but he was threatened by the fire god with torches At last Dionysus the god of wine fetched him intoxicated him with wine and took the subdued smith back to Olympus on the back of a mule accompanied by revelers a scene that sometimes appears on painted pottery of Attica and of Corinth In the painted scenes the padded dancers and phallic figures of the Dionysan throng leading the mule show that the procession was a part of the dithyrambic celebrations that were the forerunners of the satyr plays of fifth century Athens br According to Hyginus Zeus promised anything to Hephaestus in order to free Hera and he asked for the hand of Athena in marriage urged by Poseidon who was hostile toward her leading to his attempted rape of her In another version he demanded to be married to Aphrodite in order to release Hera and his mother fulfilled the request br The theme of the return of Hephaestus popular among the Attic vase painters whose wares were favored among the Etruscans may have introduced this theme to Etruria In the vase painters portrayal of the procession Hephaestus was mounted on a mule or a horse with Dionysus holding the bridle and carrying Hephaestus tools including a double headed axe br The traveller Pausanias reported seeing a painting in the temple of Dionysus in Athens which had been built in the th century but may have been decorated at any time before the nd century CE When Pausanias saw it he said br br There are paintings here Dionysus bringing Hephaestus up to heaven One of the Greek legends is that Hephaestus when he was born was thrown down by Hera In revenge he sent as a gift a golden chair with invisible fetters When Hera sat down she was held fast and Hephaestus refused to listen to any other of the gods except Dionysus in him he reposed the fullest trust and after making him drunk Dionysus brought him to heaven br br Though married to Hephaestus Aphrodite had an affair with Ares the god of war Eventually Hephaestus discovered Aphrodite s affair through Helios the all seeing Sun and planned a trap during one of their trysts While Aphrodite and Ares lay together in bed Hephaestus ensnared them in an unbreakable chain link net so small as to be invisible and dragged them to Mount Olympus to shame them in front of the other gods for retribution br The gods laughed at the sight of these naked lovers and Poseidon persuaded Hephaestus to free them in return for a guarantee that Ares would pay the adulterer s fine or that he would pay it himself Hephaestus states in The Odyssey that he would return Aphrodite to her father and demand back his bride price The Emily Wilson translation depicts Hephaestus demanding imploring Zeus before Poseidon offers however leading the reader to assume Zeus did not give back the price Hephaestus paid for his daughter and was thus why Poseidon intervened Some versions of the myth state that Zeus did not return the dowry and in fact Aphrodite simply charmed her way back again into her husband s good graces In the Iliad Hephaestus is described as married Grace Charis during the events depicted in the Trojan War while in the Theogony he is married to the Grace Aglaea The later Dionysiaca by Nonnus explicitly states that though Hephaestus and Aphrodite were once married she is referred to as his ancient wife that they have since separated and Hephaestus is now married to Charis br In a much later interpolated detail Ares put the young soldier Alectryon by their door to warn them of Helios s arrival as he suspected that Helios would tell Hephaestus of Aphrodite s infidelity if the two were discovered but Alectryon fell asleep on guard duty Helios discovered the two and alerted Hephaestus as Ares in rage turned Alectryon into a rooster which always crows at dawn when the sun is about to rise announcing its arrival br The Thebans told that the union of Ares and Aphrodite produced Harmonia but that of the union of Hephaestus with Aphrodite there was no issue However Virgil said that Eros was their child and Nonnus supported this Later authors explain this statement by saying that Eros was sired by Ares but passed off to Hephaestus as his own son Because Harmonia was conceived during Aphrodite s marriage to Hephaestus for revenge on Harmonia s wedding day to Cadmus Hephaestus gifted her with a finely worked but cursed necklace that brought immense suffering to her descendants culminating with the story of Oedipus br Hephaestus was somehow connected with the archaic pre Greek Phrygian and Thracian mystery cult of the Kabeiroi who were also called the Hephaistoi the Hephaestus men in Lemnos One of the three Lemnian tribes also called themselves Hephaestion and claimed direct descent from the god br br Hephaestus is to the male gods as Athena is to the female for he gives skill to mortal artists and was believed to have taught men the arts alongside Athena At Athens they had temples and festivals in common Both were believed to have great healing powers and Lemnian earth terra Lemnia from the spot on which Hephaestus had fallen was believed to cure madness the bites of snakes and haemorrhage and priests of Hephaestus knew how to cure wounds inflicted by snakes br He was represented in the temple of Athena Chalcioecus Athena of the Bronze House at Sparta in the act of delivering his mother on the chest of Cypselus giving Achilles s armor to Thetis and at Athens there was the famous statue of Hephaestus by Alcamenes in which his physical disability was only subtly portrayed He had almost no cults except in Athens and was possibly seen as a more approachable god to the city which shared her namesake The Greeks frequently placed miniature statues of Hephaestus near their hearths and these figures are the oldest of all his representations During the best period of Grecian art he was represented as a vigorous man with a beard and is characterized by his hammer or some other crafting tool his oval cap and the chiton br Athena is sometimes thought to be the soulmate of Hephaestus Nonetheless he seeks impetuously and passionately to make love to Athena at the moment of climax she pushes him aside and his semen falls to the earth where it impregnates Gaia br In Athens there is a Temple of Hephaestus the Hephaesteum miscalled the Theseum near the agora An Athenian founding myth tells that the city s patron goddess Athena refused a union with Hephaestus Pseudo Apollodorus records an archaic legend which claims that Hephaestus once attempted to rape Athena but she pushed him away causing him to ejaculate on her thigh Athena wiped the semen off using a tuft of wool which she tossed into the dust impregnating Gaia and causing her to give birth to Erichthonius whom Athena adopted as her own child The Roman mythographer Hyginus records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since he was the one who had smashed open Zeus s skull allowing Athena to be born Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married but when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union Athena vanished from the bridal bed causing him to ejaculate on the floor thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius Nonnus refers to this tale of Erechthonius being born of the Earth after a makeshift marriage but says that Athena then nursed Erechthonius on her manlike breast br br Some state that his origin myth was that of a daemon of fire coming up from the earth that he was also associated with gas which takes fire and burns and is considered by many people to be divine and that only later was a volcano considered Hephaestus s smithy br Hephaestus was associated by Greek colonists in southern Italy with the volcano gods Adranus of Mount Etna and Vulcanus of the Lipari islands The first century sage Apollonius of Tyana is said to have observed there are many other mountains all over the earth that are on fire and yet we should never be done with it if we assigned to them giants and gods like Hephaestus br Nevertheless Hephaestus domain over fire goes back to Homer s Iliad where he uses flames to dry the waters of Scamandrus River and force its eponymous deity who was attacking Achilles to retreat br br In the Trojan war Hephaestus sided with the Greeks but was also worshipped by the Trojans and saved one of their men from being killed by Diomedes Hephaestus favourite place in the mortal world was the island of Lemnos where he liked to dwell among the Sintians but he also frequented other volcanic islands such as Lipari Hiera Imbros and Sicily which were called his abodes or workshops br Hephaestus fought against the Giants and killed Mimas by throwing molten iron at him He also fought another Giant Aristaeus but he fled During the battle Hephaestus fell down exhausted and was picked up by Helios in his chariot As a gift of gratitude Hephaestus forged four ever flowing fountains and fire breathing bulls for Helios son Ae tes br The epithets and surnames by which Hephaestus is known by the poets generally allude to his skill in the plastic arts or to his figure or disability The Greeks frequently placed miniature statues of Hephaestus near their hearths and these figures are the oldest of all his representations br At the marriage of Peleus and Thetis he gave a knife as a wedding present br br According to most versions Hephaestus s consort is Aphrodite who is unfaithful to Hephaestus with a number of gods and mortals including Ares see Hephaestus and Aphrodite above However some sources say that Hephaestus is married to one of the Charites In Book XVIII of Homer s Iliad the consort of Hephaestus is Charis the grace with whom he lives in a bronze wrought home on Olympus a name used later in Nonnus s Dionysiaca However Hesiod names the member of the Charites who is married to Hephaestus as Aglaea and the Orphic Fragments compiled by Otto Kern say that by Hephaestus Aglaea became mother of Eucleia Good Repute Eupheme Acclaim Euthenia Prosperity and Philophrosyne Welcome Some scholars conclude that these references refer to the same goddess under different names although in the Dionysiaca both Aglaea and Charis appear as separate characters Aglaea refers to Charis as a separate attendant of Aphrodite when speaking to Eros br K roly Ker nyi notes that charis also means the delightfulness of art and supposes that Aphrodite is viewed as a work of art speculating that Aphrodite could also have been called Charis as an alternative name for in the Odyssey Homer suddenly makes her his wife br On the island of Lemnos Hephaestus consort was the sea nymph Cabeiro by whom he was the father of two metalworking gods named the Cabeiri In Sicily his consort was the nymph Aetna and his sons were two gods of Sicilian geysers called Palici who are elsewhere called the sons of Zeus by Aetna or of Zeus by Thalia another daughter of Hephaestus or of Adranos br Hephaestus fathered several children with mortals and immortals alike One of those children was the robber Periphetes br br In addition the Romans claim their equivalent god Vulcan to have produced the following children br br Cacus Cacus was mentioned also as a child of Hephaestus br Caeculus br br Hephaestus was sometimes portrayed as a vigorous man with a beard and was characterized by his hammer or some other crafting tool his oval cap and the chiton br Hephaestus is described in mythological sources as lame ch los and halting pedanos He was depicted with curved feet an impairment he had either from birth or as a result of his fall from Olympus In vase paintings Hephaestus is sometimes shown bent over his anvil hard at work on a metal creation and sometimes his feet are curved back to front Hephaistos amphigy eis He walked with the aid of a stick The Argonaut Palaimonius son of Hephaestus i e a bronze smith also had a mobility impairment br Other sons of Hephaestus were the Cabeiri on the island of Samothrace who were identified with the crab karkinos by the lexicographer Hesychius The adjective karkinopous crab footed signified lame according to Detienne and Vernant The Cabeiri were also physically disabled br In some myths Hephaestus built himself a wheeled chair or chariot with which to move around thus helping support his mobility while demonstrating his skill to the other gods In the Iliad it is stated that Hephaestus built twenty bronze wheeled tripods to assist him in moving around br Hephaestus s appearance and physical disability are taken by some to represent peripheral neuropathy and skin cancer resulting from arsenicosis caused by arsenic exposure from metalworking Bronze Age smiths added arsenic to copper to produce harder arsenical bronze especially during periods of tin scarcity Many Bronze Age smiths would have suffered from chronic arsenic poisoning as a result of their livelihood Consequently the mythic image of the disabled smith is widespread As Hephaestus was an iron age smith not a bronze age smith the connection is one from ancient folk memory br br Parallels in other mythological systems for Hephaestus s symbolism include br br The Ugarit craftsman god Kothar wa Khasis who is identified from afar by his distinctive walk possibly suggesting that he limps br As Herodotus was given to understand the Egyptian craftsman god Ptah was a dwarf god and is often depicted naked br In Norse mythology Weyland the Smith was a physically disabled bronzeworker br In Hinduism the artificer god Tvastr fills a similar role albeit more positively portrayed br The Ossetian god Kurdalagon may share a similar origin br br Solinus wrote that the Lycians dedicated a city to Hephaestus and called it Hephaestia br The Hephaestia in Lemnos was named after the god In addition the whole island of Lemnos was sacred to Hephaestus br Pausanias wrote that the Lycians in Patara had a bronze bowl in their temple of Apollo saying that Telephus dedicated it and Hephaestus made it br Pausanias also wrote that the village of Olympia in Elis contained an altar to the river Alpheios next to which was an altar to Hephaestus sometimes referred to as the altar of Warlike Zeus br The island Thermessa between Lipari and Sicily was also called Hiera of Hephaestus meaning sacred place of Hephaestus in Greek br br Pliny the Elder wrote that at Corycus there was a stone which was called Hephaestitis or Hephaestus stone According to Pliny the stone was red and was reflecting images like a mirror and when boiling water poured over it cooled immediately or alternatively when it placed in the sun it immediately set fire to a parched substance br The minor planet Hephaistos discovered in by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh was named in Hephaestus honour br br Family tree of the Greek gods br
