Activision Publishing Inc is an American video game publisher based in Santa Monica California It serves as the publishing business for its parent company Activision Blizzard and consists of several subsidiary studios Activision is one of the largest third party video game publishers in the world and was the top United States publisher in br The company was founded as Activision Inc on October in Sunnyvale California by former Atari game developers upset at their treatment by Atari in order to develop their own games for the popular Atari home video game console Activision was the first independent third party console video game developer The video game crash of in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision s footsteps without the experience of Activision s founders hurt Activision s position in console games and forced the company to diversify into games for home computers including the acquisition of Infocom After a management shift with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis the company renamed itself to Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications Mediagenic quickly fell into debt and the company was bought for around US by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around br Kotick drastically revamped and restructured the company to get it out of debt dismissing most of its staff moving the company to Los Angeles and reverting to the Activision name Building on existing assets the Kotick led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and after recovering from its former financial troubles started acquiring numerous studios and various types of intellectual property over the s and s among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series A holding company was formed as Activision s parent company to manage both its internal and acquired studios In this holding company merged with Vivendi Games the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment and formed Activision Blizzard with Kotick as its CEO Within this structure Activision manages numerous third party studios and publishes all games besides those created by Blizzard In October Microsoft acquired parent company Activision Blizzard maintaining that the company will continue to operate as a separate business While part of the larger Microsoft Gaming division Activision retains its function as the publisher of games developed by their studios br br br History br br br Founding br br In Warner Communications bought Atari Inc from Nolan Bushnell to help accelerate the Atari Video Computer System Atari VCS or later the Atari to market by That same year Atari began hiring programmers to create games for the system Prior to Warner s acquisition the company did not award bonus pay to programmers who worked on profitable games nor credit the programmers publicly to prevent them from being recruited by rival game companies Warner Communication s management style was also different from Bushnell s According to developer John Dunn Warner management treated developers as engineers rather than creative staff creating conflicts with staff Atari s CEO Ray Kassar named to that position following Warner s acquisition in was committed to keeping production costs minimal for Warner according to David Crane one of Atari s programmers br In early Atari s marketing department circulated a memo listing the best selling cartridges from the previous year to help guide game ideas Crane noted that the games he was fully responsible for had brought in over million for the company but he was still only receiving a salary Out of a development staff of thirty five four programmers Crane Larry Kaplan Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead had produced games that had accounted for of Atari s sales br Crane Kaplan Miller and Whitehead became vocal about the lack of recognition within the company and became known as the Gang of Four The group met with Kassar in May to demand that the company treat developers as record labels treated musicians with royalties and their names on game boxes Kaplan who called the others the best designers for the in the world recalled that Kassar called the four men towel designers and claimed that anybody can do a cartridge br The four made the decision to soon leave Atari and start their own business but were not sure how to go about it In the concept of third party developers did not exist as software for video game consoles were published exclusively by makers of the systems for which the games were designed thus the common thinking was that to make console games one needed to make a console first The four decided to create their own independent game development company They were directed by their attorney to Jim Levy who was at the time raising venture capital to get into the software business for early home computers Levy listened to their plans agreed with its direction and helped the four to secure about million in capital from Sutter Hill Ventures They also checked with legal counsel on their plans to develop games for the Atari VCS and included litigation fees in their capital investment br By August Crane and Miller had left Atari with Whitehead joining them shortly after Kaplan had also quit Atari in August but initially decided not to join as he did not like the starting business plan he came back later to join Activision that December Activision was formally founded on October with Levy serving as CEO The company was initially named Computer Arts Inc while they considered a better title The founders had thought of the name VSync Inc but feared that the public would not understand or know how to say it Levy suggested combining active and television to come up with Activision br br br Early years br Activision began working out of Crane s garage in the latter half of each programmer developing their own game that was planned for release in mid Dragster Fishing Derby Checkers and Boxing The four s knowledge of the Atari as well as software tricks for the system helped them make their own games visually distinct from Atari produced games To further distinguish themselves Activision s boxes were brightly colored and featured an in game screenshot on the back cover Instruction manuals for games devoted at least one page to credit the developer Additionally for nearly all of Activision s games through the instruction manuals included instructions for sending the company a photograph of a player s high scores to receive a patch in return br Ahead of the release of the first four games Activision obtained space at the mid year Consumer Electronics Show to showcase their titles and quickly obtained favorable press The attention afforded to Activision worried Atari as the four s departure had already created a major dent in their development staff Atari initially tried to tarnish Activision s reputation by using industry press at CES to label those that took trade secrets as evil terrible people according to Crane and then later threatened to refuse to sell Atari games to retailers that also carried these Activision titles By the end of Atari filed a formal lawsuit against Activision to try to stop the company claiming the four had stolen trade secrets and violated non disclosure agreements The lawsuit was settled by with Activision agreeing to pay royalties to Atari but otherwise legitimizing the third party development model In Activision s founders were given the Game Developers Choice First Penguin award reflecting their being the first successful third party developer in the video game industry br Following the first round of releases each of the founders developed their own titles about once a year over the first few years of the company While their games were modest hits one of the company s first successful games was Kaboom released in which was Activision s first game to sell over a million units Activision s breakout title was s Pitfall created by Crane More than four million copies of the game were sold Near the end of Kaplan left Activision to work on the development of the Amiga personal computer as he wanted to be more involved in hardware development br br Total sales for Activision were estimated at million and revenues at million ahead of its June initial public offering at this point Activision had around employees Danny Goodman stated in Creative Computing Video Arcade Games in I doubt that there is an active Atari owner who doesn t have at least one Activision cartridge in his library The company completed its public offering in June on NASDAQ under the stock ticker AVSN br br br The video game market crash br The success of Activision alongside the popularity of the Atari led to many more home consoles third party developers as well as other home consoles Activision produced some of its Atari games for the Intellivision and ColecoVision consoles among other platforms However several new third party developers also arose attempting to follow the approach Activision had used but without the experience they had according to Crane several of these companies were founded with venture capital and hired programmers with little game design experience off the street mass publishing whatever product the developers had made This was a contributing factor to the video game crash of br For Activision while they survived the crash they felt its effects in the following years These third party developers folded leaving warehouses full of unsold games which savvy retailers purchased and sold at a mass discount compared to Activision s manufacturer s suggested retail price While there was still a demand for Activision games uneducated consumers were more drawn to the heavily discounted titles instead reducing their income Their quarterly revenue dropped from million in mid to about million by the end of according to Levy and they were forced to lay off staff going from about employees to in that period Because of this Activision decided that they needed to diversify their games onto home computers such as the Commodore Apple and Atari bit computers to avoid completely going out of business like other third party developers There still was a drain of talent through from the crash Miller and Whitehead left in due to the large devaluation of their stock and went on to form Accolade br With the video game crash making console game development a risky proposition the company focused on developing for home computers with games like Little Computer People and Hacker while Levy tried to keep expenditures in check as they recovered Looking to expand further Activision acquired through a corporate merger the struggling text adventure pioneer Infocom in June This acquisition was spearheaded by Levy who was a big fan of Infocom s titles and felt the company was in a similar position as Activision About six months after the Infocom Wedding Activision s board decided to replace Levy with Bruce Davis Davis was against the purchase of Infocom from the start and was heavy handed in its management and even attempted to seek a lawsuit to recover their purchase from Infocom s shareholders Crane also found Davis difficult to work with and was concerned with how Davis managed the closure of Imagic one of the third party development studios formed after Activision s success in Crane left Activision in and helped Garry Kitchen found Absolute Entertainment In late Activision adopted the Electric Dreams brand usually used for British software for titles outside of English for the American market br br br Mediagenic br br In Activision began involvement in software besides video games such as business applications As a result Activision changed its corporate name to Mediagenic to better represent all of its activities br Mediagenic consisted of four groups br br Activision video game publisher for various platforms notably the Nintendo Entertainment System Master System Atari Atari ST Commodore and Amiga br Infocom developer of interactive fiction games br Gamestar initially an independent company but purchased by Activision in Specialized in sports video games br Ten Point O business application software br In after several years of losses Activision closed down the Infocom studios extending to only of the employees an offer to relocate to Activision s Silicon Valley headquarters Five of them accepted this offer br Notably during this time Mediagenic was known to have worked on the early version of a football game that would be the basis for Joe Montana Football Sega of America s Michael Katz had been able to get Sega to pay Mediagenic around early to develop this into the branded version after securing the rights to Joe Montana s name but was unaware of internal troubles that had been going on within the company which had left the state of the game mostly unfinished Katz and Sega were forced to take the incomplete game to Electronic Arts which had been developing its own John Madden Football series for personal computers to complete the game br During this period Mediagenic via Activision secured the rights to distribute games from Cyan Worlds The first game published by Activision from Cyan was The Manhole on CD ROM for personal computers the first major game distributed in this format br br br Purchase by Bobby Kotick br Davis management of Mediagenic failed to produce a profitable company in Mediagenic reported a loss of million on only million of revenue and had over million in debt Cyan severed their contract with Activision and turned to Broderbund for publishing including what would become one of the most significant computer games of the s Myst br br Bobby Kotick had become interested in the value of the video game industry following the crash and he and three other investors worked to buy Commodore International in an effort to gain access to the Amiga line of personal computers After failing to complete purchase the group bought a company that licensed Nintendo characters and through Nintendo was directed to the failing Mediagenic Kotick was drawn to buy out Mediagenic not for its current offerings but for the Activision name given its past successes with Pitfall with hopes to restore Activision to its former glory Crane said that Kotick has recognized the Activision brand name could be valued around million and rather than start a new company and spend that amount to obtain the same reputation he saw the opportunity to buy the failing Mediagenic at a bargain price and gain Activision s reputation with minimal cost Kotick and additional investors bought Mediagenic for approximately in This group of investors included real estate businessman Steve Wynn and Philips Electronics br Kotick became CEO of Mediagenic on its purchase and made several immediate changes He let go of all but of the companies employees performed a full restructuring of the company developed a bankruptcy restructuring plan and reincorporated the company in Los Angeles California In the bankruptcy plan Kotick recognized that Mediagenic still had valuable assets which included the Infocom library as well as its authoring tools to make games Activision s distribution network and licenses to develop on Nintendo and Sega home consoles Kotick offset some debt by giving stock in the company to its distributors as to keep them vested in the company s success Kotick also had the company reissue several of its past console and Infocom titles as compilations for personal computers Kotick had also recognized the value of the Zork property from Infocom and had the company develop a sequel Return to Zork Combined these steps allowed Mediagenic to fulfill on the bankruptcy plan and by the end of Kotick renamed Mediagenic to the original Activision name The new Activision went public in October raising about million and was listed on NASDAQ under its new ticker symbol ATVI br By Kotick s approach had met one promise he made to investors that he would give them four years of growth in revenues while remaining break even Reaching this goal Kotick then set Activision on his second promise to investors to develop high demand games and make the company profitable by br Activision published the first person perspective MechWarrior in based on FASA s pen and paper game BattleTech A sequel MechWarrior was released in after two years of delays and internal struggles prompting FASA not to renew their licensing deal with Activision To counter Activision released several more games bearing the MechWarrior name which did not violate their licensing agreement These included NetMech MechWarrior Ghost Bear s Legacy and MechWarrior Mercenaries The entire MechWarrior game series accounted for more than US million in sales br Activision procured the license to another pen and paper based war game Heavy Gear in The video game version was well received by critics with an average rating on GameRankings and being considered the best game of the genre at the time by GameSpot The Mechwarrior engine was also used in other Activision games including s Interstate and s Battlezone br br br Growth and acquisitions br With several of its own successfully developed games helping to turn a profit Kotick led Activision to start seeking acquisitions of video game development studios guided by market surveys to determine what areas of content to focus on It is estimated that between and Activision made acquisitions several for undisclosed amounts Several of these came prior to in the midst of the Dot com bubble enabling the company to acquire studios at a lower valuation On June Activision reorganized as a holding company Activision Holdings to manage Activision and its subsidiaries more effectively Activision changed its corporate name from Activision Inc to Activision Publishing Inc while Activision Holdings took Activision s former Activision Inc name Activision Publishing became a wholly owned subsidiary of Activision which in turn became the publicly traded company with all outstanding shares of capital stock converted br Some of the key acquisitions and investments made by Activision in this period include br br Raven Software Raven was founded in because of their close proximity Raven frequently collaborated with id Software and one of the studio s early successes was the Heretic series using id s Doom engine Around Raven s founders Brian and Steve Raffel felt the need to seek a parent company They arranged a publishing deal with Activision in which not only served to provide Raven additional financial support but also gave Activision the opportunity to work closely with id Software and gain business relationships with them By the end of Activision acquired Raven as one of its first subsidiaries under Kotick The acquisition price was million br Neversoft Prior to its acquisition in Activision had arranged a development deal with Neversoft to re develop Apocalypse a title that failed to be completed within Activision Subsequently Activision had Neversoft work on a prototype for a skateboarding game which would end up becoming the first in the Tony Hawk s series of skateboarding video games Tony Hawk s Pro Skater was a critical success leading Activision to acquire Neversoft in April After eight games the series has brought in billion br Infinity Ward After Electronic Arts released Medal of Honor Allied Assault in several of the developers from Inc disenchanted with their current contracts left to form a new studio Infinity Ward Kotick himself provided the group with startup funding as they were seeking to develop a similar title to Medal of Honor Activision acquired the studio for million in January and later

more than billion in revenue br Treyarch The Santa Monica California studio was founded in With the success of the first Tony Hawk game from Neversoft Activision used Treyarch to assist in further Tony Hawk games as well as to develop titles using Activision s license of Marvel s Spider Man Activision acquired the studio in for about million Following the success of Call of Duty from Infinity Ward Activision moved Treyarch to assist in the series development trading off each year major release between the two studios br Gray Matter Studios While Gray Matter was originally founded in as Xatrix Entertainment it was rebranded to Gray Matter in as they began work on Return to Castle Wolfenstein in conjunction with Nerve Software and oversight by id Software who owned the Castle Wolfenstein IP Activision the game s publisher acquired a portion of Gray Matter s stock during this time Return to Castle Wolfenstein was a critical and financial success and led Activision to acquire the remaining shares of Gray Matter in for about million with the intent to help Infinity Ward expand out the Call of Duty franchise In Activision made the decision to merge the smaller Gray Matter into the larger Treyarch to put their combined talents towards Call of Duty br RedOctane Around Red Octane was co developing Guitar Hero a console game based on the arcade game GuitarFreaks with Harmonix Harmonix was developing the software while RedOctane developed the instrument controllers Guitar Hero was a major success Activision purchased RedOctane for nearly million in June The

Activision s merger with Vivendi Activision gained the Spyro intellectual property and assigned Toys for Bob to develop the series in a new direction leading to the toys to life Skylanders series br br br Merger with Vivendi Games br br While Activision was highly successful with its range of developers and successful series Kotick was concerned that they did not have a title for the growing massively multiplayer online market which presented the opportunity for continued revenues from subscription models and microtransactions instead of the revenue from a single sale Around Kotick contacted Jean Bernard L vy the new CEO of Vivendi a French media conglomerate Vivendi had a games division Vivendi Games that was struggling to be viable at the time but its principal feature was that it owned Blizzard Entertainment and its highly successful World of Warcraft game which was drawing in billion a year in subscription fees Vivendi Games also owned Sierra Entertainment br L vy recognized Kotick wanted control of World of Warcraft and offered to allow the companies to merge but only if L vy held the majority shares in the merged group forcing Kotick to cede control Kotick fretted about this decision for a while according to friends and investors During this time in some of Activision s former successful properties began to wane such as Tony Hawk s so Activision bought RedOctane the publisher of the Guitar Hero franchise Kotick met with Blizzard s president Mike Morhaime and learned that Blizzard also had a successful inroad into getting their games into China a potentially lucrative market Given this potential opportunity Kotick agreed to the merger br Activision s board signed on to the merger by December The merger was completed in July The new company was called Activision Blizzard and was headed by Kotick while Vivendi maintained a share in the company The new company was estimated to be worth US billion ahead of Electronic Arts which was valued at US
