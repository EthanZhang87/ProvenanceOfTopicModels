In Greek mythology Ariadne Greek Latin Ariadne was a Cretan princess the daughter of King Minos of Crete There are different variations of Ariadne s myth but she is known for helping Theseus escape from the Minotaur and being abandoned by him on the island of Naxos There Dionysus saw Ariadne sleeping fell in love with her and later married her Many versions of the myth recount Dionysus throwing Ariadne s jeweled crown into the sky to create a constellation the Corona Borealis br Ariadne is associated with mazes and labyrinths because of her involvement in the myths of Theseus and the Minotaur br There are also festivals held in Cyprus and Naxos in Ariadne s honor br br br Etymology br Greek lexicographers in the Hellenistic period claimed that Ariadne is derived from the ancient Cretan dialectical elements ari most which is an intensive prefix and adn s holy Conversely Stylianos Alexiou has argued that despite the belief being that Ariadne s name is of Indo European origin it is actually pre Greek br Linguist Robert S P Beekes has also supported Ariadne having a pre Greek origin specifically being Minoan from Crete because her name includes the sequence dn rare in Indo European languages and an indication that it is a Minoan loanword br br br Family br Ariadne was the daughter of Minos the King of Crete and son of Zeus and of Pasipha Minos queen and daughter of Helios Others denominated her mother Crete daughter of Asterius the husband and King of Europa br Ariadne was the sister of Acacallis Androgeus Deucalion Phaedra Glaucus Xenodice and Catreus Through her mother Pasipha she was also the half sister of the Minotaur who was known in Crete as Asterion br Ariadne married Dionysus and became the mother of Oenopion the personification of wine Staphylus who was associated with grapes Thoas Peparethus Phanus Eurymedon Phliasus Ceramus Maron Euanthes Latramys Tauropolis br br br Mythology br br Minos put Ariadne in charge of the labyrinth where sacrifices were made as part of reparations either to Poseidon or Athena depending on the version of the myth later she helped Theseus conquer the Minotaur and save the children from sacrifice In other narrations she was the bride of Dionysus her status as mortal or divine varying in those accounts br br br Minos and Theseus br Because ancient Greek myths were orally transmitted like other myths that of Ariadne has many variations According to an Athenian version Minos attacked Athens after his son Androgeus was killed there The Athenians asked for terms and were required to sacrifice young men and maidens to the Minotaur every or years depending on the source One year the sacrificial party included Theseus the son of King Aegeus who volunteered in order to kill the Minotaur At first sight Ariadne fell in love with him and provided him a sword and ball of thread Ariadne s string so that he could retrace his way out of the labyrinth of the Minotaur br br Ariadne betrayed her father and her country for her lover Theseus She eloped with Theseus after he killed the Minotaur yet according to Homer in the Odyssey he had no joy of her for ere that Artemis slew her in seagirt Dia because of the witness of Dionysus The phrase seagirt Dia refers to the uninhabited island of Dia which lies off the northern coast of the Greek island of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea Dia may have referred to the island of Naxos br Most accounts claim that Theseus abandoned Ariadne on Naxos and in some versions Perseus mortally wounds her According to some Dionysus claimed Ariadne as wife therefore causing Theseus to abandon her Homer does not elaborate on the nature of Dionysus accusation yet the Oxford Classical Dictionary speculated that she was already married to him when she eloped with Theseus According to Plutarch Paion the Amathusian recounted Theseus accidentally abandoned Ariadne only to come back when it was too late br br br Naxos br br In Hesiod and in most other versions Theseus abandoned Ariadne sleeping on Naxos and Dionysus rediscovered and wedded her In a few versions of the myth Dionysus appeared to Theseus as they sailed from Crete saying that he had chosen Ariadne as his wife and demanding that Theseus leave her on Naxos for him this had the effect of absolving the Athenian cultural hero of desertion The vase painters of Athens often depicted Athena leading Theseus from the sleeping Ariadne to his ship br Ariadne bore Dionysus famous children including Oenopion Staphylus and Thoas Dionysus set her wedding diadem in the heavens as the constellation Corona Borealis Ariadne was faithful to Dionysus In one version of her myth Perseus killed her at Argos by turning her to stone with the head of Medusa during Perseus war with Dionysus The Odyssey relates that Artemis killed her According to Plutarch one version of the myth tells that Ariadne hanged herself after being abandoned by Theseus Dionysus then went to Hades and brought her and his mother Semele to Mount Olympus where they were deified br Some scholars have posited because of Ariadne s associations with thread spinning and winding that she was a weaving goddess br like Arachne and support this theory with the mytheme of the Hanged Nymph br see weaving in mythology br br br As a goddess br br Karl Kerenyi and Robert Graves theorized that Ariadne whose name they thought derived from Hesychius enumeration of a Cretan Greek form of arihagne utterly pure was a Great Goddess of Crete the first divine personage of Greek mythology to be immediately recognized in Crete once archaeological investigation began Kerenyi observed that her name was merely an epithet and claimed that she was originally the Mistress of the Labyrinth both a winding dancing ground and in the Greek opinion a prison with the dreaded Minotaur in its centre Kerenyi explained that a Linear B inscription from Knossos to all the gods honey to the mistress of the labyrinth honey in equal amounts implied to him that the Mistress of the Labyrinth was a Great Goddess in her own right Professor Barry Powell suggested that she was the Snake Goddess of Minoan Crete br br Plutarch in his Life of Theseus which treats him as a historical person reported that in contemporary Naxos was an earthly Ariadne who was distinct from a divine one br br Some of the Naxians also have a story of their own that there were two Minoses and two Ariadnes one of whom they say was married to Dionysos in Naxos and bore him Staphylos and his brother and the other of a later time having been carried off by Theseus and then abandoned by him came to Naxos accompanied by a nurse named Korkyne whose tomb they show and that this Ariadne also died there br In a kylix by the painter Aison c c BC Theseus drags the Minotaur from a temple like labyrinth yet the goddess who attends him in this Attic representation is Athena br br An ancient cult of Aphrodite Ariadne was observed at Amathus Cyprus according to the obscure Hellenistic mythographer Paeon of Amathus his works are lost but his narrative is among the sources that Plutarch cited in his vita of Theseus According to the myth that was current at Amathus the second most important Cypriot cult centre of Aphrodite Theseus ship was swept off course and the pregnant and suffering Ariadne put ashore in the storm Theseus attempting to secure the ship was inadvertently swept out to sea thus being absolved of abandoning Ariadne The Cypriot women cared for Ariadne who died in childbirth and was memorialized in a shrine Theseus overcome with grief upon his return left money for sacrifices to Ariadne and ordered two cult images one of silver and one of bronze erected br At the observation in her honour on the second day of the month Gorpiaeus a young man lay on the ground and vicariously experienced the throes of labour The sacred grove in which the shrine was located was denominated the Grove of Aphrodite Ariadne According to Cypriot legend Ariadne s tomb was located within the temenos of the sanctuary of Aphrodite Ariadne The primitive nature of the cult at Amathus in this narrative appears to be much older than the Athenian sanctioned shrine of Aphrodite who at Amathus received Ariadne derived from hagne sacred as an epithet br br br Libera br The Roman author Hyginus identified Ariadne as the Roman Libera bride to Liber br br br Festivals br br Ariadneia festivals honored Ariadne and were held in Naxos and Cyprus According to Plutarch some Naxians believed there were two Ariadnes one of which died on the island of Naxos after being abandoned by Theseus The Ariadneia festival honors Naxos as the place of her death with sacrifices and mourning Paeon as stated by Plutarch attributes the Ariadneia festival in Cyprus to Theseus who left money to the island so sacrifices could be made to commemorate Ariadne Sacrifices were held in the grove of Ariadne Aphrodite where Ariadne s tomb resided During these sacrifices a young man shall lie down and mimic a woman in labour by crying out and gesturing on the second day of the month Gorpiaeus One silver and one bronze statuette were also constructed in her honor br br br In Etruscan culture br Ariadne in Etruscan Areatha is paired with Dionysus in Etruscan Fufluns on Etruscan engraved bronze mirror backs where the Athenian
