Freyr Old Norse Lord sometimes anglicized as Frey is a widely attested god in Norse mythology associated with kingship fertility peace prosperity fair weather and good harvest Freyr sometimes referred to as Yngvi Freyr was especially associated with Sweden and seen as an ancestor of the Swedish royal house According to Adam of Bremen Freyr was associated with peace and pleasure and was represented with a phallic statue in the Temple at Uppsala According to Snorri Sturluson Freyr was the most renowned of the sir and was venerated for good harvest and peace br In the mythological stories in the Icelandic books the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda Freyr is presented as one of the Vanir the son of the god Nj r r and his sister wife as well as the twin brother of the goddess Freyja The gods gave him lfheimr the realm of the Elves as a teething present He rides the shining dwarf made boar Gullinbursti and possesses the ship Sk bla nir which always has a favorable breeze and can be folded together and carried in a pouch when it is not being used Freyr is also known to have been associated with the horse cult He also kept sacred horses in his sanctuary at Trondheim in Norway He has the servants Sk rnir Byggvir and Beyla br The most extensive surviving Freyr myth relates Freyr s falling in love with the female j tunn Ger r Eventually she becomes his wife but first Freyr has to give away his sword which fights on its own if wise be he who wields it Although deprived of this weapon Freyr defeats the j tunn Beli with an antler However lacking his sword Freyr will be killed by the fire j tunn Surtr during the events of Ragnar k br Like other Germanic deities veneration of Freyr was revived during the modern period through the Heathenry movement br br The Old Norse name Freyr lord is generally thought to descend from a Proto Norse form reconstructed as frawja stemming from the Proto Germanic noun frawjaz fraw j n lord and cognate with Gothic frauja Old English fr a or Old High German fr all meaning lord master The runic form frohila derived from an earlier fr jila may also be related Recently however an etymology deriving the name of the god from a nominalized form of the Proto Scandinavian adjective fraiw i a fruitful generative has also been proposed According to linguist Guus Kroonen within Germanic the attestation of ON frjar frj r fr r Icel frj r adj fertile prolific fraiwa clearly seems to point to a stem frai w meaning fecund Both in form and meaning fraiwa seed is reminiscent of Freyr fertility deity frauja The possibility must be considered therefore that fraiwa was metathesized from frawja a collective of some kind Freyr is also known by a series of other names which describe his attributes and role in religious practice and associated mythology br br Written c one of the oldest written sources on pre Christian Scandinavian religious practices is Adam of Bremen s Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum Adam claimed to have access to first hand accounts on pagan practices in Sweden He refers to Freyr with the Latinized name Fricco and mentions that an image of him at Skara was destroyed by the Christian missionary Bishop Egino Adam s description of the Temple at Uppsala gives some details on the god br br Later in the account Adam states that when a marriage is performed a libation is made to the image of Fricco br Historians are divided on the reliability of Adam s account br br When Snorri Sturluson was writing in th century Iceland the indigenous Germanic gods were still remembered although they had not been openly worshiped for more than two centuries br br In the Gylfaginning section of his Prose Edda Snorri introduces Freyr as one of the major gods br br This description has similarities to the older account by Adam of Bremen but the differences are interesting Adam assigns control of the weather and produce of the fields to Thor but Snorri says that Freyr rules over those areas Snorri also omits any explicitly sexual references in Freyr s description Those discrepancies can be explained in several ways Adam and Snorri were writing with different goals in mind It is possible that the Norse gods did not have exactly the same roles in Icelandic and Swedish paganism Either Snorri or Adam may also have had distorted information br The only extended myth related to Freyr in the Prose Edda is the story of his marriage br br The woman is Ger r a beautiful giantess Freyr immediately falls in love with her and becomes depressed and taciturn After a period of brooding he consents to talk to Sk rnir his foot page He tells Sk rnir that he has fallen in love with a beautiful woman and thinks he will die if he cannot have her He asks Sk rnir to go and woo her for him br br The loss of Freyr s sword has consequences According to the Prose Edda Freyr had to fight Beli without his sword and slew him with an antler But the result at Ragnar k the end of the world will be much more serious Freyr is fated to fight the fire giant Surtr and since he does not have his sword he will be defeated br br Even after the loss of his weapon Freyr still has two magical artifacts both dwarf made One is the ship Sk bla nir which will have favoring breeze wherever its owner wants to go and can also be folded together like a napkin and carried in a pouch The other is the boar Gullinbursti whose mane glows to illuminate the way for his owner No myths involving Sk bla nir have come down to us but Snorri relates that Freyr rode to Baldr s funeral in a wagon pulled by Gullinbursti br br Freyr is referred to several times in skaldic poetry In H sdr pa partially preserved in the Prose Edda he is said to ride a boar to Baldr s funeral br br In a poem by Egill Skalla Gr msson Freyr is called upon along with Nj r r to drive Eric Bloodaxe from Norway The same skald mentions in Arinbjarnarkvi a that his friend has been blessed by the two gods br br In Nafna ulur Freyr is said to ride the horse Bl ugh fi Bloody Hoof br br Freyr is mentioned in several of the poems in the Poetic Edda The information there is largely consistent with that of the Prose Edda while each collection has some details not found in the other br br V lusp the best known of the Eddic poems describes the final confrontation between Freyr and Surtr during Ragnar k br br Some scholars have preferred a slightly different translation in which the sun shines from the sword of the gods The idea is that the sword which Surtr slays Freyr with is the sword of the gods which Freyr had earlier bargained away for Ger r This would add a further layer of tragedy to the myth Sigur ur Nordal argued for this view but the possibility represented by Ursula Dronke s translation above is equally possible br br Gr mnism l a poem which largely consists of miscellaneous information about the gods mentions Freyr s abode br br A tooth gift was a gift given to an infant on the cutting of the first tooth Since Alfheimr or lfheimr means World of lfar Elves the fact that Freyr should own it is one of the indications of a connection between the Vanir and the obscure lfar Gr mnism l also mentions that the sons of valdi made Sk bla nir for Freyr and that it is the best of ships br br In the poem Lokasenna Loki accuses the gods of various misdeeds He criticizes the Vanir for incest saying that Nj r r had Freyr with his sister He also states that the gods discovered Freyr and Freyja having sex together The god T r speaks up in Freyr s defense br br Lokasenna also mentions that Freyr has servants called Byggvir and Beyla They seem to have been associated with the making of bread br br The courtship of Freyr and Ger r is dealt with extensively in the poem Sk rnism l br Freyr is depressed after seeing Ger r Nj r r and Ska i ask Sk rnir to go and talk with him Freyr reveals the cause of his grief and asks Sk rnir to go to J tunheimr to woo Ger r for him Freyr gives Sk rnir a steed and his magical sword for the journey br br When Sk rnir finds Ger r he starts by offering her treasures if she will marry Freyr When she declines he forces her to accept by threatening her with destructive magic br br Snorri Sturluson starts his epic history of the kings of Norway with Ynglinga saga a euhemerized account of the Norse gods Here Odin and the sir are men from Asia who gain power through their prowess in war and Odin s skills But when Odin attacks the Vanir he bites off more than he can chew and peace is negotiated after the destructive and indecisive sir Vanir War Hostages are exchanged to seal the peace deal and the Vanir send Freyr and Nj r r to live with the sir At this point the saga like Lokasenna mentions that incest was practised among the Vanir br br Odin makes Nj r r and Freyr priests of sacrifices and they become influential leaders Odin goes on to conquer the North and settles in Sweden where he rules as king collects taxes and maintains sacrifices After Odin s death Nj r r takes the throne During his rule there is peace and good harvest and the Swedes come to believe that Nj r r controls these things Eventually Nj r r falls ill and dies br br Freyr had a son named Fj lnir who succeeds him as king and rules during the continuing period of peace and good seasons Fj lnir s descendants are enumerated in Ynglingatal which describes the mythological kings of Sweden br br The th century Icelandic gmundar ttr dytts contains a tradition of how Freyr was transported in a wagon and administered by a priestess in Sweden Freyr s role as a fertility god needed a female counterpart in a divine couple McKinnell s translation br br Great heathen sacrifices were held there at that time and for a long while Frey had been the god who was worshipped most there and so much power had been gained by Frey s statue that the devil used to speak to people out of the mouth of the idol and a young and beautiful woman had been obtained to serve Frey It was the faith of the local people that Frey was alive as seemed to some extent to be the case and they thought he would need to have a sexual relationship with his wife along with Frey she was to have complete control over the temple settlement and all that belonged to it br In this short story a man named Gunnar was suspected of manslaughter and escaped to Sweden where Gunnar became acquainted with this young priestess He helped her drive Freyr s wagon with the god effigy in it but the god did not appreciate Gunnar and so attacked him and would have killed Gunnar if he had not promised himself to return to the Christian faith if he would make it back to Norway When Gunnar had promised this a demon jumped out of the god effigy and so Freyr was nothing but a piece of wood Gunnar destroyed the wooden idol and dressed himself as Freyr then Gunnar and the priestess travelled across Sweden where people were happy to see the god visiting them After a while he made the priestess pregnant but this was seen by the Swedes as confirmation that Freyr was truly a fertility god and not a scam Finally Gunnar had to flee back to Norway with his young bride and had her baptized at the court of Olaf Tryggvason br br Worship of Freyr is alluded to in several Icelanders sagas br The protagonist of Hrafnkels saga is a priest of Freyr He dedicates a horse to the god and kills a man for riding it setting in motion a chain of fateful events br In G sla saga a chieftain named orgr mr Freysgo i is an ardent worshipper of Freyr When he dies he is buried in a howe br br Hallfre ar saga V ga Gl ms saga and Vatnsd la saga also mention Freyr br Other Icelandic sources referring to Freyr include slendingab k Landn mab k and Hervarar saga br slendingab k written c is the oldest Icelandic source that mentions Freyr including him in a genealogy of Swedish kings Landn mab k includes a heathen oath to be sworn at an assembly where Freyr Nj r r and the almighty ss are invoked Hervarar saga mentions a Yuletide sacrifice of a boar to Freyr br br The th Century Danish Gesta Danorum describes Freyr under the name Fr as the viceroy of the gods br br That Freyr had a cult at Uppsala is well confirmed from other sources The reference to the change in sacrificial ritual may also reflect some historical memory There is archaeological evidence for an increase in human sacrifices in the late Viking Age though among the Norse gods human sacrifice is most often linked to Odin Another reference to Fr and sacrifices is found earlier in the work where the beginning of an annual bl t to him is related King Hadingus is cursed after killing a divine being and atones for his crime with a sacrifice br br The sacrifice of dark coloured victims to Freyr has a parallel in Ancient Greek religion where the chthonic fertility deities preferred dark coloured victims to lighter ones br In book Saxo identifies Fr as the king of Sweden rex Suetiae br br The reference to public prostitution may be a memory of fertility cult practices Such a memory may also be the source of a description in book of the stay of Starcatherus a follower of Odin in Sweden br br A strophe of the Anglo Saxon rune poem c records that br br Ing was first among the East Danes seen by men br This may refer to the origins of the worship of Ingui in the tribal areas that Tacitus mentions in his Germania as being populated by the Inguieonnic tribes A later Danish chronicler lists Ingui was one of three brothers that the Danish tribes descended from The strophe also states that then he Ingui went back over the waves his wagon behind him which could connect Ingui to earlier conceptions of the wagon processions of Nerthus and the later Scandinavian conceptions of Freyr s wagon journeys br Ingui is mentioned also in some later Anglo Saxon literature under varying forms of his name such as For what doth Ingeld have to do with Christ and the variants used in Beowulf to designate the kings as leader of the friends of Ing The compound Ingui Frea OE and Yngvi Freyr ON likely refer to the connection between the god and the Germanic kings role as priests during the sacrifices in the pagan period as Frea and Freyr are titles meaning Lord br The Swedish royal dynasty was known as the Ynglings from their descent from Yngvi Freyr This is supported by Tacitus who wrote about the Germans In their ancient songs their only way of remembering or recording the past they celebrate an earth born god Tuisco and his son Mannus as the origin of their race as their founders To Mannus they assign three sons from whose names they say the coast tribes are called Ingaevones those of the interior Herminones all the rest Istaevones br br In a Viking Age statuette identified as a depiction of Freyr was discovered on the farm R llinge in Lunda S dermanland parish in the province of S dermanland Sweden The depiction features a cross legged seated bearded male with an erect penis He is wearing a pointed cap or helmet and stroking his triangular beard The seven centimeter tall statue is displayed at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities br br A part of the Swedish Skog tapestry depicts three figures that have been interpreted as allusions to Odin Thor and Freyr but also as the three Scandinavian holy kings Canute Eric and Olaf The figures coincide with th century descriptions of statue arrangements recorded by Adam of Bremen at the Temple at Uppsala and written accounts of the gods during the late Viking Age The tapestry is originally from H lsingland Sweden but is now housed at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities br br Small pieces of gold foil featuring engravings dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age known as gullgubber have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia at one site almost The foil pieces have been found largely on the sites of buildings only rarely in graves The figures are sometimes single occasionally an animal sometimes a man and a woman with a leafy bough between them facing or embracing one another The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are taking part in a dance and that they may have been connected with weddings as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods representing the notion of a divine marriage such as in the Poetic Edda poem Sk rnism l the coming together of Ger r and Freyr br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Norway br br Freysakr Freyr s field name of two old farms in Gol and Torpa br
