In ancient Greek religion and myth Dionysus Ancient Greek Dionysos is the god of wine making orchards and fruit vegetation fertility festivity insanity ritual madness religious ecstasy and theatre He was also known as Bacchus or Ancient Greek Bacchos by the Greeks a name later adopted by the Romans for a frenzy he is said to induce called baccheia As Dionysus Eleutherius the liberator his wine music and ecstatic dance free his followers from self conscious fear and care and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful His thyrsus a fennel stem sceptre sometimes wound with ivy and dripping with honey is both a beneficent wand and a weapon used to destroy those who oppose his cult and the freedoms he represents Those who partake of his mysteries are believed to become possessed and empowered by the god himself br His origins are uncertain and his cults took many forms some are described by ancient sources as Thracian others as Greek In Orphism he was variously a son of Zeus and Persephone a chthonic or underworld aspect of Zeus or the twice born son of Zeus and the mortal Semele The Eleusinian Mysteries identify him with Iacchus the son or husband of Demeter Most accounts say he was born in Thrace traveled abroad and arrived in Greece as a foreigner His attribute of foreignness as an arriving outsider god may be inherent and essential to his cults as he is a god of epiphany sometimes called the god who comes br Wine was a religious focus in the cult of Dionysus and was his earthly incarnation Wine could ease suffering bring joy and inspire divine madness Festivals of Dionysus included the performance of sacred dramas enacting his myths the initial driving force behind the development of theatre in Western culture The cult of Dionysus is also a cult of the souls his maenads feed the dead through blood offerings and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead He is sometimes categorised as a dying and rising god br Romans identified Bacchus with their own Liber Pater the Free Father of the Liberalia festival patron of viniculture wine and male fertility and guardian of the traditions rituals and freedoms attached to coming of age and citizenship but the Roman state treated independent popular festivals of Bacchus Bacchanalia as subversive partly because their free mixing of classes and genders transgressed traditional social and moral constraints Celebration of the Bacchanalia was made a capital offence except in the toned down forms and greatly diminished congregations approved and supervised by the State Festivals of Bacchus were merged with those of Liber and Dionysus br br The dio prefix in Ancient Greek Di n sos di ny sos has been associated since antiquity with Zeus genitive Dios and the variants of the name seem to point to an original Dios nysos The earliest attestation is the Mycenaean Greek dative form di wo nu so featured on two tablets that had been found at Mycenaean Pylos and dated to the twelfth or thirteenth century BC At that time there could be no certainty on whether this was indeed a theonym but the Greek Swedish Excavations at Kastelli Hill Chania unearthed inter alia four artefacts bearing Linear B inscriptions among them the inscription on item KH Gq is thought to confirm Dionysus s early worship br In Mycenaean Greek the form of Zeus is di wo The second element n sos is of unknown origin It is perhaps associated with Mount Nysa the birthplace of the god in Greek mythology where he was nursed by nymphs the Nysiads although Pherecydes of Syros had postulated n sa as an archaic word for tree by the sixth century BC On a vase of Sophilos the Nysiads are named nusae Kretschmer asserted that nus is a Thracian word that has the same meaning as n mph a word similar with nuos daughter in law or bride I E snus s Sanskr snus He suggested that the male form is n sos and this would make Dionysus the son of Zeus Jane Ellen Harrison believed that the name Dionysus means young Zeus Robert S P Beekes has suggested a Pre Greek origin of the name since all attempts to find an Indo European etymology are doubtful br br Later variants include Dion sos and Di n sos in Boeotia Dien n sos in Thessaly Deon sos and Deun sos in Ionia and Dinn sos in Aeolia besides other variants A Dio prefix is found in other names such as that of the Dioscures and may derive from Dios the genitive of the name of Zeus br Nonnus in his Dionysiaca writes that the name Dionysus means Zeus limp and that Hermes named the new born Dionysus this because Zeus while he carried his burden lifted one foot with a limp from the weight of his thigh and nysos in Syracusan language means limping In his note to these lines W H D Rouse writes It need hardly be said that these etymologies are wrong The Suda a Byzantine encyclopedia based on classical sources states that Dionysus was so named from accomplishing for each of those who live the wild life Or from providing everything for those who live the wild life br br Academics in the nineteenth century using study of philology and comparative mythology often regarded Dionysus as a foreign deity who was only reluctantly accepted into the standard Greek pantheon at a relatively late date based on his myths which often involve this theme a god who spends much of his time on earth abroad and struggles for acceptance when he returns to Greece However more recent evidence has shown that Dionysus was in fact one of the earliest gods attested in mainland Greek culture The earliest written records of Dionysus worship come from Mycenaean Greece specifically in and around the Palace of Nestor in Pylos dated to around BC The details of any religion surrounding Dionysus in this period are scant and most evidence comes in the form only of his name written as di wo nu su jo Dionysoio of Dionysus in Linear B preserved on fragments of clay tablets that indicate a connection to offerings or payments of wine which was described as being of Dionysus References have also been uncovered to women of Oinoa the place of wine who may correspond to the Dionysian women of later periods br br Other Mycenaean records from Pylos record the worship of a god named Eleuther who was the son of Zeus and to whom oxen were sacrificed The link to both Zeus and oxen as well as etymological links between the name Eleuther or Eleutheros with the Latin name Liber Pater indicates that this may have been another name for Dionysus According to K roly Ker nyi these clues suggest that even in the thirteenth century BC the core religion of Dionysus was in place as were his important myths At Knossos in Minoan Crete men were often given the name Pentheus who is a figure in later Dionysian myth and which also means suffering Ker nyi argued that to give such a name to one s child implies a strong religious connection potentially not the separate character of Pentheus who suffers at the hands of Dionysus followers in later myths but as an epithet of Dionysus himself whose mythology describes a god who must endure suffering before triumphing over it According to Ker nyi the title of man who suffers likely originally referred to the god himself only being applied to distinct characters as the myth developed br The oldest known image of Dionysus accompanied by his name is found on a dinos by the Attic potter Sophilos around BC and is located in the British Museum By the seventh century iconography found on pottery shows that Dionysus was already worshiped as more than just a god associated with wine He was associated with weddings death sacrifice and sexuality and his retinue of satyrs and dancers was already established A common theme in these early depictions was the metamorphosis at the hand of the god of his followers into hybrid creatures usually represented by both tame and wild satyrs representing the transition from civilized life back to nature as a means of escape br While scholarly references are scarce there exists a notable overlap between the Greco Roman Dionysus and the Hindu god Shiva Shared iconography and background include a crescent or horns on the head panther or tiger skins serpents phallic symbolism Shiva lingam association as a wanderer and outcaste and association with ritual ecstasy Shiva is understood to be one of a triple godhead

Greeks and traces of Dionysian type cult have also been found in ancient Minoan Crete br br The Dionysia Haloa Ascolia and Lenaia festivals were dedicated to Dionysus The Rural Dionysia or Lesser Dionysia was one of the oldest festivals dedicated to Dionysus begun in Attica and probably celebrated the cultivation of vines It was held during the winter month of Poseideon the time surrounding the winter solstice modern December or January The Rural Dionysia centered on a procession during which participants carried phalluses long loaves of bread jars of water and wine as well as other offerings and young girls carried baskets The procession was followed by a series of dramatic performances and drama competitions br The City Dionysia or Greater Dionysia took place in urban centers such as Athens and Eleusis and was a later development probably beginning during the sixth century BC Held three months after the Rural Dionysia the Greater festival fell near the spring equinox in the month of Elaphebolion modern March or April The procession of the City Dionysia was similar to that of the rural celebrations but more elaborate and led by participants carrying a wooden statue of Dionysus and including sacrificial bulls and ornately dressed choruses The dramatic competitions of the Greater Dionysia also featured more noteworthy poets and playwrights and prizes for both dramatists and actors in multiple categories br br The Anthesteria was an Athenian festival that celebrated the beginning of spring It spanned three days Pithoigia Jar Opening Choes The Pouring and Chythroi The Pots It was said the dead arose from the underworld during the span of the festival Along with the souls of the dead the Keres also wandered through the city and had to be banished when the festival ended On the first day Wine vats were opened The wine was opened and mixed in honour of the god The rooms and the drinking vessels were adorned with flowers along with children over three years of age br On the second day a solemn ritual for Dionysus occurred along with drinking People dressed up sometimes as members of Dionysus s entourage and visited others Choes was also the occasion of a solemn and secret ceremony in one of the sanctuaries of Dionysus in the Lenaeum which was closed for the rest of the year The basilissa or basilinna wife of the basileus underwent through a symbolic ceremonial marriage to the god possibly representing a Hieros gamos The basilissa was assisted by fourteen Athenian matrons called Gerarai who were chosen by the basileus and sworn to secrecy br The last day was dedicated to the dead Offerings were also offered to Hermes due to his connection to the underworld It was considered a day of merrymaking Some poured Libations on the tombs of deceased relatives Chythroi ended with a ritual cry intended to order the souls of the dead to return to the underworld Keres were also banished from the festival on the last day br To protect themselves from evil people chewed leaves of whitethorn and smeared their doors with tar to protect themselves The festival also allowed servants and slaves to join in on the festivities br br The central religious cult of Dionysus is known as the Bacchic or Dionysian Mysteries The exact origin of this religion is unknown though Orpheus was said to have invented the mysteries of Dionysus Evidence suggests that many sources and rituals typically considered to be part of the similar Orphic Mysteries actually belong to Dionysian mysteries Some scholars have suggested that additionally there is no difference between the Dionysian mysteries and the mysteries of Persephone but that these were all facets of the same mystery religion and that Dionysus and Persephone both had important roles in it Previously considered to have been a primarily rural and fringe part of Greek religion the major urban center of Athens played a major role in the development and spread of the Bacchic mysteries br The Bacchic mysteries served an important role in creating ritual traditions for transitions in people s lives originally primarily for men and male sexuality but later also created space for ritualizing women s changing roles and celebrating changes of status in a woman s life This was often symbolized by a meeting with the gods who rule over death and change such as Hades and Persephone but also with Dionysus mother Semele who probably served a role related to initiation into the mysteries br The religion of Dionysus often included rituals involving the sacrifice of goats or bulls and at least some participants and dancers wore wooden masks associated with the god In some instances records show the god participating in the ritual via a masked and clothed pillar pole or tree while his worshipers eat bread and drink wine The significance of masks and goats to the worship of Dionysus seems to date back to the earliest days of his worship and these symbols have been found together at a Minoan tomb near Phaistos in Crete br br As early as the fifth century BC Dionysus became identified with Iacchus a minor deity from the tradition of the Eleusinian Mysteries This association may have arisen because of the homophony of the names Iacchus and Bacchus Two black figure lekythoi c BC possibly represent the earliest evidence for such an association The nearly identical vases one in Berlin the other in Rome depict Dionysus along with the inscription IAKXNE a possible miswriting of IAKXE More early evidence can be found in the works of the fifth century BC Athenian tragedians Sophocles and Euripides In Sophocles Antigone c BC an ode to Dionysus begins by addressing Dionysus as the God of many names who rules over the glens of Demeter s Eleusis and ends by identifying him with Iacchus the Giver who leads the chorus of the stars whose breath is fire and whose attendant Thyiads dance in night long frenzy And in a fragment from a lost play Sophocles describes Nysa Dionysus traditional place of nurture From here I caught sight of Nysa haunt of Bacchus famed among mortals which Iacchus of the bull s horns counts as his beloved nurse In Euripides Bacchae c BC a messenger describing the Bacchic revelries on mount Cithaeron associates Iacchus with Bromius another of the names of Dionysus saying they began to wave the thyrsos calling on Iacchus the son of Zeus Bromius with united voice br An inscription found on a stone stele c BC found at Delphi contains a paean to Dionysus which describes his travels From Thebes where he was born he first went to Delphi where he displayed his starry body and with Delphian girls took his place on the folds of Parnassus then next to Eleusis where he is called Iacchus br br And in your hand brandishing your night br lighting flame with god possessed frenzy br you went to the vales of Eleusis br br where the whole people of Hellas br land alongside your own native witnesses br of the holy mysteries calls upon you br as Iacchus for mortals from their pains br you have opened a haven without toils br Strabo says that Greeks give the name Iacchus not only to Dionysus but also to the leader in chief of the mysteries In particular Iacchus was identified with the Orphic Dionysus who was a son of Persephone Sophocles mentions Iacchus of the bull s horns and according to the first century BC historian Diodorus Siculus it was this older Dionysus who was represented in paintings and sculptures with horns because he excelled in sagacity and was the first to attempt the yoking of oxen and by their aid to effect the sowing of the seed Arrian the second century Greek historian wrote that it was to this Dionysus the son of Zeus and Persephone not the Theban Dionysus that the mystic chant Iacchus is sung The second century poet Lucian also referred to the dismemberment of Iacchus br The fourth or fifth century poet Nonnus associated the name Iacchus with the third Dionysus He described the Athenian celebrations given to the first Dionysus Zagreus son of Persephone the second Dionysus Bromios son of Semele and the third Dionysus Iacchus br br They the Athenians honoured him as a god next after the son of Persephone and after Semele s son they established sacrifices for Dionysos late born and Dionysos first born and third they chanted a new hymn for Iacchos In these three celebrations Athens held high revel in the dance lately made the Athenians beat the step in honour of Zagreus and Bromios and Iacchos all together br By some accounts Iacchus was the husband of Demeter Several other sources identify Iacchus as Demeter s son The earliest such source a fourth century BC vase fragment at Oxford shows Demeter holding the child Dionysus on her lap By the first century BC Demeter suckling Iacchus had become such a common motif that the Latin poet Lucretius could use it as an apparently recognizable example of a lover s euphemism A scholiast on the second century AD Aristides explicitly names Demeter as Iacchus mother br br In the Orphic tradition the first Dionysus was the son of Zeus and Persephone and was dismembered by the Titans before being reborn Dionysus was the patron god of the Orphics who they connected to death and immortality and he symbolized the one who guides the process of reincarnation br This Orphic Dionysus is sometimes referred to with the alternate name Zagreus Greek The earliest mentions of this name in literature describe him as a partner of Gaia and call him the highest god Aeschylus linked Zagreus with Hades as either Hades son or Hades himself Noting Hades identity as Zeus katachthonios alter ego Timothy Gantz thought it likely that Zagreus originally perhaps the son of Hades and Persephone later merged with the Orphic Dionysus the son of Zeus and Persephone However no known Orphic sources use the name Zagreus to refer to the Orphic Dionysus It is possible that the association between the two was known by the third century BC when the poet Callimachus may have written about it in a now lost source Callimachus as well as his contemporary Euphorion told the story of the dismemberment of the infant Dionysus and Byzantine sources quote Callimachus as referring to the birth of a Dionysos Zagreus explaining that Zagreus was the poets name for the chthonic aspect of Dionysus The earliest definitive reference to the belief that Zagreus is another name for the Orphic Dionysus is found in the late first century writings of Plutarch The fifth century Greek poet Nonnus Dionysiaca tells the story of this Orphic Dionysus in which Nonnus calls him the older Dionysos illfated Zagreus Zagreus the horned baby Zagreus the first Dionysos Zagreus the ancient Dionysos and Dionysos Zagreus br br Bacchus was most often known by that name in Rome and other locales in the Republic and Empire although many often called him Dionysus br br The mystery cult of Bacchus was brought to Rome from the Greek culture of southern Italy or by way of Greek influenced Etruria It was established around BC in the Aventine grove of Stimula by a priestess from Campania near the temple where Liber Pater the Free Father had a State sanctioned popular cult Liber was a native Roman god of wine fertility and prophecy patron of Rome s plebeians citizen commoners and one of the members of the Aventine Triad along with his mother Ceres and sister or consort Libera A temple to the Triad was erected on the Aventine Hill in BC along with the institution of celebrating the festival of Liberalia The worship of the Triad gradually took on more and more Greek influence and by BC Liber and Libera had been formally identified with Bacchus and Proserpina Liber was often interchangeably identified with Dionysus and his mythology though this identification was not universally accepted Cicero insisted on the non identity of Liber and Dionysus and described Liber and Libera as children of Ceres br Liber like his Aventine companions carried various aspects of his older cults into official Roman religion He protected various aspects of agriculture and fertility including the vine and the soft seed of its grapes wine and wine vessels and male fertility and virility Pliny called Liber the first to establish the practice of buying and selling he also invented the diadem the emblem of royalty and the triumphal procession Roman mosaics and sarcophagi attest to various representations of a Dionysus like exotic triumphal procession In Roman and Greek literary sources from the late Republic and Imperial era several notable triumphs feature similar distinctively Bacchic processional elements recalling the supposedly historic Triumph of Liber br Liber and Dionysus may have had a connection that predated Classical Greece and Rome in the form of the Mycenaean god Eleutheros who shared the lineage and iconography of Dionysus but whose name has the same meaning as Liber Before the importation of the Greek cults Liber was already strongly associated with Bacchic symbols and values including wine and uninhibited freedom as well as the subversion of the powerful Several depictions from the late Republic era feature processions depicting the Triumph of Liber br br In Rome the most well known festivals of Bacchus were the Bacchanalia based on the earlier Greek Dionysia festivals These Bacchic rituals were said to have included omophagic practices such as pulling live animals apart and eating the whole of them raw This practice served not only as a reenactment of the infant death and rebirth of Bacchus but also as a means by which Bacchic practitioners produced enthusiasm etymologically to let a god enter the practitioner s body or to have her become one with Bacchus br br In Livy s account the Bacchic mysteries were a novelty at Rome originally restricted to women and held only three times a year they were corrupted by an Etruscan Greek version and thereafter drunken disinhibited men and women of all ages and social classes cavorted in a sexual free for all five times a month Livy relates their various outrages against Rome s civil and religious laws and traditional morality mos maiorum a secretive subversive and potentially revolutionary counter culture Livy s sources and his own account of the cult probably drew heavily on the Roman dramatic genre known as Satyr plays based on Greek originals The cult was suppressed by the State with great ferocity of the arrested most were executed Modern scholarship treats much of Livy s account with skepticism more certainly a Senatorial edict the Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus was distributed throughout Roman and allied Italy It banned the former Bacchic cult organisations Each meeting must seek prior senatorial approval through a praetor No more than three women and two men were allowed at any one meeting and those who defied the edict risked the death penalty br Bacchus was conscripted into the official Roman pantheon as an aspect of Liber and his festival was inserted into the Liberalia In Roman culture Liber Bacchus and Dionysus became virtually interchangeable equivalents Thanks to his mythology involving travels and struggles on earth Bacchus became euhemerised as a historical hero conqueror and founder of cities He was a patron deity and founding hero at Leptis Magna birthplace of the emperor Septimius Severus who promoted his cult In some Roman sources the ritual procession of Bacchus in a tiger drawn chariot surrounded by maenads satyrs and drunks commemorates the god s triumphant return from the conquest of India Pliny believed this to be the historical prototype for the Roman Triumph br br In the Neoplatonist philosophy and religion of Late Antiquity the Olympian gods were sometimes considered to number based on their spheres of influence For example according to Sallustius Jupiter Neptune and Vulcan fabricate the world Ceres Juno and Diana animate it Mercury Venus and Apollo harmonize it and lastly Vesta Minerva and Mars preside over it with a guarding power The multitude of other gods in this belief system subsist within the primary gods and Sallustius taught that Bacchus subsisted in Jupiter br In the Orphic tradition a saying was supposedly given by an oracle of Apollo that stated Zeus Hades and Helios Dionysus were three gods in one godhead This statement apparently conflated Dionysus not only with Hades but also his father Zeus and implied a particularly close identification with the sun god Helios When quoting this in his Hymn to King Helios Emperor Julian substituted Dionysus name with that of Serapis whose Egyptian counterpart Osiris was also identified with Dionysus br br Three centuries after the reign of Theodosius I which saw the outlawing of pagan worship across the Roman Empire the Quinisext Council in Constantinople felt it necessary to warn Christians against participating in persisting rural worship of Dionysus specifically mentioning and prohibiting the feast day Brumalia the public dances of women ritual cross dressing the wearing of Dionysiac masks and the invoking of Bacchus name when squeez ing out the wine in the presses or when pouring out wine into jars br According to the Lanercost chronicle during Easter in in Scotland the parish priest of Inverkeithing led young women in a dance in honor of Priapus and Father Liber commonly identified with Dionysus The priest danced and sang at the front carrying a representation of the phallus on a pole He was killed by a Christian mob later that year Historian C S Watkins believes that Richard of Durham the author of the chronicle identified an occurrence of apotropaic magic with his knowledge of ancient Greek religion rather than recording an actual case of survival of pagan rituals br The late medieval Byzantine scholar Gemistus Pletho secretly advocated in favor of a return to paganism in medieval Greece br In the eighteenth century Hellfire Clubs appeared in Britain and Ireland Though activities varied between the clubs some of them were very pagan and included shrines and sacrifices Dionysus was one of the most popular deities alongside deities like Venus and Flora Today one can still see the statue of Dionysus left behind in the Hellfire Caves br In Ephraim Lyon founded the Church of Bacchus in Eastford Connecticut He declared himself High Priest and added local drunks to the list of membership He maintained that those who died as members would go to a Bacchanalia for their afterlife br Modern pagan and polytheist groups often include worship of Dionysus in their traditions and practices most prominently groups which have sought to revive Hellenic polytheism such as the Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes YSEE In addition to libations of wine modern worshipers of Dionysus offer the god grape vines ivy and various forms of incense particularly styrax They may also celebrate Roman festivals such as the Liberalia March close to the Spring Equinox or Bacchanalia Various dates and various Greek festivals such as the Anthesteria Lenaia and the Greater and Lesser Dionysias the dates of which are calculated by the lunar calendar br br In the Greek interpretation of the Egyptian pantheon Dionysus was often identified with Osiris Stories of the dismemberment of Osiris and the re assembly and resurrection by Isis closely parallel those of the Orphic Dionysus and Demeter According to Diodorus Siculus as early as the fifth century BC the two gods had been syncretized as a single deity known as Dionysus Osiris The most notable record of this belief is found in Herodotus Histories Plutarch also described his belief that Osiris and Dionysus were identical stating that anyone familiar with the secret rituals associated with both gods would recognize obvious parallels and that their dismemberment myths and associated public symbols are enough additional evidence that they are the same god worshiped by two different cultures br Other syncretic Greco Egyptian deities arose out of this conflation including with the gods Serapis and Hermanubis Serapis was believed to be both Hades and Osiris and the Roman Emperor Julian considered him the same as Dionysus as well Dionysus Osiris was particularly popular in Ptolemaic Egypt as the Ptolemies claimed descent from Dionysus and as Pharaohs they had claim to the lineage of Osiris This association was most notable during a deification ceremony where Mark Antony became Dionysus Osiris alongside Cleopatra as Isis Aphrodite br Egyptian myths about Priapus said that the Titans conspired against Osiris killed him divided his body into equal parts and slipped them secretly out of the house All but Osiris penis which since none of them was willing to take it with him they threw into the river Isis Osiris wife hunted down and killed the Titans reassembled Osiris body parts into the shape of a human figure and gave them to the priests with orders that they pay Osiris the honours of a god But since she was unable to recover the penis she ordered the priests to pay to it the honours of a god and to set it up in their temples in an erect position br br The fifth fourth century BC philosopher Heraclitus unifying opposites declared that Hades and Dionysus the very essence of indestructible life zo are the same god Among other evidence Karl Ker nyi notes in his book that the Homeric Hymn To Demeter votive marble images and epithets all link Hades to being Dionysus He also notes that the grieving goddess Demeter refused to drink wine as she states that it would be against themis for her to drink wine which is the gift of Dionysus after Persephone s abduction because of this association indicating that Hades may in fact have been a cover name for the underworld Dionysus He suggests that this dual identity may have been familiar to those who came into contact with the Mysteries One of the epithets of Dionysus was Chthonios meaning the subterranean br br Evidence for a cult connection is quite extensive particularly in southern Italy especially when considering the heavy involvement of death symbolism included in Dionysian worship Statues of Dionysus found in the Ploutonion at Eleusis give further evidence as the statues found bear a striking resemblance to the statue of Eubouleus also called Aides Kyanochaites Hades of the flowing dark hair known as the youthful depiction of the Lord of the Underworld The statue of Eubouleus is described as being radiant but disclosing a strange inner darkness Ancient portrayals show Dionysus holding in his hand the kantharos a wine jar with large handles and occupying the place where one would expect to see Hades Archaic artist Xenocles portrayed on one side of a vase Zeus Poseidon and Hades each with his emblems of power with Hades head turned back to front and on the other side Dionysus striding forward to meet his bride Persephone with the kantharos in his hand against a background of grapes Dionysus also shared several epithets with Hades such as Chthonios Eubouleus and Euclius br Both Hades and Dionysus were associated with a divine tripartite deity with Zeus Zeus like Dionysus was occasionally believed to have an underworld form closely identified with Hades to the point that they were occasionally thought of as the same god br br According to Marguerite Rigoglioso Hades is Dionysus and this dual god was believed by the Eleusinian tradition to have impregnated Persephone This would bring the Eleusinian in harmony with the myth in which Zeus not Hades impregnated Persephone to bear the first Dionysus Rigoglioso argues that taken together these myths suggest a belief that is that with Persephone Zeus Hades Dionysus created in terms quoted from Ker nyi a second a little Dionysus who is also a subterranean Zeus The unification of Hades Zeus and Dionysus as a single tripartite god was used to represent the birth death and resurrection of a deity and to unify the shining realm of Zeus and the dark underworld realm of Hades According to Rosemarie Taylor Perry it is often mentioned that Zeus Hades and Dionysus were all attributed to being the exact same god Being a tripartite deity Hades is also Zeus doubling as being the Sky God or Zeus Hades abducts his daughter and paramour Persephone The taking of Kore by Hades is the act which allows the conception and birth of a second integrating force Iacchos Zagreus Dionysus also known as Liknites the helpless infant form of that Deity who is the unifier of the dark underworld chthonic realm of Hades and the Olympian Shining one of Zeus br br The Phrygian god Sabazios was alternately identified with Zeus or with Dionysus The Byzantine Greek encyclopedia Suda c tenth century stated Sabazios is the same as Dionysos He acquired this form of address from the rite pertaining to him for the barbarians call the bacchic cry sabazein Hence some of the Greeks too follow suit and call the cry sabasmos thereby Dionysos becomes Sabazios They also used to call saboi those places that had been dedicated to him and his Bacchantes Demosthenes in the speech On Behalf of Ktesiphon mentions them Some say that Saboi is the term for those who are dedicated to Sabazios that is to Dionysos just as those dedicated to Bakkhos are Bakkhoi They say that Sabazios and Dionysos are the same Thus some also say that the Greeks call the Bakkhoi Saboi br Strabo in the first century linked Sabazios with Zagreus among Phrygian ministers and attendants of the sacred rites of Rhea and Dionysos Strabo s Sicilian contemporary Diodorus Siculus conflated Sabazios with the secret Dionysus born of Zeus and Persephone However this connection is not supported by any surviving inscriptions which are entirely to Zeus Sabazios br Several ancient sources record an apparently widespread belief in the classical world that the god worshiped by the Jewish people Yahweh was identifiable as Dionysus or Liber via his identification with Sabazios Tacitus Lydus Cornelius Labeo and Plutarch all either made this association or discussed it as an extant belief though some like Tacitus specifically brought it up in order to reject it According to Plutarch one of the reasons for the identification is that Jews were reported to hail their god with the words Euoe and Sabi a cry typically associated with the worship of Sabazius According to scholar Sean M McDonough it is possible that Plutarch s sources had confused the cry of Iao Sabaoth typically used by Greek speakers in reference to Yahweh with the Sabazian cry of Euoe Saboe originating the confusion and conflation of the two deities The cry of Sabi could also have been conflated with the Jewish term sabbath adding to the evidence the ancients saw that Yahweh and Dionysus Sabazius were the same deity Further bolstering this connection would have been coins used by the Maccabees that included imagery linked to the worship of Dionysus such as grapes vine leaves and cups However the belief that the Jewish god was identical with Dionysus Sabazius was widespread enough that a coin dated to BC depicting a kneeling king was labelled Bacchus Judaeus BACCHIVS IVDAEVS and in BC praetor Cornelius Scipio Hispalus deported Jewish people for attempting to infect the Roman customs with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius br br Various different accounts and traditions existed in the ancient world regarding the parentage birth and life of Dionysus on earth complicated by his several rebirths By the first century BC some mythographers had attempted to harmonize the various accounts of Dionysus birth into a single narrative involving not only multiple births but two or three distinct manifestations of the god on earth throughout history in different lifetimes The historian Diodorus Siculus said that according to some writers of myths there were two gods named Dionysus an older one who was the son of Zeus and Persephone but that the younger one also inherited the deeds of the older and so the men of later times being unaware of the truth and being deceived because of the identity of their names thought there had been but one Dionysus He also said that Dionysus was thought to have two forms the ancient one having a long beard because all men in early times wore long beards and the younger one being long haired youthful and effeminate and young br br Though the varying genealogy of Dionysus was mentioned in many works of classical literature only a few contain the actual narrative myths surrounding the events of his multiple births These include the first century BC Bibliotheca historica by Greek historian Diodorus which describes the birth and deeds of the three incarnations of Dionysus the brief birth narrative given by the first century AD Roman author Hyginus which describes a double birth for Dionysus and a longer account in the form of Greek poet Nonnus s epic Dionysiaca which discusses three incarnations of Dionysus similar to Diodorus account but which focuses on the life of the third Dionysus born to Zeus and Semele br br Though Diodorus mentions some traditions which state an older Indian or Egyptian Dionysus existed who invented wine no narratives are given of his birth or life among mortals and most traditions ascribe the invention of wine and travels through India to the last Dionysus According to Diodorus Dionysus was originally the son of Zeus and Persephone or alternately Zeus and Demeter This is the same horned Dionysus described by Hyginus and Nonnus in later accounts and the Dionysus worshiped by the Orphics who was dismembered by the Titans and then reborn Nonnus calls this Dionysus Zagreus while Diodorus says he is also considered identical with Sabazius However unlike Hyginus and Nonnus Diodorus does not provide a birth narrative for this incarnation of the god It was this Dionysus who was said to have taught mortals how to use oxen to plow the fields rather than doing so by hand His worshipers were said to have honored him for this by depicting him with horns br br The Greek poet Nonnus gives a birth narrative for Dionysus in his late fourth or early fifth century AD epic Dionysiaca In it he described how Zeus intended to make a new Dionysos grow up a bullshaped copy of the older Dionysos who was the Egyptian god Osiris Dionysiaca Zeus took the shape of a serpent drakon and ravished the maidenhood of unwedded Persephoneia According to Nonnus though Persephone was the consort of the blackrobed king of the underworld she remained a virgin and had been hidden in a cave by her mother to avoid the many gods who were her suitors because all that dwelt in Olympos were bewitched by this one girl rivals in love for the marriageable maid Dionysiaca After her union with Zeus Persephone s womb swelled with living fruit and she gave birth to a horned baby named Zagreus Zagreus despite his infancy was able to climb onto the throne of Zeus and brandish his lightning bolts marking him as Zeus heir Hera saw this and alerted the Titans who smeared their faces with chalk and ambushed the infant Zagreus while he contemplated his changeling countenance reflected in a mirror They attacked him However according to Nonnus where his limbs had been cut piecemeal by the Titan steel the end of his life was the beginning of a new life as Dionysos He began to change into many different forms in which he returned the attack including Zeus Cronus a baby and a mad youth with the flower of the first down marking his rounded chin with black He then transformed into several animals to attack the assembled Titans including a lion a wild horse a horned serpent a tiger and finally a bull Hera intervened killing the bull with a shout and the Titans finally slaughtered him and cut him into pieces Zeus attacked the Titans and had them imprisoned in Tartaros This caused the mother of the Titans Gaia to suffer and her symptoms were seen across the whole world resulting in fires and floods and boiling seas Zeus took pity on her and in order to cool down the burning land he caused great rains to flood the world Dionysiaca br br In the Orphic tradition Dionysus was in part a god associated with the underworld As a result the Orphics considered him the son of Persephone and believed that he had been dismembered by the Titans and then reborn The earliest attestation of this myth of the dismemberment and rebirth of Dionysus comes from the st century BC in the works of Philodemus and Diodorus Siculus Later Neoplatonists such as Damascius and Olympiodorus added a number of further elements to the myth including the punishment of the Titans by Zeus for their act their destruction by a thunderbolt from his hand and the subsequent birth of humankind from their ashes however whether any of these elements were part of the original myth is the subject of debate among scholars The dismemberment of Dionysus the sparagmos has often been considered the most important myth of Orphism br Many modern sources identify this Orphic Dionysus with the god Zagreus though this name does not seem to have been used by any of the ancient Orphics who simply called him Dionysus As pieced together from various ancient sources the reconstructed story usually given by modern scholars goes as follows Zeus had intercourse with Persephone in the form of a serpent producing Dionysus The infant was taken to Mount Ida where like the infant Zeus he was guarded by the dancing Curetes Zeus intended Dionysus to be his successor as ruler of the cosmos but a jealous Hera incited the Titans to kill the child Damascius claims that he was mocked by the Titans who gave him a fennel stalk thyrsus in place of his rightful scepter br Diodorus relates that Dionysus is the son of Zeus and Demeter the goddess of agriculture and that his birth narrative is an allegory for the generative power of the gods at work in nature When the Sons of Gaia i e the Titans boiled Dionysus following his birth Demeter gathered together his remains allowing his rebirth Diodorus noted the symbolism this myth held for its adherents Dionysus god of the vine was born from the gods of the rain and the earth He was torn apart and boiled by the sons of Gaia or earth born symbolizing the harvesting and wine making process Just as the remains of the bare vines are returned to the earth to restore its fruitfulness the remains of the young Dionysus were returned to Demeter allowing him to be born again br br The birth narrative given by Gaius Julius Hyginus c BC AD in Fabulae agrees with the Orphic tradition that Liber Dionysus was originally the son of Jove Zeus and Proserpine Persephone Hyginus writes that Liber was torn apart by the Titans so Jove took the fragments of his heart and put them into a drink which he gave to Semele the daughter of Harmonia and Cadmus king and founder of Thebes This resulted in Semele becoming pregnant Juno appeared to Semele in the form of her nurse Beroe and told her Daughter ask Jove to come to you as he comes to Juno so you may know what pleasure it is to sleep with a god When Semele requested that Jove do so she was killed by a thunderbolt Jove then took the infant Liber from her womb and put him in the care of Nysus Hyginus states that for this reason he is called Dionysus and also the one with two mothers dim t r br Nonnus describes how when life was rejuvenated after the flood it was lacking in revelry in the absence of Dionysus The Seasons those daughters of the lichtgang still joyless plaited garlands for the gods only of meadow grass For Wine was lacking Without Bacchos to inspire the dance its grace was only half complete and quite without profit it charmed only the eyes of the company when the circling dancer moved in twists and turns with a tumult of footsteps having only nods for words hand for mouth fingers for voice Zeus declared that he would send his son Dionysus to teach mortals how to grow grapes and make wine to alleviate their toil war and suffering After he became protector of humanity Zeus promises Dionysus would struggle on earth but be received by the bright upper air to shine beside Zeus and to share the courses of the stars Dionysiaca br br The mortal princess Semele then had a dream in which Zeus destroyed a fruit tree with a bolt of lightning but did not harm the fruit He sent a bird to bring him one of the fruits and sewed it into his thigh so that he would be both mother and father to the new Dionysus She saw the bull shaped figure of a man emerge from his thigh and then came to the realization that she herself had been the tree Her father Cadmus fearful of the prophetic dream instructed Semele to make sacrifices to Zeus Zeus came to Semele in her bed adorned with various symbols of Dionysus He transformed into a snake and Zeus made long wooing and shouted Euoi as if the winepress were near as he begat his son who would love the cry Immediately Semele s bed and chambers were overgrown with vines and flowers and the earth laughed Zeus then spoke to Semele revealing his true identity and telling her to be happy you bring forth a son who shall not die and you I will call immortal Happy woman you have conceived a son who will make mortals forget their troubles you shall bring forth joy for gods and men Dionysiaca br br During her pregnancy Semele rejoiced in the knowledge that her son would be divine She dressed herself in garlands of flowers and wreathes of ivy and would run barefoot to the meadows and forests to frolic whenever she heard music Hera became envious and feared that Zeus would replace her with Semele as queen of Olympus She went to Semele in the guise of an old woman who had been Cadmus wet nurse She made Semele jealous of the attention Zeus gave to Hera compared with their own brief liaison and provoked her to request Zeus to appear before her in his full godhood Semele prayed to Zeus that he show himself Zeus answered her prayers but warned her that no other mortals had ever seen him as he held his lightning bolts Semele reached out to touch them and was burnt to ash Dionysiaca But the infant Dionysus survived and Zeus rescued him from the flames sewing him into his thigh So the rounded thigh in labour became female and the boy too soon born was brought forth but not in a mother s way having passed from a mother s womb to a father s Dionysiaca At his birth he had a pair of horns shaped like a crescent moon The Seasons crowned him with ivy and flowers and wrapped horned snakes around his own horns br An alternate birth narrative is given by Diodorus from the Egyptian tradition In it Dionysus is the son of Ammon who Diodorus regards both as the creator god and a quasi historical king of Libya Ammon had married the goddess Rhea but he had an affair with Amaltheia who bore Dionysus Ammon feared Rhea s wrath if she were to discover the child so he took the infant Dionysus to Nysa Dionysus traditional childhood home Ammon brought Dionysus into a cave where he was to be cared for by Nysa a daughter of the hero Aristaeus Dionysus grew famous due to his skill in the arts his beauty and his strength It was said that he discovered the art of winemaking during his boyhood His fame brought him to the attention of Rhea who was furious with Ammon for his deception She attempted to bring Dionysus under her own power but unable to do so she left Ammon and married Cronus br br Even in antiquity the account of Dionysus birth to a mortal woman led some to argue that he had been a historical figure who became deified over time a suggestion of Euhemerism an explanation of mythic events having roots in mortal history often applied to demi gods The th century Roman emperor and philosopher Julian encountered examples of this belief and wrote arguments against it In his letter To the Cynic Heracleios Julian wrote I have heard many people say that Dionysus was a mortal man because he was born of Semele and that he became a god through his knowledge of theurgy and the Mysteries and like our lord Heracles for his royal virtue was translated to Olympus by his father Zeus However to Julian the myth of Dionysus s birth and that of Heracles stood as an allegory for a deeper spiritual truth The birth of Dionysus Julian argues was no birth but a divine manifestation to Semele who foresaw that a physical manifestation of the god Dionysus would soon appear However Semele was impatient for the god to come and began revealing his mysteries too early for her transgression she was struck down by Zeus When Zeus decided it was time to impose a new order on humanity for it to pass from the nomadic to a more civilized mode of life he sent his son Dionysus from India as a god made visible spreading his worship and giving the vine as a symbol of his manifestation among mortals In Julian s interpretation the Greeks called Semele the mother of Dionysus because of the prediction that she had made but also because the god honored her as having been the first prophetess of his advent while it was yet to be The allegorical myth of the birth of Dionysus per Julian was developed to express both the history of these events and encapsulate the truth of his birth outside the generative processes of the mortal world but entering into it though his true birth was directly from Zeus along into the intelligible realm br br According to Nonnus Zeus gave the infant Dionysus to the care of Hermes Hermes gave Dionysus to the Lamides or daughters of Lamos who were river nymphs But Hera drove the Lamides mad and caused them to attack Dionysus who was rescued by Hermes Hermes next brought the infant to Ino for fostering by her attendant Mystis who taught him the rites of the mysteries Dionysiaca In Apollodorus account Hermes instructed Ino to raise Dionysus as a girl to hide him from Hera s wrath However Hera found him and vowed to destroy the house with a flood however Hermes again rescued Dionysus this time bringing him to the mountains of Lydia Hermes adopted the form of Phanes most ancient of the gods and so Hera bowed before him and let him pass Hermes gave the infant to the goddess Rhea who cared for him through his adolescence br Another version is that Dionysus was taken to the rain nymphs of Nysa who nourished his infancy and childhood and for their care Zeus rewarded them by placing them as the Hyades among the stars see Hyades star cluster In yet another version of the myth he is raised by his cousin Macris on the island of Euboea br br Dionysus in Greek mythology is a god of foreign origin and while Mount Nysa is a mythological location it is invariably set far away to the east or to the south The Homeric Hymn to Dionysus places it far from Phoenicia near to the Egyptian stream Others placed it in Anatolia or in Libya away in the west beside a great ocean in Ethiopia Herodotus or Arabia Diodorus Siculus br According to Herodotus br br As it is the Greek story has it that no sooner was Dionysus born than Zeus sewed him up in his thigh and carried him away to Nysa in Ethiopia beyond Egypt and as for Pan the Greeks do not know what became of him after his birth It is therefore plain to me that the Greeks learned the names of these two gods later than the names of all the others and trace the birth of both to the time when they gained the knowledge br The Bibliotheca seems to be following Pherecydes who relates how the infant Dionysus god of the grapevine was nursed by the rain nymphs the Hyades at Nysa Young Dionysus was also said to have been one of the many famous pupils of the centaur Chiron According to Ptolemy Chennus in the Library of Photius Dionysus was loved by Chiron from whom he learned chants and dances the bacchic rites and initiations br br When Dionysus grew up he discovered the culture of the vine and the mode of extracting its precious juice being the first to do so but Hera struck him with madness and drove him forth a wanderer through various parts of the earth In Phrygia the goddess Cybele better known to the Greeks as Rhea cured him and taught him her religious rites and he set out on a progress through Asia teaching the people the cultivation of the vine The most famous part of his wanderings is his expedition to India which is said to have lasted several years According to a legend when Alexander the Great reached a city called Nysa near the Indus river the locals said that their city was founded by Dionysus in the distant past and their city was dedicated to the god Dionysus These travels took something of the form of military conquests according to Diodorus Siculus he conquered the whole world except for Britain and Ethiopia br br Another myth according to Nonnus involves Ampelus a satyr who was loved by Dionysus As related by Ovid Ampelus became the constellation Vindemitor or the grape gatherer not so will the Grape gatherer escape thee The origin of that constellation also can be briefly told Tis said that the unshorn Ampelus son of a nymph and a satyr was loved by Bacchus on the Ismarian hills Upon him the god bestowed a vine that trailed from an elm s leafy boughs and still the vine takes from the boy its name While he rashly culled the gaudy grapes upon a branch he tumbled down Liber bore the lost youth to the stars Another story of Ampelus was related by Nonnus in an accident foreseen by Dionysus the youth was killed while riding a bull maddened by the sting of a gadfly sent by Selene the goddess of the Moon The Fates granted Ampelus a second life as a vine from which Dionysus squeezed the first wine br br Returning in triumph to Greece after his travels in Asia Dionysus came to be considered the founder of the triumphal procession He undertook efforts to introduce his religion into Greece but was opposed by rulers who feared it on account of the disorders and madness it brought with it br In one myth adapted in Euripides play The Bacchae Dionysus returns to his birthplace Thebes which is ruled by his cousin Pentheus Pentheus as well as his mother Agave and his aunts Ino and Autonoe disbelieve Dionysus divine birth Despite the warnings of the blind prophet Tiresias they deny his worship and denounce him for inspiring the women of Thebes to madness br br Dionysus uses his divine powers to drive Pentheus insane then invites him to spy on the ecstatic rituals of the Maenads in the woods of Mount Cithaeron Pentheus hoping to witness a sexual orgy hides himself in a tree The Maenads spot him maddened by Dionysus they take him to be a mountain dwelling lion and attack him with their bare hands Pentheus aunts and his mother Agave are among them and they rip him limb from limb Agave mounts his head on a pike and takes the trophy to her father Cadmus br Euripides description of this sparagmos was as follows br br But she was foaming at the mouth her eyes rolled all around her mind was mindless now Held by the god she paid the man no heed She grabbed his left arm just below the elbow wedging her foot against the victim s ribs she ripped his shoulder off not by mere force the god made easy everything they touch On his right arm worked Ino ripping flesh Autono and the mob of maenads griped him screaming as one While he had breath he cried but they were whooping victory calls One took an arm a foot another boot and all They stripped his torso bare staining their nails with blood then tossed balls of flesh around Pentheus body lies in fragments now on the hard rocks and mingled with the leaves buried in the woodland hard to find His mother stumbled across his head poor head She grabbed it and fixed it on her thrysus like a lions s to wave in joyful triumph at her hunt br The madness passes Dionysus arrives in his true divine form banishes Agave and her sisters and transforms Cadmus and his wife Harmonia into serpents Only Tiresias is spared br br In the Iliad when King Lycurgus of Thrace heard that Dionysus was in his kingdom he imprisoned Dionysus followers the Maenads Dionysus fled and took refuge with Thetis and sent a drought which stirred the people to revolt The god then drove King Lycurgus insane and had him slice his own son into pieces with an axe in the belief that he was a patch of ivy a plant holy to Dionysus An oracle then claimed that the land would stay dry and barren as long as Lycurgus lived and his people had him drawn and quartered Appeased by the king s death Dionysus lifted the curse In an alternative version sometimes depicted in art Lycurgus tries to kill Ambrosia a follower of Dionysus who was transformed into a vine that twined around the enraged king and slowly strangled him br br The Homeric Hymn to Dionysus recounts how while he sat on the seashore some sailors spotted him believing him a prince They attempted to kidnap him and sail away to sell him for ransom or into slavery No rope would bind him The god turned into a fierce lion and unleashed a bear on board killing all in his path Those who jumped ship were mercifully turned into dolphins The only survivor was the helmsman Acoetes who recognized the god and tried to stop his sailors from the start br In a similar story Dionysus hired a Tyrrhenian pirate ship to sail from Icaria to Naxos When he was aboard they sailed not to Naxos but to Asia intending to sell him as a slave This time the god turned the mast and oars into snakes and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes so that the sailors went mad and leaping into the sea were turned into dolphins In Ovid s Metamorphoses Bacchus begins this story as a young child found by the pirates but transforms to a divine adult when on board br Many of the myths involve Dionysus defending his godhead against skeptics Malcolm Bull notes that It is a measure of Bacchus s ambiguous position in classical mythology that he unlike the other Olympians had to use a boat to travel to and from the islands with which he is associated Paola Corrente notes that in many sources the incident with the pirates happens towards the end of Dionysus time among mortals In that sense it serves as final proof of his divinity and is often followed by his descent into Hades to retrieve his mother both of whom can then ascend into heaven to live alongside the other Olympian gods br br Pausanias in book II of his Description of Greece describes two variant traditions regarding Dionysus katabasis or descent into the underworld Both describe how Dionysus entered into the afterlife to rescue his mother Semele and bring her to her rightful place on Olympus To do so he had to contend with the hell dog Cerberus which was restrained for him by Heracles After retrieving Semele Dionysus emerged with her from the unfathomable waters of a lagoon on the coast of the Argolid near the prehistoric site of Lerna according to the local tradition This mythic event was commemorated with a yearly nighttime festival the details of which were held secret by the local religion According to Paola Corrente the emergence of Dionysus from the waters of the lagoon may signify a form of rebirth for both him and Semele as they reemerged from the underworld A variant of this myth forms the basis of Aristophanes comedy The Frogs br According to the Christian writer Clement of Alexandria Dionysus was guided in his journey by Prosymnus or Polymnus who requested as his reward to be Dionysus lover Prosymnus died before Dionysus could honor his pledge so to satisfy Prosymnus shade Dionysus fashioned a phallus from a fig branch and penetrated himself with it at Prosymnus tomb This story survives in full only in Christian sources whose aim was to discredit pagan mythology but it appears to have also served to explain the origin of secret objects used by the Dionysian Mysteries br This same myth of Dionysus descent to the underworld is related by both Diodorus Siculus in his first century BC work Bibliotheca historica and Pseudo Apollodorus in the third book of his first century AD work Bibliotheca In the latter Apollodorus tells how after having been hidden away from Hera s wrath Dionysus traveled the world opposing those who denied his godhood finally proving it when he transformed his pirate captors into dolphins After this the culmination of his life on earth was his descent to retrieve his mother from the underworld He renamed his mother Thyone and ascended with her to heaven where she became a goddess In this variant of the myth it is implied that Dionysus must prove his godhood to mortals and then also legitimize his place on Olympus by proving his lineage and elevating his mother to divine status before taking his place among the Olympic gods br br Dionysus discovered that his old school master and foster father Silenus had gone missing The old man had wandered away drunk and was found by some peasants who carried him to their king Midas alternatively he passed out in Midas rose garden The king recognized him hospitably feasting him for ten days and nights while Silenus entertained with stories and songs On the eleventh day Midas brought Silenus back to Dionysus Dionysus offered the king his choice of reward br Midas asked that whatever he might touch would turn to gold Dionysus consented though was sorry that he had not made a better choice Midas rejoiced in his new power which he hastened to put to the test He touched and turned to gold an oak twig and a stone but his joy vanished when he found that his bread meat and wine also turned to gold Later when his daughter embraced him she too turned to gold br The horrified king strove to divest the Midas Touch and he prayed to Dionysus to save him from starvation The god consented telling Midas to wash in the river Pactolus As he did so the power passed into them and the river sands turned gold this etiological myth explained the gold sands of the Pactolus br br When Theseus abandoned Ariadne sleeping on Naxos Dionysus found and married her They had a son named Oenopion but she committed suicide or was killed by Perseus In some variants Dionysus had her crown put into the heavens as the constellation Corona in others he descended into Hades to restore her to the gods on Olympus Another account claims Dionysus ordered Theseus to abandon Ariadne on the island of Naxos for Dionysus had seen her as Theseus carried her onto the ship and had decided to marry her Psalacantha a nymph promised to help Dionysus court Ariadne in exchange for his sexual favours but Dionysus refused so Psalacantha advised Ariadne against going with him For this Dionysus turned her into the plant with the same name br br Dionysus fell in love with a nymph named Nicaea in some versions by Eros binding Nicaea however was a sworn virgin and scorned his attempts to court her So one day while she was away he replaced the water in the spring from which she used to drink with wine Intoxicated Nicaea passed out and Dionysus raped her in her sleep When she woke up and realized what had happened she sought him out to harm him but she never found him She gave birth to his sons Telete Satyrus and others Dionysus named the ancient city of Nicaea after her br In Nonnus s Dionysiaca Eros made Dionysus fall in love with Aura a virgin companion of Artemis as part of a ploy to punish Aura for having insulted Artemis Dionysus used the same trick as with Nicaea to get her fall asleep tied her up and then raped her Aura tried to kill herself with little success When she gave birth to twin sons by Dionysus Iacchus and another boy she ate one twin before drowning herself in the Sangarius river br Also in the Dionysiaca Nonnus relates how Dionysus fell in love with a handsome satyr named Ampelos who was killed by Selene due to him challenging her On his death Dionysus changed him into the first grapevine br br A third descent by Dionysus to Hades is invented by Aristophanes in his comedy The Frogs Dionysus as patron of the Athenian dramatic festival the Dionysia wants to bring back to life one of the great tragedians After a poetry slam Aeschylus is chosen in preference to Euripides br When Hephaestus bound Hera to a magical chair Dionysus got him drunk and brought him back to Olympus after he passed out br Callirrhoe was a Calydonian woman who scorned Coresus a priest of Dionysus who threatened to afflict all the women of Calydon with insanity see Maenad The priest was ordered to sacrifice Callirhoe but he killed himself instead Callirhoe threw herself into a well which was later named after her br Dionysus also sent a fox that was fated never to be caught in Thebes Creon king of Thebes sent Amphitryon to catch and kill the fox Amphitryon obtained from Cephalus the dog that his wife Procris had received from Minos which was fated to catch whatever it pursued br Another account about Dionysus s parentage indicates that he is the son of Zeus and G Gaia also named Themel foundation corrupted into Semele br Hyginus relates that Dionysus once gave human speech to a donkey The donkey then proceeded to challenge Priapus in a contest about which between them had the better penis the donkey lost Priapus killed the donkey but Dionysus placed him among the stars above the Crab br br The earliest cult images of Dionysus show a mature male bearded and robed He holds a fennel staff tipped with a pine cone and known as a thyrsus Later images show him as a beardless sensuous naked or half naked androgynous youth the literature describes him as womanly or man womanish In its fully developed form his central cult imagery shows his triumphant disorderly arrival or return as if from some place beyond the borders of the known and civilized His procession thiasus is made up of wild female followers maenads and bearded satyrs with erect penises some are armed with the thyrsus some dance or play music The god himself is drawn in a chariot usually by exotic beasts such as lions or tigers and is sometimes attended by a bearded drunken Silenus This procession is presumed to be the cult model for the followers of his Dionysian Mysteries Dionysus is represented by city religions as the protector of those who do not belong to conventional society and he thus symbolizes the chaotic dangerous and unexpected everything which escapes human reason and which can only be attributed to the unforeseeable action of the gods br Dionysus was a god of resurrection and he was strongly linked to the bull In a cult hymn from Olympia at a festival for Hera Dionysus is invited to come as a bull with bull foot raging Walter Burkert relates Quite frequently Dionysus is portrayed with bull horns and in Kyzikos he has a tauromorphic image and refers also to an archaic myth in which Dionysus is slaughtered as a bull calf and impiously eaten by the Titans br br The snake and phallus were symbols of Dionysus in ancient Greece and of Bacchus in Greece and Rome There is a procession called the phallophoria in which villagers would parade through the streets carrying phallic images or pulling phallic representations on carts He typically wears a panther or leopard skin and carries a thyrsus His iconography sometimes includes maenads who wear wreaths of ivy and serpents around their hair or neck br The cult of Dionysus was closely associated with trees specifically the fig tree and some of his bynames exhibit this such as Endendros he in the tree or Dendrit s he of the tree Peters suggests the original meaning as he who runs among the trees or that of a runner in the woods Janda accepts the etymology but proposes the more cosmological interpretation of he who impels the world tree This interpretation explains how Nysa could have been re interpreted from a meaning of tree to the name of a mountain the axis mundi of Indo European mythology is represented both as a world tree and as a world mountain br Dionysus is also closely associated with the transition between summer and autumn In the Mediterranean summer marked by the rising of the dog star Sirius the weather becomes extremely hot but it is also a time when the promise of coming harvests grow Late summer when Orion is at the center of the sky was the time of the grape harvest in ancient Greece Plato describes the gifts of this season as the fruit that is harvested as well as Dionysian joy Pindar describes the pure light of high summer as closely associated with Dionysus and possibly even an embodiment of the god himself An image of Dionysus birth from Zeus thigh calls him the light of Zeus Dios phos and associates him with the light of Sirius br br The god and still more often his followers were commonly depicted in the painted pottery of Ancient Greece much of which made to hold wine But apart from some reliefs of maenads Dionysian subjects rarely appeared in large sculpture before the Hellenistic period when they became common In these the treatment of the god himself ranged from severe archaising or Neo Attic types such as the Dionysus Sardanapalus to types showing him as an indolent and androgynous young man often nude Hermes and the Infant Dionysus is probably a Greek original in marble and the Ludovisi Dionysus group is probably a Roman original of the second century AD Well known Hellenistic sculptures of Dionysian subjects surviving in Roman copies include the Barberini Faun the Belvedere Torso the Resting Satyr The Furietti Centaurs and Sleeping Hermaphroditus reflect related subjects which had by this time become drawn into the Dionysian orbit The marble Dancer of Pergamon is an original as is the bronze Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo a recent recovery from the sea br The Dionysian world by the Hellenistic period is a hedonistic but safe pastoral into which other semi divine creatures of the countryside have been co opted such as centaurs nymphs and the gods Pan and Hermaphrodite Nymph by this stage means simply an ideal female of the Dionysian outdoors a non wild bacchant Hellenistic sculpture also includes for the first time large genre subjects of children and peasants many of whom carry Dionysian attributes such as ivy wreaths and most should be seen as part of his realm They have in common with satyrs and nymphs that they are creatures of the outdoors and are without true personal identity The fourth century BC Derveni Krater the unique survival of a very large scale Classical or Hellenistic metal vessel of top quality depicts Dionysus and his followers br Dionysus appealed to the Hellenistic monarchies for a number of reasons apart from merely being a god of pleasure He was a human who became divine he came from and had conquered the East exemplified a lifestyle of display and magnificence with his mortal followers and was often regarded as an ancestor He continued to appeal to the rich of Imperial Rome who populated their gardens with Dionysian sculpture and by the second century AD were often buried in sarcophagi carved with crowded scenes of Bacchus and his entourage br The fourth century AD Lycurgus Cup in the British Museum is a spectacular cage cup which changes colour when light comes through the glass it shows the bound King Lycurgus being taunted by the god and attacked by a satyr this may have been used for celebration of Dionysian mysteries Elizabeth Kessler has theorized that a mosaic appearing on the triclinium floor of the House of Aion in Nea Paphos Cyprus details a monotheistic worship of Dionysus In the mosaic other gods appear but may only be lesser representations of the centrally imposed Dionysus The mid Byzantine Veroli Casket shows the tradition lingering in Constantinople around AD but probably not very well understood br br Bacchic subjects in art resumed in the Italian Renaissance and soon became almost as popular as in antiquity but his strong association with feminine spirituality and power almost disappeared as did the idea that the destructive and creative powers of the god were indissolubly linked In Michelangelo s statue madness has become merriment The statue tries to suggest both drunken incapacity and an elevated consciousness but this was perhaps lost on later viewers and typically the two aspects were thereafter split with a clearly drunk Silenus representing the former and a youthful Bacchus often shown with wings because he carries the mind to higher places br br Titian s Bacchus and Ariadne and The Bacchanal of the Andrians both painted for the same room offer an influential heroic pastoral while Diego Vel zquez in The Triumph of Bacchus or Los borrachos the drinkers c and Jusepe de Ribera in his Drunken Silenus choose a genre realism Flemish Baroque painting frequently painted the Bacchic followers as in Van Dyck s Drunken Silenus and many works by Rubens Poussin was another regular painter of Bacchic scenes br A common theme in art beginning in the sixteenth century was the depiction of Bacchus and Ceres caring for a representation of love often Venus Cupid or Amore This tradition derived from a quotation by the Roman comedian Terence c c BC which became a popular proverb in the Early Modern period Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus without Ceres and Bacchus Venus freezes Its simplest level of meaning is that love needs food and wine to thrive Artwork based on this saying was popular during the period especially in Northern Mannerism in Prague and the Low Countries as well as by Rubens Because of his association with the vine harvest Bacchus became the god of autumn and he and his followers were often shown in sets depicting the seasons br br Dionysus has remained an inspiration to artists philosophers and writers into the modern era In The Birth of Tragedy the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proposed that a tension between Apollonian and Dionysian aesthetic principles underlay the development of Greek tragedy Dionysus represented what was unrestrained chaotic and irrational while Apollo represented the rational and ordered This concept of a rivalry or opposition between Dionysus and Apollo has been characterized as a modern myth as it is the invention of modern thinkers like Nietzsche and Johann Joachim Winckelmann and is not found in classical sources However the acceptance and popularity of this theme in Western culture has been so great that its undercurrent has influenced the conclusions of classical scholarship br Nietzsche also claimed that the oldest forms of Greek Tragedy were entirely based upon the suffering Dionysus In Nietzsche s work Beyond Good and Evil and later The Twilight of the Idols The Antichrist and Ecce Homo Dionysus is conceived as the embodiment of the unrestrained will to power Towards the end of his life Nietzsche famously went mad He was known to sign letters as both Dionysus and The Crucified in this period of his life In The Hellenic Religion of the Suffering God and Dionysus and Early Dionysianism the poet Vyacheslav Ivanov elaborates the theory of Dionysianism tracing the origins of literature and tragedy in particular to ancient Dionysian mysteries Ivanov said that Dionysus suffering was the distinctive feature of the cult just as Christ s suffering is significant for Christianity Karl Ker nyi characterizes Dionysus as representative of the psychological life force Greek Zo Other psychological interpretations place Dionysus emotionality in the foreground focusing on the joy terror or hysteria associated with the god Sigmund Freud specified that his ashes should be kept in an Ancient Greek vase painted with Dionysian scenes from his collection which remains on display at Golders Green Crematorium in London br J M Tolcher s autobiography Poof features Dionysus as a character and a force of modern liberation in Australia incorporating traditional myth and Nietzschean philosophy to represent queer suffering Dionysus as Tolcher is a convincing and sympathetic anti hero His crimes figurative and literal have rationales they are reparations they are specific acts of rebellion with a focus on above all survival His substance abuse is a symptom of the escapism of all outcast subcultures a grasp however doomed against nihilistic despair Poof is Tolcher s barbaric yawp a throat tearing shriek that is meant to ring in its readers ears long after this is what the silence of heteronormative WASP respectability costs for queer people this is the price of ignorance on a human body and psyche br br Walt Disney depicted Bacchus in the Pastoral segment of the animated film Fantasia as a Silenus like character br In an adaption of The Bacchae was performed called Dionysus in A film was made of the same performance The production was notable for involving audience participation nudity and theatrical innovations br In Stephen Sondheim and Burt Shevelove adapted Aristophanes comedy The Frogs into a modern musical which hit broadway in and was revived in London in The musical keeps the descent of Dionysus into Hades to bring back a playwright however the playwrights are updated to modern times and Dionysus is forced to choose between George Bernard Shaw and William Shakespeare br In The Orion Experience in the album Cosmicandy included a song titled Cult of Dionysus The song invokes themes from the god s cult The entire album is described as short sharp and ultimately memorable glowing with a long forgotten disco synth energy The song overall plays upon the god s themes of being devious and rebelling against social norms br In Dionysus was featured in Smite as a playable god under his Roman Bacchus name br In Dionysus was featured in Hades an indie roguelike action dungeon crawler video game developed and published by Supergiant Games He is one of the cousins of the protagonist and playable character Zagreus who is trying to escape the underworld and find his mother whilst his father Hades tries to stop him Dionysus offers boons and assist the Son of Hades in his attempts to escape from the underworld All of his boons and powers are based on his key traits from his Mythos focusing on alcohol related abilities and negative effects on enemies to assist the protagonist His characterisation in the game nods back to a lot of his stories and traits from the history of the character His interactions with other Gods also highlight his character as mischievous a lover of festivities and of course wine There is also the reference of the protagonist having the name Zagreus considered to be the first birth of Dionysus He is voiced by Cyrus Nemati br In the Australian musical project Dead Can Dance released an album entitled Dionysus Musician Brendan Perry described the inspiration for the album as a trance like Dionysian experience he had at a festival during a trip to rural Spain It s the spring festivals like that one where you see the real remnants of Dionysian festivals They re all over the Mediterranean in remote places where Christian influence hasn t been as great People wear masks and dance in circles almost like time has stood still in their celebrations Perry chose to employ Mediterranean folk instruments that mimic natural sounds in addition to a vocal chorus in order to evoke the atmosphere of an ancient festival br In the South Korean boy band BTS released a rap rock synth pop hip hop track named Dionysus as part of their album Map of the Soul Persona The naming of this song comes from the association of the namesake with debauchery and excess this is reflected in its lyrics talking about getting drunk on art playing on the Korean words for alcohol sul and art yesul as an example alongside expressions about their stardom legacy and artistic integrity The band s leader RM in a press release described the song as the joy and pain of creating something and an honest track br br Numerous scholars have compared narratives surrounding the Christian figure of Jesus with those associated with Dionysus br br Some scholars of comparative mythology identify both Dionysus and Jesus with the dying and rising god mythological archetype On the other hand it has been noted that the details of Dionysus death and rebirth are starkly different both in content and symbolism from Jesus The two stories take place in very different historical and geographic contexts Also the manner of death is different in the most common myth Dionysus was torn to pieces and eaten by the Titans but eventually restored to a new life from the heart that was left over br br Another parallel can be seen in The Bacchae where Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity which is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by Pontius Pilate However a number of scholars dispute this parallel since the confrontation between Dionysus and Pentheus ends with Pentheus dying torn into pieces by the mad women whereas the trial of Jesus ends with him being sentenced to death The discrepancies between the two stories including their resolutions have led many scholars to regard the Dionysus story as radically different from the one about Jesus except for the parallel of the arrest which is a detail that appears in many biographies as well br br E Kessler has argued that the Dionysian cult developed into strict monotheism by the fourth century AD together with Mithraism and other sects the cult formed an instance of pagan monotheism in direct competition with Early Christianity during Late Antiquity Scholars from the sixteenth century onwards especially Gerard Vossius also discussed the parallels between the biographies of Dionysus Bacchus and Moses Vossius named his sons Dionysius and Isaac Such comparisons surface in details of paintings by Poussin br John Moles has argued that the Dionysian cult influenced early Christianity and especially how Christians understood themselves as a new religion centered around a savior deity In particular he argues that the account of Christian origins in the Acts of the Apostles was heavily influenced by Euripides The Bacchae Moles also suggests that Paul the Apostle may have partially based his account of the Lord s Supper on the ritual meals performed by members of the Dionysian cult
