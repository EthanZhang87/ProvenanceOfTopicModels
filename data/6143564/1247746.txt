magazine within the book industry br She also introduced the magazine s short lived Quill Awards with nominees in categories selected by a nominating board of booksellers and librarians Winners were determined by the reading public who could vote at kiosks in Borders stores or online at the Quills site Reed Business dropped the Quill Awards in br Since the front covers of Publishers Weekly were used to display advertisements by book publishers PW editorial covers now feature illustrations and author photographs tied to interior articles these covers follow the front cover advertisement The

digitized archive of reviews Reviews appear two to four months prior to the publication date of a book and until when PW launched BookLife com a website for self published books books already in print were seldom reviewed br These anonymous reviews are short averaging words and it is not unusual for the review section to run as long as pages filling the second half of the magazine In the past a
