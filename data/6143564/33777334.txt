with only the goddess Bast as a guardian Over the course of the novel Carter is forced to assume the role of older brother and take on a greater level of independence than he has previously experienced As Elizabeth Bush says in a review of the novel the bittersweet ending lays the foundation for subsequent titles and character growth br Carter also learns to accept the facets of his personality which make him similar to Horus namely his ability to lead and his courage in the face of danger and learns that it is not disrespectful to his father to relax his standards a little and become his own person Despite his newfound individuality he retains many of his father s values and attributes He vows to find the real Zia Rashid a young girl to whom he is attracted over her dying shabti body much as his father did for his mother Carter acquires a khopesh in Amos s mansion which becomes his weapon of choice throughout the series He begins to specialize in combat magic and inherits his father s magic kit br br Three months after the defeat of Set Carter Sadie and Bast have begun to educate a group of about twenty initiates about the Path of the Gods br In this novel the trio and their trainees work to find Ra a powerful god who will help them in their upcoming fight with Apophis Carter experiences a number of traumatic experiences in the novel including the near death of himself and separately a trainee named Jaz the loss of a close friend Bes and the disappointment of Ra s inadequacy coupled with his former enemy Michel Desjardins s ultimate sacrifice to protect the Kanes from Apophis br The novel is characterized by Carter s eye opening experiences and his becoming the hero that destiny demands When he is poisoned by a tjesu heru Egyptian pushmi pullyu Sadie is forced to analyze his ren to learn his secret name the sum of his experiences even those he d never want to share He says this event felt like Sadie had opened me up on the surgery table examined me and sewn me back together Carter also struggles with his new and almost obsessive love for Zia Rashid and has to balance his desire to protect her with his duty to the rest of the world and cope when she admits that she does not feel the same for him On top of all this Carter is also learning to be a leader for children his own age and older annoyed by his sister s rebellious nature and occasional lack of responsibility His visit to the palace of Osiris in the underworld where he sees his deceased parents comforts him but reinforces the knowledge that he will never be able to live with them br br The st Nome s situation is dire in the opening of the final book as Apophis is soon to escape and the magicians are still searching for a way to defeat him The Kanes spend the course of the book recruiting all the Egyptian gods and gathering information about a dangerous spell to execrate the dangerous Apophis For a short while Carter struggles to channel Horus because the war god believes they should try an all out assault on Apophis rather than risk hunting for the spell and its ingredients The magicians manage to banish Apophis but this disruption of the balance between Order Ma at and Chaos Isfet forces the gods to retreat from the world including Horus Isis Ra and Carter s father Julius host to Osiris br The Serpent s Shadow represents Carter s final transformation into a leader and the head of his family with his mother and father now completely out of the picture Because of his victory over the serpent Carter is named pharaoh of the House of Life though he chooses not to exercise this power until he has matured He decides to continue life as a normal high school student while living at the Brooklyn House with his trainees Carter also begins a romantic relationship with Zia Rashid br br Carter is an African American teenager and closely resembles his father Julius in appearance He bears little to no resemblance to his sister and mother both of whom are Caucasian in appearance Because of this difference in appearance few people initially realize that he and Sadie are siblings something Carter has grown used to Carter typically carries an Eye of Horus symbol a gift from his father Later some of Horus s essence is left in the symbol and he removes it so as not to be tempted to use the power Carter s ba is a falcon with a human head recalling Horus br br Carter has frequently been whitewashed on covers of Kane Chronicles non English edition novels such as in Russia the Netherlands Italy and more Even the American covers depict Carter in a way that makes it difficult to tell if he has the dark brown skin he is said to have in the series though he still appears more African American than on many other editions Riordan complained about the issue on both his Twitter and Tumblr pages repeatedly saying the whitewashing of Carter Kane continues Ugh and Pretty art but I m not amused how they whitewash Carter He later announced that the Dutch and Russian editions had fixed covers br br Carter Kane is very protective of his family and friends especially Zia Rashid and will do anything to ensure their safety He tends to be a gentleman because of the way his father raised him and is always thinking of how to solve their next problem He is described as nerdy bookish and formal br br Magic Carter is a very powerful magician though is not formally trained He has more experience than the initiates of the other Nomes and his progress is quickened due to the Path of the Gods Carter s specialty is combat magic although he can use other techniques granted by the Path of Horus He can also use hieroglyphic spells and has been known to be able to speak about half a dozen Divine Words Carter also has the ability to transform into a falcon Whilst being the Eye of Horus Carter had the ability to transform other beings into animals for a short duration br Combat Skills During The Red Pyramid Carter shows superhuman reflexes whilst in a battle He deflects daggers at remarkable speeds and even dodges a dagger Although he usually uses combat magic Carter was once forced to use pure combat skills against opponents due to his link with Horus not being very strong He managed to hold his own against Sobek s crocodiles and was able to hold his own against Percy Jackson despite the latter being the better sword fighter Percy himself told Carter that he was one of the few people to fight him well br Animal Charming As a result of following the Path of Horus Carter has the ability to control the god s sacred animals such as falcons griffins and snakes He first used this ability to tame Freak the griffin in The Throne of Fire and it has allowed him to control the griffin and understand him to an extent since br br Khopesh Carter used a khopesh from Brooklyn House during the Red Pyramid and the first part of the Throne of Fire He later lost his sword while fighting the Tjesu heru and wasn t able to retrieve it Carter found himself a new khopesh in The Serpent s Shadow but again lost it in a fight with a massive hippo demon By the Son of Sobek he has possession of another khopesh This is Carter s main offensive weapon br Wand Carter used his wand through the Red Pyramid and the Throne of Fire until his encounter with the water demons He later used his wand from his father s tool kit and is still using it He can summon a shield of force around himself by focusing his will Carter can also send a burst of magic into anything his wand is in contact with to shock them however this does not work with Percy Jackson and in extension to any demigods This is Carter s main defensive weapon br Crook and flail At times Carter has been able to use the crook and flail of the sun god Ra This enhances his own abilities to the extent that he can make gods bow to him and in a rage harm Apophis where nothing else affected him While Ra gave him the crook and flail to keep he decided to leave them in the First Nome and only use them in big battles br Shabti While Carter was initially not very good at creating magical figurines he has proven capable of using them such as using his father s Doughboy in The Red Pyramid and using the shabti of Apophis to destroy him He has grown better over time with them now carrying wax to form them in his kit and able to shape a shabti on the fly without even looking In this case the shabti was rather deformed but it was due to a lack of time to finish properly br br Kane Chronicles UK website official br Percy Jackson Universe series
