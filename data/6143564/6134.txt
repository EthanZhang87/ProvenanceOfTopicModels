Charybdis Ancient Greek romanized Kh rybdis Attic Greek k rybdis Latin Charybdis Classical Latin k r bd s is a sea monster in Greek mythology Charybdis along with the sea monster Scylla appears as a challenge to epic characters such as Odysseus Jason and Aeneas Scholarship locates her in the Strait of Messina br The idiom between Scylla and Charybdis has come to mean being forced to choose between two similarly dangerous situations br br The sea monster Charybdis was believed to live under a small rock on one side of a narrow channel Opposite her was Scylla another sea monster who lived inside a much larger rock The sides of the strait were within an arrow shot of each other and sailors attempting to avoid one of them would come in reach of the other To be between Scylla and Charybdis therefore means to be presented with two opposite dangers the task being to find a route that avoids both Three times a day Charybdis swallowed a huge amount of water before belching it back out again creating large whirlpools capable of dragging a ship underwater In some variations of the story Charybdis was simply a large whirlpool instead of a sea monster br Through the descriptions of Greek mythical chroniclers and Greek historians such as Thucydides modern scholars generally agree that Charybdis was said to have been located in the Strait of Messina off the coast of Sicily and opposite a rock on the mainland identified with Scylla A whirlpool does exist there caused by currents meeting but it is dangerous only to small craft in extreme conditions br br Another myth makes Charybdis the daughter of Poseidon and Gaia and living as a loyal servant to her father br br Charybdis aided her father Poseidon in his feud with her paternal uncle Zeus and as such helped him engulf lands and islands in water Zeus angry over the land she stole from him sent her to the bottom of the sea with a thunderbolt from the sea bed she drank the water from the sea thrice a day creating whirlpools She lingered on a rock with Scylla facing her directly on another rock making a strait br In some myths Charybdis was a voracious woman who stole oxen from Heracles and was hurled by the thunderbolt of Zeus into the sea where she retained her voracious nature br br Odysseus faced both Charybdis and Scylla while rowing through a narrow channel He ordered his men to avoid Charybdis thus forcing them to pass near Scylla which resulted in the deaths of six of his men Later stranded on a raft Odysseus was swept back through the strait and passed near Charybdis His raft was sucked into her maw but he survived by clinging to a fig tree growing on a rock over her lair On the next outflow of water when his raft was expelled Odysseus recovered it and paddled away safely br br The Argonauts were able to avoid both dangers because Hera ordered the Nereid Thetis to guide them through the perilous passage br br In the Aeneid the Trojans are warned by Helenus of Scylla and Charybdis and are advised to avoid them by sailing around Pachynus point Cape Passero rather than risk the strait Later however they find themselves passing Etna and have to row for their lives to escape Charybdis br br Aristotle mentions in his Meteorologica that Aesop once teased a ferryman by telling him a myth concerning Charybdis With one gulp of the sea she brought the mountains to view islands appeared after the next The third is yet to come and will dry the sea altogether thus depriving the ferryman of his livelihood br br Icefalls br br Apollonius Rhodius Argonautica translated by Robert Cooper Seaton R C Loeb Classical Library Volume London William Heinemann Ltd Online version at the Topos Text Project br Apollonius Rhodius Argonautica George W Mooney London Longmans Green Greek text available at the Perseus Digital Library br Homer The Odyssey with an English Translation by A T Murray PH D in two volumes Cambridge MA Harvard University Press London William Heinemann Ltd ISBN Online version at the Perseus Digital Library Greek text available from the same website br Maurus Servius Honoratus In Vergilii carmina comentarii Servii Grammatici qui feruntur in Vergilii carmina commentarii recensuerunt Georgius Thilo et Hermannus Hagen Georgius Thilo Leipzig B G Teubner Online version at the Perseus Digital Library br br Smith William Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology London Scylla br br Media related to Charybdis at Wikimedia Commons br Chisholm Hugh ed Scylla and Charybdis Encyclop dia Britannica Vol th ed Cambridge University Press p
