Mount Olympus Greek romanized lympos IPA oli m bos is an extensive massif near the Thermaic Gulf of the Aegean Sea located on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia between the regional units of Larissa and Pieria about km mi southwest from Thessaloniki Mount Olympus has peaks and deep gorges br The highest peak Mytikas M tikas meaning nose rises to metres ft and is the highest peak in Greece and one of the highest peaks in Europe in terms of topographic prominence br In Greek mythology Olympus is the home of the Greek gods on Mytikas peak The mountain has exceptional biodiversity and rich flora It has been a National Park the first in Greece since It is also a World Biosphere Reserve br Olympus remains the most popular hiking summit in Greece as well as one of the most popular in Europe Organized mountain refuges and various mountaineering and climbing routes are available The usual starting point is the town of Litochoro which lies in the eastern foothills of the mountain some km mi from Thessaloniki br br The shape of Olympus was formed by rain and wind which produced an isolated tower almost metres ft above the sea which is only kilometres mi away from Litochoro Olympus has many peaks and an almost circular shape The mountain has a circumference of kilometres mi an average diameter of kilometres mi and square kilometres sq mi of area To the northwest lies the Aromanian village of Kokkinopilos The Makryrema stream separates Olympus from the massif of Voulgara The villages Petra Vrontou and Dion lie to the northeast while on the eastern side there is the town of Litochoro where Enipeas bisects the massif of Olympus On its southeastern side the Ziliana gorge divides Mount Olympus from Kato Olympos Lower Olympus while on its southwestern foothills there are the villages Sykaminea and Karya The Agia Triada Sparmou Monastery and the village Pythion lie to the west br Olympus s dry foothills known as the Xirokampi are covered in chaparral and provides habitat for animals such as wild boar Further east the plain of Dion is fertile and watered by the streams which originate on Olympus br br Mount Olympus is formed of sedimentary rock laid down million years ago in a shallow sea Various geological events that followed caused the emergence of the whole region and the sea Around one million years ago glaciers covered Olympus and created its plateaus and depressions With the temperature rise that followed the ice melted and the streams that were created swept away large quantities of crushed rock in the lowest places forming the alluvial fans that spread out all over the region from the foothills of the mountain to the sea The Geological Museum of Mount Olympus located in Leptokarya provides detailed information about the geological structure of the mountain br br The complicated geological past of the region is obvious from the morphology of Olympus and its National Park Features include deep gorges and lots of smooth peaks many of them over metres ft including Aghios Antonios metres ft Kalogeros metres ft Toumpa metres ft and Profitis Ilias metres ft However it is the central almost vertical rocky peaks that impress the visitor Over the town of Litochoro on the horizon the relief of the mountain displays an apparent V between two peaks of almost equal height The left limb is the peak named Mytikas or Pantheon It is Greece s highest peak Then on the right is Stefani or Thronos Dios Throne of Zeus metres ft which presents the most impressive and steep peak of Olympus with its last sharply rising metres presenting the greatest challenge for climbers Further south Skolio N E second highest sub peak metres ft completes an arc of about degrees with its steep slopes forming on the west side like a wall an impressive precipitous amphitheatrical cavity metres ft in depth and metres ft in circumference the Megala Kazania On the east side of the high peaks the steep slopes form zone like parallel folds the Zonaria Even narrower and steeper scorings the Loukia lead to the peak br On the north side between Stefani and Profitis Ilias extends the Muses Plateau at metres ft while further south almost in the center of the massif extends the alpine tundra region of Bara at an elevation of metres ft Olympus has numerous ravines and gullies Most distinguishable of the ravines are those of Mavrologos Enipeas km and Mavratzas Sparmos km near Bara and cut the massif in two oval portions On the southern foothills the great gorge of Ziliana km long consists of a natural limit that separates the mountain from Lower Olympus There are also many precipices and a number of caves even nowadays unexplored The form and layout of the rocks favor the emergence of numerous springs most of them lower than m small seasonal lakes and streams and a small river Enipeas with its springs in the site Prionia and its estuary in the Aegean Sea br br The origin of the name Olympos is unknown One theory suggests that it is compounded of ou lyma and pous meaning pure foot conforming to Hesiod s description of the earth as a sort of footstool for heaven up from which rise the Blessed Gods According to Robert S P Beekes the word is of pre Greek origin and he speculates that it originally meant mountain The word is also probably cognate with the Mycenean Greek word u ru pi ja jo which is most likely a term used to describe people or possibly an ethnic group In Homeric Greek Odyssey the variant Oulumpos occurs conceived of as the seat of the gods and not identified with any specific peak br Homer Iliad Odyssey also appears to be using as a common noun as a synonym of ouranos sky br Mount Olympus was historically also known as Mount Belus after Iliad where the seat of the gods is referred to as i heavenly threshold br In Ancient Greek religion and mythology Olympus was the name of the home of the Twelve Olympian gods This was conceived of as a lofty mountaintop and in all regions settled by Greek tribes the highest local elevation tended to be so named among the numerous peaks called Olumpos in antiquity are mountains in Mysia Laconia Lycia Cyprus Attica Euboea Ionia and Lesbos and others br Thessalian Olympus is the highest peak in any territory with Greek settlement and came to be seen as the Pan Hellenic representative of the mythological seat of the gods by at least the th century BC as Herodotus identifies Olympus as the peak in Thessaly br In Pieria at Olympus s northern foot the mythological tradition had placed the nine Muses patrons of the Fine Arts daughters of Zeus and the Titaness Mnemosyne br br In antiquity the Olympus massif formed the border between Thessaly and Macedon The history of the surrounding area is consequently of interest in the context of the Rise of Macedon the Chremonidean War and the Macedonian Wars during the th to nd centuries BC br In the period of the Ottoman Empire the mountain was a hiding place and base of operations for klephts and armatoloi It was known as Semavatevi in Turkish during the nearly years of Ottoman rule br In Olympus the second armatoliki was founded led by Kara Michalis in The action of the klephts in Olympus led the Turks to visit their outrage on the klephts ally village of Milia in the late th century which they destroyed In that period Livadi in Olympus became the seat of the armatoliki of Olympus and Western Macedonia with their first renowned commander Panos Zidros In the th century the Turks had to replace the armatoloi who very often joined the klephts with Muslim Albanian armatoloi who ravaged the countryside of Macedonia However Olympus s armatoloi even after their capitulation to Ali Pasha never ceased fighting on land and at sea Among them who were active there and in nearby regions were Nikotsaras Giorgakis Olympios and the legendary family of Lazaioi In the early th century even for some time after the liberation from the Ottoman Empire robbers were active in the region the best known of them the notorious Giagoulas while during the German invasion in the Hellenic Army fought significant battles along with units of New Zealanders and Australians During the German Occupation the mountain was one of the centers of the Greek Resistance while a little later the Greek Civil War started there in Litochoro br br The whole region of Pieria s Olympus was declared an archaeological and historical site for the preservation of its monumental and historical character Five kilometre away from the sea is Dion sacred city of the ancient Macedons dedicated to Zeus and the Twelve Olympians Its prosperity lasted from the th century BC to the th century AD The excavations continuing since have revealed numerous findings of the Macedonian the Hellenistic and the Roman period Currently there is a unique archaeological park of hectares with the ancient town and the sacred places of worship outside its walls Many statues and other invaluable items are kept in the nearby Dion s archaeological museum Pimblia and Leivithra two other towns in Olympus s region are related to Orpheus and the Orphic mysteries According to a tradition Orpheus son of Apollo and Calliope one of the Muses taught here the mystic ceremonies of worship of Dionysus also known as Bacchus By the sea in a strategic position at Macedonia s gates is located Platamon Castle built between th and th century AD in the ancient town of Heracleia To the north the ancient Pydna is located Here in BC the decisive battle between the Macedonians and the Romans took place Between Pydna and Mount Olympus are a fortified bishop s seat from the Byzantine period called Louloudies and the Macedonian Tombs of Katerini and Korinos br br In the Olympus region there are also several Christian monuments among them the highest elevation chapel of Orthodox Christianity dedicated to Prophet Elias in Greek tradition associated with mountaintops on the summit of the same name Profitis Ilias at m br It was built in the th century by Saint Dionysios of Olympus who also founded the most significant monastery in the region The Old Monastery of Dionysios elevation m lies in Enipeas gorge and is accessible by car from Litochoro It was looted and burned by the Ottomans and in it was destroyed by the German invaders who suspected it was a guerrilla den Nowadays it has been partially restored and operates as a dependency of the New Monastery of Dionysios that is outside Litochoro On Olympus s southern foot in a dominant position m in Ziliana gorge there is the Kanalon Monastery km away from Karya It was founded in by the monks Damianos and Joakim and since it has been restored and operates as a convent Further west in the edge of Mavratza stream at m there is the Agia Triada Sparmou Monastery that flourished in the early th century possessed great property and assisted to establish the famous Tsaritsani school It was abandoned in but in it was completely renovated and reopened as a male monastery affiliated to Elassona s diocese br br Archaeological evidence suggests that Mount Olympus was regularly visited in religious pilgrimages through antiquity and the early Middle Ages For instance ancient Greek pottery coins and evidence of sacrificial ashes estimated to be from B C have been found on the summit Plutarch writing during the Roman Empire reported that writings and sacrificial ashes left by priests and religious pilgrims on the summit of the mountains of Mount Kyllini and Mount Olympus could be found intact several years later neither being washed away by rains or scattered by winds Plutarch cited this as evidence that the highest mountains on Earth were above the clouds and winds Augustine of Hippo writing in the early Middle Ages similarly reported in On Genesis that on the peak of Mount Olympus which is said to rise above the area of this humid air we are told certain letters are regularly made in the dust and are a year later found whole and unmarred by those who climb that mountain for their solemn memorials br The third highest peak of Mount Olympus called Agios Antonios Saint Anthony N E m is known to have been the site of a sanctuary of Zeus in antiquity based on archaeological finds discovered in In the modern era a series of explorers tried to study the mountain and to reach its summit Examples include the French archaeologist Leon Heuzey the German explorer Heinrich Barth and the German engineer Edward Richter Richter tried to reach the summit in but was abducted by klephts who also killed the Ottoman gendarmes that accompanied him br It was just one year after the liberation of northern Greece from Ottoman rule on August that the summit of Olympus was finally reached The Swiss Fr d ric Boissonnas and Daniel Baud Bovy aided by a hunter of wild goats from Litochoro Christos Kakkalos were the first to reach Greece s highest peak Kakkalos who had much experience climbing Olympus was the first of the three to climb Mytikas Afterwards and until his death in he was the official guide on Olympus In he and Marcel Kurz reached the second highest summit of Olympus Stefani Based on these explorations Kurz in edited Le Mont Olympe a book that includes the first detailed map of the summits In the painter Vasilis Ithakisios climbed Olympus together with Kakkalos reaching a cave that he named Shelter of the Muses and he spent many summers painting views of the mountain Olympus was later photographed and mapped in detail by others and a series of successful climbs and winter ascents of the steepest summits in difficult weather conditions took place br Climbing Mount Olympus is a non technical hike except for the final section from the Skala summit to the Mytikas peak which is a YDS class rock scramble and due to high exposed to heights requires resistance to acrophobia It is estimated that over people goes on a Mount Olympus each year most of them reaching only the Skala and Skolio summits Most climbs of Mount Olympus start from the town of Litochoro which took the name City of Gods because of its location at the foot of the mountain From there a road goes to Prionia where the hike begins at the bottom of the mountain br br Generally speaking Olympus s climate can be described as Mediterranean with continental influence Its local variations are the result of the impact of the sea and the rugged terrain of the region In the lower locations Litochoro and the foothills the climate is typically Mediterranean i e hot and dry in the summer but humid and cold in the winter Higher it is more humid warm and sometimes severe with more intense meteorological phenomena in these locations it often snows throughout winter while rain and snow is not unusual even in the summer The temperature varies in winter from C to C and in summer from C to C while winds are an almost daily occurrence Generally the temperature falls C per m of elevation As the elevation rises meteorological phenomena are more intense and the changes in temperature and humidity are often sudden br The coastal northeast slopes of Olympus receive more rain than the continental northwest so as a result there is a clear difference in vegetation being more abundant in the first of them The hottest month is August while the coldest is February br The mountain s highest zone over metres is snowcapped for about nine months September to May In some places the winds gather snow metres thick anemosouria in Greek while in some deep ravines the snow is maintained all over the year everlasting snow For this Olympus s alpine region recordings have been made in the s in the highest elevation weather station in Greece that was established on the summit of Aghios Antonios m providing a number of interesting data for the mountain s climate The average temperature is C in winter and C in summer The average annual precipitation heights vary from cm at Prionia m to cm at Aghios Antonios about half of them rainfall and hailstorms in summer and the rest snowfall in winter The weather may change several times in the same day In summer rainfalls are frequent commonly as evening thunderstorms many times accompanied by hail and strong winds However water springs over metres are scarce and visitors should ensure that they have always water and of course the necessary clothing for any weather conditions br br The research of Olympus s plants started in when the French botanist Aucher loy studied them According to this and later studies the National Park of Olympus is considered one of the richest flora regions in Greece with about species and subspecies that represent some of Greek flora Of them are characterized as significant are Greek endemic and of them are local endemic i e they can be found only in Olympus and are rare in Greece or and have there the limits of their spread within Northern Greece br An important book about the plants and flowers from the beach of the Aegean Sea up to the upper regions of Mount Olympus was written in by the Swedish botanist Arne Strid br Most of those found in lower elevation are the common Mediterranean and central European species Ramonda heldreichii syn Jankaea heldreichii a plant relict of the Ice age is of particular interest to botanists The intense diversity of the landscape the varying orientation of the slopes and their position in relation to the sea affect locally Olympus s climate and so a local microclimate prevails combined with the geological background and the soil favor the growth of particular vegetation types and biotopes Generally Olympus s northeast side is densely forested as it receives the most rainfall while the southwest one has significantly sparser vegetation br br In Olympus there are generally four sequential flora zones but due to the complex topography and variety of microclimates these do not form an obvious clear sequence with elevation br br A zone of evergreen broadleaf trees maquis occurs between and metres elevation Along with oak Quercus ilex and Greek strawberry tree there occur kermes oak strawberry tree Phillyrea latifolia bay laurel cedar and others Of the deciduous species most common are Fraxinus Ulmus Montpellier maple Judas tree terebinth Cotinus coggygria and others br br The evergreen broadleaf trees zone is gradually replaced by ecosystems of European black pine that forms compact clusters with no intermediate zone of deciduous oaks although trees of these species occur sporadically within clusters of black pine On the northern slopes of Xirolakos valley between and metres elevation there is a high forest of downy oak of about hectares br The black pine dominates on the eastern and northern side of the mountain between and metres In this zone there is also hybrid fir in small groups and scrubs or small clumps particularly in the lower region and in the sites Naoumi west and Stalamatia and Polykastro east where it is mixed with black pine and Bosnian pine In this zone there is also beech While in the neighboring mountains Pierians and Ossa it creates an extended vegetation zone in Olympus it is restricted to small clusters appearing as islets mainly in more humid locations and the best soils A particularly rich variety of trees and shrubs is found in Enipeas gorge One can see there elm cherry plum European yew hazel holly Cornus mas manna ash maple and a considerable variety of herbaceous plants Gorges and ravines are covered by oriental planes willows black alders and riverside greenery br br Typical species of this zone is Bosnian pine This rare kind of pine occurs sporadically higher than metres and gradually replaces the black pine while over metres it creates an almost unmixed forest Over metres the forest becomes sparser reaching to metres thus creating one of the highest forest tree line limit limit of forest growth in the Balkans and Europe Another feature of this zone is that over metres the trees appear in a crawling form The region where Bosnian pine grows is mostly dry and its slopes are rocky There are no springs or water streams The vegetation growing there is adapted to specific local conditions and represented by typical shrubs graminaceous chasmophytes etc while the flora includes many endemic species of the Balkans br br Beyond Bosnian pine s zone follows an extensive zone without trees with alpine meadows consisted by a mosaic of grassland ecosystems depending on the topography the slope and the orientation of the ground In general this alpine flora with more than plant species contains snow accumulation meadows grassy swamps alpine scree and rock crevices On the meadows the rocks and the steep slopes live most of the endemic plants among them some of the most beautiful wildflowers in Greece Half of them are found only in the Balkans and only in Olympus and nowhere else br br The list of local endemic plants at Mount Olympus from the Olympus National Park

systematically studied so far includes considerable variety and is marked by important rare and endangered species Large mammals that lived formerly in the region like roe deer have disappeared In ancient times there were lions Pausanias while at least until the th century there were brown bears Life of St Dionysios the Later br There have been recorded species of mammals including Balkan chamois Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica roe deer Capreolus capreolus wild boar wildcat Felis sylvestris beech marten Martes foina red fox and red squirrel There have also been detected species of birds like sparrowhawk cinereous vulture rock partridge white stork rock dove European robin lanner falcon peregrine falcon tree falcon golden eagle short toed snake eagle booted eagle and hoopoe Many of them particularly the birds of prey are scarce In addition there are the common reptiles of Greek fauna species like snakes turtles lizards etc and some amphibians species in streams and seasonal ponds as well as a great variety of insects particularly butterflies br br Greece s highest mountain dwelling of the Twelve Gods of antiquity has been the first region in the country to be applied specific protective rules by its declaration as a National Park in The aim of this declaration was the preservation in perpetuity of the natural environment of the region i e of wild flora fauna and natural landscape as well as its cultural and other values In addition the declaration has aimed promoting scientific research along with environmental education for the public and tourist development in the region Specific laws prohibit all forms of exploitation on the eastern side of the mountain in an area of about hectares that is the core of the Park A wider region around this core has been designated peripheral zone of the National Park so that its managing and exploitation to be done so as not to adversely affect the core s protection At present the park has been expanded to hectares Administratively it belongs to Pieria s and Larissa s Prefectures and specifically to the municipalities Diou Olympou and Katerinis Pieria and empon and Elassonas Larissa Its lowest elevation is metres and its peak Mytikas at metres In UNESCO proclaimed Olympus Biosphere Reserve European Union has listed Olympus in the Significant for Birdlife Regions of European Union It is also registered in the list of Natura European Network as a special protection area and a site of community interest br In June the Olympus National Park Information Center located at Litochoro opened its gates It informs their visitors about geology archaeological sites mythology monasteries plants animals and other subjects affecting Mount Olympus Hikers will find help from professional rangers a guide
