In Greek mythology the Labyrinth Ancient Greek romanized Lab rinthos was an elaborate confusing structure designed and built by the legendary artificer Daedalus for King Minos of Crete at the Knossos Its function was to hold the Minotaur the monster eventually killed by the hero Theseus Daedalus had so cunningly made the Labyrinth that he could barely escape it after he built it br Although early Cretan coins occasionally exhibit branching multicursal patterns the single path unicursal seven course Classical design without branching or dead ends became associated with the Labyrinth on coins as early as BC and similar non branching patterns became widely used as visual representations of the Labyrinth even though both logic and literary descriptions make it clear that the Minotaur was trapped in a complex branching maze Even as the designs became more elaborate visual depictions of the mythological Labyrinth from the Roman era until the Renaissance are almost invariably unicursal Branching mazes were reintroduced only when hedge mazes became popular during the Renaissance br In English the term labyrinth is generally synonymous with maze As a result of the long history of unicursal representation of the mythological Labyrinth however many contemporary scholars and enthusiasts observe a distinction between the two In this specialized usage maze refers to a complex branching multicursal puzzle with choices of path and direction while a unicursal labyrinth has only a single path to the center A labyrinth in this sense has an unambiguous route to the center and back and presents no navigational challenge br Unicursal labyrinths appeared as designs on pottery or basketry as body art and in etchings on walls of caves or churches The Romans created many primarily decorative unicursal designs on walls and floors in tile or mosaic Many labyrinths set in floors or on the ground are large enough that the path can be walked Unicursal patterns have been used historically both in group ritual and for private meditation and are increasingly found for therapeutic use in hospitals and hospices br br Labyrinth is a word of pre Greek origin whose derivation and meaning are uncertain Maximillian Mayer suggested as early as that labyrinthos might derive from labrys a Lydian word for double bladed axe Arthur Evans who excavated the Minoan palace of Knossos in Crete early in the th century suggested that the ruins there inspired the story of the labyrinth and since the double axe motif appears in the palace ruins he asserted that labyrinth could be understood to mean the house of the double axe The same symbol however was discovered in other palaces in Crete Nilsson observed that in Crete the double axe is not a weapon and always accompanies goddesses or women and not a male god br The association with labrys lost some traction when Linear B was deciphered in the s and an apparent Mycenaean Greek rendering of labyrinth appeared as da pu ri to This may be related to the Minoan word du pu re which appears in Linear A on libation tablets and in connection with Mount Dikte and Mount Ida both of which are associated with caverns Caverns near Gortyna the Cretan capital in the st century AD were called labyrinthos br Pliny s Natural History gives four examples of ancient labyrinths the Cretan labyrinth an Egyptian labyrinth a Lemnian labyrinth and an Italian labyrinth These are all complex underground structures and this appears to have been the standard Classical understanding of the word br Beekes also finds the relation with labrys speculative and suggests instead a relation with Greek narrow street br br When the Bronze Age site at Knossos was excavated by archaeologist Arthur Evans the complexity of the architecture prompted him to suggest that the palace had been the Labyrinth of Daedalus Evans found various bull motifs including an image of a man leaping over the horns of a bull as well as depictions of a labrys carved into the walls On the strength of a passage in the Iliad it has been suggested that the palace was the site of a dancing ground made for Ariadne by the craftsman Daedalus br where young men and women of the age of those sent to Crete as prey for the Minotaur would dance together By extension in popular legend the palace is associated with the myth of the Minotaur br In the s archaeologists explored other potential sites of the labyrinth Oxford University geographer Nicholas Howarth believes that Evans s hypothesis that the palace of Knossos is also the Labyrinth must be treated sceptically Howarth and his team conducted a search of an underground complex known as the Skotino cave but concluded that it was formed naturally Another contender is a series of tunnels at Gortyn accessed by a narrow crack but expanding into interlinking caverns Unlike the Skotino cave these caverns have smooth walls and columns and appear to have been at least partially man made This site corresponds to a labyrinth symbol on a th century map of Crete in a book of maps in the library of Christ Church Oxford A map of the caves themselves was produced by the French in The site was also used by German soldiers to store ammunition during the Second World War Howarth s investigation was shown on a documentary produced for the National Geographic Channel br br In Book II of his Histories Herodotus applies the term labyrinth to a building complex in Egypt near the place called the City of Crocodiles that he considered to surpass the pyramids The structure which may have been a collection of funerary temples such as are commonly found near Egyptian pyramids was destroyed in antiquity and can only be partially reconstructed During the nineteenth century the remains of this ancient Egyptian structure were discovered at Hawara in the Faiyum Oasis by Flinders Petrie at the foot of the pyramid of the twelfth dynasty pharaoh Amenemhat III reigned c BC to c BC br br Pliny the Elder s Natural History lists the legendary Smilis reputed to be a contemporary of Daedalus together with the historical mid sixth century BC architects and sculptors Rhoikos and Theodoros as two of the makers of the Lemnian labyrinth which Andrew Stewart regards as evidently a misunderstanding of the Samian temple s location en limnais in the marsh br br According to Pliny the Tomb of Lars Porsena contained an underground maze Pliny s description of the exposed portion of the tomb is intractable Pliny it seems clear had not observed this structure himself but is quoting the historian and Roman antiquarian Varro br br A design essentially identical to the course classical pattern appeared in Native American culture the Tohono O odham people labyrinth which features I itoi the Man in the Maze The Tonoho O odham pattern has two distinct differences from the classical it is radial in design and the entrance is at the top where traditional labyrinths have the entrance at the bottom see below The earliest appearances cannot be dated securely the oldest is commonly dated to the th century br Unsubstantiated claims have been made for the early appearance of labyrinth figures in India such as a prehistoric petroglyph on a riverbank in Goa purportedly dating to circa BC Other examples have been found among cave art in northern India and on a dolmen shrine in the Nilgiri Mountains but are difficult to date accurately Securely datable examples begin to appear only around BC Early labyrinths in India typically follow the Classical pattern or a local variant of it some have been described as plans of forts or cities br Labyrinths appear in Indian manuscripts and Tantric texts from the th century onward They are often called Chakravyuha in reference to an impregnable battle formation described in the ancient Mahabharata epic Lanka the capital city of mythic R vana is described as a labyrinth in the translation of Al Beruni s India c AD p with a diagram on the following page br By the White Sea notably on the Solovetsky Islands there have been preserved more than stone labyrinths The most remarkable monument is the Stone labyrinths of Bolshoi Zayatsky Island a group of some stone labyrinths on km area of one small island Local archaeologists have speculated that these labyrinths may be years old though most researchers remain dubious br br The course Classical or Cretan pattern known from Cretan coins ca BC appears in several examples from antiquity some perhaps as early as the late Stone Age or early Bronze Age Roman floor mosaics typically unite four copies of the classical labyrinth or a similar pattern interlinked around the center squared off as the medium requires but still recognisable An image of the Minotaur or an allusion to the legend of the Minotaur appears at the center of many of these mosaic labyrinths br br The four axis medieval patterns may have developed from the Roman model but are more varied in how the four quadrants of the design are traced out The Minotaur or other danger is retained in the center of several medieval examples The Chartres pattern named for its appearance in Chartres Cathedral is the most common medieval design it appears in manuscripts as early as the th century br br When the early humanist Benzo d Alessandria visited Verona before he noted the Laberinthum which is now called the Arena perhaps he was seeing the cubiculi beneath the arena s missing floor br The full flowering of the medieval labyrinth came about from the twelfth through fourteenth centuries with the grand pavement labyrinths of the gothic cathedrals notably Chartres Reims and Amiens in northern France The symbolism or purpose behind these is unclear and may have varied from one installation to the next Descriptions survive of French clerics performing a ritual Easter dance along the path on Easter Sunday Some labyrinths may have originated as allusions to the Holy City and some modern writers have theorized that prayers and devotions may have accompanied the perambulation of their intricate paths Although some books in particular guidebooks suggest that the mazes on cathedral floors served as substitutes for pilgrimage paths the earliest attested use of the phrase chemin de Jerusalem path to Jerusalem dates to the late th century when it was used to describe mazes at Reims and Saint Omer The accompanying ritual depicted in Romantic illustrations as involving pilgrims following the maze on their knees while praying may have been practiced at Chartres during the th century The cathedral labyrinths are thought to be the inspiration for the many turf mazes in the UK such as survive at Wing Hilton Alkborough and Saffron Walden br Over the same general period some or more non ecclesiastical labyrinths were constructed in Scandinavia These labyrinths generally in coastal areas are marked out with stones most often in the simple or course classical forms They often have names which translate as Troy Town They are thought to have been constructed by fishing communities trapping malevolent trolls or winds in the labyrinth s coils might ensure a safe fishing expedition There are also stone labyrinths on the Isles of Scilly although none is known to date from before the nineteenth century br There are examples of labyrinths in many disparate cultures The symbol has appeared in various forms and media petroglyphs classic form medieval form pavement turf and basketry at some time throughout most parts of the world from Native North and South America to Australia Java India and Nepal br br Starting in the late th century there has been a resurgence of interest in labyrinths and a revival in labyrinth building of both unicursal and multicursal patterns Approximately labyrinths have been registered with the Worldwide Labyrinth Locator these are located around the world in private properties libraries schools gardens and recreational areas as well as famous temples and cathedrals br The labyrinth is also treated in contemporary fine arts Examples include Piet Mondrian s Pier and Ocean Joan Mir s Labyrinth Pablo Picasso s Minotauromachy M C Escher s Relativity Friedensreich Hundertwasser s Labyrinth Jean Dubuffet s Logological Cabinet Richard Long s Connemara sculpture Joe Tilson s Earth Maze Richard Fleischner s Chain Link Maze Istv n Orosz s Atlantis Anamorphosis Dmitry Rakov s Labyrinth and drawings by contemporary American artist Mo Morales employing what the artist calls Labyrinthine projection The Italian painter Davide Tonato has dedicated many of his artistic works to the labyrinth theme In modern imagery the labyrinth of Daedalus is often represented by a multicursal maze in which one may become lost br Mark Wallinger has created a set of enamel plaques of unicursal labyrinth designs one for every tube station in the London Underground to mark the th anniversary of the Underground The plaques were installed over a month period in and and each is numbered according to its position in the route taken by the contestants in the Guinness World Record Tube Challenge br br Prehistoric labyrinths may have served as traps for malevolent spirits or as paths for ritual dances Many Roman and Christian labyrinths appear at the entrances of buildings suggesting that they may have served a similar apotropaic purpose In their cross cultural study of signs and symbols Patterns that Connect Carl Schuster and Edmund Carpenter present various forms of the labyrinth and suggest various possible meanings including not only a sacred path to the home of a sacred ancestor but also perhaps a representation of the ancestor him herself many New World Indians who make the labyrinth regard it as a sacred symbol a beneficial ancestor a deity In this they may be preserving its original meaning the ultimate ancestor here evoked by two continuous lines joining its twelve primary joints Schuster also observes the common theme of the labyrinth being a refuge for a trickster in India the demon Ravana has dominion over labyrinths the trickster Djonaha lives in a labyrinth according to Sumatran Bataks and Europeans say it is the home of a rogue br One can think of labyrinths as symbolic of pilgrimage people walking the path ascend toward salvation or enlightenment Mystical teachings in traditions across centuries suggest that they can also be understood as coded maps of the spiritual path br Many labyrinths have been constructed recently in churches hospitals and parks These are often used for contemplation walking among the turnings one loses track of direction and of the outside world and thus quiets the mind br br Labyrinths have on various occasions been used in Christian tradition as a part of worship The earliest known example is from a fourth century pavement at the Basilica of St Reparatus at Orleansville Algeria with the words Sancta Eclesia sic at the center though it is unclear how it might have been used in worship br In medieval times labyrinths began to appear on church walls and floors around AD The most famous medieval labyrinth with great influence on later practice was created in Chartres Cathedral br The use of labyrinths has recently been revived in some contexts of Christian worship Many churches in Europe and North America have constructed permanent typically unicursal labyrinths or employ temporary ones e g painted on canvas or outlined with candles For example a labyrinth was set up on the floor of St Paul s Cathedral for a week in March Some conservative Christians disapprove of labyrinths considering them pagan practices or New Age fads br br Labyrinths and mazes have been embraced by the video game industry and countless video games include such a feature For example the video game Marathon features many maze like passages the player must navigate br A number of film game and music creations feature labyrinths For instance the avant garde multi screen film In the Labyrinth presents a search for meaning in a symbolic modern labyrinth The well received film Pan s Labyrinth draws heavily upon labyrinth legend for symbolism A magical labyrinth appears in the third episode And The Horns of a Dilemma of The Librarians See Labyrinth disambiguation for a further list of titles br The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was entranced with the idea of the labyrinth and used it extensively in his short stories such as The House of Asterion in The Aleph His use of it has inspired other authors e g Umberto Eco s The Name of the Rose Mark Z Danielewski s House of Leaves Additionally Roger Zelazny s fantasy series The Chronicles of Amber features a labyrinth called the Pattern which grants those who walk it the power to move between parallel worlds In Rick Riordan s series Percy Jackson the Olympians the events of the fourth novel The Battle of the Labyrinth predominantly take place within the labyrinth of Daedalus which has followed the heart of the West to settle beneath the United States Ursula K Le Guin used an underground labyrinth in the second book of her Earthsea series The Tombs of Atuan in which the series hero Ged is captured by the book s protagonist Tenar on his trip to the Kargish Empire the spiritual power of the Nameless Ones is vested at least in part in the labyrinth Australian author Sara Douglass incorporated some labyrinthine ideas in her series The Troy Game in which the Labyrinth on Crete is one of several in the ancient world created with the cities as a source of magical power Lawrence Durrell s The Dark Labyrinth depicts travelers trapped underground in Crete Because a labyrinth can serve as a metaphor for situations that are difficult to be extricated from Octavio Paz titled his
