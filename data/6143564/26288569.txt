Thor Odinson is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics Created by artist Jack Kirby writer Stan Lee and scripter Larry Lieber the character first appeared in Journey into Mystery and first received his own title with Thor Thor is an adaptation of the deity of the same name from Norse mythology and many aspects of Thor s character are based on his mythological counterpart Comic books featuring Thor have been published across several volumes since the character s introduction br Thor is one of the gods of Asgard and the son of the Asgardian king Odin In addition to his Asgardian strength and extended lifespan Thor wields control over the weather including rain and lightning He also carries the enchanted hammer Mjolnir that enhances his abilities and grants him the ability to fly Thor was first introduced as the alter ego of surgeon Donald Blake who acquired Thor s power later revealed to be a fabrication by Thor s father Thor has since assumed other human identities and sometimes ruled as king of Asgard br Thor s cast of supporting characters includes his fellow Asgardians Odin Sif The Warriors Three and Balder the Brave as well as other allies such as Jane Foster Beta Ray Bill and Hercules Thor s arch nemesis is the Asgardian Loki Thor is a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers and has played a significant role in Marvel crossover events including Avengers Disassembled Siege and The War of the Realms Chris Hemsworth portrays the cinematic adaptation of Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe first appearing in Thor br br Thor was created by Stan Lee Jack Kirby and Larry Lieber After initially drafting the character Lee gave the project to his brother Lieber to write the stories Kirby developed Thor s visual design and he had an interest in ancient mythology that lent itself to the character s creation and design Bulfinch s Mythology was used as a reference during Thor s creation As superhero comics became more popular Marvel began replacing its previous comic book lines with superheroes Thor first appeared in Journey into Mystery Like other superheroes created at the time Thor usurped a comic book anthology that had previously been dedicated to monster fiction Thor arose from Lee s desire to create a superhero who was more powerful than Hulk or the Fantastic Four Lee in described Thor s genesis early in the Marvel pantheon following the creation of the Hulk br br H ow do you make someone stronger than the strongest person It finally came to me Don t make him human make him a god I decided readers were already pretty familiar with the Greek and Roman gods It might be fun to delve into the old Norse legends Besides I pictured Norse gods looking like Vikings of old with the flowing beards horned helmets and battle clubs Journey into Mystery needed a shot in the arm so I picked Thor to headline the book After writing an outline depicting the story and the characters I had in mind I asked my brother Larry to write the script because I didn t have time and it was only natural for me to assign the penciling to Jack Kirby br The idea for adapting Thor as a superhero was first developed when Lee and Kirby heard of Marvel being discussed as twentieth century mythology Thor was well suited to be recreated as a superhero as the mythological character already had an established supporting cast superpowers and sense of justice At the time Thor was created there were approximately million Scandinavian Americans and the United States had a general cultural awareness of historical Scandinavian culture through ideas of Vikings and Leif Erikson A previous adaptation of Thor had appeared in Venus published by what is now Marvel Comics Kirby had previously adapted Thor for DC Comics in Adventure Comics Boy Commandos Tales of the Unexpected br br Shortly after Thor premiered Lieber moved on to other projects and Thor was given to other writers Various artists worked on Thor in his first issues including Don Heck and Joe Sinnott Lee soon took over writing duties for several Marvel superhero titles as the writers did not meet his expectations and he became the writer for Thor beginning in Journey into Mystery Kirby became the artist shortly afterward beginning in Journey into Mystery br When Marvel s distributor allowed them more monthly releases The Avengers was developed as a new comic book series Thor was included as an inaugural member of the titular superhero team By the difficulty of maintaining continuity between The Avengers and the titles of the individual characters prompted Lee to write the original cast out of The Avengers including Thor br Lee created a second series that centered on Norse mythology Tales of Asgard First appearing in Journey into Mystery this series focused on Thor s mythological adventures and greatly expanded his roster of supporting characters including Sif Balder the Brave and the Warriors Three Journey into Mystery was eventually renamed to Thor beginning with Thor This marked a significant shift in Thor s characterization the primary setting was moved from Earth to Asgard Thor s love interest Jane Foster was written out of the story in favor of Sif and Hercules became a major character Tales of Asgard continued until Thor The character s backstory was changed in Thor when it was revealed that Thor was the actual mythological Thor rather than a mortal who obtained Thor s power and that his secret identity of Donald Blake was a fabrication created by Odin to teach him humility As Kirby s work on Thor came to an end the setting shifted back to Earth and Jane Foster was reintroduced br br Kirby stayed on as Thor s artist until Thor Lee eventually ceded control of the titles he worked on to other writers and Thor was given to Gerry Conway who at the time was a teenager John and Sal Buscema were the artists for this run After Conway gave up the series editor Len Wein took over as its writer After returning to the Avengers Thor was again removed in Avengers because writer Steve Englehart believed that Thor was too powerful for the group Fan backlash ensued and the subsequent writer Jim Shooter returned him to the team in Avengers br In the mid s Marvel considered giving the character a second series as part of parent company Magazine Management s line of black and white comics magazines A story written by Steve Englehart for the aborted project appeared in Thor Annual br Doug Moench wrote for Thor from to This run was poorly received which Moench argued was due to the limitations imposed by editor Mark Gruenwald Walter Simonson subsequently took over the series revitalizing it and increasing sales Simonson s run was highly regarded by critics and it included several major milestones in Thor s history including The Surtur Saga Skurge s Last Stand Mjolnir s Song and The Ballad of Beta Ray Bill His introduction of Beta Ray Bill shifted the dynamic of Thor introducing a second character who Odin recognized as worthy of Thor s power In the s Marvel briefly supplemented its main superheroes with more violent anti hero versions During this time Thor was replaced with Eric Masterson br During the Heroes Reborn event many of Marvel s superheroes were given new volumes restarted at issue but Thor s series was not renewed A new volume of Thor instead launched during the subsequent Heroes Return event This volume was written by Dan Jurgens and drawn by John Romita Jr To humanize Thor he was again bound to a mortal to humanize him this time giving him the alter ego of paramedic Jake Olson br br The subsequent period of Marvel s history reflected the political turmoil that followed the September attacks and the War on Terror For Thor this involved becoming the king of Asgard giving him political power that he abused An alternate version of the Avengers the Ultimates debuted in as part of the Ultimate Marvel branding that re imagined Marvel characters in an alternative universe This universe s version of Thor has the same powers but he is a pacifist and it is left unclear whether he is truly a god or mentally unstable br Thor volume two ended with a tie in to the Avengers Disassembled storyline that saw major changes to Marvel s main characters Issues follow the events of Ragnar k as the story s primary setting Asgard is destroyed This story arc was written by Michael Avon Oeming and drawn by Andrea Di Vito A third volume of Thor began publication in written by J Michael Straczynski and drawn by Olivier Coipel This volume began by addressing the ramifications of Avengers Disassembled and slowly reintroducing Thor s supporting characters Thor was then a central character in the Siege event in which featured Marvel s cast of superheroes defending Asgard from Norman Osborn br To coincide with the Thor film Marvel launched a number of new series starring the character in mid These included Thor The Mighty Avenger by Roger Langridge and Chris Samnee Thor First Thunder by Bryan J L Glass and Tan Eng Huat Thor For Asgard by Robert Rodi and Simone Bianchi and Iron Man Thor by the writing duo of Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning The limited series Thor The Mighty Avenger was published across eight issues from to following Thor in his earlier years as a less serious family friendly interpretation of the character This series was written by Roger Langridge and drawn by Chris Samnee and was met with critical praise br br The next Thor series Thor God of Thunder began publication in during the Marvel Now relaunch This run was written by Jason Aaron and drawn by Esad Ribic The first eleven issues followed Thor accompanied by an elderly Thor from the future and a young Thor from the past battling Gorr the God Butcher In the s Marvel began substituting its main characters with a new diverse cast of characters Thor was replaced by Jane Foster as part of this trend during the Original Sin story arc and she became the main character in the Thor franchise The original Thor was called The Odinson during this period and he starred in a separate series The Unworthy Thor written by Aaron and drawn by Olivier Coipel Thor was relaunched with Marvel s Fresh Start branding still written by Aaron restoring The Odinson as Thor and leading up to The War of the Realms br A new volume of Thor began publication in written by Donny Cates and drawn by Nic Klein which follows Thor as the ruler of Asgard The next series The Immortal Thor premiered in br br Thor was born to Odin the king of Asgard and Gaea the Earth goddess He was then raised by Odin s wife Frigga believing her to be his mother As Thor comes of age Odin gifts him a magic hammer Mjolnir which is enchanted so that only the worthy may lift it Thor had existed in a past form more reminiscent of the mythological Thor but he was eventually reincarnated as a new version In the past Thor fought alongside the Vikings but he condemned them after an attack on a Christian monastery br Deeming him too arrogant Odin banishes Thor to modern day Earth with no memory of his Asgardian origins giving him the identity of Donald Blake As Blake Thor visits Scandinavia where he stumbles upon a walking stick which he discovers can turn into Mjolnir and give him the powers of Thor In a plot to defeat Thor Loki provokes the Hulk into attacking a train While Loki is successful in luring Thor out he is accompanied by Iron Man Ant Man and Wasp After defeating Loki the heroes come together as a superhero team forming the Avengers Odin eventually restores Thor as an Asgardian revealing that Blake was a persona that he had invented for Thor When Thor is defeated by Beta Ray Bill Odin transfers the ability to transform into Blake from Thor to Beta Ray Bill To continue living among mortals Thor takes the name Sigurd Jarlson and becomes a construction worker Odin later binds Thor to the mortal Eric Masterson to save Masteron s life Thor is exiled for seemingly killing Loki but Masterson retains the powers of Thor and becomes the superhero Thunderstrike br During the Onslaught attack Thor is one of the heroes who is transported to an alternate dimension by Franklin Richards but they are soon returned Thor is again bound to a mortal this time to Jake Olson but this connection too is severed When Odin seemingly dies Thor becomes the king of Asgard To cure humanity s ills he relocates Asgard above Earth and takes control of human affairs to give them clean energy healthcare and economic prosperity The extent of the entanglement and the resulting loss of liberties cause strife within Asgard and resentment from humanity This leads to military conflict that destroys Asgard and New York City Such is Thor s hubris that he finds himself unable to lift Mjolnir He remains steadfast consolidating his power over Earth for many years before he remorsefully goes back in time to prevent himself from seizing power over Earth br br As Ragnar k begins Thor learns that the Asgardians undergo an endless cycle of death and rebirth through Ragnar k enforced by higher beings To break the cycle Thor destroys the tapestry of the Three Fates reincarnating the Asgardians as mortals In the meantime a clone of Thor is created by the pro registration faction during the civil war between superheroes While in the afterlife Thor once again binds himself to Blake to resurrect himself and creates a new Asgard floating over Oklahoma gathering the Asgardians who had been reincarnated as mortals When Loki resurrects Thor s grandfather Bor Bor goes into a berserker state and Thor is forced to kill him As Bor was the rightful king of Asgard upon his resurrection Thor is banished for regicide While banished Thor seeks out Sif who was still lost from the destruction of the Asgardians After Norman Osborn seizes power in the United States he orders an attack on the new Asgard and Thor returns to his home Though Asgard is destroyed and Loki is killed after coming to Thor s aid Thor ends the attack and his banishment is commuted After Thor discovers that Loki has been reborn as a child with no memories they reunite as brothers br Odin s brother Serpent returns and wages war on Earth Thor fights and defeats Serpent sacrificing his own life Kid Loki seeks out Blake to resurrect Thor Thor then faces Gorr the God Butcher and teams with a younger and an older version of himself to defeat Gorr Gorr s condemnation of the gods shakes Thor s confidence and he finds himself unable to lift Mjolnir The hammer is taken by Thor s ally Jane Foster who temporarily becomes the new Thor before inspiring his confidence and returning the role to him When Malekith the Accursed wages the War of the Realms Thor sacrifices his eye in exchange for the wisdom to defeat him and Thor then reunites with his past and future selves as well as Foster s Thor to win the battle When Galactus arrives to warn of the Black Winter he imbues Thor with the Power Cosmic and enlists him as a herald only for Thor to use the power to kill him br br Thor is one of the gods of Asgard granting him exceptional strength durability and endurance Though not fully immortal Asgardians have immense lifespans and are immune to disease Until Thor ended the Ragnarok cycle the Asgardians went through an endless series of deaths and reincarnations Among the Asgardians Thor is one of the most powerful He possesses superhuman strength and centuries of combat have trained him as a proficient warrior Thor is also educated in human medicine from his experience as Blake who was a surgeon br Thor wields an enchanted hammer Mjolnir which is crafted from the fictional metal uru making it nearly indestructible Wielding it grants him control over wind rain thunder and lightning amplifying his natural control over the weather He can use the hammer to fly by throwing it into the air and grabbing the leather strap to pull himself off the ground The hammer also allows Thor to travel between dimensions moving him between Earth and Asgard Mjolnir is enchanted so that it may only be lifted by those who are worthy Another enchantment causes it to always return to its wielder when thrown It previously gave Thor the ability to travel through time but it has since lost this power When Thor transforms into a human Mjolnir takes the guise of a walking stick that he can use to transform back into Thor During these times being separated from the hammer for sixty seconds reverts him back to his human form br Besides his hammer Thor possesses a magic belt that doubles his strength but it drains him of energy and he uses it only sparingly He also owns a set of uru armor and a pair of iron gauntlets When traveling with passengers or cargo as a consideration Thor uses a chariot pulled by his two magic goats Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder br br As with many Marvel superheroes Thor was created as a flawed character He is conflicted between his sense of moral purity and his pride and his father Odin seeks to teach him humility For his arrogance he was forced by Odin to live as a mortal and Thor s experience with humanity provides his character growth br When Thor was first created he was an exception to Marvel s real world approach to storytelling emphasizing the fantastical over current events and modern social issues As he became more connected to the Marvel Universe social commentary became more common Thor was also one of several Marvel characters who underwent physical transformation to explore different aspects of his character transforming between the mortal Donald Blake and the immortal Thor br Thor finds himself split between Asgard and Earth having an established life and loyalty to both Though he is an Asgardian he was born to Gaea the Earth goddess and he is imbued with an intrinsic connection to Earth While he is bound to Dr Blake Thor holds significant responsibilities in both realms and he is often forced to choose between his role as a prince and as a surgeon Writers have intentionally sought to balance Earth centric and Asgard centric stories to keep the character interesting br Thor has a distinct manner of speech inspired by the King James Version of the Bible and by the work of William Shakespeare The extent of this style and how it is implemented has changed between writers Thor s origin as a Norse god has allowed for religious themes to be invoked with the character He is also reminiscent of the Vikings and invokes positive aspects of their image but he has rejected the brutality associated with Viking raids br br Thor s supporting cast includes the gods of Asgard his father is the Asgardian king Odin he was friends with Balder the Brave since childhood and the Warriors Three sometimes accompany him Thor is romantically involved with Sif a fellow Asgardian When Thor was banished to Earth as Dr Blake he met the nurse Jane Foster Both Thor and his alter ego Blake developed an attraction to Foster creating a love triangle When Thor returned to Asgard he reunited with Sif Thor s relationship with Foster has been the subject of disagreement between Thor and his father Hercules of the Greek pantheon was initially introduced as a rival to Thor but the two eventually became allies Beta Ray Bill became an ally of Thor after proving his worthiness and receiving a hammer of his own from Odin Stormbreaker On Earth Thor is allied with the Avengers of which he is a founding member br Thor s nemesis is his half brother Loki As Thor is the heir to Asgard s throne Loki envies Thor and engages in plots to seize power over Asgard for himself Thor regularly fights mythological creatures such as trolls and giants Besides his supernatural opponents Thor also fights human groups such as agents of the Soviet Union Other major villains include Surtur Enchantress Executioner Hela Malekith the Accursed Ulik Mangog the Destroyer Serpent Ymir Laufey Fafnir Perrikus Gorr the God Butcher the Midgard Serpent Kurse the Wrecking Crew Ragnarok and Galactus br Other characters have taken the title of Thor including Jane Foster Beta Ray Bill Eric Masterson Volstagg and Storm The Marvel Multiverse features many variants of Thor including Ultimate Thor in the Ultimate Universe Thor in Marvel Throg the Frog of Thunder and King Thor from the future Wonder Woman of DC Comics wielded Thor s power after lifting Mjolnir in the miniseries DC vs Marvel br br According to Martin Arnold Thor s existence as a comic book superhero has moved the ideas of Norse mythology from high culture to low culture shifting it away from both its reputation as an academic topic and its association with Nazi iconography Although the direct applicability of Marvel s Thor to the mythological Thor is limited Marvel s Thor is a prominent representation of Norse mythology in popular culture and represents an entry point for the understanding of Norse folklore in modern times The character created a th century American audience for Norse myth that expanded significantly when Marvel s Thor was adapted to film br Thor has appeared among the top five in several ranked lists of greatest Avengers characters Kirby had intended to replace Thor and his cast of characters with a new pantheon of deities this idea was nixed by Lee but it eventually became the New Gods and Fourth World stories that Kirby created for DC Comics Thor influenced the comic book Black Hammer which features various homages to the character br br Thor was first adapted in The Marvel Super Heroes an animated television serial in Thor has since appeared in various animated television programs featuring Marvel characters as a main character in ensemble casts and through guest appearances in other Marvel properties The character also stars in the animated direct to video film Thor Tales of Asgard br A live action adaptation of Thor appears in The Incredible Hulk Returns portrayed by Eric Allan Kramer This version of Thor was considered for its own spin off but this was not seen through due to the ongoing writers strike and concerns about the character s design A Thor movie was set for production with Universal Pictures in but it was one of several planned Marvel projects that were not produced Lee also pitched a Thor film to Fox Studios but it was not accepted br Chris Hemsworth portrays an adaptation of Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe appearing in Thor The Avengers Thor The Dark World Avengers Age of Ultron Doctor Strange Thor Ragnarok Avengers Infinity War Avengers Endgame and Thor Love and Thunder This version of Thor was introduced as a member of a technologically advanced alien race placing less emphasis on the
