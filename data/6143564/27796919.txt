success of the original series Riordan began writing a second series using inspiration for his storyline from experiences that he and his children had while playing video and role playing games such as World of Warcraft and Scion After creating the storyline Riordan created three new main characters Jason Piper and Leo but continued to use the previous main characters such as Annabeth and Grover as secondary characters Unlike the Percy Jackson the Olympians series which uses first person narration solely from Percy s point of view the second series is told in third person with the point of view alternating between various main characters In The Lost Hero those characters are Jason Piper and Leo Although initially uncertain how fans would react Riordan later found that they enjoyed the new format as it allowed them to learn more about each character br The novel begins six months after the events of The Last Olympian which allowed continuity with the first series so previous characters could be included and readers would not be confused Riordan says that it was my way of letting them revisit that world in a fresh twist but also to catch up with Percy and Annabeth and the rest of the gang from the first series He also decided to include the Roman gods after many readers requested that Riordan write a new series on Roman gods who are the Roman equivalent of the Greek gods with some minor changes in personality He pondered on how the Roman aspect of the gods would be after moving from Greece to Rome to America After a while playing with that idea gave me the idea for the new series br Before The Lost Hero was released Disney Hyperion released several sneak peeks in an effort to build up publicity for the books release This included releasing a preview of the

Greek and Roman mix fascinating and also said that the characters are interesting and well developed and the richly complex story has Riordan s trademark wry humor and nearly nonstop action br Few reviewers criticized certain aspects of the novel Vicky Smith of Kirkus Reviews for example wrote that there are far too many pages of stretched out action telling not showing and awkward dialogue while believing that the novel would be enjoyed by d ie hard fans She positively noted that the Greek vs Roman tension tantalizes and that incidental details that bring the gods into the story often shine Lauren Berkes of The National Post appreciated the novel writing Along the way the novel has a lot of action a bit of magic a freaky security system and a metal dragon but recommended that readers read the predecessor series first as it will help you to understand a lot of the concepts in The Lost Hero br Others were appreciative of the book as an excellent sequel to Percy Jackson and the Olympians Anita Burkam of The Horn Book Magazine wrote in her review Riordan extends the franchise in a logical direction while maximizing the elements that made the first series so popular irreverent heroes plenty of tension filled moments fighting monsters and authentic classical mythology mixed in with modern life Carrie R Wheadon of Common Sense Media rated it and opined Percy Jackson series spin off is almost as delightful and observes The story set up isn t terribly smooth and this is a denser read than the first few Percy Jackson books but once the action heats up that s easily forgotten Voice of Youth Advocates comments The tale is longer than the Percy Jackson originals and can drag a bit at times but fans hungry for further adventures in Riordan s modernized mythological realm will be well satisfied br Other elements of the novel were also well received Booklist wrote that the backstory of a master plan to unseat the gods is complex but is doled out in manageable bits with a general air of foreboding while also appreciating f lashes of humor that lighten the mood at times They conclude w ith appealing new characters within a familiar framework this spin off will satisfy the demand for more KidsReads appreciated the book for its knowledge writing I always learn something new whenever I read these books and it certainly helps that I laugh along the way and also notes this time they cross over to Roman mythology and the sometimes blurred lines between the two cultures are examined in closer detail School Library Journal wrote that Riordan excels at clever plot devices and at creating an urgent sense of cliff hanging danger and observed t he young heroes deal with issues familiar to teens today The Lost Hero won the Junior Young Reader
