An ebook short for electronic book also spelled as e book or eBook is a book publication made available in electronic form consisting of text images or both readable on the flat panel display of computers or other electronic devices Although sometimes defined as an electronic version of a printed book some e books exist without a printed equivalent E books can be read on dedicated e reader devices also on any computer device that features a controllable viewing screen including desktop computers laptops tablets and smartphones br In the s there was a trend of print and e book sales moving to the Internet where readers buy traditional paper books and e books on websites using e commerce systems With print books readers are increasingly browsing through images of the covers of books on publisher or bookstore websites and selecting and ordering titles online The paper books are then delivered to the reader by mail or any other delivery service With e books users can browse through titles online select and order titles then the e book can be sent to them online or the user can download the e book By the early s e books had begun to overtake hardcover by overall publication figures in the U S br The main reasons people buy e books are possibly because of lower prices increased comfort as they can buy from home or on the go with mobile devices and a larger selection of titles With e books electronic bookmarks make referencing easier and e book readers may allow the user to annotate pages Although fiction and non fiction books come in e book formats technical material is especially suited for e book delivery because it can be digitally searched for keywords In addition for programming books code examples can be copied In the U S the amount of e book reading is increasing By of adults had read an e book compared to in By of American adults had an e reader or a tablet compared to owning such devices in br Besides published books and magazines that have a digital equivalent there are also digital textbooks that are intended to serve as the text for a class and help in technology based education br br E books are also referred to as ebooks eBooks Ebooks e Books e journals e editions or digital books A device that is designed specifically for reading e books is called an e reader ebook device or eReader br br Some trace the concept of an e reader a device that would enable the user to view books on a screen to a manifesto by Bob Brown written after watching his first talkie movie with sound He titled it The Readies playing off the idea of the talkie In his book Brown says movies have outmaneuvered the book by creating the talkies and as a result reading should find a new medium br br A simple reading machine which I can carry or move around attach to any old electric light plug and read hundred thousand word novels in minutes if I want to and I want to br Brown s notion however was much more focused on reforming orthography and vocabulary than on medium He says It is time to pull out the stopper and begin a bloody revolution of the word introducing huge numbers of portmanteau symbols to replace normal words and punctuation to simulate action or movement so it is not clear whether this fits into the history of e books or not Later e readers never followed a model at all like Brown s However he correctly predicted the miniaturization and portability of e readers In an article Jennifer Schuessler writes The machine Brown argued would allow readers to adjust the type size avoid paper cuts and save trees all while hastening the day when words could be recorded directly on the palpitating ether Brown believed that the e reader and his notions for changing the text itself would bring a completely new life to reading Schuessler correlates it with a DJ spinning bits of old songs to create a beat or an entirely new song as opposed to just a remix of a familiar song br br The inventor of the first e book is not widely agreed upon Some notable candidates include the following br br The first e book may be the Index Thomisticus a heavily annotated electronic index to the works of Thomas Aquinas prepared by Roberto Busa S J beginning in and completed in the s Although originally stored on a single computer a distributable CD ROM version appeared in However this work is sometimes omitted Maybe this is because the digitized text was a means for studying written texts and developing linguistic concordances rather than as a published edition in its own right In the Index was published online br br In ngela Ruiz Robles a teacher from Ferrol Spain patented the Enciclopedia Mec nica or the Mechanical Encyclopedia a mechanical device which operated on compressed air where text and graphics were contained on spools that users would load onto rotating spindles Her idea was to create a device which would decrease the number of books that her pupils carried to school The final device was planned to include audio recordings a magnifying glass a calculator and an electric light for night reading Her device was never put into production but a prototype is on display at the National Museum of Science and Technology in A Coru a br br Alternatively some historians consider electronic books to have started in the early s with the NLS project headed by Douglas Engelbart at Stanford Research Institute SRI and the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS projects headed by Andries van Dam at Brown University FRESS documents ran on IBM main frames and were structure oriented rather than line oriented They were formatted dynamically for different users display hardware window sizes and so on as well as having automated tables of contents indexes and so on All these systems also provided extensive hyperlinking graphics and other capabilities Van Dam is generally thought to have coined the term electronic book and it was established enough to use in an article title by br FRESS was used for reading extensive primary texts online as well as for annotation and online discussions in several courses including English Poetry and Biochemistry Brown s faculty made extensive use of FRESS For example the philosopher Roderick Chisholm used it to produce several of his books Thus in the Preface to Person and Object he writes The book would not have been completed without the epoch making File Retrieval and Editing System Brown University s work in electronic book systems continued for many years including US Navy funded projects for electronic repair manuals a large scale distributed hypermedia system known as InterMedia a spinoff company Electronic Book Technologies that built DynaText the first SGML based e reader system and the Scholarly Technology Group s extensive work on the Open eBook standard br br Despite the extensive earlier history several publications report Michael S Hart as the inventor of the e book In the operators of the Xerox Sigma V main frame at the University of Illinois gave Hart extensive computer time Seeking a worthy use of this resource he created his first electronic document by typing the United States Declaration of Independence into a computer in plain text Hart planned to create documents using plain text to make them as easy as possible to download and view on devices After Hart first adapted the U S Declaration of Independence into an electronic document in Project Gutenberg was launched to create electronic copies of more texts especially books br br Dedicated hardware devices for ebook reading began to appear in the s and s in addition to the main frame and laptop solutions and collections of data per se One early e book implementation was the desktop prototype for a proposed notebook computer the Dynabook in the s at PARC a general purpose portable personal computer capable of displaying books for reading In the U S Department of Defense began a concept development for a portable electronic delivery device for technical maintenance information called project PEAM the Portable Electronic Aid for Maintenance Detailed specifications were completed in FY and prototype development began with Texas Instruments that same year Four prototypes were produced and delivered for testing in and tests were completed in The final summary report was produced in by the U S Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences authored by Robert Wisher and J Peter Kincaid A patent application for the PEAM device titled Apparatus for delivering procedural type instructions was submitted by Texas Instruments on December listing John K Harkins and Stephen H Morriss as inventors br br In Sony launched the Data Discman an electronic book reader that could read e books that were stored on CDs One of the electronic publications that could be played on the Data Discman was called The Library of the Future Early e books were generally written for specialty areas and a limited audience meant to be read only by small and devoted interest groups The scope of the subject matter of these e books included technical manuals for hardware manufacturing techniques and other subjects In the s the general availability of the Internet made transferring electronic files much easier including e books br In Paul Baim released a freeware HyperCard stack called EBook that allowed easy import of any text file to create a pageable version similar to an electronic paperback book A notable feature was automatic tracking of the last page read so that on returning to the book you were taken back to where you had previously left off reading The title of this stack may have helped popularize the term ebook br br As e book formats emerged and proliferated some garnered support from major software companies such as Adobe with its PDF format that was introduced in Unlike most other formats PDF documents are generally tied to a particular dimension and layout rather than adjusting dynamically to the current page window or another size Different e reader devices followed different formats most of them accepting books in only one or a few formats thereby fragmenting the e book market even more Due to the exclusiveness and limited readerships of e books the fractured market of independent publishers and specialty authors lacked consensus regarding a standard for packaging and selling e books br Meanwhile scholars formed the Text Encoding Initiative which developed consensus guidelines for encoding books and other materials of scholarly interest for a variety of analytic uses as well as reading Countless literary and other works have been developed using the TEI approach In the late s a consortium formed to develop the Open eBook format as a way for authors and publishers to provide a single source document which many book reading software and hardware platforms could handle Several scholars from the TEI were closely involved in the early development of Open eBook including Allen Renear Elli Mylonas and Steven DeRose all from Brown Focused on portability Open eBook as defined required subsets of XHTML and CSS a set of multimedia formats others could be used but there must also be a fallback in one of the required formats and an XML schema for a manifest to list the components of a given e book identify a table of contents cover art and so on This format led to the open format EPUB Google Books has converted many public domain works to this open format br In e books continued to gain in their own specialist and underground markets Many e book publishers began distributing books that were in the public domain At the same time authors with books that were not accepted by publishers offered their works online so they could be seen by others Unofficial and occasionally unauthorized catalogs of books became available on the web and sites devoted to e books began disseminating information about e books to the public Nearly two thirds of the U S Consumer e book publishing market are controlled by the Big Five The Big Five publishers are Hachette HarperCollins Macmillan Penguin Random House and Simon Schuster br br U S libraries began to offer free e books to the public in through their websites and associated services although the e books were primarily scholarly technical or professional in nature and could not be downloaded In libraries began offering free downloadable popular fiction and non fiction e books to the public launching an e book lending model that worked much more successfully for public libraries The number of library e book distributors and lending models continued to increase over the next few years From to libraries experienced a growth in e book collections In a Public Library Funding and Technology Access Study by the American Library Association found that of public libraries in the U S were offering e books and a large movement in the library industry began to seriously examine the issues relating to e book lending acknowledging a tipping point when e book technology would become widely established Content from public libraries can be downloaded to e readers using application software like Overdrive and Hoopla br The U S National Library of Medicine has for many years provided PubMed a comprehensive bibliography of medical literature In early NLM set up the PubMed Central repository which stores full text e book versions of many medical journal articles and books through co operation with scholars and publishers in the field Pubmed Central also now provides archiving and access to over million articles maintained in a standard XML format known as the Journal Article Tag Suite JATS br Despite the widespread adoption of e books some publishers and authors have not endorsed the concept of electronic publishing citing issues with user demand copyright infringement and challenges with proprietary devices and systems In a survey of interlibrary loan ILL librarians it was found that of libraries held e books in their collections and that of those libraries had negotiated ILL rights for some of their e books This survey found significant barriers to conducting interlibrary loan for e books Patron driven acquisition PDA has been available for several years in public libraries allowing vendors to streamline the acquisition process by offering to match a library s selection profile to the vendor s e book titles The library s catalog is then populated with records for all of the e books that match the profile The decision to purchase the title is left to the patrons although the library can set purchasing conditions such as a maximum price and purchasing caps so that the dedicated funds are spent according to the library s budget The meeting of the Association of American University Presses included a panel on the PDA of books produced by university presses based on a preliminary report by Joseph Esposito a digital publishing consultant who has studied the implications of PDA with a grant from the Andrew W Mellon Foundation br br Although the demand for e book services in libraries has grown in the first two decades of the st century difficulties keep libraries from providing some e books to clients Publishers will sell e books to libraries but in most cases they will only give libraries a limited license to the title meaning that the library does not own the electronic text but is allowed to circulate it for either a certain period of time or a certain number of check outs or both When a library purchases an e book license the cost is at least three times what it would be for a personal consumer E book licenses are more expensive than paper format editions because publishers are concerned that an e book that is sold could theoretically be read and or checked out by a huge number of users potentially damaging sales However some studies have found the opposite effect to be true for example Hilton and Wikey br br The Internet Archive and Open Library offer more than six million fully accessible public domain e books Project Gutenberg has over freely available public domain e books br br An e reader also called an e book reader or e book device is a mobile electronic device that is designed primarily for the purpose of reading e books and digital periodicals An e reader is similar in form but more limited in purpose than a tablet In comparison to tablets many e readers are better than tablets for reading because they are more portable have better readability in sunlight and have longer battery life In July online bookseller Amazon com reported sales of e books for its proprietary Kindle outnumbered sales of hardcover books for the first time ever during the second quarter of saying it sold e books for every hardcover books including hardcovers for which there was no digital edition By January e book sales at Amazon had surpassed its paperback sales In the overall US market paperback book sales are still much larger than either hardcover or e book The American Publishing Association estimated e books represented of sales as of mid up from a year before At the end of the first quarter of e book sales in the United States surpassed hardcover book sales for the first time br Until late use of an e reader was not allowed on airplanes during takeoff and landing by the FAA In November the FAA allowed use of e readers on airplanes at all times if it is in Airplane Mode which means all radios turned off and Europe followed this guidance the next month In The New York Times predicted that by e books will make up over of total consumer publishing revenue in the United States and Great Britain br br Some of the major book retailers and multiple third party developers offer free and in some third party cases premium paid e reader software applications apps for the Mac and PC computers as well as for Android Blackberry iPad iPhone Windows Phone and Palm OS devices to allow the reading of e books and other documents independently of dedicated e book devices Examples are apps for the Amazon Kindle Barnes Noble Nook iBooks Kobo eReader and Sony Reader br br c br ngela Ruiz Robles patents the idea of the

br br May Barnes Noble releases the GlowLight Plus e reader the largest Nook e reader to date with a inch E Ink screen br br Writers and publishers have many formats to choose from when publishing e books Each format has advantages and disadvantages The most popular e readers and their natively supported formats are shown below br br Most e book publishers do not warn their customers about the possible implications of the digital rights management tied to their products Generally they claim that digital rights management is meant to prevent illegal copying of the e book However in many cases it is also possible that digital rights management will result in the complete denial of access by the purchaser to the e book The e books sold by most major publishers and electronic retailers which are Amazon com Google Barnes Noble Kobo Inc and Apple Inc are DRM protected and tied to the publisher s e reader software or hardware The first major publisher to omit DRM was Tor Books one of the largest publishers of science fiction and fantasy in Smaller e book publishers such as O Reilly Media Carina Press and Baen Books had already forgone DRM previously br br Some e books are produced simultaneously with the production of a printed format as described in electronic publishing though in many instances they may not be put on sale until later Often e books are produced from pre existing hard copy books generally by document scanning sometimes with the use of robotic book scanners having the technology to quickly scan books without damaging the original print edition Scanning a book produces a set of image files which may additionally be converted into text format by an OCR program Occasionally as in some projects an e book may be produced by re entering the text from a keyboard Sometimes only the electronic version of a book is produced by the publisher It is possible to release an e book chapter by chapter as each chapter is written This is useful in fields such as information technology where topics can change quickly in the months that it takes to write a typical book It is also possible to convert an electronic book to a printed book by print on demand However these are exceptions as tradition dictates that a book be launched in the print format and later if the author wishes an electronic version is produced The New York Times keeps a list of best selling e books for both fiction and non fiction br br All of the e readers and reading apps are capable of tracking e book reading data and what the data could contain which e books users open how long the users spend reading each e book and how much of each e book is finished In December Kobo released e book reading data collected from over million of its users worldwide Some of the results were that only of UK readers finished the bestselling e book The Goldfinch and the top selling e book in the UK One Cold Night was finished by of readers This is evidence that while popular e books are being completely read some e books are only sampled br br In the space that a comparably sized physical book takes up an e reader can contain thousands of e books limited only by its memory capacity Depending on the device an e book may be readable in low light or even total darkness Many e readers have a built in light source can enlarge or change fonts use text to speech software to read the text aloud for visually impaired elderly or dyslexic people or just for convenience Additionally e readers allow readers to look up words or find more information about the topic immediately using an online dictionary Amazon reports that of its e book readers look up a word while reading br A study found that even when accounting for the emissions created in manufacturing the e reader device substituting more than print books a year resulted in less greenhouse gas emissions than print While an e reader costs more than most individual books e books may have a lower cost than paper books E books may be made available for less than the price of traditional books using on demand book printers Moreover numerous e books are available online free of charge on sites such as Project Gutenberg For example all books printed before are in the public domain in the United States which enables websites to host ebook versions of such titles for free br Depending on possible digital rights management e books unlike physical books can be backed up and recovered in the case of loss or damage to the device on which they are stored a new copy can be downloaded without incurring an additional cost from the distributor Readers can synchronize their reading location highlights and bookmarks across several devices br br There may be a lack of privacy for the user s e book reading activities For example Amazon knows the user s identity what the user is reading whether the user has finished the book what page the user is on how long the user has spent on each page and which passages the user may have highlighted One obstacle to wide adoption of the e book is that a large portion of people value the printed book as an object itself including aspects such as the texture smell weight and appearance on the shelf Print books are also considered valuable cultural items and symbols of liberal education and the humanities Kobo found that of e books that are purchased from their e book store are never opened and found that the more expensive the book is the more likely the reader would at least open the e book br Joe Queenan has written about the pros and cons of e books br br Electronic books are ideal for people who value the information contained in them or who have vision problems or who like to read on the subway or who do not want other people to see how they are amusing themselves or who have storage and clutter issues but they are useless for people who are engaged in an intense lifelong love affair with books Books that we can touch books that we can smell books that we can depend on br br Apart from all the emotional and habitual aspects there are also some readability and usability issues that need to be addressed by publishers and software developers Many e book readers who complain about eyestrain lack of overview and distractions could be helped if they could use a more suitable device or a more user friendly reading application but when they buy or borrow a DRM protected e book they often have to read the book on the default device or application even if it has insufficient functionality br While a paper book is vulnerable to various threats including water damage mold and theft e books files may be corrupted deleted or otherwise lost as well as pirated Where the ownership of a paper book is fairly straightforward albeit subject to restrictions on renting or copying pages depending on the book the purchaser of an e book s digital file has conditional access with the possible loss of access to the e book due to digital rights management provisions copyright issues the provider s business failing or possibly if the user s credit card expired br br According to the Association of American Publishers annual report ebooks accounted for of the total trade revenue br Publishers of books in all formats made billion in print form and billion in e books according to the Association of American Publishers annual
