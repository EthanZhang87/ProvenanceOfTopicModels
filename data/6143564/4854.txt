title: Bermuda Triangle
id: 4854
The Bermuda Triangle also known as the Devil s Triangle is an urban legend focused on a loosely defined region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean where a number of aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances The idea of the area as uniquely prone to disappearances arose in the mid th century but most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery br br br Origins br br The earliest suggestion of unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area appeared in an article written by Edward Van Winkle Jones of the Miami Herald that was distributed by the Associated Press and appeared in various American newspapers on September br Two years later Fate magazine published Sea Mystery at Our Back Door a short article by George X Sand that was the first to lay out the now familiar triangular area where the losses took place Sand recounted the loss of several planes and ships since World War II the disappearance of Sandra a tramp steamer the December loss of Flight a group of five US Navy torpedo bombers on a training mission the January disappearance of Star Tiger a British South American Airways BSAA passenger airplane the March disappearance of a fishing skiff with three men including jockey Albert Snider the December disappearance of an Airborne Transport DC charter flight en route from Puerto Rico to Miami and the January disappearance of Star Ariel another BSAA passenger airplane br Flight was covered again in the April issue of The American Legion Magazine In it author Allan W Eckert wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying We cannot be sure of any direction everything is wrong strange the ocean doesn t look as it should In February Vincent Gaddis wrote an article called The Deadly Bermuda Triangle in Argosy saying Flight and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the region dating back to at least The next year Gaddis expanded this article into a book Invisible Horizons br Other writers elaborated on Gaddis ideas including John Wallace Spencer Limbo of the Lost repr Charles Berlitz The Bermuda Triangle and Richard Winer The Devil s Triangle Various of these authors incorporated supernatural elements br br br Triangle area br Sand s article in Fate described the area as a watery triangle bounded roughly by Florida Bermuda and Puerto Rico The Argosy article by Gaddis further delineated the boundaries giving its vertices as Miami San Juan Puerto Rico and Bermuda Subsequent writers did not necessarily follow this definition Some writers gave different boundaries and vertices to the triangle with the total area varying from to million km to million sq mi Indeed some writers even stretch it as far as the Irish coast Consequently the determination of which accidents occurred inside the triangle depends on which writer reported them br br br Criticism of the concept br br br Larry Kusche br Larry Kusche author of The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved argued that many claims of Gaddis and subsequent writers were exaggerated dubious or unverifiable Kusche s research revealed a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies between Berlitz s accounts and statements from eyewitnesses participants and others involved in the initial incidents Kusche noted cases where pertinent information went unreported such as the disappearance of round the world yachtsman Donald Crowhurst which Berlitz had presented as a mystery despite clear evidence to the contrary Another example was the ore carrier recounted by Berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an Atlantic port when it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the Pacific Ocean Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the incidents that sparked allegations of the Triangle s mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it Often his research was simple he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events like unusual weather that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories br Kusche concluded that br br The number of ships and aircraft reported missing in the area was not significantly greater proportionally speaking than in any other part of the ocean br In an area frequented by tropical cyclones the number of disappearances that did occur were for the most part neither disproportionate unlikely nor mysterious br Furthermore Berlitz and other writers would often fail to mention such storms or even represent the disappearance as having happened in calm conditions when meteorological records clearly contradict this br The numbers themselves had been exaggerated by sloppy research A boat s disappearance for example would be reported but its eventual if belated return to port may not have been br Some disappearances had in fact never happened One plane crash was said to have taken place in off Daytona Beach Florida in front of hundreds of witnesses br The legend of the Bermuda Triangle is a manufactured mystery perpetuated by writers who either purposely or unknowingly made use of misconceptions faulty reasoning and sensationalism br br br Further responses br When the British Channel television program The Bermuda Triangle was being produced by John Simmons of Geofilms for the Equinox series the marine insurance market Lloyd s of London was asked if an unusually large number of ships had sunk in the Bermuda Triangle area Lloyd s determined that large numbers of ships had not sunk there Lloyd s does not charge higher rates for passing through this area United States Coast Guard records confirm their conclusion In fact the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular basis br The Coast Guard is also officially skeptical of the Triangle noting that they collect and publish through their inquiries much documentation contradicting many of the incidents written about by the Triangle authors In one such incident involving the explosion and sinking of the tanker V A Fogg the Coast Guard photographed the wreck and recovered several bodies in contrast with one Triangle author s claim that all the bodies had vanished with the exception of the captain who was found sitting in his cabin at his desk clutching a coffee cup In addition V A Fogg sank off the coast of Texas nowhere near the commonly accepted boundaries of the Triangle br The Nova Horizon episode The Case of the Bermuda Triangle aired on June was highly critical stating that When we ve gone back to the original sources or the people involved the mystery evaporates Science does not have to answer questions about the Triangle because those questions are not valid in the first place Ships and planes behave in the Triangle the same way they behave everywhere else in the world br Skeptical researchers such as Ernest Taves and Barry Singer have noted how mysteries and the paranormal are very popular and profitable This has led to the production of vast amounts of material on topics such as the Bermuda Triangle They were able to show that some of the pro paranormal material is often misleading or inaccurate but its producers continue to market it Accordingly they have claimed that the market is biased in favor of books TV specials and other media that support the Triangle mystery and against well researched material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint br In a study the World Wide Fund for Nature identified the world s most dangerous waters for shipping but the Bermuda Triangle was not among them br Benjamin Radford an author and scientific paranormal investigator noted in an interview on the Bermuda Triangle that it could be very difficult locating an aircraft lost at sea due to the vast search area and although the disappearance might be mysterious that did not make it paranormal or unexplainable Radford further noted the importance of double checking information as the mystery surrounding the Bermuda Triangle had been created by people who had neglected to do so br br br Hypothetical explanation attempts br Persons accepting the Bermuda Triangle as a real phenomenon have offered a number of explanatory approaches br br br Paranormal explanations br Triangle writers have used a number of supernatural concepts to explain the events One explanation pins the blame on leftover technology from the mythical lost continent of Atlantis Sometimes connected to the Atlantis story is the submerged rock formation known as the Bimini Road off the island of Bimini in the Bahamas which is in the Triangle by some definitions Followers of the purported psychic Edgar Cayce take his prediction that evidence of Atlantis would be found in as referring to the discovery of the Bimini Road Believers describe the formation as a road wall or other structure but the Bimini Road is of natural origin br Some hypothesize that a parallel universe exists in the Bermuda Triangle region causing a time space warp that sucks the objects around it into a parallel universe Others attribute the events to UFOs Charles Berlitz author of various books on anomalous phenomena lists several theories attributing the losses in the Triangle to anomalous or unexplained forces br br br Natural explanations br br br Compass variations br Compass problems are one of the cited phrases in many Triangle incidents While some have theorized that unusual local magnetic anomalies may exist in the area such anomalies have not been found Compasses have natural magnetic variations in relation to the magnetic poles a fact which navigators have known for centuries Magnetic compass north and geographic true north are exactly the same only for a small number of places for example as of in the United States only those places on a line running from Wisconsin to the Gulf of Mexico But the public may not be as informed and think there is something mysterious about a compass changing across an area as large as the Triangle which it naturally will br br br Gulf Stream br The Gulf Stream Florida Current is a major surface current primarily driven by thermohaline circulation that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and then flows through the Straits of Florida into the North Atlantic In essence it is a river within an ocean and like a river it can and does carry floating objects It has a maximum surface velocity of about m s ft s A small plane making a water landing or a boat having engine trouble can be carried away from its reported position by the current br br br Human error br One of the most cited explanations in official inquiries as to the loss of any aircraft or vessel is human error Human stubbornness may have caused businessman Harvey Conover to lose his sailing yacht Revonoc as he sailed into the teeth of a storm south of Florida on January br br br Violent weather br Hurricanes are powerful storms which form in tropical waters and have historically cost thousands of lives and caused billions of dollars in damage The sinking of Francisco de Bobadilla s Spanish fleet in was the first recorded instance of a destructive hurricane These storms have in the past caused a number of incidents related to the Triangle Many Atlantic hurricanes pass through the Triangle as they recurve off the Eastern Seaboard and before the advent of weather satellites ships often had little to no warning of a hurricane s approach br br A powerful downdraft of cold air was suspected to be a cause in the sinking of Pride of Baltimore on May The crew of the sunken vessel noted the wind suddenly shifted and increased velocity from km h mph to km h mph A National Hurricane Center satellite specialist James Lushine stated during very unstable weather conditions the downburst of cold air from aloft can hit the surface like a bomb exploding outward like a giant squall line of wind and water br br br Methane hydrates br br An explanation for some of the disappearances has focused on the presence of large fields of methane hydrates a form of natural gas on the continental shelves Laboratory experiments carried out in Australia have proven that bubbles can indeed sink a scale model ship by decreasing the density of the water and any wreckage would be deposited on the ocean floor or rapidly dispersed by the Gulf Stream It has been hypothesized that periodic methane eruptions sometimes called mud volcanoes may produce regions of frothy water that are no longer capable of providing adequate buoyancy for ships If this were the case such an area forming around a ship could cause it to sink very rapidly and without warning br Publications by the USGS describe large stores of undersea hydrates worldwide including the Blake Ridge area off the coast of the southeastern United States However according to the USGS no large releases of gas hydrates are believed to have occurred in the Bermuda Triangle for the past years br br br Notable incidents br br br HMS Atalanta br br The sail training ship HMS Atalanta originally named HMS Juno disappeared with her entire crew after setting sail from the Royal Naval Dockyard Bermuda for Falmouth England on January It was presumed that she sank in a powerful storm which crossed her route a couple of weeks after she sailed and that her crew being composed primarily of inexperienced trainees may have been a contributing factor The search for evidence of her fate attracted worldwide attention at the time connection is also often made to the loss of the training ship HMS Eurydice which foundered after departing the Royal Naval Dockyard in Bermuda for Portsmouth on March and she was alleged decades later to have been a victim of the mysterious triangle an allegation resoundingly refuted by the research of author David Francis Raine in br br br USS Cyclops br br The incident resulting in the single largest loss of life in the history of the US Navy not related to combat occurred when the collier Cyclops carrying a full load of manganese ore and with one engine out of action went missing without a trace with a crew of sometime after March after departing the island of Barbados Although there is no strong evidence for any single theory many independent theories exist some blaming storms some capsizing and some suggesting that wartime enemy activity was to blame for the loss In addition two of Cyclops s sister ships Proteus and Nereus were subsequently lost in the North Atlantic during World War II Both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on Cyclops during her fatal voyage In all three cases structural failure due to overloading with a much denser cargo than designed is considered the most likely cause of sinking br br br Carroll A Deering br br Carroll A Deering a five masted schooner built in was found hard aground and abandoned at Diamond Shoals near Cape Hatteras North Carolina on January FBI investigation into the Deering scrutinized then ruled out multiple theories as to why and how the ship was abandoned including piracy domestic Communist sabotage and the involvement of rum runners br br br Flight br br Flight was a training flight of five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers that disappeared on December while over the Atlantic The squadron s flight plan was scheduled to take them due east from Fort Lauderdale for mi km north for mi km and then back over a final mi km leg to complete the exercise The flight never returned to base The disappearance was attributed by Navy investigators to navigational error leading to the aircraft running out of fuel br One of the search and rescue aircraft deployed to look for them a PBM Mariner with a man crew also disappeared A tanker off the coast of Florida reported seeing an explosion and observing a widespread oil slick when fruitlessly searching for survivors The weather was becoming stormy by the end of the incident According to contemporaneous sources the Mariner had a history of explosions due to vapor leaks when heavily loaded with fuel as it might have been for a potentially long search and rescue operation br br br Star Tiger and Star Ariel br br G AHNP Star Tiger disappeared on January on a flight from the Azores to Bermuda G AGRE Star Ariel disappeared on January on a flight from Bermuda to Kingston Jamaica Both were Avro Tudor IV passenger aircraft operated by British South American Airways Both planes were operating at the very limits of their range and the slightest error or fault in the equipment could keep them from reaching the small island br br br Douglas DC br br On December a Douglas DC aircraft number NC disappeared while on a flight from San Juan Puerto Rico to Miami No trace of the aircraft or the people on board was ever found A Civil Aeronautics Board investigation found there was insufficient information available on which to determine probable cause of the disappearance br br br Connemara IV br A pleasure yacht was found adrift in the Atlantic south of Bermuda on September it is usually stated in the stories Berlitz Winer that the crew vanished while the yacht survived being at sea during three hurricanes The Atlantic hurricane season shows Hurricane Ione passing nearby between and September with Bermuda being affected by winds of almost gale force In his second book on the Bermuda Triangle Winer quoted from a letter he had received from Mr J E Challenor of Barbados br br On the morning of September Connemara IV was lying to a heavy mooring in the open roadstead of Carlisle Bay Because of the approaching hurricane the owner strengthened the mooring ropes and put out two additional anchors There was little else he could do as the exposed mooring was the only available anchorage In Carlisle Bay the sea in the wake of Hurricane Janet was awe inspiring and dangerous The owner of Connemara IV observed that she had disappeared An investigation revealed that she had dragged her moorings and gone to sea br br br KC Stratotankers br On August a pair of US Air Force KC Stratotanker aircraft collided and crashed into the Atlantic miles km west of Bermuda Some writers say that while the two aircraft did collide there were two distinct crash sites separated by over miles km of water However Kusche s research showed that the unclassified version of the Air Force investigation report revealed that the debris field defining the second crash site was examined by a search and rescue ship and found to be a mass of seaweed and driftwood tangled in an old buoy br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br Citations br br br Bibliography br The incidents cited above apart from the official documentation come
