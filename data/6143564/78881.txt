In ancient Greek religion and mythology Pan Ancient Greek romanized P n is the god of the wild shepherds and flocks rustic music and impromptus and companion of the nymphs He has the hindquarters legs and horns of a goat in the same manner as a faun or satyr With his homeland in rustic Arcadia he is also recognized as the god of fields groves wooded glens and often affiliated with sex because of this Pan is connected to fertility and the season of spring br In Roman religion and myth Pan was frequently identified with Faunus a nature god who was the father of Bona Dea sometimes identified as Fauna he was also closely associated with Silvanus due to their similar relationships with woodlands and Inuus a vaguely defined deity also sometimes identified with Faunus In the th and th centuries Pan became a significant figure in the Romantic movement of western Europe and also in the th century Neopagan movement br br br Origins br Many modern scholars consider Pan to be derived from the reconstructed Proto Indo European god P h us n whom they believe to have been an important pastoral deity P h us n shares an origin with the modern English word pasture The Rigvedic psychopomp god Pushan from PIE zero grade Ph us n is believed to be a cognate of Pan The connection between Pan and Pushan both of whom are associated with goats was first identified in by the German scholar Hermann Collitz The familiar form of the name Pan is contracted from earlier derived from the root peh guard watch over According to Edwin L Brown the name Pan is probably a cognate with the Greek word companion br In his earliest appearance in literature Pindar s Pythian Ode iii Pan is associated with a mother goddess perhaps Rhea or Cybele Pindar refers to maidens worshipping Cybele and Pan near the poet s house in Boeotia br br br Worship br The worship of Pan began in Arcadia which was always the principal seat of his worship Arcadia was a district of mountain people culturally separated from other Greeks Arcadian hunters used to scourge the statue of the god if they had been disappointed in the chase br Being a rustic god Pan was not worshipped in temples or other built edifices but in natural settings usually caves or grottoes such as the one on the north slope of the Acropolis of Athens These are often referred to as the Cave of Pan The only exceptions are the Temple of Pan on the Neda River gorge in the southwestern Peloponnese the ruins of which survive to this day and the Temple of Pan at Apollonopolis Magna in ancient Egypt In the th century BC Pan was depicted on the coinage of Pantikapaion br Archaeologists while excavating a Byzantine church of around AD in Banyas discovered in the walls of the church an altar of the god Pan with a Greek inscription dating back to the nd or rd century AD The inscription reads Atheneon son of Sosipatros of Antioch is dedicating the altar to the god Pan Heliopolitanus He built the altar using his own personal money in fulfillment of a vow he made br In the mystery cults of the highly syncretic Hellenistic era Pan is identified with Phanes Protogonos Zeus Dionysus and Eros br br br Epithets br Aegocerus Ancient Greek romanized Aig ker s lit goat horned was an epithet of Pan descriptive of his figure with the horns of a goat br Lyterius Ancient Greek meaning Deliverer There was a sanctuary at Troezen and he had this epithet because he was believed during a plague to have revealed in dreams the proper remedy against the disease br Maenalius Ancient Greek or Maenalides Ancient Greek derived from mount Maenalus which was sacred to the god br br br Parentage br br Numerous different parentages are given for Pan by different authors According to the Homeric Hymn to Pan he is the child of Hermes and an unnamed daughter of Dryops Several authors state that Pan is the son of Hermes and Penelope apparently Penelope the wife of Odysseus according to Herodotus this was the version which was believed by the Greeks and later sources such as Cicero and Hyginus call Pan the son of Mercury and Penelope In some early sources such as Pindar c c BC and Hecataeus c c BC he is called the child of Penelope by Apollo Apollodorus records two distinct divinities named Pan one who was the son of Hermes and Penelope and the other who had Zeus and a nymph named Hybris for his parents and was the mentor of Apollo Pausanias records the story that Penelope had in fact been unfaithful to her husband who banished her to Mantineia upon his return Other sources Duris of Samos the Vergilian commentator Servius report that Penelope slept with all suitors in Odysseus absence and gave birth to Pan as a result This myth reflects the folk etymology that equates Pan s name with the Greek word for all According to Smith s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology Apollodorus has his parents as Hermes and Oeneis while scholia on Theocritus have Aether and Oeneis br br Like other nature spirits Pan appears to be older than the Olympians if it is true that he gave Artemis her hunting dogs and taught the secret of prophecy to Apollo Pan might be multiplied as the Pans Burkert III Ruck and Staples p or the Paniskoi Kerenyi p notes from scholia that Aeschylus in Rhesus distinguished between two Pans one the son of Zeus and twin of Arcas and one a son of Cronus In the retinue of Dionysos or in depictions of wild landscapes there appeared not only a great Pan but also little Pans Paniskoi who played the same part as the Satyrs br Herodotus wrote that according to Egyptian chronology Pan was the most ancient of the gods but according to the version in which Pan was the son of Hermes and Penelope he was born only eight hundred years before Herodotus and thus after the Trojan war Herodotus concluded that that would be when the Greeks first learnt the name of Pan br br br Mythology br br br Battle with Typhon br The goat god Aegipan was nurtured by Amalthea with the infant Zeus in Crete In Zeus battle with Typhon Aegipan and Hermes stole back Zeus sinews that Typhon had hidden away in the Corycian Cave Pan aided his foster brother in the battle with the Titans by letting out a horrible screech and scattering them in terror According to some traditions Aegipan was the son of Pan rather than his father The constellation Capricornus is traditionally depicted as a sea goat a goat with a fish s tail see Goatlike Aigaion called Briareos one of the Hecatonchires A myth reported as Egyptian in Hyginus s Poetic Astronomy which would seem to be invented to justify a connection of Pan with Capricorn says that when Aegipan that is Pan in his goat god aspect was attacked by the monster Typhon he dived into the river Nile the parts above the water remained a goat but those under the water transformed into a fish br br br Erotic aspects br br Pan is famous for his sexual prowess and is often depicted with a phallus Diogenes of Sinope speaking in jest related a myth of Pan learning masturbation from his father Hermes and teaching the habit to shepherds br There was a legend that Pan seduced the moon goddess Selene deceiving her with a sheep s fleece br One of the famous myths of Pan involves the origin of his pan flute fashioned from lengths of hollow reed Syrinx was a lovely wood nymph of Arcadia daughter of Ladon the river god As she was returning from the hunt one day Pan met her To escape from his importunities the fair nymph ran away and didn t stop to hear his compliments He pursued from Mount Lycaeum until she came to her sisters who immediately changed her into a reed When the air blew through the reeds it produced a plaintive melody The god still infatuated took some of the reeds because he could not identify which reed she became and cut seven pieces or according to some versions nine joined them side by side in gradually decreasing lengths and formed the musical instrument bearing the name of his beloved Syrinx Henceforth Pan was seldom seen without it br br Echo was a nymph who was a great singer and dancer and scorned the love of any man This angered Pan a lecherous god and he instructed his followers to kill her Echo was torn to pieces and spread all over Earth The goddess of the Earth Gaia received the pieces of Echo whose voice remains repeating the last words of others In some versions Echo and Pan had two children Iambe and Iynx In other versions Pan had fallen in love with Echo but she scorned the love of any man but was enraptured by Narcissus As Echo was cursed by Hera to only be able to repeat words that had been said by someone else she could not speak for herself She followed Narcissus to a pool where he fell in love with his own reflection and changed into a narcissus flower Echo wasted away but her voice could still be heard in caves and other such similar places br Pan also loved a nymph named Pitys who was turned into a pine tree to escape him In another version Pan and the north wind god Boreas clashed over the lovely Pitys Boreas uprooted all the trees to impress her but Pan laughed and Pitys chose him Boreas then chased her and threw her off a cliff resulting in her death Gaia pitied Pitys and turned her into a pine tree br According to some traditions Pan taught Daphnis a rustic son of Hermes how to play the pan pipes and also fell in love with him br Women who had had sexual relations with several men were referred to as Pan girls br br br Panic br Disturbed in his secluded afternoon naps Pan s angry shout inspired panic panikon deima in lonely places Following the Titans assault on Olympus Pan claimed credit for the victory of the gods because he had frightened the attackers In the Battle of Marathon BC it is said that Pan favored the Athenians and so inspired panic in the hearts of their enemies the Persians br br br Music br br In two late Roman sources Hyginus and Ovid Pan is substituted for the satyr Marsyas in the theme of a musical competition agon and the punishment by flaying is omitted br Pan once had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge Apollo the god of the lyre to a trial of skill Tmolus the mountain god was chosen to judge Pan blew on his pipes and gave great satisfaction with his rustic melody to himself and to his faithful follower Midas who happened to be present Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo and all but Midas agreed with the judgment Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer and turned Midas ears into those of a donkey br br br All of the Pans br br Pan could be multiplied into a swarm of Pans and even be given individual names as in Nonnus Dionysiaca where the god Pan had twelve sons that helped Dionysus in his war against the Indians Their names were Kelaineus Argennon Aigikoros Eugeneios Omester Daphoenus Phobos Philamnos Xanthos Glaukos Argos and Phorbas br Two other Pans were Agreus and Nomios Both were the sons of Hermes Agreus mother being the nymph Sose a prophetess he inherited his mother s gift of prophecy and was also a skilled hunter Nomios mother was Penelope not the same as the wife of Odysseus He was an excellent shepherd seducer of nymphs and musician upon the shepherd s pipes Most of the mythological stories about Pan are actually about Nomios not the god Pan Although Agreus and Nomios could have been two different aspects of the prime Pan reflecting his dual nature as both a wise prophet and a lustful beast br Aegipan literally goat Pan was a Pan who was fully goatlike rather than half goat and half man When the Olympians fled from the monstrous giant Typhoeus and hid themselves in animal form Aegipan assumed the form of a fish tailed goat Later he came to the aid of Zeus in his battle with Typhoeus by stealing back Zeus stolen sinews As a reward the king of the gods placed him amongst the stars as the Constellation Capricorn The mother of Aegipan Aix the goat was perhaps associated with the constellation Capra br Sybarios was an Italian Pan who was worshipped in the Greek colony of Sybaris in Italy The Sybarite Pan was conceived when a Sybarite shepherd boy named Krathis copulated with a pretty she goat amongst his herds br br br The great god Pan is dead br br According to the Greek historian Plutarch in De defectu oraculorum The Obsolescence of Oracles Pan is the only Greek god who actually dies During the reign of Tiberius AD the news of Pan s death came to one Thamus a sailor on his way to Italy by way of the Greek island of Paxi A divine voice hailed him across the salt water Thamus are you there When you reach Palodes take care to proclaim that the great god Pan is dead Which Thamus did and the news was greeted from shore with groans and laments br Christian apologists including Eusebius of Caesarea have long made much of Plutarch s story of the death of Pan Due to the word all in Greek also being pan a pun was made that all demons had perished br In Rabelais Fourth Book of Pantagruel th century the Giant Pantagruel after recollecting the tale as told by Plutarch opines that the announcement was actually about the death of Jesus Christ which did take place at about the same time towards the end of Tiberius reign noting the aptness of the name for he may lawfully be said in the Greek tongue to be Pan since he is our all For all that we are all that we live all that we have all that we hope is him by him from him and in him In this interpretation Rabelais was following Guillaume Postel in his De orbis terrae concordia br The th century visionary Anne Catherine Emmerich in a twist echoed nowhere else claims that the phrase the Great Pan was actually a demonic epithet for Jesus Christ and that Thamus or Tramus was a watchman in the port of Nicaea who at the time of the other spectacular events surrounding Christ s death was then commissioned to spread this message which was later garbled in repetition br In modern times G K Chesterton has repeated and amplified the significance of the death of Pan suggesting that with the death of Pan came the advent of theology To this effect Chesterton claimed It is said truly in a sense that Pan died because Christ was born It is almost as true in another sense that men knew that Christ was born because Pan was already dead A void was made by the vanishing world of the whole mythology of mankind which would have asphyxiated like a vacuum if it had not been filled with theology It was interpreted with concurrent meanings in all four modes of medieval exegesis literally as historical fact and allegorically as the death of the ancient order at the coming of the new br In more modern times some have suggested a possible naturalistic explanation for the myth For example Robert Graves The Greek Myths reported a suggestion that had been made by Salomon Reinach and expanded by James S Van Teslaar that the sailors actually heard the excited shouts of the worshipers of Tammuz Thamo s panm gas t thn ke All great Tammuz is dead and misinterpreted them as a message directed to an Egyptian sailor named Thamus Great Pan is Dead Van Teslaar explains i n its true form the phrase would have probably carried no meaning to those on board who must have been unfamiliar with the worship of Tammuz which was a transplanted and for those parts therefore an exotic custom Certainly when Pausanias toured Greece about a century after Plutarch he found Pan s shrines sacred caves and sacred mountains still very much frequented However a naturalistic explanation might not be needed For example William Hansen has shown that the story is quite similar to a class of widely known tales known as Fairies Send a Message br The cry The Great Pan is dead has appealed to poets such as John Milton in his ecstatic celebration of Christian peace On the Morning of Christ s Nativity line Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Louisa May Alcott br br br Influence br br br Iconography br Representations of Pan have influenced conventional popular depictions of the Devil br br br Literary revival br br In the late th century interest in Pan revived among liberal scholars Richard Payne Knight discussed Pan in his Discourse on the Worship of Priapus as a symbol of creation expressed through sexuality Pan is represented pouring water upon the organ of generation that is invigorating the active creative power by the prolific element br John Keats s Endymion opens with a festival dedicated to Pan where a stanzaic hymn is sung in praise of him Keats drew most of his account of Pan s activities from the Elizabethan poets Douglas Bush notes The goat god the tutelary divinity of shepherds had long been allegorized on various levels from Christ to Universall Nature Sandys here he becomes the symbol of the romantic imagination of supra mortal knowledge br In the late th century Pan became an increasingly common figure in literature and art Patricia Merivale states that between and there was an astonishing resurgence of interest in the Pan motif He appears in poetry in novels and children s books and is referenced in the name of the character Peter Pan In the Peter Pan stories Peter represents a golden age of pre civilisation in both the minds of very young children before enculturation and education and in the natural world outside the influence of humans Peter Pan s character is both charming and selfish emphasizing our cultural confusion about whether human instincts are natural and good or uncivilised and bad J M Barrie describes Peter as a betwixt and between part animal and part human and uses this device to explore many issues of human and animal psychology within the Peter Pan stories br Arthur Machen s novella The Great God Pan uses the god s name in a simile about the whole world being revealed as it really is seeing the Great God Pan The novella is considered by many including Stephen King as being one of the greatest horror stories ever written br In an article in Hellebore magazine Melissa Edmundson argues that women writers from the th century used the figure of Pan to reclaim agency in texts that explored female empowerment and sexual liberation In Eleanor Farjeon s poem Pan Worship the speaker tries to summon Pan to life after feeling a craving in me wishing for a spring tide that will replace the stagnant autumn of the soul A dark version of Pan s seductiveness appears in Margery Lawrence s Robin s Rath both giving and taking life and vitality br Pan is the eponymous Piper at the Gates of Dawn in the seventh chapter of Kenneth Grahame s The Wind in the Willows Grahame s Pan unnamed but clearly recognisable is a powerful but secretive nature god protector of animals who casts a spell of forgetfulness on all those he helps He makes a brief appearance to help Rat and Mole recover the Otter s lost son Portly br The goat footed god entices villagers to listen to his pipes as if in a trance in Lord Dunsany s novel The Blessing of Pan Although the god does not appear within the story his energy invokes the younger folk of the village to revel in the summer twilight while the vicar of the village is the only person worried about the revival of worship of the old pagan god br Pan features as a prominent character in Tom Robbins Jitterbug Perfume br The British writer and editor Mark Beech of Egaeus Press published in the limited edition anthology Soliloquy for Pan which includes essays and poems such as The Rebirthing of Pan by Adrian Eckersley Pan s Pipes by Robert Louis Stevenson Pan with Us by Robert Frost and The Death of Pan by Lord Dunsany Some of the detailed illustrated depictions of Pan included in the volume are by the artists Giorgio Ghisi Sir James Thornhill Bernard Picart Agostino Veneziano Vincenzo Cartari and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo br In the Percy Jackson novels author Rick Riordan uses The Great God Pan is dead quote as a plot point in the novel The Sea of Monsters and in The Battle of the Labyrinth Pan is revealed to be in a state of half death br br br Revival in music br Pan inspired pieces of classical music by Claude Debussy Syrinx written as part of incidental music to the play Psych by Gabriel Mourey was originally called Fl te de Pan Pr lude l apr s midi d un faune was based on a poem by St phane Mallarm br The story of Pan is the inspiration for the first movement in Benjamin Britten s work for solo oboe Six Metamorphoses after Ovid first performed in Inspired by characters from Ovid s fifteen volume work Metamorphoses Britten titled the movement Pan who played upon the reed pipe which was Syrinx his beloved br The British rock band Pink Floyd named its first album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in reference to Pan as he appears in The Wind in the Willows Andrew King Pink Floyd s manager said Syd Barrett thought Pan had given him an understanding into the way nature works It formed into his holistic view of the world br Brian Jones a founding member of The Rolling Stones strongly identified with Pan He produced the live album Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka about a Moroccan festival that evoked the ancient Roman rites of Pan br Musician Mike Scott of the Waterboys refers to Pan as the archetypal force within us all and talks about his search of The Pan Within reflected in songs such as The Return of Pan br br br Revived worship br In the English town of Painswick in Gloucestershire a group of th century gentry led by Benjamin Hyett organised an annual procession dedicated to Pan during which a statue of the deity was held aloft and people shouted Highgates Highgates Hyett also erected temples and follies to Pan in the gardens of his house and a Pan s lodge located over Painswick Valley The tradition died out in the s but was revived in by a new vicar W H Seddon who mistakenly believed that the festival had been ancient in origin One of Seddon s successors however was less appreciative of the pagan festival and put an end to it in when he had Pan s statue buried br Occultists Aleister Crowley and Victor Neuburg built an altar to Pan on Da leh Addin a mountain in Algeria where they performed a magic ceremony to summon the god In the final rite of the ritual play The Rites of Eleusis written by Crowley Pan pulls back the final veil revealing the child Horus who represents humanity s eternal and divine element br br br Neopaganism br In the Egyptologist Margaret Murray published the book The God of the Witches in which she theorised that Pan was merely one form of a horned god who was worshipped across Europe by a witch cult This theory influenced the Neopagan notion of the Horned God as an archetype of male virility and sexuality In Wicca the archetype of the Horned God is highly important as represented by such deities as the Celtic Cernunnos the Hindu Pashupati and
