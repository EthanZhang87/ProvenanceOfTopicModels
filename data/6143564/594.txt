diseases the Sun and light poetry and more One of the most important and complex of the Greek gods he is the son of Zeus and Leto and the twin brother of Artemis goddess of the hunt He is considered to be the most beautiful god and is represented as the ideal of the kouros ephebe or a beardless athletic youth Apollo is known in Greek influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu br As the patron deity of Delphi Apollo Pythios Apollo is an oracular god the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle and also the deity of ritual purification His oracles were often consulted for guidance in various matters He was in general seen as the god who affords help and wards off evil and is referred to as Alexicacus the averter of evil br Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius Apollo delivered people from epidemics yet he is also a god who could bring ill health and deadly plague with his arrows The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis Apollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden bow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows br As the god of mousike Apollo presides over all music songs dance and poetry He is the inventor of string music and the frequent companion of the Muses functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations The lyre is a common attribute of Apollo Protection of the young is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona As a kourotrophos Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children and he presided over their passage into adulthood Long hair which was the prerogative of boys was cut at the coming of age ephebeia and dedicated to Apollo The god himself is depicted with long uncut hair to symbolise his eternal youth br Apollo is an important pastoral deity and he was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds Protection of herds flocks and crops from diseases pests and predators were his primary rustic duties On the other hand Apollo also encouraged the founding of new towns and the establishment of civil constitutions is associated with dominion over colonists and was the giver of laws His oracles were often consulted before setting laws in a city Apollo Agyieus was the protector of the streets public places and home entrances br In Hellenistic times especially during the th century BCE as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios the personification of the Sun In Latin texts however there was no conflation of Apollo with Sol among the classical Latin poets until st century CE Apollo and Helios Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the th century CE br br Apollo Attic Ionic and Homeric Greek Apoll n GEN Doric Apell n Arcadocypriot Apeil n Aeolic Aploun Latin Apoll br The name Apollo unlike the related older name Paean is generally not found in the Linear B Mycenean Greek texts although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form pe rjo Linear B on the KN E tablet though it has also been suggested that the name might actually read Hyperion u pe rjo ne br The etymology of the name is uncertain The spelling pronounced a p l l n in Classical Attic had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era but the Doric form Apellon is more archaic as it is derived from an earlier j It probably is a cognate to the Doric month Apellaios and the offerings apellaia at the initiation of the young men during the family festival apellai According to some scholars the words are derived from the Doric word apella which originally meant wall fence for animals and later assembly within the limits of the square Apella is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta corresponding to the ecclesia R S P Beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested a Pre Greek proto form Apalyun br Several instances of popular etymology are attested by ancient authors Thus the Greeks most often associated Apollo s name with the Greek verb apollymi to destroy Plato in Cratylus connects the name with apolysis redemption with apolousis purification and with h aploun simple in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name and finally with aeiballon ever shooting Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric apella which means assembly so that Apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation sekos fold in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds In the ancient Macedonian language pella means stone and some toponyms may be derived from this word Pella the capital of ancient Macedonia and Pell n Pellene br The Hittite form Apaliunas dx ap pa li u na a is attested in the Manapa Tarhunta letter The Hittite testimony reflects an early form Apelj n which may also be surmised from the comparison of Cypriot with Doric The name of the Lydian god Q d ns k ns may reflect an earlier k aly n before palatalization syncope and the pre Lydian sound change y d Note the labiovelar in place of the labial p found in pre Doric j and Hittite Apaliunas br A Luwian etymology suggested for Apaliunas makes Apollo The One of Entrapment perhaps in the sense of Hunter br br Apollo s chief epithet was Phoebus FEE b s Phoibos Greek pronunciation p i bos literally bright It was very commonly used by

br Apollo is considered the most Hellenic Greek of the Olympian gods br The cult centers of Apollo in Greece Delphi and Delos date from the th century BCE The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to Artemis Apollo s twin sister At Delphi Apollo was venerated as the slayer of the monstrous serpent Python For the Greeks Apollo was the most Greek of all the gods and through the centuries he acquired different functions In Archaic Greece he was the prophet the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing In Classical Greece he was the god of light and of music but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil Walter Burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship which he termed a Dorian northwest Greek component a Cretan Minoan component and a Syro Hittite component br br In classical times his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil and he was therefore called apotropaios averting evil and alexikakos keeping off ill from v n Apollo also had many epithets relating to his function as a healer Some commonly used examples are paion literally healer or helper epikourios succouring oulios healer baleful and loimios of the plague In later writers the word paion usually spelled Paean becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of healing br Apollo in his aspect of healer has a connection to the primitive god Paean who did not have a cult of his own Paean serves as the healer of the gods in the Iliad and seems to have originated in a pre Greek religion It is suggested though unconfirmed that he is connected to the Mycenaean figure pa ja wo ne Linear B Paean was the personification of holy songs sung by seer doctors which were supposed to cure disease br Homer illustrated Paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo and afterwards to other gods to Dionysus to Apollo Helios to Apollo s son Asclepius the healer About the th century BCE the paean became merely a formula of adulation its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered It was in this way that Apollo had become recognized as the god of music Apollo s role as the slayer of the Python led to his association with battle and victory hence it became the Roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when a fleet left the harbour and also after a victory had been won br In the Iliad Apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the Vedic god of disease Rudra He sends a plague to the Achaeans Knowing that Apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent they purify themselves in a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows called a hecatomb br br The Homeric Hymn to Apollo depicts Apollo as an intruder from the north The connection with the northern dwelling Dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month Apellaios in northwest Greek calendars The family festival was dedicated to Apollo Doric Apellaios is the month of these rites and Apellon is the megistos kouros the great Kouros However it can explain only the Doric type of the name which is connected with the Ancient Macedonian word pella Pella stone Stones played an important part in the cult of the god especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi Omphalos br br George Huxley regarded the identification of Apollo with the Minoan deity Paiawon worshipped in Crete to have originated at Delphi In the Homeric Hymn Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi where they evidently transferred their religious practices Apollo Delphinios or Delphidios was a sea god especially worshipped in Crete and in the islands Apollo s sister Artemis who was the Greek goddess of hunting is identified with Britomartis Diktynna the Minoan Mistress of the animals In her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the Master of the animals a bow wielding god of hunting whose name has been lost aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular Apollo br br A non Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship The name of Apollo s mother Leto has Lydian origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of Asia Minor The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from Anatolia which is the origin of Sibyl and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated Omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old Assyro Babylonian texts These rituals were spread into the empire of the Hittites and from there into Greece br Homer pictures Apollo on the side of the Trojans fighting against the Achaeans during the Trojan War He is pictured as a terrible god less trusted by the Greeks than other gods The god seems to be related to Appaliunas a tutelary god of Wilusa Troy in Asia Minor but the word is not complete The stones found in front of the gates of Homeric Troy were the symbols of Apollo A western Anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of Artimus Artemis and Q d ns whose name may be cognate with the Hittite and Doric forms in surviving Lydian texts However recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of Q d ns with Apollo br The Greeks gave to him the name agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column However while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated on the seventh day of the month and the emphasis given to that day sibutu indicates a Babylonian origin br br The Vedic Rudra has some similar functions to Apollo The terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of Shiva Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows but he was able to free people of them and his alternative Shiva is a healer physician god However the Indo European component of Apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens exorcisms and with the oracular cult br br br Unusually among the Olympic deities Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence Delos and Delphi In cult practice Delian Apollo and Pythian Apollo the Apollo of Delphi were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality Lycia was sacred to the god for this Apollo was also called Lycian Apollo s cult was already fully established when written sources commenced about BCE Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period and the frequency of theophoric names such as Apollodorus or Apollonios and cities named Apollonia testify to his popularity Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites In the nd and rd century CE those at Didyma and Claros pronounced the so called theological oracles in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all encompassing highest deity In the rd century Apollo fell silent Julian the Apostate tried to revive the Delphic oracle but failed br br Apollo had a famous oracle in Delphi and other notable ones in Claros and Didyma His oracular shrine in Abae in Phocis where he bore the toponymic epithet Abaeus Apollon Abaios was important enough to be consulted by Croesus br His oracular shrines include br br Abae in Phocis br Bassae in the Peloponnese br At Clarus on the west coast of Asia Minor as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a pneuma from which the priests drank br In Corinth the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of Tenea from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War br At Khyrse in Troad the temple was built for Apollo Smintheus br In Delos there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo during summer The Hieron Sanctuary of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake was the place where the god was said to have been born br In Delphi the Pythia became filled with the pneuma of Apollo said to come from a spring inside the Adyton br In Didyma an oracle on the coast of Anatolia south west of Lydian Luwian Sardis in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple Was believed to have been founded by Branchus son or lover of Apollo br In Hierapolis Bambyce Syria modern Manbij according to the treatise De Dea Syria the sanctuary of the Syrian Goddess contained a robed and bearded image of Apollo Divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image br At Patara in Lycia there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo said to have been the place where the god went from Delos As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman br In Segesta in Sicily br Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo br br In Oropus north of Athens the oracle Amphiaraus was said to be the son of Apollo Oropus also had a sacred spring br in Labadea miles km east of Delphi Trophonius another son of Apollo killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle br br Many temples were dedicated to Apollo in Greece and the Greek colonies They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of Greek architecture which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations Some of the earliest temples especially in Crete do not belong to any Greek order It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures The different wooden elements were considered divine and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of Doric order The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances The temples should be canonic and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms This probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics br The Doric order dominated during the th and the th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs which couldn t be solved without changing the original forms The order was almost abandoned for the Ionic order but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple Both orders were abandoned for the Corinthian order gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome br The most important temples are br br Thebes Greece The oldest temple probably dedicated to Apollo Ismenius was built in the th century BC It seems that it was a curvilinear building The Doric temple was built in the early th century BC but only some small parts have been found

were discovered in the th century and many of its architectural fragments were dispersed among private collections or reworked into new sculptures Parts of the temple s podium were rediscovered in br br In the myths Apollo is the son of Zeus the king of the gods and Leto his previous wife or one of his mistresses Apollo often appears in the myths plays and hymns either directly or indirectly through his oracles As Zeus favorite son he had direct access to the mind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans A divinity beyond human comprehension he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god br br Pregnant with the offsprings of Zeus Leto wandered through many lands wanting to give birth to Apollo However all the lands rejected her out of fear Upon reaching Delos Leto requested the island to shelter her and that in return her son would bring fame and prosperity to the island Delos then revealed to Leto that Apollo was rumoured to be the god who will greatly lord it among gods and men all over the fruitful earth For this reason all the lands were fearful and Delos feared that Apollo would cast her aside once he is born Hearing this Leto swore on the river Styx that if she is allowed to give birth on the island her son would honour Delos the most amongst all the other lands Assured by this Delos agreed to assist Leto All goddesses except Hera also came to aid Leto br However Hera had tricked Eileithyia the goddess of childbirth to stay on Olympus due to which Leto was unable to give birth The goddesses then convinced Iris to go bring Eileithyia by offering her a necklace of amber yards m long Iris did accordingly and persuaded Eileithyia to step onto the island Thus clutching a palm tree Leto finally gave birth after labouring for nine days and nine nights with Apollo leaping forth from his mother s womb The goddesses washed the newborn covered him in a white garment and fastened golden bands around him As Leto was unable to feed him Themis the goddess of divine law fed him nectar and ambrosia Upon tasting the divine food the child broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of lyre and archery and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind He then started to walk which caused the island to be filled with gold br br The island Delos used to be Asteria a goddess who jumped into the waters to escape the advances of Zeus and became a free floating island of the same name When Leto got pregnant Hera was told that Leto s son would become more dear to Zeus than Ares Enraged by this Hera watched over the heavens and sent out Ares and Iris to prevent Leto from giving birth on the earth Ares stationed over the mainland and Iris over the islands threatened all the lands and prevented them from helping Leto br When Leto arrived at Thebes fetal Apollo prophesied from his mother s womb that in the future he would punish a slanderous woman in Thebes Niobe so he did not want to be born there Leto then went to Thessaly and sought the help of the river nymphs who were the daughters of the river Peneus Though he was initially fearful and reluctant Peneus later decided to let Leto give birth in his waters He did not change his mind even when Ares produced a terrifying sound and threatened to hurl mountain peaks into the river But Leto herself declined his help and departed as she did not want him to suffer for her sake br After being turned away from various lands Apollo spoke again from the womb asking his mother to take look at the floating island in front of her and expressing his wish to be born there When Leto approached Asteria all the other islands fled But Asteria welcomed Leto without any fear of Hera Walking on the island she sat down against a palm tree and asked Apollo to be born During the childbirth swans circled the island seven times a sign that later on Apollo would play the seven stringed lyre When Apollo finally leapt forth from his mother s womb the nymphs of the island sang a hymn to Eileithyia that was heard to the heavens The moment Apollo was born the entire island including the trees and the waters became gold Asteria bathed the newborn swaddled him and fed him with her breast milk The island had become rooted and was later called Delos br Hera was no longer angry as Zeus had managed to calm her down and she held no grudge against Asteria since Asteria had rejected Zeus in the past br br Pindar is the earliest source who explicitly calls Apollo and Artemis as twins Here Asteria is also stated to be Leto s sister Wanting to escape Zeus advances she flung herself into the sea and became a floating rock called Ortygia until the twins were born When Leto stepped on the rock four pillars with adamantine bases rose from the earth and held up the rock When Apollo and Artemis were born their bodies shone radiantly and a chant was sung by Eileithyia and Lachesis one of the three Moirai br br Scorning the advances of Zeus Asteria transformed herself into a bird and jumped into a sea From her an island rose which was called Ortygia br When Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant with Zeus child she decreed that Leto can give birth only in a place where sun does not shine During this time the monster Python also started hounding Leto with an intent of killing her because he had foreseen his death coming at the hands of Leto s offspring However on Zeus orders Boreas carried away Leto and entrusted her to Poseidon To protect her Poseidon took her to the island Ortygia and covered it with waves so that the sun would not shine on it Leto gave birth clinging to an olive tree and henceforth the island was called Delos br br Other variations of Apollo s birth include br Aelian states that it took Leto twelve days and twelve nights to travel from Hyperborea to Delos Leto changed herself into a she wolf before giving birth This is given as the reason why Homer describes Apollo as the wolf born god br Libanius wrote that neither land nor visible islands would receive Leto but by the will of Zeus Delos then became visible and thus received Leto and the children br According to Strabo the Curetes helped Leto by creating loud noises with their weapons and thus frightening Hera they concealed Leto s childbirth br Theognis wrote that the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance when Apollo was born and the Earth laughed with joy br While in some accounts Apollo s birth itself fixed the floating Delos to the earth there are accounts of Apollo securing Delos to the bottom of the ocean a little while later br This island became sacred to Apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god br Apollo was born on the seventh day hebdomagenes of the month Thargelion according to Delian tradition or of the month Bysios according to Delphian tradition The seventh and twentieth the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him br The general consensus is that Artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo br br Hyperborea the mystical land of eternal spring venerated Apollo above all the gods The Hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted Pythian games There a vast forest of beautiful trees was called the garden of Apollo Apollo spent the winter months among the Hyperboreans leaving his shrine in Delphi under the care of Dionysus His absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death No prophecies were issued during this time He returned to the world during the beginning of the spring The Theophania festival was held in Delphi to celebrate his return br However Diodorus Silculus states that Apollo visited Hyperborea every nineteen years This nineteen year period was called by the Greeks as the year of Meton the time period in which the stars returned to their initial positions And that visiting Hyperborea at that time Apollo played on the cithara and danced continuously from the vernal equinox until the rising of the Pleiades constellations br Hyperborea was also Leto s birthplace It is said that Leto came to Delos from Hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves Henceforth Hyperborea became Apollo s winter home and wolves became sacred to him His intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet Lyceus meaning wolf like But Apollo was also the wolf slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators The Hyperborean worship of Apollo bears the strongest marks of Apollo being worshipped as the sun god Shamanistic elements in Apollo s cult are often liked to his Hyperborean origin and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman Shamans like Abaris and Aristeas were also the followers of Apollo who hailed from Hyperborea br In myths the tears of amber Apollo shed when his son Asclepius died mixed with the waters of the river Eridanos which surrounded Hyperborea Apollo also buried in Hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the Cyclopes He later gave this arrow to Abaris br br Growing up Apollo was nursed by the nymphs Korythalia and Aletheia the personification of truth Phoebe his grandmother gave the oracular shrine of Delphi to Apollo as a birthday gift br As a four year old child Apollo built a foundation and an altar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted Since he learnt the art of building when young he came to be known as Archegetes the founder of towns and guided men to build new cities To keep the child amused the Delian nymphs ran around the altar beating it and then with their hands tied behind their backs bit an olive branch It later became a custom for all the sailors who passed by the island to do the same br From his father Zeus Apollo received a golden headband and a chariot driven by swans br In his early years when Apollo spent his time herding cows he was reared by the Thriae who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills The god Pan was also said to mentored him in the prophetic art Apollo is also said to have invented the lyre and along with Artemis the art of archery He then taught the humans the art of healing and archery br br Soon after giving birth to her twins Leto fled from Delos fearing Hera Upon reaching Lycia her infants had drained all of their mother s milk and cried for more to satisfy their hunger The exhausted mother then tried drinking from a nearby lake but was stopped by some Lycian peasants When she begged them to let her quench her thirst the haughty peasants not only threatened her but also stirred the mud in the lake to dirty the waters Angered by this Leto turned them into frogs br In a slightly varied version Leto took her infants and crossed over to Lycia where she attempted to bathe her children in a spring she found there But the local herdsmen drove her away After that some wolves found Leto and guided her to the river Xanthos where Leto was able to bathe her children and quench her thirst She then returned to the spring and turned the herdsmen into frogs br br Python a chthonic serpent dragon was a child of Gaia and the guardian of the Delphic Oracle br In the Callimachus hymn to Delos fetal Apollo foresees the death of Python at his hands br In the Homeric hymn to Apollo Python was a female drakon and the nurse of the giant Typhon whom Hera had created to overthrow Zeus She was described as a terrifying monster and a bloody plague Apollo in his pursuit to establish his worship came across Python and killed her with a single arrow shot from his bow He let the corpse rot under the sun and declared himself the oracular deity of Delphi Other authors have Apollo kill the monster using a hundred arrows or a thousand arrows br br According to Euripides Leto had brought her twins to the cliffs of Parnassus shortly after giving birth to them Upon seeing the monster there Apollo still a child being carried in his mother s arms leapt forth and killed Python Some authors also mention that Python was killed for displaying lustful affections towards Leto br In another account Python chased pregnant Leto with an intent of killing her because his death was fated to come at the hands of Leto s child However he had to stop the chase when Leto came under the protection of Poseidon After his birth four days old Apollo killed the serpent with the bow and arrows gifted to him by Hephaestus and avenged the trouble given to his mother The god then put the bones of the slain monster in a cauldron and deposited it in his temple br This legend is also narrated as the origin of the cry Hi paian According to Athenaeus Pyhton attacked Leto and her twins during their visit to Delphi Taking Artemis into her arms Leto climbed upon a rock and cried at Apollo to shoot the monster The cry let out by her Shoot boy later got slightly altered as Hi paian an exclamation to avert evils Callimachus attributes the origin of this phrase to the Delphians who let out the cry to encourage Apollo when the young god battled with Python br Strabo has recorded a slightly different version where Python was actually a cruel and lawless man who was also known by the name Drakon When Apollo was teaching the humans to cultivate fruits and civilise themselves the residents of Parnassus complained to the god about Python In response to their pleas Apollo killed the man with his arrows During the fight the Parnassians shouted Hi paian to encourage the god br br Continuing from his victory over Python the Homeric hymn describes how the young god established his worship among the humans As Apollo was pondering about what kind of men he should recruit to serve him he spotted a ship full of Cretan merchants or pirates He took the form of a dolphin and sprang aboard the ship Whenever the oblivious crew members tried throwing the dolphin overboard the god shook the ship until the crew was awed into submission Apollo then created a breeze that directed the ship to Delphi Upon reaching the land he revealed himself as a god and initiated them as his priests He instructed them to guard his temple and always keep righteousness in their hearts br Alcaeus narrates the following account Zeus who had adorned his newborn son with a golden headband also provided him with a chariot driven by swans and instructed Apollo to visit Delphi to establish his laws among the people But Apollo disobeyed his father and went to the land of Hyperborea The Delphians continuously sung paeans in his honour and pleaded him to come back to them The god returned only after a year and then carried out Zeus orders br In other variations the shrine at Delphi was simply handed over to Apollo by his grandmother Phoebe as a gift or Themis herself inspired him to be the oracular voice of Delphi br br However in many other accounts Apollo had to overcome certain obstacles before he was able to establish himself at Delphi Gaea came in conflict with Apollo for killing Python and claiming the Delphic oracle for himself According to Pindar she sought to banish Apollo to Tartarus as a punishment According to Euripides soon after Apollo took the ownership of the oracle Gaea started sending prophetic dreams to the humans As a result people stopped visiting Delphi to obtain prophecies Troubled by this Apollo went to Olympus and supplicated to Zeus Zeus admiring the ambitions of his young son granted his request by putting an end to the dream visions This sealed the role of Apollo as the oracular deity of Delphi br Since Apollo had committed a blood crime he also had to be purified Pausanias has recorded two of the many variations of this purification In one of them both Apollo and Artemis fled to Sicyon and were purified there In the other tradition that had been prevalent among the Cretans Apollo alone travelled to Crete and was purified by Carmanor In another account the Argive king Crotopus was the one who performed the purification rites on Apollo alone br According the Aristonous and Aelian Apollo was purified by the will of Zeus in the Vale of Tempe Aristonous has continued the tale saying that Apollo was escorted back to Delphi by Athena As a token of gratitude he later built a temple for Athena at Delphi which served as a threshold for his own temple Upon reaching Delphi Apollo convinced Gaea and Themis into handing over the seat of oracle to him To celebrate this event other immortals also graced Apollo with gifts Poseidon gave him the land of Delphi the Delphian nymphs gifted him the Corycian cave and Artemis set her dogs to patrol and safeguard the land br Some others have also said that Apollo was exiled and subjected to servitude under king Admetus as a means of punishment for the murder he had committed It was when he was serving as a cowherd under Admetus that the theft of the cattle by Hermes happened The servitude was said to have lasted for either one year or one great year a cycle of eight years or nine years br Plutarch however has mentioned a variation where Apollo was neither purified in Tempe nor banished to Earth as a servant for nine years but was driven out to another world for nine great years The god who returned was cleansed and purified thus becoming a true Phoebus that is to say clear and bright He then took over the Delphic oracle which had been under the care of Themis in his absence Henceforth Apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder made men aware of their guilt and purified them br The Pythian games were also established by Apollo either as funeral games to honor Python or to celebrate his own victory The Pythia was Apollo s high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies br br Tityus was another giant who tried to rape Leto either on his own accord when she was on her way to Delphi or at the order of Hera Leto called upon on her children who instantly slew the giant Apollo still a young boy shot him with his arrows In some accounts Artemis also joined him in protecting their mother by attacking Tityos with her arrows For this act he was banished to Tartarus and there he was pegged to the rock floor and stretched on an area of acres m while a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver or his heart br Another account recorded by Strabo says that Tityus was not a giant but a lawless man whom Apollo killed at the request of the residents br br Admetus was the king of Pherae who was known for his hospitality When Apollo was exiled from Olympus for killing Python he served as a herdsman under Admetus who was then young and unmarried Apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with Admetus during his stay After completing his years of servitude Apollo went back to Olympus as a god br Because Admetus had treated Apollo well the god conferred great benefits on him in return Apollo s mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins Apollo helped Admetus win the hand of Alcestis the daughter of King Pelias by taming a lion and a boar to draw Admetus chariot He was present during their wedding to give his blessings When Admetus angered the goddess Artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings Apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister When Apollo learnt of Admetus untimely death he convinced or tricked the Fates into letting Admetus live past his time br According to another version or perhaps some years later when Zeus struck down Apollo s son Asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead Apollo in revenge killed the Cyclopes who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus Apollo would have been banished to Tartarus for this but his mother Leto intervened and reminding Zeus of their old love pleaded with him not to kill their son Zeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year of hard labor once again under Admetus br The love between Apollo and Admetus was a favored topic of Roman poets like Ovid and Servius br br The fate of Niobe was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto s womb Niobe was the queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion She displayed hubris when she boasted that she was superior to Leto because she had fourteen children Niobids seven male and seven female while Leto had only two She further mocked Apollo s effeminate appearance and Artemis manly appearance Leto insulted by this told her children to punish Niobe Accordingly Apollo killed Niobe s sons and Artemis her daughters According to some versions of the myth among the Niobids Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto Amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge br A devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylos in Asia Minor and turned into stone as she wept Her tears formed the river Achelous Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them br When Chloris married and had children Apollo granted her son Nestor the years he had taken away from the Niobids Hence Nestor was able to live for generations br br Once Apollo and Poseidon served under the Trojan king Laomedon in accordance with Zeus words Apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris Apollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of Mount Ida while Poseidon built the walls of Troy Other versions make both Apollo and Poseidon the builders of the wall In Ovid s account Apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre br In Pindar s odes the gods took a mortal named Aeacus as their assistant When the work was completed three snakes rushed against the wall and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus Apollo immediately prophesied that Troy would fall at the hands of Aeacus s descendants the Aeacidae i e his son Telamon joined Heracles when he sieged the city during Laomedon s rule Later his great grandson Neoptolemus was present in the wooden horse that leads to the downfall of Troy br However the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised but also threatened to bind their feet and hands and sell them as slaves Angered by the unpaid labour and the insults Apollo infected the city with a pestilence and Poseidon sent the sea monster Cetus To deliver the city from it Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter Hesione who would later be saved by Heracles br During his stay in Troy Apollo had a lover named Ourea who was a nymph and daughter of Poseidon Together they had a son named Ileus whom Apollo loved dearly br br Apollo sided with the Trojans during the Trojan War waged by the Greeks against the Trojans br During the war the Greek king Agamemnon captured Chryseis the daughter of Apollo s priest Chryses and refused to return her Angered by this Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment He demanded that they return the girl and the Achaeans Greeks complied indirectly causing the anger of Achilles which is the theme of the Iliad br br Receiving the aegis from Zeus Apollo entered the battlefield as per his father s command causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry He pushed the Greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers He is described as the rouser of armies because he rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart br When Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel However Apollo declined to fight him saying that he would not fight his uncle for the sake of mortals br br When the Greek hero Diomedes injured the Trojan hero Aeneas Aphrodite tried to rescue him but Diomedes injured her as well Apollo then enveloped Aeneas in a cloud to protect him He repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain from attacking a god Aeneas was then taken to Pergamos a sacred spot in Troy where he was healed br After the death of Sarpedon a son of Zeus Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father s wish and cleaned it He then gave it to Sleep Hypnos and Death Thanatos Apollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that day so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while br br The Trojan hero Hector who according to some was the god s own son by Hecuba was favored by Apollo When he got severely injured Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms During a duel with Achilles when Hector was about to lose Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him When the Greek warrior Patroclus tried to get into the fort of Troy he was stopped by Apollo Encouraging Hector to attack Patroclus Apollo stripped the armour of the Greek warrior and broke his weapons Patroclus was eventually killed by Hector At last after Hector s fated death Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse shielding it from the rays of the sun br Apollo held a grudge against Achilles throughout the war because Achilles had murdered his son Tenes before the war began and brutally assassinated his son Troilus in his own temple Not only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles he also tricked Achilles by disguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates He foiled Achilles attempt to mutilate Hector s dead body br Finally Apollo caused Achilles death by guiding an arrow shot by Paris into Achilles heel In some versions Apollo himself killed Achilles by taking the disguise of Paris br Apollo helped many Trojan warriors including Agenor Polydamas Glaucus in the battlefield Though he greatly favored the Trojans Apollo was bound to follow the orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war br br Apollo Kourotrophos is the god who nurtures and protects children and the young especially boys He oversees their education and their passage into adulthood Education is said to have originated from Apollo and the Muses Many myths have him train his children It was a custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to Apollo after reaching adulthood br Chiron the abandoned centaur was fostered by Apollo who instructed him in medicine prophecy archery and more Chiron would later become a great teacher himself br Asclepius in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts from his father However he was later entrusted to Chiron for further education br Anius Apollo s son by Rhoeo was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth Apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts Anius later became the priest of Apollo and the king of Delos br Iamus was the son of Apollo and Evadne When Evadne went into

him many arts including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds br Idmon was educated by Apollo to be a seer Even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the Argonauts he embraced his destiny and died a brave death To commemorate his son s bravery Apollo commanded Boeotians to build a town around the tomb of the hero and to honor him br Apollo adopted Carnus the abandoned son of Zeus and Europa He reared the child with the help of his mother Leto and educated him to be a seer br When his son Melaneus reached the age of marriage Apollo asked the princess Stratonice to be his son s bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed br Apollo saved a shepherd boy name unknown from death in a large deep cave by means of vultures To thank him the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius br br Immediately after his birth Apollo demanded a lyre and invented the paean thus becoming the god of music As the divine singer he is the patron of poets singers and musicians The invention of string music is attributed to him Plato said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music rhythm and harmony is the gift of Apollo and the Muses According to Socrates ancient Greeks believed that Apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together both for the gods and the humans For this reason he was called Homopolon before the Homo was replaced by A Apollo s harmonious music delivered people from their pain and hence like Dionysus he is also called the liberator The swans which were considered to be the most musical among the birds were believed to be the singers of Apollo They are Apollo s sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to Hyperborea Aelian says that when the singers would sing hymns to Apollo the swans would join the chant in unison br br Among the Pythagoreans the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of Apollo their principal deity Their belief was that music purifies the soul just as medicine purifies the body They also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos evolving into an idea known as the music of the spheres br Apollo appears as the companion of the Muses and as Musagetes leader of Muses he leads them in dance They spend their time on Parnassus which is one of their sacred places Apollo is also the lover of the Muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like Orpheus and Linus br Apollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the lyre In his role as the god of banquets he was always present to play music at weddings of the gods like the marriage of Eros and Psyche Peleus and Thetis He is a frequent guest of the Bacchanalia and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the maenads and satyrs Apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others He was the victor in all those contests but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their hubris br br The invention of the lyre is attributed either to Hermes or to Apollo himself Distinctions have been made that Hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell whereas the lyre Apollo invented was a regular lyre br Myths tell that the infant Hermes stole a number of Apollo s cows and took them to a cave in the woods near Pylos covering their tracks In the cave he found a tortoise and killed it then removed the insides He used one of the cow s intestines and the tortoise shell and made his lyre br br Upon discovering the theft Apollo confronted Hermes and asked him to return his cattle When Hermes acted innocent Apollo took the matter to Zeus Zeus having seen the events sided with Apollo and ordered Hermes to return the cattle Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented Apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre Hence Apollo then became the master of the lyre br According to other versions Apollo had invented the lyre himself whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to Marsyas Hermes lyre therefore would be a reinvention br br Once Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest The mountain god Tmolus was chosen to umpire Pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower Midas who happened to be present Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre It was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo and everyone was pleased with the judgement Only Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award Apollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of a donkey br br Marsyas was a satyr who was punished by Apollo for his hubris He had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by Athena because it made her cheeks puffy Athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished When Marsyas played the flute everyone became frenzied with joy This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo and he challenged the god to a musical contest The contest was judged by the Muses or the nymphs of Nysa Athena was also present to witness the contest br Marsyas taunted Apollo for wearing his hair long for having a fair face and smooth body for his skill in so many arts He also further said br br His Apollo hair is smooth and made into tufts and curls that fall about his brow and hang before his face His body is fair from head to foot his limbs shine bright his tongue gives oracles and he is equally eloquent in prose or verse propose which you will What of his robes so fine in texture so soft to the touch aglow with purple What of his lyre that flashes gold gleams white with ivory and shimmers with rainbow gems What of his song so cunning and so sweet Nay all these allurements suit with naught save luxury To virtue they bring shame alone br The Muses and Athena sniggered at this comment The contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could do whatever he wanted to the loser br br According to one account after the first round they both were deemed equal by the Nysiads But in the next round Apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance Marsyas argued against this saying that Apollo would have an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating But Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute which needed air blown from the throat it was similar to singing and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all The nymphs decided that Apollo s argument was just Apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time mesmerising the audience Marsyas could not do this Apollo was declared the winner and angered with Marsyas haughtiness and his accusations decided to flay the satyr br br According to another account Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat Out of shame he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument upside down Marsyas could not do this with his instrument So the Muses who were the judges declared Apollo the winner Apollo hung Marsyas from a tree to flay him br Apollo flayed the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near Celaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god He then gave the rest of his body for proper burial and nailed Marsyas flayed skin to a nearby pine tree as a lesson to the others Marsyas blood turned into the river Marsyas But Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away The lyre was later discovered by the Muses and Apollo s sons Linus and Orpheus The Muses fixed the middle string Linus the string struck with the forefinger and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it They took it back to Apollo but the god who had decided to stay away from music for a while laid away both the lyre and the pipes at Delphi and joined Cybele in her wanderings to as far as Hyperborea br br Cinyras was a ruler of Cyprus who was a friend of Agamemnon Cinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan war but did not keep his promise Agamemnon cursed Cinyras He invoked Apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise Apollo then had a lyre playing contest with Cinyras and defeated him Either Cinyras committed suicide when he lost or was killed by Apollo br br Apollo functions as the patron and protector of sailors one of the duties he shares with Poseidon In the myths he is seen helping heroes who pray to him for a safe journey br When Apollo spotted a ship of

brothers and separated them He reprimanded Heracles for this act of violation and asked Apollo to give a solution to Heracles Apollo then ordered the hero to serve under Omphale queen of Lydia for one year in order to purify himself br After their reconciliation Apollo and Heracles together founded the city of Gythion br br A long time ago there were three kinds of human beings male descended from the sun female descended from the earth and androgynous descended from the moon Each human being was completely round with four arms and four legs two identical faces on opposite sides of a head with four ears and all else to match They were powerful and unruly Otis and Ephialtes even dared to scale Mount Olympus br To check their insolence Zeus devised a plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them He cut them all in two and asked Apollo to make necessary repairs giving humans the individual shape they still have now Apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds he pulled together their skin at the abdomen and sewed the skin together at the middle of it This is what we call navel today He smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest But he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment br br As he Zeus cut them one after another he bade Apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn Apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and compose their forms So Apollo gave a turn to the face and pulled the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly like the purses which draw in and he made one mouth at the centre of the belly which he fastened in a knot the same which is called the navel he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last he left a few wrinkles however in the region of the belly and navel as a memorial of the primeval state br br Leukatas was believed to be a white colored rock jutting out from the island of Leukas into the sea It was present in the sanctuary of Apollo Leukates A leap from this rock was believed to have put an end to the longings of love br Once Aphrodite fell deeply in love with Adonis a young man of great beauty who was later accidentally killed by a boar Heartbroken Aphrodite wandered looking for the rock of Leukas When she reached the sanctuary of Apollo in Argos she confided in him her love and sorrow Apollo then brought her to the rock of Leukas and asked her to throw herself from the top of the rock She did so and was freed from her love When she sought the reason behind this Apollo told her that Zeus before taking another lover would sit on this rock to free himself from his love for Hera br Another tale relates that a man named Nireus who fell in love with the cult statue of Athena came to the rock and jumped in order to relieve himself After jumping he fell into the net of a fisherman in which when he was pulled out he found a box filled with gold He fought with the fisherman and took the gold but Apollo appeared to him in the night in a dream and warned him not to appropriate gold which belonged to others br It was an ancestral custom among the Leukadians to fling a criminal from this rock every year at the sacrifice performed in honor of Apollo for the sake of averting evil However a number of men would be stationed all around below rock to catch the criminal and take him out of the borders in order to exile him from the island This was the same rock from which according to a legend Sappho took her suicidal leap br br Once Hera out of spite aroused the Titans to war against Zeus and take away his throne Accordingly when the Titans tried to climb Mount Olympus Zeus with the help of Apollo Artemis and Athena defeated them and cast them into Tartarus br br Apollo is said to have been the lover of all nine Muses and not being able to choose one of them

of Apollo s favourite lovers The pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous Zephyrus and struck Hyacinthus in the head killing him instantly Apollo is said to be filled with grief Out of Hyacinthus blood Apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection meaning alas He was later resurrected and taken to heaven The festival Hyacinthia was a national celebration of Sparta which commemorated the death and rebirth of Hyacinthus br Another male lover was Cyparissus a descendant of Heracles Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth Cyparissus was so saddened by its death that he asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever Apollo granted the request by turning him into the Cypress named after him which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk br br Admetus the king of Pherae was also Apollo s lover During his exile which lasted either for one year or nine years Apollo served Admetus as a herdsman The romantic nature of their relationship was first described by Callimachus of Alexandria who wrote that Apollo was fired with love for Admetus Plutarch lists Admetus as one of Apollo s lovers and says that Apollo served Admetus because he doted upon him Latin poet Ovid in his Ars Amatoria said that even though he was a god Apollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of Admetus Tibullus describes Apollo s love to the king as servitium amoris slavery of love and asserts that Apollo became his servant not by force but by choice He would also make cheese and serve it to Admetus His domestic actions caused embarrassment to his family br br Oh how often his sister Diana blushed at meeting her brother as he carried a young calf through the fields often Latona lamented when she saw her son s disheveled locks which were admired even by Juno his step mother br When Admetus wanted to marry princess Alcestis Apollo provided a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed This

Apollo fostered and educated Chiron the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods including Apollo s sons Apollo also fostered Carnus the son of Zeus and Europa br br Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination br br Daphne was a nymph who scorned Apollo s advances and ran away from him When Apollo chased her in order to persuade her she changed herself into a laurel tree According to other versions she cried for help during the chase and Gaia helped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place According to Roman poet Ovid the chase was brought about by Cupid who hit Apollo with a golden arrow of love and Daphne with a leaden arrow of hatred The myth explains the origin of the laurel and the connection of Apollo with the laurel and its leaves which his priestess employed at Delphi The leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths were given to the victors of the Pythian games br Marpessa was kidnapped by Idas but was loved by Apollo as well Zeus made her choose between them and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo being immortal would tire of her when she grew old br Sinope a nymph was approached by the amorous Apollo She made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin Apollo kept his promise and went back br Bolina was admired by Apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea To avoid her death Apollo turned her into a nymph saving her life br Castalia was a nymph whom Apollo loved She fled from him and dove into the spring at Delphi at the base of Mt Parnassos which was then named after her Water from this spring was sacred it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses br Cassandra was a daughter of Hecuba and Priam Apollo wished to court her Cassandra promised to return his love on one condition he should give her the power to see the future Apollo fulfilled her wish but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after Angered that she broke her promise Apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future no one would ever believe her prophecies br The Sibyl of Cumae like Cassandra promised Apollo her love if he would give her a boon The Sibyl took a handful of sand and asked Apollo to grant her years of life as many as the grains of sand she held in her hands Apollo granted her wish but Sibyl went back on her word Although Sibyl did live an extended life as Apollo had promised he did not give her agelessness along with it so she shrivelled and shrank and only her voice remained br Hestia the goddess of the hearth rejected both Apollo s and Poseidon s marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried br In one version of the prophet Tiresias s origins he was originally a woman who promised Apollo to sleep with him if he would give her music lessons Apollo gave her her wish but then she went back on her word and refused him Apollo in anger turned her into a man br br Artemis as the sister of Apollo is thea apollousa that is she as a female divinity represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity In the pre Hellenic period their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo However this relationship was never sexual but spiritual which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the Hellenic period br Artemis like her brother is armed with a bow and arrows She is the cause of sudden deaths of women She also is the protector of the young especially girls Though she has nothing to do with oracles music or poetry she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang The laurel daphne was sacred to both Artemis Daphnaia had her temple among the Lacedemonians at a place called Hypsoi br Apollo Daphnephoros had a temple in Eretria a place where the citizens are to take the oaths In later times when Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or Helios Artemis was naturally regarded as Selene or the moon br br Hecate the goddess of witchcraft and magic is the chthonic counterpart of Apollo They both are cousins since their mothers Leto and Asteria are sisters One of Apollo s epithets Hecatos is the masculine form of Hecate and both names mean working from afar While Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven Hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness If Hecate is the gate keeper Apollo Agyieus is the door keeper Hecate is the goddess of crossroads and Apollo is the god and protector of streets br br The oldest evidence found for Hecate s worship is at Apollo s temple in Miletos There Hecate was taken to be Apollo s sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis Hecate s lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements at the same time Apollo s solar nature br br As a deity of knowledge and great power Apollo was seen being the male counterpart of Athena Being Zeus favorite children they were given more powers and duties Apollo and Athena often took up the role of protectors of cities and were patrons of some of the important cities Athena was the principal goddess of Athens Apollo was the principal god of Sparta br As patrons of arts Apollo and Athena were companions of the Muses the former a much more frequent companion than the latter Apollo was sometimes called the son of Athena and Hephaestus br In the Trojan War as Zeus executive Apollo is seen holding the aegis like Athena usually does Apollo s decisions were usually approved by his sister Athena and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by Zeus br br In Aeschylus Oresteia trilogy Clytemnestra kills her husband King Agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia to proceed forward with the Trojan war Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon s son Orestes is to kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus her lover Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge and consequently Orestes is pursued by the Erinyes or Furies female personifications of vengeance br Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the matricide was justified Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage They invade his temple and he drives them away He says that the matter should be brought before Athena Apollo promises to protect Orestes as Orestes has become Apollo s supplicant Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo br br The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks As a quintessentially Greek god Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent although later Roman poets often referred to him as Phoebus There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of Rome during the reign of Tarquinius Superbus br On the occasion of a pestilence in the s BCE Apollo s first temple at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the Apollinare During the Second Punic War in BCE the Ludi Apollinares Apollonian Games were instituted in his honor on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius In the time of Augustus who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome br After the Battle of Actium which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo Augustus enlarged Apollo s temple dedicated a portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour He also erected a new temple to the god on the Palatine hill Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and Diana formed the culmination of the Secular Games held in BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era br br The chief Apollonian festival was the Pythian Games held every four years at Delphi and was one of the four great Panhellenic Games Also of major importance was the Delia held every four years on Delos br Athenian annual festivals included the Boedromia Metageitnia Pyanepsia and Thargelia br Spartan annual festivals were the Carneia and the Hyacinthia br Thebes every nine years held the Daphnephoria br br Apollo s most common attributes were the bow and arrow Other attributes of his included the kithara an advanced version of the common lyre the plectrum and the sword Another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers The Pythian Games were held in Apollo s honor every four years at Delphi The bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games br br The palm tree was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in Delos Animals sacred to Apollo included wolves dolphins roe deer swans cicadas symbolizing music and song ravens hawks crows Apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers snakes referencing Apollo s function as the god of prophecy mice and griffins mythical eagle lion hybrids of Eastern origin br Homer and Porphyry wrote that Apollo had a hawk as his messenger In many myths Apollo is transformed into a hawk In addition Claudius Aelianus wrote that in Ancient Egypt people believed that hawks were sacred to the god and that according to the ministers of Apollo in Egypt there were certain men called hawk keepers who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god Eusebius wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of Apollo in Egypt and that the city s symbol is a man with a hawklike face Horus Claudius Aelianus wrote that Egyptians called Apollo Horus in their own language br br As god of colonization Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization BCE According to Greek tradition he helped Cretan or Arcadian colonists found the city of Troy However this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction Hittite cuneiform texts mention an Asia Minor god called Appaliunas or Apalunas in connection with the city of Wilusa attested in Hittite inscriptions which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek Ilion by most scholars In this interpretation Apollo s title of Lykegenes can simply be read as born in Lycia which effectively severs the god s supposed link with wolves possibly a folk etymology br In literary contexts Apollo represents harmony order and reason characteristics contrasted with those of Dionysus god of wine who represents ecstasy and disorder The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives Apollonian and Dionysian However the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when Apollo at winter left for Hyperborea he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the Borghese Vase br Apollo is often associated with the Golden Mean This is the Greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony br In antiquity Apollo was associated with the planet Mercury The ancient Greeks believed that Mercury as observed during the morning was a different planet than the one during the evening because each twilight Mercury would appear farther from the Sun as it set than it had the night before The morning planet was called Apollo and the one at evening Hermes Mercury before they realised they were the same thereupon the name Mercury Hermes was kept and Apollo was dropped br br Apollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the Renaissance The earliest Greek word for a statue is delight agalma and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision Maurice Bowra notices that the Greek artist puts into a god the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings but they also embodied in concrete form issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought br The naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body which was essentially a religious activity The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment The statues of Apollo and the other gods present them in their full youth and strength In the balance and relation of their limbs such figures express their whole character mental and physical and reveal their central being the radiant reality of youth in its heyday br br Numerous free standing statues of male youths from Archaic Greece exist and were once thought to be representations of Apollo though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals In V I Leonardos proposed the term kouros male youth to refer to those from Keratea this usage was later expanded by Henri Lechat in to cover all statues of this format br The earliest examples of life sized statues of Apollo may be two figures from the Ionic sanctuary on the island of Delos Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios Boeotia alone Significantly more rare are the life sized bronze statues One of the few originals which survived into the present day so rare that its discovery in was described as a miracle by Ernst Homann Wedeking is the masterpiece bronze Piraeus Apollo It was found in Piraeus a port city close to Athens and is believed to have come from north eastern Peloponnesus It is the only surviving large scale Peloponnesian statue br br The famous Apollo of Mantua and its variants are early forms of the Apollo Citharoedus statue type in which the god holds the cithara a sophisticated seven stringed variant of the lyre in his left arm While none of the Greek originals have survived several Roman copies from approximately the late st or early nd century exist of which an example is the Apollo Barberini br br Apollo as a handsome beardless young man is often depicted with a cithara as Apollo Citharoedus or bow in his hand or reclining on a tree the Apollo Lykeios and Apollo Sauroctonos types The Apollo Belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late th century for centuries it epitomized the ideals of Classical Antiquity for Europeans from the Renaissance through the th century The marble is a Hellenistic or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor Leochares made between and BCE br The life size so called Adonis found in on the site of a villa suburbana near the Via Labicana in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars In the late nd century CE floor mosaic from El Djem Roman Thysdrus he is identifiable as Apollo Helios by his effulgent halo though now even a god s divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later Empire br Another haloed Apollo in mosaic from Hadrumentum is in the museum at Sousse The conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted large eyed curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the rd century BCE to depict Alexander the Great Some time after this mosaic was executed the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed br br Apollo often appears in modern and popular culture due to his status as the god of music dance and poetry br br Apollo has featured in dance and music in modern culture Percy Bysshe Shelley composed a Hymn of Apollo and the god s instruction of the Muses formed the subject of Igor Stravinsky s Apollon musag te In the Canadian band Rush released an album with songs Apollo Bringer of Wisdom Dionysus Bringer of Love br br Apollo has been portrayed in modern literature such as when Charles Handy in Gods of Management uses Greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organizational culture Apollo represents a role culture where order reason and bureaucracy prevail In author Rick Riordan published the first book in the Trials of Apollo series publishing four other books in the series in and br br Apollo has been depicted in modern films for instance by Keith David in the animated feature film Hercules by Luke Evans in the action film Clash of the Titans and by Dimitri Lekkos in the film Percy Jackson the Olympians The Lightning Thief br br Apollo has appeared in many modern video games Apollo appears as a minor character in Santa Monica Studio s action adventure game God of War III with his bow being used by Peirithous He also appears in the Hi Rez Studios Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game Smite as a playable character br br In the philosophical discussion of the arts a distinction is sometimes made between the Apollonian and Dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity Friedrich Nietzsche argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable Psychologist Carl Jung s Apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over intellectualise and maintain emotional distance br br In spaceflight the s and s NASA program for orbiting and landing astronauts
