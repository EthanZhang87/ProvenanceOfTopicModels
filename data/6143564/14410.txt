Hermes Greek is an Olympian deity in ancient Greek religion and mythology considered the herald of the gods He is also widely considered the protector of human heralds travelers thieves merchants and orators He is able to move quickly and freely between the worlds of the mortal and the divine aided by his winged sandals Hermes plays the role of the psychopomp or soul guide a conductor of souls into the afterlife br In myth Hermes functions as the emissary and messenger of the gods and is often presented as the son of Zeus and Maia the Pleiad He is regarded as the divine trickster about which the Homeric Hymn to Hermes offers the most well known account br Hermes attributes and symbols include the herma the rooster the tortoise satchel or pouch talaria winged sandals and winged helmet or simple petasos as well as the palm tree goat the number four several kinds of fish and incense However his main symbol is the caduceus a winged staff intertwined with two snakes copulating and carvings of the other gods br In Roman mythology and religion many of Hermes characteristics belong to Mercury a name derived from the Latin merx meaning merchandise and the origin of the words merchant and commerce br br The earliest form of the name Hermes is the Mycenaean Greek herm h s written e ma a e ma ha in the Linear B syllabic script Most scholars derive Hermes from Greek herma stone heap br The etymology of itself is unknown but is probably not a Proto Indo European word R S P Beekes rejects the connection with herma and suggests a Pre Greek origin However the stone etymology is also linked to Indo European ser to bind put together Scholarly speculation that Hermes derives from a more primitive form meaning one cairn is disputed Other scholars have suggested that Hermes may be a cognate of the Vedic Sarama br It is likely that Hermes is a pre Hellenic god though the exact origins of his worship and its original nature remain unclear Frothingham thought the god to have existed as a Mesopotamian snake god similar or identical to Ningishzida a god who served as mediator between humans and the divine especially Ishtar and who was depicted in art as a Caduceus Angelo thinks Hermes to be based on the Thoth archetype The absorbing combining of the attributes of Hermes to Thoth developed after the time of Homer amongst Greeks and Romans Herodotus was the first to identify the Greek god with the Egyptian Hermopolis Plutarch and Diodorus also did so although Plato thought the gods were dissimilar Friedlander br His cult was established in Greece in remote regions likely making him originally a god of nature farmers and shepherds It is also possible that since the beginning he has been a deity with shamanic attributes linked to divination reconciliation magic sacrifices and initiation and contact with other planes of existence a role of mediator between the worlds of the visible and invisible According to a theory that has received considerable scholarly acceptance Hermes originated as a form of the god Pan who has been identified as a reflex of the Proto Indo European pastoral god P h us n in his aspect as the god of boundary markers The PIE root peh protect also shows up in Latin pastor shepherd whence the English pastoral A zero grade of the full PIE form ph us n yields the name of the Sanskrit psychopomp Pushan who like Pan is associated with goats Later the epithet supplanted the original name itself and Hermes took over the role of psychopomp and as god of messengers travelers and boundaries which had originally belonged to Pan while Pan himself continued to be venerated by his original name in his more rustic aspect as the god of the wild in the relatively isolated mountainous region of Arcadia In later myths after the cult of Pan was reintroduced to Attica Pan was said to be Hermes son br br The image of Hermes evolved and varied along with Greek art and culture In Archaic Greece he was usually depicted as a mature man bearded and dressed as a traveler herald or shepherd This image remained common on the Hermai which served as boundary markers roadside markers and grave markers as well as votive offerings br In Classical and Hellenistic Greece Hermes was usually depicted as a young athletic man lacking a beard When represented as Logios Greek speaker his attitude is consistent with the attribute Phidias left a statue of a famous Hermes Logios and Praxiteles another also well known showing him with the baby Dionysus in his arms br br At all times however through the Hellenistic periods Roman and throughout Western history into the present day several of his characteristic objects are present as identification but not always all together Among these objects is a wide brimmed hat the petasos widely used by rural people of antiquity to protect themselves from the sun and that in later times was adorned with a pair of small wings sometimes this hat is not present and may have been replaced with wings rising from the hair br br Another object is the caduceus a staff with two intertwined snakes sometimes crowned with a pair of wings and a sphere The caduceus historically appeared with Hermes and is documented among the Babylonians from about BC Two snakes coiled around a staff was also a symbol of the god Ningishzida who like Hermes served as a mediator between humans and the divine specifically the goddess Ishtar or the supreme Ningirsu In Greece other gods have been depicted holding a caduceus but it was mainly associated with Hermes It was said to have the power to make people fall asleep or wake up and also made peace between litigants and is a visible sign of his authority being used as a sceptre A similar appearing but distinct symbol is the Rod of Asclepius associated with the patron of medicine and son of Apollo Asclepius which bears only one snake The Rod of Asclepius occasionally conflated with the caduceus in modern times is used by most Western physicians as a badge of their profession After the Renaissance the caduceus also appeared in the heraldic crests of several and currently is a symbol of commerce br Hermes sandals called p dila by the Greeks and talaria by the Romans were made of palm and myrtle branches but were described as beautiful golden and immortal made a sublime art able to take the roads with the speed of wind Originally they had no wings but late in the artistic representations they are depicted In certain images the wings spring directly from the ankles Hermes has also been depicted with a purse or a bag in his hands wearing a robe or cloak which had the power to confer invisibility His weapon was a harpe which killed Argos it was also lent to Perseus to kill Medusa and Cetus br br Hermes began as a god with strong chthonic or underworld associations He was a psychopomp leader of souls along the road between the Under and the Upper world This function gradually expanded to encompass roads in general and from there to boundaries travelers sailors commerce and travel itself br br Beginning with the earliest records of his worship Hermes has been understood as a chthonic deity heavily associated with the earth and or underworld As a chthonic deity the worship of Hermes also included an aspect relating to fertility with the phallus being included among his major symbols The inclusion of phallic imagery associated with Hermes and placed in the form of herma at the entrances to households may reflect a belief in ancient times that Hermes was a symbol of the household s fertility specifically the potency of the male head of the household in producing children br br The association between Hermes and the underworld is related to his function as a god of boundaries the boundary between life and death but he is considered a psychopomp a deity who helps guide souls of the deceased to the afterlife and his image was commonly depicted on gravestones in classical Greece br br In Ancient Greece Hermes was a phallic god of boundaries His name in the form herma was applied to a wayside marker pile of stones and each traveler added a stone to the pile In the th century BC Hipparchus the son of Pisistratus replaced the cairns that marked the midway point between each village deme at the central agora of Athens with a square or rectangular pillar of stone or bronze topped by a bust of a bearded Hermes An erect phallus rose from the base In the more primitive Mount Kyllini or Cyllenian herms the standing stone or wooden pillar was simply a carved phallus That a monument of this kind could be transformed into an Olympian god is astounding Walter Burkert remarked In Athens herms were placed outside houses both as a form of protection for the home a symbol of male fertility and as a link between the household and its gods with the gods of the wider community br In BC on the night when the Athenian fleet was about to set sail for Syracuse during the Peloponnesian War all of the Athenian hermai were vandalized The Athenians at the time believed it was the work of saboteurs either from Syracuse or from the anti war faction within Athens itself Socrates pupil Alcibiades was suspected of involvement and one of the charges eventually made against Socrates which led to his execution years later was that he had either corrupted Alcibiades or failed to guide him away from his moral corruption br br In association with his role as a psychopomp and god who is able to easily cross boundaries Hermes is predominantly worshiped as a messenger often described as the messenger of the gods since he can convey messages between the divine realms the underworld and the world of mortals As a messenger and divine herald he wears winged sandals or in Roman art influenced by Etruscan depictions of Turms a winged cap br br Hermes was known as the patron god of flocks herds and shepherds an attribute possibly tied to his early origin as an aspect of Pan In Boeotia Hermes was worshiped for having saved the town from a plague by carrying a ram or calf around the city walls A yearly festival commemorated this event during which a lamb would be carried around the city by the most handsome boy and then sacrificed in order to purify and protect the city from disease drought and famine Numerous depictions of Hermes as a shepherd god carrying a lamb on his shoulders Hermes kriophoros have been found throughout the Mediterranean world and it is possible that the iconography of Hermes as The Good Shepherd had an influence on early Christianity specifically in the description of Christ as the Good Shepherd in the Gospel of John br br The earliest written record of Hermes comes from Linear B inscriptions from Pylos Thebes and Knossos dating to the Bronze Age Mycenaean period Here Hermes name is rendered as e ma a h This name is always recorded alongside those of several goddesses including Potnija Posidaeja Diwja Hera Pere and Ipemedeja indicating that his worship was strongly connected to theirs This is a pattern that would continue in later periods as worship of Hermes almost always took place within temples and sanctuaries primarily dedicated to goddesses including Hera Demeter Hecate and Despoina br br In literary works of Archaic Greece Hermes is depicted both as a protector and a trickster In Homer s Iliad Hermes is called the bringer of good luck guide and guardian and excellent in all the tricks In Hesiod s Works and Days Hermes is depicted giving Pandora the gifts of lies seductive words and a dubious character br The earliest known theological or spiritual documents concerning Hermes are found in the c th century BC Homeric Hymns In Homeric Hymn to Hermes describes the god s birth and his theft of Apollo s sacred cattle In this hymn Hermes is invoked as a god of many shifts polytropos associated with cunning and thievery but also a bringer of dreams and a night guardian He is said to have invented the chelys lyre as well as racing and the sport of wrestling br br The cult of Hermes flourished in Attica and many scholars writing before the discovery of the Linear B evidence considered Hermes to be a uniquely Athenian god This region had numerous Hermai or pillar like icons dedicated to the god marking boundaries crossroads and entryways These were initially stone piles later pillars made of wood stone or bronze with carved images of Hermes a phallus or both In the context of these herms by the Classical period Hermes had come to be worshiped as the patron god of travelers and sailors By the th century BC Hermai were also in common use as grave monuments emphasizing Hermes role as a chthonic deity and psychopomp This was probably his original function and he may have been a late inclusion in the Olympic pantheon Hermes is described as the youngest Olympian and some myths including his theft of Apollo s cows describe his initial coming into contact with celestial deities Hermes therefore came to be worshiped as a mediator between celestial and chthonic realms as well as the one who facilitates interactions between mortals and the divine often being depicted on libation vessels br Due to his mobility and his liminal nature mediating between opposites such as merchant customer he was considered the god of commerce and social intercourse the wealth brought in business especially sudden or unexpected enrichment travel roads and crossroads borders and boundary conditions or transient the changes from the threshold agreements and contracts friendship hospitality sexual intercourse games data the draw good luck the sacrifices and the sacrificial animals flocks and shepherds and the fertility of land and cattle br In Athens Hermes Eion came to represent the Athenian naval superiority in their defeat of the Persians under the command of Cimon in BC In this context Hermes became a god associated with the Athenian empire and its expansion and of democracy itself as well as all of those closely associated with it from the sailors in the navy to the merchants who drove the economy A section of the agora in Athens became known as the Hermai because it was filled with a large number of herms placed there as votive offerings by merchants and others who wished to commemorate a personal success in commerce or other public affair The Hermai was probably destroyed in the Siege of Athens and Piraeus BC br br As Greek culture and influence spread following the conquests of Alexander the Great a period of syncretism or interpretatio graeca saw many traditional Greek deities identified with foreign counterparts In Ptolemaic Egypt for example the Egyptian god Thoth was identified by Greek speakers as the Egyptian form of Hermes The two gods were worshiped as one at the Temple of Thoth in Khemenu a city which became known in Greek as Hermopolis This led to Hermes gaining the attributes of a god of translation and interpretation or more generally a god of knowledge and learning This is illustrated by a rd century BC example of a letter sent by the priest Petosiris to King Nechopso probably written in Alexandria c BC stating that Hermes is the teacher of all secret wisdoms which are accessible by the experience of religious ecstasy br An epithet of Thoth found in the temple at Esna Thoth the great the great the great became applied to Hermes beginning in at least BC This lent Hermes one of his most famous later titles Hermes Trismegistus thrice greatest Hermes The figure of Hermes Trismegistus would later absorb a variety of other esoteric wisdom traditions and become a major component of Hermeticism alchemy and related traditions br br As early as the th century BC Romans had adopted Hermes into their own religion combining his attributes and worship with the earlier Etruscan god Turms under the name Mercury According to St Augustin the Latin name Mercury may be a title derived from medio currens in reference to Hermes role as a mediator and messenger who moves between worlds Mercury became one of the most popular Roman gods as attested by the numerous shrines and depictions in artwork found in Pompeii In art the Roman Mercury continued the style of depictions found in earlier representations of both Hermes and Turms a young beardless god with winged shoes and or hat carrying the caduceus His role as a god of boundaries a messenger and a psychopomp also remained unchanged following his adoption into the Roman religion these attributes were also similar to those in the Etruscan s worship of Turms br br The Romans identified the Germanic god Odin with Mercury and there is evidence that Germanic peoples who had contact with Roman culture also accepted this identification Odin and Mercury Hermes share several attributes in common For example both are depicted carrying a staff and wearing a wide brimmed hat and both are travelers or wanderers However the reasons for this interpretation appear to go beyond superficial similarities Both gods are connected to the dead Mercury as psychopomp and Odin as lord of the dead in Valhalla both were connected to eloquent speech and both were associated with secret knowledge The identification of Odin as Mercury was probably also influenced by a previous association of a more Odin like Celtic god as the Celtic Mercurius br A further Roman Imperial era syncretism came in the form of Hermanubis the result of the identification of Hermes with the Egyptian god of the dead Anubis Hermes and Anubis were both psychopomps the primary attribute leading to their conflation as the same god Hermanubis depicted with a human body and a jackal head holding the caduceus In addition to his function of guiding souls to the afterlife Hermanubis represented the Egyptian priesthood the investigation of truth br Beginning around the turn of the st century AD a process began by which in certain traditions Hermes became euhemerised that is interpreted as a historical mortal figure who had become divine or elevated to godlike status in legend Numerous books of wisdom and magic including astrology theosophy and alchemy were attributed to this historical Hermes usually identified in his Alexandrian form of Hermes Trismegistus As a collection these works are referred to as the Hermetica br br Though worship of Hermes had been almost fully suppressed in the Roman Empire following the Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I in the th century AD Hermes continued to be recognized as a mystical or prophetic figure though a mortal one by Christian scholars Early medieval Christians such as Augustine believed that a euhemerised Hermes Trismegistus had been an ancient pagan prophet who predicted the emergence of Christianity in his writings Some Christian philosophers in the medieval and Renaissance periods believed in the existence of a prisca theologia a single thread of true theology that could be found uniting all religions Christian philosophers used Hermetic writings and other ancient philosophical literature to support their belief in the prisca theologia arguing that Hermes Trismegistus was a contemporary of Moses or that he was the third in a line of important prophets after Enoch and Noah br The th century Suda attempted to further Christianize the figure of Hermes claiming that He was called Trismegistus on account of his praise of the trinity saying there is one divine nature in the trinity br br There are only three temples known to have been specifically dedicated to Hermes during the Classical Greek period all of them in Arcadia Though there are a few references in ancient literature to numerous temples of Hermes this may be poetic license describing the ubiquitous herms or other smaller shrines to Hermes located in the temples of other deities One of the oldest places of worship for Hermes was Mount Cyllene in Arcadia where some myths say he was born Tradition holds that his first temple was built by Lycaon From there the Hermes cult would have been taken to Athens from which it radiated to the whole of Greece In the Roman period additional temples to Hermes Mercury were constructed across the Empire including several in modern day Tunisia Mercury s temple in Rome was situated in the Circus Maximus between the Aventine and Palatine hills and was built in BC br In most places temples were consecrated to Hermes in conjunction with Aphrodite as in Attica Arcadia Crete Samos and in Magna Graecia Several ex votos found in his temples revealed his role as initiator of young adulthood among them soldiers and hunters since war and certain forms of hunting were seen as ceremonial initiatory ordeals This function of Hermes explains why some images in temples and other vessels show him as a teenager br As a patron of the gym and fighting Hermes had statues in gyms and he was also worshiped in the sanctuary of the Twelve Gods in Olympia where Greeks celebrated the Olympic Games His statue was held there on an altar dedicated to him and Apollo together br A temple within the Aventine was consecrated in BC br Pausanias wrote that during his time at Megalopolis people could see the ruins of the temple of Hermes Acacesius br In addition the Tricrena meaning Three Springs mountains at Pheneus were sacred to Hermes because three springs were there and according to the legend Hermes was washed in them after birth by the nymphs of the mountain br Furthermore at Pharae there was a water sacred to Hermes The name of the spring was Hermes stream and the fish in it were not caught being considered sacred to the god br Sacrifices to Hermes involved honey cakes pigs goats and lambs In the city of Tanagra it was believed that Hermes had been nursed under a wild strawberry tree the remains of which were held there in the shrine of Hermes Promachus and in the hills Phene ran three waterways that were sacred to him because he was believed to have been bathed there at birth br br Hermes feast was the Hermaea which was celebrated with sacrifices to the god and with athletics and gymnastics possibly having been established in the th century BC but no documentation on the festival before the th century BC survives However Plato said that Socrates attended a Hermaea Of all the festivals involving Greek games these were the most like initiations because participation in them was restricted to young boys and excluded adults br br Hermes was also called Atlantiades Greek because his mother Maia was the daughter of Atlas br br Hermes epithet Arge phontes Ancient Greek Latin Argicida meaning slayer of Argus recalls the slaying of the hundred eyed giant Argus Panoptes by the messenger god Argus was watching over the heifer nymph Io in the sanctuary of Queen Hera herself in Argos Hermes placed a charm on Argus eyes with the caduceus to cause the giant to sleep after which he slew the giant with a harpe The eyes were then put into the tail of the peacock a symbol of the goddess Hera br br Hermes was called Cyllenian Greek because according to some myths he was born at the Mount Cyllene and nursed by the Oread nymph Cyllene br br In ancient Greek culture kriophoros Greek or criophorus the ram bearer is a figure that commemorates the solemn sacrifice of a ram It becomes an epithet of Hermes br br The chief office of the god was as messenger Explicitly at least in sources of classical writings of Euripides Electra and Iphigenia in Aulis and in Epictetus Discourses Hermes Diactorus

br Empolaios engaged in traffic and commerce br Hermes is sometimes depicted in art works holding a purse br br Source br No cult to Hermes Dolios existed in Attica and so this form of Hermes seems to

Hermes obtains a bad character and an in moral amoral ed cult as Dolios br Hermes is amoral like a baby Zeus sent Hermes as a teacher to humanity to teach them knowledge of and value of justice and to improve inter personal relationships bonding between mortals br Considered to have a mastery of rhetorical persuasion and special pleading the god typically has nocturnal modus operandi Hermes knows

where he had been imprisoned by Otus and Ephialtes In the Odyssey Hermes helps his great grand son the protagonist Odysseus by informing him about the fate of his companions who were turned into animals by the power of Circe Hermes instructed Odysseus to protect himself by chewing a magic herb he also told Calypso of Zeus order to free Odysseus from her island to allow him to continue his journey back home When Odysseus killed the suitors of his wife Hermes led their souls to Hades In Works and Days when Zeus ordered Hephaestus to create Pandora to disgrace humanity by punishing Prometheus s act of giving fire to man every god gave her a gift and Hermes gifts were lies seductive words and a dubious character Hermes was then instructed to take her as wife to Epimetheus br br The Homeric Hymn to Hermes which tells the story of the god s birth and his subsequent theft of Apollo s sacred cattle invokes him as the one of many shifts polytropos blandly cunning a robber a

and the sport of wrestling and therefore was a patron of athletes br br Aeschylus wrote in The Eumenides that Hermes helped Orestes kill Clytemnestra under a false identity and other stratagems and also said that he was the god of searches and those who seek things lost or stolen In Philoctetes Sophocles invokes Hermes when Odysseus needs to convince Philoctetes to join the Trojan War on the

edible roots and of hospitality He also said that Hermes had assigned each person his share of intelligence br br One of the Orphic Hymns Khthonios is dedicated to Hermes indicating that he was also a god of the underworld Aeschylus had called him by this epithet several times Another is the Orphic Hymn to Hermes where his association with the athletic games held is mystic in tone br Phlegon of Tralles said he was invoked to ward off ghosts and Apollodorus reports several events involving Hermes According to Apollodorus Hermes participated in the Gigantomachy in defense of Olympus was given

off to Tanagra in Boeotia br According to Hyginus Fabula Pan the Greek god of nature shepherds and flocks is the son of Hermes through the nymph Dryope It is likely that the worship of Hermes himself actually originated as an aspect of Pan as the god of boundaries which could explain their association as parent and child in Hyginus In other sources the god Priapus is understood as a son of Hermes br According to the mythographer Apollodorus Autolycus the Prince of Thieves was a son of Hermes and Chione making Hermes a great grandfather of Odysseus br Once Hermes chased either Persephone or
