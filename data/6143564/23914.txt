Polyphemus Greek translit Polyph mos Epic Greek polyp mos Latin Polyph mus p l p e m s is the one eyed giant son of Poseidon and Thoosa in Greek mythology one of the Cyclopes described in Homer s Odyssey His name means abounding in songs and legends many voiced or very famous Polyphemus first appeared as a savage man eating giant in the ninth book of the Odyssey The satyr play of Euripides is dependent on this episode apart from one detail Polyphemus is made a pederast in the play Later Classical writers presented him in their poems as heterosexual and linked his name with the nymph Galatea Often he was portrayed as unsuccessful in these and as unaware of his disproportionate size and musical failings In the work of even later authors however he is presented as both a successful lover and skilled musician From the Renaissance on art and literature reflect all of these interpretations of the giant br br br Odysseus and Polyphemus br br br Ancient sources br In Homer s epic Odysseus lands on the island of the Cyclopes during his journey home from the Trojan War and together with some of his men enters a cave filled with provisions When the giant Polyphemus returns home with his flocks he blocks the entrance with a great stone and scorning the usual custom of hospitality eats two of the men Next morning the giant kills and eats two more and leaves the cave to graze his sheep br br After the giant returns in the evening and eats two more of the men Odysseus offers Polyphemus some strong and undiluted wine given to him earlier on his journey Drunk and unwary the giant asks Odysseus his name promising him a guest gift if he answers Odysseus tells him which means nobody and Polyphemus promises to eat this Nobody last of all With that he falls into a drunken sleep Odysseus had meanwhile hardened a wooden stake in the fire and drives it into Polyphemus eye When Polyphemus shouts for help from his fellow giants saying that Nobody has hurt him they think Polyphemus is being afflicted by divine power and recommend prayer as the answer br In the morning the blind Cyclops lets the sheep out to graze feeling their backs to ensure that the men are not escaping However Odysseus and his men have tied themselves to the undersides of the animals and so get away As he sails off with his men Odysseus boastfully reveals his real name an act of hubris that was to cause problems for him later Polyphemus prays to his father Poseidon for revenge and casts huge rocks towards the ship which Odysseus barely escapes br The story reappears in later Classical literature In Cyclops the th century BC play by Euripides a chorus of satyrs offers comic relief from the grisly story of how Polyphemus is punished for his impious behaviour in not respecting the rites of hospitality In this play Polyphemus claims to be a pederast revealing to Odysseus that he takes more pleasure in boys than in women and tries to take the satyr Silenus who he kept together with his sons as slaves on Mount Etna in Sicily calling him my Ganymede The scene is infused with low comedy specifically from the chorus and Polyphemus is made to look silly he is drunk when he explains his sexual desire Silenus is too old to play the part of the young lover and he himself will be subjected to penetration with the wooden spike br In his Latin epic Virgil describes how Aeneas observes blind Polyphemus as he leads his flocks down to the sea They have encountered Achaemenides who re tells the story of how Odysseus and his men escaped leaving him behind The giant is described as descending to the shore using a lopped pine tree as a walking staff Once Polyphemus reaches the sea he washes his oozing bloody eye socket and groans painfully Achaemenides is taken aboard Aeneas vessel and they cast off with Polyphemus in chase His great roar of frustration brings the rest of the Cyclopes down to the shore as Aeneas draws away in fear br br br Artistic representations br br During the seventh century the potters gave preference to scenes from both epics The Odyssey and the Iliad almost half being that of the blinding of the Cyclops and the ruse by which Odysseus and his men escape One such episode on a vase featuring the hero carried beneath a sheep was used on a drachma Greek postage stamp in This was a steep drop to the point of being insignificant from the volume of pan Hellenic pottery discovered from the fifth and sixth centuries which largely depicted ancient Greek mythology scenes from the Trojan War or deeds from Heracles or Perseus br The blinding was depicted in life size sculpture including a giant Polyphemus in the Sperlonga sculptures probably made for the Emperor Tiberius This may be an interpretation of an existing composition and was apparently repeated in variations in later Imperial palaces by Claudius Nero and at Hadrian s Villa br br Of the European painters of the subject the Flemish Jacob Jordaens depicted Odysseus escaping from the cave of Polyphemus in see gallery below and others chose the dramatic scene of the giant casting boulders at the escaping ship In Guido Reni s painting of see above the furious giant is tugging a boulder from the cliff as Odysseus and his men row out to the ship far below Polyphemus is portrayed as it often happens with two empty eye sockets and his damaged eye located in the middle on his forehead This convention goes back to Greek statuary and painting and is reproduced in Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein s head and shoulders portrait of the giant see below br Arnold B cklin pictures the giant as standing on rocks onshore and swinging one of them back as the men row desperately over a surging wave see below while Polyphemus is standing at the top of a cliff in Jean L on G r me s painting of He stands poised having already thrown one stone which barely misses the ship The reason for his rage is depicted in J M W Turner s painting Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus Here the ship sails forward as the sun breaks free of clouds low on the horizon The giant himself is an indistinct shape barely distinguished from the woods and smoky atmosphere high above br br br Possible origins br Folktales similar to that of Homer s Polyphemus are a widespread phenomenon throughout the ancient world In Wilhelm Grimm collected versions in Serbian Romanian Estonian Finnish Russian German and others versions in Basque S mi Lithuanian Gascon Syriac and Celtic are also known More than two hundred different versions have been identified from around twenty five nations covering a geographic region extending from Iceland Ireland England Portugal and Africa to Arabia Turkey Russia and Korea The consensus of current modern scholarship is that these Polyphemus legends preserve traditions predating Homer br An example of such a story is one from Georgia in the Caucasus which describes several brothers held prisoner by a giant one eyed shepherd called One eye After all but two of the brothers are roasted on a spit and eaten the remaining two take the spit heat it red hot and stab it into the giant s eye As One eye let his flock out of their pen he felt each sheep as it passed between his legs but the two brothers were able to escape by covering themselves with a sheepskin br br br Polyphemus and Galatea br br br Ancient sources br br br Philoxenus of Cythera br Writing more than three centuries after the Odyssey is thought to have been composed Philoxenus of Cythera took up the myth of Polyphemus in his poem Cyclops or Galatea The poem was written to be performed as a dithyramb of which only fragments have survived and was perhaps the first to provide a female love interest for the Cyclops The object of Polyphemus romantic desire is a sea nymph named Galatea In the poem Polyphemus is not a cave dwelling monstrous brute as in the Odyssey but instead he is rather like Odysseus himself in his vision of the world He has weaknesses he is adept at literary criticism and he understands people br The date of composition for the Cyclops is not precisely known but it must be prior to BC when Aristophanes parodied it in his comedy Plutus Wealth and probably after BC when Dionysius I became tyrant of Syracuse Philoxenus lived in that city and was the court poet of Dionysius I According to ancient commentators either because of his frankness regarding Dionysius poetry or because of a conflict with the tyrant over a female aulos player named Galatea Philoxenus was imprisoned in the quarries and had there composed his Cyclops in the manner of a Roman clef where the poem s characters Polyphemus Odysseus and Galatea were meant to represent Dionysius Philoxenus and the aulos player Philoxenus had his Polyphemus perform on the cithara a professional lyre requiring great skill The Cyclops playing such a sophisticated and fashionable instrument would have been quite a surprising juxtaposition for Philoxenus audience br Philoxenus Cyclops is also referred to in Aristotle s Poetics in a section that discusses representations of people in tragedy and comedy citing as comedic examples the Cyclops of both Timotheus and Philoxenus br br br Aristophanes br The text of Aristophanes last extant play Plutus Wealth has survived with almost all of its choral odes missing What remains shows Aristophanes as he does to some extent in all his plays parodying a contemporary literary work in this case Philoxenus Cyclops While making fun of literary aspects of Philoxenus dithyramb Aristophanes is at the same time commenting on musical developments occurring in the fourth century BC developing themes that run through the whole play It also contains lines and phrases taken directly from the Cyclops br The slave Cario tells the chorus that his master has brought home with him the god Wealth and because of this they will all now be rich The chorus wants to dance for joy so Cario takes the lead by parodying Philoxenus Cyclops As a solo performer leading a chorus that sings and dances Cario recreates the form of a dithyramb He first casts himself in the role of Polyphemus while assigning to the chorus the roles of sheep and goats at the same time imitating the sound of a lyre And now I wish threttanello to imitate the Cyclops and swinging my feet to and fro like this to lead you in the dance But come on children shout and shout again the songs of bleating sheep and smelly goats The chorus however does not want to play sheep and goats they would rather be Odysseus and his men and they threaten to blind Cario as had Odysseus the drunken Cyclops with a wooden stake br br br Hellenistic pastoral poets br The romantic element originated by Philoxenus was revived by later Hellenistic poets including Theocritus Callimachus Hermesianax and Bion of Smyrna br Theocritus is credited with creating the genre of pastoral poetry His works are titled Idylls and of these Idyll XI tells the story of the Cyclops love for Galatea Though the character of Polyphemus derives from Homer there are notable differences Where Homer s Cyclops was beastly and wicked Theocritus is absurd lovesick and comic Polyphemus loves the sea nymph Galatea but she rejects him because of his ugliness However in a borrowing from Philoxenus poem Polyphemus has discovered that music will heal lovesickness and so he plays the panpipes and sings of his woes for I am skilled in piping as no other Cyclops here His longing is to overcome the antithetic elements that divide them he of earth and she of water br br The love of the mismatched pair was later taken up by other pastoral poets The same trope of music being the cure for love was introduced by Callimachus in his Epigram How excellent was the charm that Polyphemus discovered for the lover By Earth the Cyclops was no fool A fragment of a lost idyll by Bion also portrays Polyphemus declaring his undying love for Galatea Referring back to this an elegy on Bion s death that was once attributed to Moschus takes the theme further in a piece of hyperbole Where Polyphemus had failed the poet declares Bion s greater artistry had won Galatea s heart drawing her from the sea to tend his herds This reflected the situation in Idyll VI of Theocritus There two herdsmen engage in a musical competition one of them playing the part of Polyphemus who asserts that since he has adopted the ruse of ignoring Galatea she has now become the one who pursues him br br br Latin poets br The successful outcome of Polyphemus love was also alluded to in the course of a st century BC love elegy on the power of music by the Latin poet Propertius Listed among the examples he mentions is that Even Galatea it s true below wild Etna wheeled her brine wet horses Polyphemus to your songs The division of contrary elements between the land based monster and the sea nymph lamented in Theocritus Idyll is brought into harmony by this means br While Ovid s treatment of the story that he introduced into the Metamorphoses is reliant on the idylls of Theocritus it is complicated by the introduction of Acis who has now become the focus of Galatea s love br br There is also a reversion to the Homeric vision of the hulking monster whose attempt to play the tender shepherd singing love songs is made a source of humour by Galatea br br In his own character too Polyphemus mentions the transgression of heavenly laws that once characterised his actions and is now overcome by Galatea I who scorn Jove and his heaven and his piercing lightning bolt submit to you alone br Galatea listens to the love song of Polyphemus while she and Acis lie hidden by a rock In his song Polyphemus scolds her for not loving him in return offers her rustic gifts and points out what he considers his best feature the single eye that is he boasts the size of a great shield But when Polyphemus discovers the hiding place of the lovers he becomes enraged with jealousy Galatea terrified dives into the ocean while the Cyclops wrenches off a piece of the mountain and crushes Acis with it But on her return Galatea changes her dead lover into the spirit of the Sicilian river Acis br br br First century AD art br That the story sometimes had a more successful outcome for Polyphemus is also attested in the arts In one of the murals rescued from the site of Pompeii Polyphemus is pictured seated on a rock with a cithara rather than a syrinx by his side holding out a hand to receive a love letter from Galatea which is carried by a winged Cupid riding on a dolphin br In another fresco also dating from the st century AD the two stand locked in a naked embrace see below From their union came the ancestors of various wild and war like races According to some accounts the Celts Galati in Latin i in Greek were descended from their son Galatos while Appian credited them with three children Celtus Illyrius and Galas from whom descend the Celts the Illyrians and the Gauls respectively br br br Lucian br br There are indications that Polyphemus courtship also had a more successful outcome in one of the dialogues of Lucian of Samosata There Doris one of Galatea s sisters spitefully congratulates her on her love conquest and she defends Polyphemus From the conversation one understands that Doris is chiefly jealous that her sister has a lover Galatea admits that she does not love Polyphemus but is pleased to have been chosen by him in preference to all her companions br br br Nonnus br That their conjunction was fruitful is also implied in a later Greek epic from the turn of the th century AD In the course of his Dionysiaca Nonnus gives an account of the wedding of Poseidon and Beroe at which the Nereid Galatea twangled a marriage dance and restlessly twirled in capering step and she sang the marriage verses for she had learnt well how to sing being taught by Polyphemos with a shepherd s syrinx br br br Later European interpretations br br br Literature and music br During Renaissance and Baroque times Ovid s story emerged again as a popular theme In Spain Luis de G ngora y Argote wrote the much admired narrative poem F bula de Polifemo y Galatea published in It is particularly noted for its depiction of landscape and for the sensual description of the love of Acis and Galatea It was written in homage to an earlier and rather shorter narrative with the same title by Luis Carillo y Sotomayor The story was also given operatic treatment in the very popular zarzuela of Antoni Lliteres Carri The atmosphere here is lighter and enlivened by the inclusion of the clowns Momo and Tisbe br In France the story was condensed to the fourteen lines of Tristan L Hermite s sonnet Polyph me en furie In it the giant expresses his fury upon viewing the loving couple ultimately throwing the huge rock that kills Acis and even injures Galatea Later in the century Jean Baptiste Lully composed his opera Acis et Galat e on the theme br br In Italy Giovanni Bononcini composed the one act opera Polifemo Shortly afterwards George Frideric Handel worked in that country and composed the cantata Aci Galatea e Polifemo laying as much emphasis on the part of Polifemo as on the lovers Written in Italian Polifemo s deep bass solo Fra l ombre e gl orrori From horrid shades establishes his character from the start After Handel s move to England he gave the story a new treatment in his pastoral opera Acis and Galatea with an English libretto provided by John Gay Initially composed in the work went through many revisions and was later to be given updated orchestrations by both Mozart and Mendelssohn As a pastoral work it is suffused with Theocritan atmosphere but largely centres on the two lovers When Polyphemus declares his love in the lyric O ruddier than the cherry the effect is almost comic Handel s rival for a while on the London scene Nicola Porpora also made the story the subject of his opera Polifemo br Later in the century Joseph Haydn composed Acide e Galatea as his first opera while in Vienna Designed for an imperial wedding it was given a happy ending centred on the transformation scene after the murder of Acis as the pair declare their undying love Johann Gottlieb Naumann was to turn the story into a comic opera Aci e Galatea with the subtitle i ciclopi amanti the amorous cyclops The work was first performed in Dresden in and its plot was made more complicated by giving Polifemo a companion Orgonte There were also two other lovers Dorinda and Lisia with Orgonte Lisia s rival for Dorinda s love br After John Gay s libretto in Britain it was not until the th century that the subject was given further poetical treatment In appeared The Death of Acis by Bryan Procter writing under the name of Barry Cornwall A blank verse narrative with lyric episodes it celebrates the musicianship of Polyphemus which draws the lovers to expose themselves from their hiding place in a cave and thus brings about the death of Acis At the other end of the century there was Alfred Austin s dramatic poem Polyphemus which is set after the murder and transformation of the herdsman The giant is tortured by hearing the happy voices of Galatea and Acis as they pursue their love duet Shortly afterwards Albert Samain wrote the act verse drama Polyph me with the additional character of Lycas Galatea s younger brother In this the giant is humanised sparing the lovers when he discovers them he blinds himself and wades to his death in the sea The play was first performed posthumously in with incidental music by Raymond Bonheur On this the French composer Jean Cras based his operatic lyric tragedy composed in and first performed in Cras took Samain s text almost unchanged subdividing the play s two acts into four and cutting a few lines from Polyphemus final speech br There have also been two Spanish musical items that reference Polyphemus name Reginald Smith Brindle s four fragments for guitar El Polifemo de Oro takes its title from Federico Garc a Lorca s poem The riddle of the guitar That speaks of six dancing maidens the guitar strings entranced by a golden Polyphemus the one eyed sound hole The Spanish composer Andres Valero Castells takes the inspiration for his Polifemo i Galatea from Gongora s work Originally written for brass band in he rescored it for orchestra in br br br Painting and sculpture br Paintings that include Polyphemus in the story of Acis and Galatea can be grouped according to their themes Most notably the story takes place within a pastoral landscape in which the figures are almost incidental This is particularly so in Nicolas Poussin s Landscape with Polyphemus see gallery below in which the lovers play a minor part in the foreground To the right Polyphemus merges with a distant mountain top on which he plays his pipes In an earlier painting by Poussin from now housed at the Dublin National Gallery the couple are among several embracing figures in the foreground shielded from view of Polyphemus who is playing his flute higher up the slope Another variation on the theme was painted by Pietro Dandini during this period br br An earlier fresco by Giulio Romano from seats Polyphemus against a rocky foreground with a lyre in his raised right hand The lovers can just be viewed through a gap in the rock that gives onto the sea at the lower right Corneille Van Cl ve represents a seated Polyphemus in his sculpture except that in his version it is pipes that the giant holds in his lowered hand Otherwise he has a massive club held across his body and turns to the left to look over his shoulder br Other paintings take up the Theocritan theme of the pair divided by the elements with which they are identified land and water There are a series of paintings often titled The Triumph of Galatea in which the nymph is carried through the sea by her Nereid sisters while a minor figure of Polyphemus serenades her from the land Typical examples of this were painted by Fran ois Perrier Giovanni Lanfranco and Jean Baptiste van Loo br A whole series of paintings by Gustave Moreau make the same point in a variety of subtle ways The giant spies on Galatea through the wall of a sea grotto or emerges from a cliff to adore her sleeping figure see below Again Polyphemus merges with the cliff where he meditates in the same way that Galatea merges with her element within the grotto in the painting at Mus e d Orsay The visionary interpretation of the story also finds its echo in Odilon Redon s painting The Cyclops in which the giant towers over the slope on which Galatea sleeps br French sculptors have also been responsible for some memorable versions Auguste Ottin s separate figures are brought together in an fountain in the Luxembourg Garden Above is crouched the figure of Polyphemus in weathered bronze peering down at the white marble group of Acis and Galatea embracing below see above A little later Auguste Rodin made a series of statues centred on Polyphemus Originally modelled in clay around and later cast in bronze they may have been inspired by Ottin s work br A final theme is the rage that succeeds the moment of discovery That is portrayed in earlier paintings of Polyphemus casting a rock at the fleeing lovers such as those by Annibale Carracci Lucas Auger and Carle van Loo Jean Fran ois de Troy s th century version combines discovery with aftermath as the giant perched above the lovers turns to wrench up a rock br br br Artistic depictions of Polyphemus br br br Polyphemus and Odysseus br br br br br br br br br
