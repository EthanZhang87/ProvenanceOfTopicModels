The manticore or mantichore Latin mantichora reconstructed Old Persian martyahv rah Modern Persian mard khar is a Persian legendary creature similar to the Egyptian sphinx that proliferated in Western European medieval art as well It has the head of a human the body of a lion and the tail of a scorpion or a tail covered in venomous spines similar to porcupine quills There are some accounts that the spines can be launched like arrows It eats its victims whole using its three rows of teeth and leaves no bones behind br br The term manticore descends via Latin mantichora from Ancient Greek martikh r s This in turn is a transliteration of an Old Persian compound word consisting of mart ya man and xuar stem to eat Mod Persian mard khordan i e man eater br br The ultimate source of manticore was Ctesias Greek physician of the Persian court during the Achaemenid dynasty and is based on the testimonies of his Persian speaking informants who had travelled to India Ctesias himself wrote that the martichora was its name in Persian which translated into Greek as androphagon or anthropophagon i e man eater But the name was mistranscribed as mantichoras in a faulty copy of Aristotle through whose works the notion of the manticore was perpetuated across Europe br Ctesias was also later cited by Pausanias regarding the martichoras or androphagos of India br br br An account of the manticore was given in Ctesias s lost book Indica India and circulated among Greek writers on natural history but has survived only in fragments and epitomes preserved by later writers br Photius s Myriobiblon or Bibliotheca th century serves as base text but Aelian De Natura Animalium rd century preserves the same information and more br br The beast s name means maneater as already noted Aelian citing Ctesias adds that the Mantichora prefers to hunt humans lying in wait taking down even men at a time And the Indians take their young captive disabling its tail by crushing it with stone before the growth of sting begins br br Pliny described the mantichora in his Naturalis Historia c AD having relied on a faulty copy of Aristotle s natural history that contained the misspelling martikhoras br Pliny also introduced the confused notion that the manticore might occur in Africa because he had discussed this and other creatures such as the yale within a passage on Aethiopia But he also described the crocotta and the mantichora of Aethiopia together and while the crocotta imitated the voices of men the mantichora of Aethiopia too also mimicked human speech on authority of Juba II with a voice like the pipe panpipe fistula mixed with trumpet br br Ctesias purportedly saw a martichora presented to the Persian king by the Indians The Romanised Greek Pausanias was skeptical and considered it an unreliable exaggerated account of a tiger Apollonius of Tyana also dismissed the mantichore as a tall tale according to the biography by Philostratus c br Pliny did not share Pausanias skepticism And for years afterwards it was Pliny s account also copied by Solinus nd century which was held to be authoritative on matters of natural history whether real or mythological In the advent of Christianity writings in the Holy Scripture combined with Plinian Aristotelian learning gave rise to the Physiologus also c nd century which later evolved into the medieval bestiaries some of which contained entries on the manticore br br The manticore has been included in some medieval bestiaries with accompanying illustrations though not all br The thick maned and long bearded manticore wearing a Phrygian cap is a commonplace design fig top left br In most instances the manticora is coloured red or brown and has clawed feet Artists took the liberty of coloring the manticore blue at times One example is depicted as a long haired blond fig top right Another has the face of a woman and the body of a blue manticore fig bottom right br Most manuscripts do not bother detailing the scorpion tail and simply draw a long cat s tail br but in Harley MS the manticore has an oddly pointed tail or an extraordinary spike on the end of it and a tail covered in spikes from end to end is shown on the manticore in several other second family manuscripts br The three rows of teeth are not faithfully represented except in some third family examples br br Second Family br The manticore Latin manticora occurs in about half of the Second Family Latin bestiaries The specific source used in this case was probably Solinus nd century br The text here describing the beast differs little from Pliny s Latin version in language or the Greek version in content paraphrased above This is naturally the case since much of Solinus was recopied out of Pliny and the manticora is described as bloody colored here rather than red like cinnabar br The text concludes by stating that the manticore seeks human flesh is active and leaps so that neither large spaces nor broad obstacles can delay it neither the broadest space nor the widest barrier can hinder it br br H text br Actually there are two candidate sources given for the passage Solinus and H iii this H being the pseudo Hugh of Saint Victor De bestiis et aliis rebus edited by Migne but this source has been regarded circumspectly as the problematic De bestiis et aliis rebus by Clark br br Transitional br The manticore also occurs in the earliest Transitional First Family bestiary c and some Third Family codices as well whose illustrations attempted to reproduce some of the finer details given in its text br br As aforementioned the manticore is one of three hybrids from Aithiopia described together by Solinus appearing in nearly successive chapters of the bestiary This created the groundwork for the beasts in adjacent chapters being confounded or amalgamated through scribal errors as described below in the cases of bestiaries produced in France br br The manticore is basically absent from the French bestiary of Pierre de Beauvais which exist in the short versions of or chapters and the long version of chapters Instead there is a Chapter on the centicore or santicora var ceucrocata which suggests manticore in name but which is nothing like the standard manticore The name is thought to have arisen from misspellings of leucrocotta compounded by the suffix replaced by cora by scribal error Due to further mistransmission centicore became the French misnomer for the yale eale a mythic antelope which should be a separate entry in the bestiaries br Neither manticore nor leucrotta French lucrote appears in Philippe de Thaun s bestiary in Anglo Norman verse br br Edward Topsell in described the manticore as br br bred among the Indians having a treble rowe of teeth beneath and above whose greatnesse roughnesse and feete are like a Lyons his face and eares like unto a mans his eies grey and collour red his taile like the taile of a Scorpion of the earth armed with a sting casting forth sharp pointed quills his voice like the voice of a small trumpet or pipe being in course as swift as a Hart His wildnes such as can never be tamed and his appetite is especially to the flesh of man His body like the body of a Lyon being very apt both to leape and to run so as no distance or space doth hinder him br Topsell thought the manticore was described by other names elsewhere He thought that it was the same Beast which Avicen calleth Marion and Maricomorion and also the same as the Leucrocuta about the bigness of a wilde Ass being in legs and Hoofs like a Hart having his mouth reaching on both sides to his ears and the head and face of a female like unto a Badgers br And Topsell wrote that in India they would bruise the buttockes and taile of the whelp or cub they captured causing it to be incapable of using its quills thus removing the danger This differs somewhat from the original sources which stated that they would crush the tail with stone to make them useless br br The likeness of manticore or similar creatures by another name i e mantyger have been used in heraldry spanning from the late High Middle Ages into the modern period br br The mantyger is glossed as merely a variant reading of manticore in the OED though the th century heraldry collector Randle Holme made a fine distinction between manticore and mantyger Holme s description of the manticore seems to derive directly from naturalist Edward Topsell cf above The manticore has the face of a man the mouth open to the ears with a treble row of teeth beneath and above long neck whose greatness roughness body and feet are like a Lyon of a red colour his tail like the tail of a Scorpion of the Earth the end armed with a sting casting forth sharp pointed quills while he describes the mantyger as having the face and ears of a man the body of a Tyger and whole footed like Goose or Dragon yet others make it with feet like a Tyger etc and also noting that they may be horned or unhorned br The manticore first appeared in English heraldry in c as a badge of William Hastings st Baron Hastings and in the th century br The mantyger device was later used as a badge by Robert Radcliffe st Earl of Sussex and by Sir Anthony Babyngton The Radford e s device was described as mantygers argent by one source c Thus in heraldic discourse the term manticore became usurped by mantyger during the th centuries and mantiger in the th br It is noted that the manticore mantiger of heraldic devices has a beast of prey body as standard but sometimes chosen to be given dragon feet The Radcliffe family manticore appears to have human feet and not so surprisingly a chronicler described as a Babyon baboon the device by John Radcliffe Lord Fitzwater accompanying Henry VIII into war in France It has also been speculated the Babyngton device is intended to represent the Babyon or baboon as a play upon his name and it too also has characteristically monkey like feet br The typical heraldic manticore is supposed to have not only the face of an old man but spiraling horns as well although this is not really ascertainable in the Radcliffe family badge where the purple manticore is wearing a yellow cap cap of dignity br br Gerald Brenan linked the manticore to the mantequero a monster feeding on human fat in Andalusian folklore br The Hindu god Narasimha is often referred to as a Manticore Narasimha the man lion is the fourth avatar of Vishnu and is described as having a man s torso and the head and claws of a lion br br Dante Alighieri in his Inferno depicted the mythical Geryon as a manticore following Pliny s description br br The heraldic manticore influenced some Mannerist representations of the sin of Fraud conceived as a monstrous chimera with a beautiful woman s face for example in Bronzino s allegory Venus Cupid Folly and Time National Gallery London and more commonly in the decorative schemes called grotteschi grotesque From here it passed by way of Cesare Ripa s Iconologia into the seventeenth and eighteenth century French conception of a sphinx br br In some modern depictions such as in the tabletop role playing game Dungeons Dragons D D and the card game Magic The Gathering manticores are depicted as having wings They are more specifically given wings of a dragon in the implementation of D D s th edition according to the Monster Manual though an earlier version of the manual described them as batlike wings br In the animated sitcom television series Krapopolis the character of Shlub is depicted as a mantitaur half centaur half manticore br br
