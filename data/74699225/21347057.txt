A Unix like sometimes referred to as UN X or nix operating system is one that behaves in a manner similar to a Unix system although not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the Single UNIX Specification A Unix like application is one that behaves like the corresponding Unix command or shell Although there are general philosophies for Unix design there is no technical standard defining the term and opinions can differ about the degree to which a particular operating system or application is Unix like br Some well known examples of Unix like operating systems include Linux and BSD These systems are often used on servers as well as on personal computers and other devices Many popular applications such as the Apache web server and the Bash shell are also designed to be used on Unix like systems br One of the key features of Unix like systems is their ability to support multiple users and processes simultaneously This allows users to run multiple programs at the same time and to share resources such as memory and disk space This is in contrast to many older operating systems which were designed to only support a single user or process at a time Another important feature of Unix like systems is their modularity This means that the operating system is made up of many small interchangeable components that can be added or removed as needed This makes it easy to customize the operating system to suit the needs of different users or environments br br The Open Group owns the UNIX trademark and administers the Single UNIX Specification with the UNIX name being used as a certification mark They do not approve of the construction Unix like and consider it a misuse of their trademark Their guidelines require UNIX to be presented in uppercase or otherwise distinguished from the surrounding text strongly encourage using it as a branding adjective for a generic word such as system and discourage its use in hyphenated phrases br Other parties frequently treat Unix as a genericized trademark Some add a wildcard character to the name to make an abbreviation like Un x or nix since Unix like systems often have Unix like names such as AIX A UX HP UX IRIX Linux Minix Ultrix Xenix and XNU These patterns do not literally match many system names but are still generally recognized to refer to any UNIX system descendant or work alike even those with completely dissimilar names such as Darwin macOS illumos Solaris or FreeBSD br In Wayne R Gray sued to dispute the status of UNIX as a trademark but lost his case and lost again on appeal with the court upholding the trademark and its ownership br br Unix like systems started to appear in the late s and early s Many proprietary versions such as Idris UNOS Coherent and UniFlex aimed to provide businesses with the functionality available to academic users of UNIX br When AT T allowed relatively inexpensive commercial binary sublicensing of UNIX in a variety of proprietary systems were developed based on it including AIX HP UX IRIX SunOS Tru Ultrix and Xenix These largely displaced the proprietary clones Growing incompatibility among these systems led to the creation of interoperability standards including POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification br Various free low cost and unrestricted substitutes for UNIX emerged in the s and s including BSD Linux and Minix Some of these have in turn been the basis for commercial Unix like systems such as BSD OS and macOS Several versions of Mac OS X macOS running on Intel based Mac computers have been certified under the Single UNIX Specification The BSD variants are descendants of UNIX developed by the University of California at Berkeley with UNIX source code from Bell Labs However the BSD code base has evolved since then replacing all the AT T code Since the BSD variants are not certified as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification they are referred to as UNIX like rather than UNIX br br Dennis Ritchie one of the original creators of Unix expressed his opinion that Unix like systems such as Linux are de facto Unix systems Eric S Raymond and Rob Landley have suggested that there are three kinds of Unix like systems br br Those systems with a historical connection to the AT T codebase Most commercial UNIX systems fall into this category So do the BSD systems which are descendants of work done at the University of California Berkeley in the late s and early s Some of these systems have no original AT T code but can still trace their ancestry to AT T designs br br These systems largely commercial in nature have been determined by the Open Group to meet the Single UNIX Specification and are allowed to carry the UNIX name Most such systems are commercial derivatives of the System V code base in one form or another although Apple macOS and later is a BSD variant that has been certified and EulerOS and Inspur K UX are Linux distributions that have been certified A few other systems such as IBM z OS earned the trademark through a POSIX compatibility layer and are not otherwise inherently Unix systems Many ancient UNIX systems no longer meet this definition br br Broadly any Unix like system that behaves in a manner roughly consistent with the UNIX specification including having a program which manages your login and command line sessions more specifically this can refer to systems such as Linux or Minix that behave similarly to a UNIX system but have no genetic or trademark connection to the AT T code base Most free open source implementations of the UNIX design whether genetic UNIX or not fall into the restricted definition of this third category due to the expense of obtaining Open Group certification which costs thousands of dollars br Around Linux was given the opportunity to get a certification including free help from the POSIX chair Andrew Josey for the symbolic price of one dollar There have been some activities to make Linux POSIX compliant with Josey having prepared a list of differences between the POSIX standard and the Linux Standard Base specification but in August this project was shut down because of missing interest at the LSB work group br br Some non Unix like operating systems provide a Unix like compatibility layer with varying degrees of Unix like functionality br br IBM z OS s UNIX System Services is sufficiently complete as to be certified as trademark UNIX br Cygwin MSYS and MSYS each provide a GNU environment on top of the Microsoft Windows user API sufficient for most common open source software to be compiled and run br The MKS Toolkit and UWIN are comprehensive interoperability tools which allow the porting of Unix programs to Windows br Windows NT type systems have a POSIX environmental subsystem br Subsystem for Unix based Applications previously Interix provides Unix like functionality as a Windows NT subsystem discontinued br Windows Subsystem for Linux provides a Linux compatible kernel interface developed by Microsoft and containing no Linux code with Ubuntu user mode binaries running on top of it br Windows Subsystem for Linux version WSL provides a fully functional Linux environment running in a virtual machine br OpenHarmony employs the third party musl libc library and native APIs ports providing support on POSIX for Linux syscalls within the Linux kernel and LiteOS default kernels side of the system multi kernel Kernel Abstract Layer subsystem for vendor and developers interoperability br HarmonyOS with HarmonyOS NEXT system has OpenHarmony user mode that contains musl libc library and native APIs ports providing support with POSIX for Linux syscalls within the default kernels of the Linux kernel standard system and LiteOS small and lightweight system side of the system multi kernel Kernel Abstract Layer subsystem for interoperability on legacy Unix like functionalities br Other means of Windows Unix interoperability include br br The above Windows packages can be used with various X servers for Windows br Hummingbird Connectivity provides several ways for Windows machines to connect to Unix and Linux machines from terminal emulators to X clients and servers and others br The Windows Resource Kits for versions of Windows NT include a Bourne Shell some command line tools and a version of Perl br Hamilton C shell is a version of csh written specifically for Windows br
