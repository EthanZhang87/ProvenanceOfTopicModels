title: Session type
id: 68644033
In type theory session types are used to ensure correctness in concurrent programs They guarantee that messages sent and received between concurrent programs are in the expected order and of the expected type Session type systems have been adapted for both channel and actor systems br Session types are used to ensure desirable properties in concurrent and distributed systems i e absence of communication errors or deadlocks and protocol conformance br br br Binary versus multiparty session types br Interaction between two processes can be checked using binary session types while interactions between more than two processes can be checked using multiparty session types In multiparty session types interactions between all participants are described using a global type which is then projected into local types that describe communication from the local view of each participant Importantly the global type encodes the sequencing information of the communication which would be lost if we were to use binary session types to encode the same communication br br br Formal definition of binary session types br Binary session types can be described using send operations br br br br br br br displaystyle br br receive operations br br br br br br br displaystyle br br branches br br br br br br br displaystyle br br selections br br br br br br br displaystyle oplus br br recursion br br br br r br e br c br br br displaystyle rec br br and termination br br br br e br n br d br br br displaystyle end br br br For example br br br br S br br br br b br o br o br l br br br i br n br t br br e br n br d br br br displaystyle S bool int end br br represents a session type br br br br S br br br displaystyle S br br which first sends a boolean br br br br br b br o br o br l br br br displaystyle bool br br then receives an integer br br br br br i br n br t br br br displaystyle int br br before finally terminating br br br br e br n br d br br br displaystyle end br br br br br Implementations br Session types have been adapted for several existing programming languages including br br lchannels Scala br Effpi Scala br STMonitor Scala br EnsembleS br Session types Rust br sesh Rust br Session Actors Python br Monitored Session Erlang Erlang br FuSe OCaml br session ocaml OCaml br Priority Sesh Haskell br Java Typestate Checker Java br Swift Sessions Swift br br br
