A dichotomy is a partition of a whole or a set into two parts subsets In other words this couple of parts must be br br jointly exhaustive everything must belong to one part or the other and br mutually exclusive nothing can belong simultaneously to both parts br If there is a concept A and it is split into parts B and not B then the parts form a dichotomy they are mutually exclusive since no part of B is contained in not B and vice versa and they are jointly exhaustive since they cover all of A and together again give A br Such a partition is also frequently called a bipartition The two parts thus formed are complements In logic the partitions are opposites if there exists a proposition such that it holds over one and not the other Treating continuous variables or multicategorical variables as binary variables is called dichotomization The discretization error inherent in dichotomization is temporarily ignored for modeling purposes br br br Etymology br The term dichotomy is from the Greek language Greek dichotom a dividing in two from d cha in two asunder and tom a cutting incision br br br Usage and examples br In set theory a dichotomous relation R is such that either aRb bRa but not both br A false dichotomy is an informal fallacy consisting of a supposed dichotomy which fails one or both of the conditions it is not jointly exhaustive and or not mutually exclusive In its most common form two entities are presented as if they are exhaustive when in fact other alternatives are possible In some cases they may be presented as if they are mutually exclusive although there is a broad middle ground see also undistributed middle br One type of dichotomy is dichotomous classification classifying objects by recursively splitting them into two groups As Lewis Carroll explains After dividing a Class by the Process of Dichotomy into two smaller Classes we may sub divide each of these into two still smaller Classes and this Process may be repeated over and over again the number of Classes being doubled at each repetition For example we may divide books into old and new i e not old we may then sub divide each of these into English and foreign i e not English thus getting four Classes br In statistics dichotomous data may only exist at first two levels of measurement namely at the nominal level of measurement such as British vs American when measuring nationality and at the ordinal level of measurement such as tall vs short when measuring height A variable measured dichotomously is called a dummy variable br In computer science more specifically in programming language engineering dichotomies are fundamental dualities in a language s design For instance C has a dichotomy in its memory model heap versus stack whereas Java has a dichotomy in its type system references versus primitive data types br In astronomy dichotomy is when the Moon or an inferior planet is exactly half lit as viewed from Earth For the Moon this occurs slightly before one quarter Moon orbit and slightly after the third quarter of the Moon s orbit at and respectively This is not to be confused with quadrature which is when the Sun Earth Moon superior planet angle is br In botany branching may be dichotomous or axillary In dichotomous branching the branches form as a result of an equal division of a terminal bud i e a bud formed at the apex of a stem into two equal branches This also applies to root systems as well br br br See also br br br
