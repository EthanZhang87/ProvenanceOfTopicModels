Freemium a portmanteau of the words free and premium is a pricing strategy by which a basic product or service is provided free of charge but money a premium is charged for additional features services or virtual online or physical offline goods that expand the functionality of the free version of the software This business model has been used in the software industry since the s A subset of this model used by the video game industry is called free to play br br br Origin br The business model has been in use for software since the s The term freemium to describe this model appears to have been created much later in response to a blog post by venture capitalist Fred Wilson summarizing the model Give your service away for free possibly ad supported but maybe not acquire a lot of customers very efficiently through word of mouth referral networks organic search marketing etc then offer premium priced value added services or an enhanced version of your service to your customer base Jarid Lukin of Alacra one of Wilson s portfolio companies then suggested the term freemium for this model br In Chris Anderson published the book Free which examines the popularity of this business model As well as for traditional proprietary software and services it is now also often used by Web and open source companies In Eric Seufert published the book Freemium Economics which attempts to deconstruct the economic principles of the freemium model and prescribe a framework for implementing them into software products br The freemium model is closely related to tiered services Notable examples include LinkedIn Badoo Discord and in the form of a soft paywall such as those employed by The New York Times and La Presse This is often in a time limited or feature limited version to promote a paid for full version The model is particularly suited to software as the cost of distribution is negligible br A freemium model is sometimes used to build a consumer base when the marginal cost of producing extra units is low Thus little is lost by giving away free software licenses as long as significant cannibalization is avoided Other examples include free to play games video games that can be downloaded without paying Video game publishers of free to play games rely on other means to generate revenue such as optional in game virtual items that can be purchased by players to enhance gameplay or aesthetics br br br Types of product limitations br Ways in which the product or service may be limited or restricted in the free version include br br Limited features A free video chat client may not include three way video calling Most free to play games fall into this category as they offer virtual items that are either impossible or very slow to purchase with in game currency but can be instantly purchased with real world money br Limited capacity For example SQL Server Express is restricted to databases of GB or less br Limited use license For example most Autodesk or Microsoft software products with full features are free for student with an educational license See Microsoft Imagine Some apps like CCleaner are free for personal use only br Limited use time Most free to play games permit the user to play the game consecutively for a limited number of levels or turns the player must either wait a period of time to play more or purchase the right to play more br Limited support Priority or real time technical support may not be available for non paying users For example Comodo offers all its software products free of charge Its premium offerings only add various kinds of technical support br Limited or no access to online services that are only available by purchasing periodic subscriptions br Some software and services make all of the features available for free for a trial period and then at the end of that period revert to operating as a feature limited free version e g Online Armor Personal Firewall The user can unlock the premium features on payment of a license fee as per the freemium model Some businesses use a variation of the model known as open core in which the unsupported feature limited free version is also open source software but versions with additional features and official support are commercial software br br br Significance br In June PC World reported that traditional anti virus software had started to lose market share to freemium anti virus products By September all but two of the highest grossing apps in the Games section of Apple s iTunes App Store supported in app purchases leading Wired to conclude that game developers were now required to choose between including such purchases or foregoing a very substantial revenue stream Beginning in the digital distribution platform Steam began to add numerous free to play and early access games to its library many of which utilized freemium marketing for their in game economies Due to criticism that the multiplayer games falling under this category were pay to win in nature or were low quality and never finished development Valve has since added stricter rules to its early access and free to play policies br br br Criticism of freemium games br br Freemium games have come under criticism from players and critics Many are labelled with the derogatory term pay to win which criticizes freemium games for giving an advantage to players who pay more money as opposed to those who have more skill Criticisms also extend to the way that the business model can often appear unregulated to the point of encouraging prolific spending Freemium games are often designed in a manner where players who are not actively using premium features are actively frustrated delayed or require much larger investments in time required to acquire currency or upgrades br In November the animated TV series South Park aired an episode entitled Freemium Isn t Free The episode satirized the business model for encouraging predatory game design tactics based on an improper business model In Nintendo released two of their own freemium games in the Pok mon series based on other standalone purchasable titles With the title Pok mon Rumble World Nintendo took a different approach by making it possible to complete the entire game without buying premium credits but retaining them as an option so players can proceed through the game at a pace
