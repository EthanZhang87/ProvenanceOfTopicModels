score while Pac Man himself wanted to survive his encounters with the ghosts As characters such as Ms Pac Man were introduced later on Robinson noted this to anthropomorphize the character further for

recognizable br Jaakko Suominen and Saara Ala Luopa wrote that Pac Man was a root icon in video games alongside the enemies from Space Invaders as well as a leading example of the retro gaming economy

armchair nostalgia They highlighted this with the numerous pieces of official and unofficial merchandise of the character s original design as well as graffiti designs of the character present
