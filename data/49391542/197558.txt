br In a world inhabited by monsters the city of Monstropolis harnesses the screams of human children for energy At the Monsters Incorporated factory skilled monsters employed as scarers venture into the human world to scare children and harvest their screams through doors that activate portals to children s bedroom closets The work is considered dangerous as human children are believed to be toxic and capable of killing a monster through physical contact Monsters Inc CEO Henry J Waternoose III is concerned about the declining energy production as children are becoming less easily scared br One evening after work top scarer James P Sulley Sullivan discovers that an active door has been left in the station of his rival Randall Boggs He inspects the door and accidentally lets a toddler girl into the factory Frightened Sulley unsuccessfully tries returning the girl who escapes into Monstropolis interrupting Sulley s best friend and assistant Mike Wazowski on a date at a sushi restaurant Chaos erupts when other monsters see the girl Sulley and Mike escape with her as the Child Detection Agency CDA arrives and quarantines the restaurant Forced to keep the girl hidden in their apartment for the night Sulley realizes that she is not toxic and her laughter can generate more energy than screams br The next day Sulley and Mike disguise the girl as a monster and attempt to send her home While Mike seeks out her door Sulley grows attached to her and nicknames her Boo Randall waiting in ambush for the girl kidnaps Mike by accident and reveals his plan to kidnap children and extract screams from them using his invention the Scream Extractor Sulley rescues Mike and they search for Waternoose to alert him of Randall s plan Boo reveals herself to Waternoose who reveals that he is working with Randall Waternoose abducts Boo before banishing Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas in the human world br Sulley finds a way to return to the monster world but Mike refuses to go with him Sulley returns to the factory and rescues Boo from the Scream Extractor but Randall fights him Mike returns to reconcile with Sulley and both search for Boo s door Randall eventually catches up to the trio but Boo easily defeats him Sulley and Mike hurl Randall through a door to the human world and destroy it br Mike and Sulley locate Boo s door but Waternoose brings it down to the scare floor intending to have the CDA arrest Mike and Sulley Mike distracts the CDA while Sulley and Boo lure Waternoose into a scare simulation room There Sulley tricks Waternoose into revealing his conspiracy with Randall to kidnap thousands of children Mike records the conversation exposing Waternoose to the CDA and Waternoose is arrested Undercover CDA agent Roz allows Sulley to send Boo home but has her door destroyed Sulley retools the company s power generation method to harvest children s laughter instead of screams as laughter is ten times more powerful With the energy crisis solved

tackling him shaving his entire body and sterilizing him He is good friends with coworker Pete Claws Ward br br br Production br br br Development br br The idea for Monsters Inc along with ideas that would eventually become A Bug s Life Finding Nemo and WALL E was conceived in a lunch in attended by John Lasseter Pete Docter Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during the near completion of Toy Story One of the ideas that came out of the brainstorming session was a film about monsters When we were making Toy Story Docter said everybody came up to me and said Hey I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room So when Disney asked us to do some more films I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid So I said Hey let s do a film about monsters br Docter began work on the film that was to become Monsters Inc in while others focused on A Bug s Life and Toy Story Its code name was Hidden City named for Docter s favorite restaurant in Point Richmond By early February Docter had drafted a treatment together with Harley Jessup Jill Culton and Jeff Pidgeon that bore some resemblance to the final film Docter pitched the story to Disney with some initial artwork on February that year He and his story team left with some suggestions in hand and returned to pitch a refined version of the story on May At this pitch meeting longtime Disney animator Joe Grant whose work stretched back to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs suggested the title Monsters Inc a play on the title of a gangster film Murder Inc which stuck The film marks the first Pixar feature to not be directed by Lasseter instead being helmed by Docter as well as Lee Unkrich and David Silverman who served as co directors The early test of Monsters Inc was released on October br br br Writing br The storyline took on many forms during production Docter s original idea featured a year old man dealing with monsters that he drew in a book as a child coming back to bother him as an adult Each monster represented a fear he had and conquering those fears caused the monsters to eventually disappear br After Docter scrapped the initial concept of a year old terrified of monsters he decided on a buddy story between a monster and a child titled simply Monsters in which the monster character of Sulley known at this stage as Johnson was an up and comer at his workplace where the company s purpose was to scare children Sulley s eventual sidekick Mike Wazowski had not yet been added br Between and the lead monster and child went through radical changes as the story evolved As the story continued to develop the child varied in age and gender Ultimately the story team decided that a girl would be the best counterpart for a furry foot tall m co star After a girl was settled upon the character continued to undergo changes at one point being from Ireland and at another time being an African American character Originally the character of the little girl known as Mary became a fearless seven year old who has been toughened by years of teasing and pranks from four older brothers In stark contrast Johnson is nervous about the possibility of losing his job after the boss at Monsters Inc announces a downsizing is on the way He feels envious because another scarer Ned who later became Randall is the company s top performer Through various drafts Johnson s occupation went back and forth from being a scarer and from working in another area of the company such as a janitor or a refinery worker until his final incarnation as the best scarer at Monsters Inc Throughout development Pixar worried that having a main character whose main goal was to scare children would alienate audiences and make them not empathize with him Docter would later describe that the team bent over backwards trying to create a story that still had monsters while still attempting to solve the problem A key moment came when the team decided Okay he s the BEST scarer there He s the star quarterback with Docter noting that before that moment design after design we really didn t know what he was about Disney noted to Pixar early on that they did not want the character to look like a guy in a suit To this end Johnson was originally planned to have tentacles for feet however this caused many problems in early animation tests The idea was later largely rejected as it was thought that audiences would be distracted by the tentacles Mary s age also differed from draft to draft until the writers settled on the age of three We found that the younger she was the more dependent she was on Sulley Docter said br Eventually Johnson was renamed Sullivan Sullivan was also planned to wear glasses throughout the film However the creators found it a dangerous idea because the eyes were a perfectly readable and clear way of expressing a character s personality thus this idea was also rejected br The idea of a monster buddy for the lead monster emerged at an April story summit in Burbank with employees from Disney and Pixar A term coined by Lasseter a story summit was a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in only two days Such a character the group agreed would give the lead monster someone to talk to about his predicament Development artist Ricky Nierva drew a concept sketch of a rounded one eyed monster as a concept for the character and everyone was generally receptive to it Docter named the character Mike for the father of his friend Frank Oz a director and Muppet performer Jeff Pidgeon and Jason Katz story boarded a test in which Mike helps Sulley choose a tie for work and Mike Wazowski soon became a vital character in the film Originally Mike had no arms and had to use his legs as appendages however due to some technical difficulties arms were soon added to him br Screenwriter Daniel Gerson joined Pixar in and worked on the film with the filmmakers on a daily basis for almost two years He considered it his first experience in writing a feature film He explained I would sit with Pete Docter and David Silverman and we would talk about a scene and they would tell me what they were looking for I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence We d get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist Here s where the collaborative process really kicked in The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there Sometimes I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually Once the scene moved on to animation the animators would plus the material even further br Docter has cited the film Paper Moon as inspiration for the concept of someone experiencing getting stuck with a kid who turns out to be the real expert and he credits Lasseter for coming up with the laughter is ten times more powerful than fear concept br br br Casting br Bill Murray was considered for the voice role of James P Sulley Sullivan He screen tested for the role and was interested but when Pete Docter was unable to make contact with him he took it as a no The voice role of Sulley went to John Goodman the longtime co star of the comedy series Roseanne and a regular in the films of the Coen brothers Goodman interpreted the character to himself as the monster equivalent of a National Football League player He s like a seasoned lineman in the tenth year of his career he said at the time He is totally dedicated and a total pro Billy Crystal having regretted turning down the part of Buzz Lightyear years prior accepted that of Mike Wazowski Sulley s one eyed best friend and scare assistant br br br Animation br br In November early in the production of Monsters Inc Pixar packed up and moved for the second time since its Lucasfilm Ltd years The company s approximately employees had become spread among three buildings separated by a busy highway The company moved from Point Richmond to a much bigger campus in Emeryville co designed by Lasseter and Steve Jobs br In production the film differed from earlier Pixar features as every main character in this movie had its own lead animator John Kahrs on Sulley Andrew Gordon on Mike and Dave DeVan on Boo Kahrs found that the bearlike quality of Goodman s voice provided an exceptionally good fit with the character He faced a difficult challenge however in dealing with Sulley s sheer mass traditionally animators conveyed a figure s heaviness by giving it a slower more belabored movement but Kahrs was concerned that such an approach to a central character would give the film a sluggish feel Like Goodman Kahrs came to think of Sulley as a football player one whose athleticism enabled him to move quickly in spite of his size To help the animators with Sulley and other large monsters Pixar arranged for Rodger Kram a University of California Berkeley expert on the locomotion of heavy mammals to lecture on the subject br Adding to Sulley s lifelike appearance was an intense effort by the technical team to refine the rendering of fur Other production houses had tackled realistic fur most notably Rhythm Hues in its polar bear commercials for Coca Cola and in its talking animals faces in the film Babe This film however required fur on a much larger scale From the standpoint of Pixar s engineers the quest for fur posed several significant challenges one was to figure out how to animate a large number of hairs of them on Sulley in a reasonably efficient way and another was to make sure that the hairs cast shadows on other ones Without self shadowing either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat colored look e g in Toy Story the hair on Andy s toddler sister as seen in that movie s opening sequence is hair without self shadowing br The first fur test allowed Sulley to run an obstacle course Results were not satisfactory as such objects caught and stretched out the fur due to the extreme amount of motion Another similar test was also unsuccessful because this time the fur went through the objects br Pixar then set up a Simulation department and created a new fur simulation program called Fizt short for physics tool After a shot with Sulley in it had been animated this department took the data for that shot and added Sulley s fur Fizt allowed the fur to react in a more natural way Every time when Sulley had to move his fur automatically reacted to his movements thus taking the effects of wind and gravity into account as well The Fizt program also controlled the movement of Boo s clothes which provided another breakthrough The deceptively simple sounding task of animating cloth was also a challenge to animate thanks to those hundreds of creases and wrinkles that automatically occurred in the clothing when the wearer moved Also this meant they had to solve the complex problem of how to keep cloth untangled in other words to keep it from passing through itself when parts of it intersect Fizt applied the same system to Boo s clothes as to Sulley s fur First of all Boo was animated shirtless the Simulation department then used Fizt to apply the shirt over Boo s body and every time she moved her clothes also reacted to her movements in a more natural manner br To solve the problem of cloth to cloth collisions Michael Kass Pixar s senior scientist was joined on Monsters Inc by David Baraff and Andrew Witkin and developed an algorithm they called global intersection analysis to handle the problem The complexity of the shots in the film including elaborate sets such as the door vault required more computing power to render than any of Pixar s earlier efforts combined The render farm in place for Monsters Inc was made up of Sun Microsystems processors compared with for Toy Story and only for Toy Story both built on Sun s own RISC based SPARC processor architecture br The scene in which the Harryhausen s restaurant was decontaminated was originally going to feature the restaurant being blown up Due to the September attacks the explosion was replaced by a plasma dome br br br Music br br Monsters Inc was Randy Newman s fourth feature film collaboration with Pixar The end credits song If I Didn t Have You was sung by John Goodman and Billy Crystal br The album was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score and a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media The score lost both these awards to The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring but after sixteen nominations the song If I Didn t Have You finally won Newman his first Academy Award for Best Original Song During his acceptance speech he jokingly said I don t want your pity It also won a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media
