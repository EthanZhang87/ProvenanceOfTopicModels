Melbourne MEL b rn locally m lb n Boonwurrung Woiwurrung Narrm or Naarm is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Victoria and the second most populous city in Australia after Sydney Its name generally refers to a km sq mi metropolitan area also known as Greater Melbourne comprising an urban agglomeration of local municipalities although the name is also used specifically for the local municipality of City of Melbourne based around its central business area br The metropolis occupies much of the northern and eastern coastlines of Port Phillip Bay and spreads into the Mornington Peninsula part of West Gippsland as well as the hinterlands towards the Yarra Valley the Dandenong Ranges and the Macedon Ranges Melbourne has a population over million of the population of Australia as of the census mostly residing to the east of the city centre and its inhabitants are commonly referred to as Melburnians br The area of Melbourne has been home to Aboriginal Victorians for over years and serves as an important meeting place for local Kulin nation clans Of the five peoples of the Kulin nation the traditional custodians of the land encompassing Melbourne are the Boonwurrung Wathaurong and the Wurundjeri peoples A short lived penal settlement was built in at Port Phillip then part of the British colony of New South Wales However it was not until with the arrival of free settlers from Van Diemen s Land modern day Tasmania that Melbourne was founded It was incorporated as a Crown settlement in and named after William Lamb nd Viscount Melbourne who was then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom In four years after Queen Victoria declared it a city Melbourne became the capital of the new colony of Victoria During the s Victorian gold rush the city entered a lengthy boom period that by the late s had transformed it into one of the world s largest and wealthiest metropolises After the federation of Australia in Melbourne served as the interim seat of government of the new nation until Canberra became the permanent capital in Today it is a leading financial centre in the Asia Pacific region and ranked nd globally in the March Global Financial Centres Index br Melbourne is home of many of Australia s best known landmarks such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground the National Gallery of Victoria and the World Heritage listed Royal Exhibition Building Noted for its cultural heritage the city gave rise to Australian rules football Australian impressionism and Australian cinema and has more recently been recognised as a UNESCO City of Literature and a global centre for street art live music and theatre It hosts major annual international events such as the Australian Grand Prix and the Australian Open and also hosted the Summer Olympics Melbourne consistently ranked as the world s most liveable city for much of the s br Melbourne Airport also known as the Tullamarine Airport is the second busiest airport in Australia and the Port of Melbourne is the nation s busiest seaport Its main metropolitan rail terminus is Flinders Street station and its main regional rail and road coach terminus is Southern Cross station It also has Australia s most extensive freeway network and the largest urban tram network in the world br br br History br br br Early history and foundation br br Aboriginal Australians have lived in the Melbourne area for at least years When European colonisers arrived in the th century at least Kulin people from three distinct language groups the Wurundjeri Bunurong and Wathaurong resided in the area It was an important meeting place for the clans of the Kulin nation alliance and a vital source of food and water In June the boundaries between the land of two of the traditional owner groups the Wurundjeri and Bunurong were agreed after being drawn up by the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council The borderline runs across the city from west to east with the CBD Richmond and Hawthorn included in Wurundjeri land and Albert Park St Kilda and Caulfield on Bunurong land However this change in boundaries is still disputed by people on both sides of the dispute including N arweet Carolyn Briggs The name Narrm is commonly used by the broader Aboriginal community to refer to the city stemming from the traditional name recorded for the area on which the Melbourne city centre is built The word is closely related to Narm narm being the Boonwurrung word for Port Phillip Bay Narrm means scrub in Eastern Kulin languages which reflects the Creation Story of how the Bay was filled by the creation of the Birrarung Yarra River Before this the dry Melbourne region extended out into the Bay and the Bay was filled with teatree scrub where boordmul emu and marram kangaroo were hunted br The first British settlement in Victoria then part of the penal colony of New South Wales was established by Colonel David Collins in October at Sullivan Bay near present day Sorrento The following year due to a perceived lack of resources these settlers relocated to Van Diemen s Land present day Tasmania and founded the city of Hobart It would be years before another settlement was attempted br br In May and June John Batman a leading member of the Port Phillip Association in Van Diemen s Land explored the Melbourne area and later claimed to have negotiated a purchase of km acres with eight Wurundjeri elders However the nature of the treaty has been heavily disputed as none of the parties spoke the same language and the elders likely perceived it as part of the gift exchanges which had taken place over the previous few days amounting to a tanderrum ceremony which allows temporary not permanent access to and use of the land Batman selected a site on the northern bank of the Yarra River declaring that this will be the place for a village before returning to Van Diemen s Land In August another group of Vandemonian settlers arrived in the area and established a settlement at the site of the current Melbourne Immigration Museum Batman and his group arrived the following month and the two groups ultimately agreed to share the settlement initially known by the native name of Dootigala br Batman s Treaty with the Aboriginal elders was annulled by Richard Bourke the Governor of New South Wales who at the time governed all of eastern mainland Australia with compensation paid to members of the association In Bourke declared the city the administrative capital of the Port Phillip District of New South Wales and commissioned the first plan for its urban layout the Hoddle Grid in Known briefly as Batmania the settlement was named Melbourne on April by Bourke after the British Prime Minister William Lamb nd Viscount Melbourne whose seat was Melbourne Hall in the market town of Melbourne Derbyshire That year the settlement s general post office officially opened with that name br Between and Victorian Aboriginal groups were largely dispossessed of their land by European settlers By January there were said to be Aboriginal people resident in squalid camps in Melbourne The British Colonial Office appointed five Aboriginal Protectors for the Aboriginal people of Victoria in however their work was nullified by a land policy that favoured squatters who took possession of Aboriginal lands By fewer than wealthy Europeans held all the pastoral licences then issued in Victoria and became a powerful political and economic force in Victoria for generations to come br Letters patent of Queen Victoria issued on June declared Melbourne a city On July the Port Phillip District separated from New South Wales to become the Colony of Victoria with Melbourne as its capital br br br Victorian gold rush br br The discovery of gold in Victoria in mid sparked a gold rush and Melbourne the colony s major port experienced rapid growth Within months the city s population had nearly doubled from to inhabitants Exponential growth ensued and by Melbourne had overtaken Sydney as Australia s most populous city br An influx of intercolonial and international migrants particularly from Europe and China saw the establishment of slums including Chinatown and a temporary tent city on the southern banks of the Yarra In the aftermath of the Eureka Rebellion mass public support for the plight of the miners resulted in major political changes to the colony including improvements in working conditions across mining agriculture manufacturing and other local industries At least twenty nationalities took part in the rebellion giving some indication of immigration flows at the time br With the wealth brought in from the gold rush and the subsequent need for public buildings a program of grand civic construction soon began The s and s saw the commencement of Parliament House the Treasury Building the Old Melbourne Gaol Victoria Barracks the State Library University of Melbourne General Post Office Customs House the Melbourne Town Hall St Patrick s cathedral though many remained incomplete for decades with some still not finished as of br The layout of the inner suburbs on a largely one mile grid pattern cut through by wide radial boulevards and parklands surrounding the central city was largely established in the s and s These areas rapidly filled with the ubiquitous terrace houses as well as with detached houses and grand mansions while some of the major roads developed as shopping streets Melbourne quickly became a major finance centre home to several banks the Royal Mint and in Australia s first stock exchange br In the Melbourne Cricket Club secured possession of its now famous ground the MCG Members of the Melbourne Football Club codified Australian football in and in the first Melbourne Cup race was held Melbourne acquired its first public monument the Burke and Wills statue in br With the gold rush largely over by Melbourne continued to grow on the back of continuing gold mining as the major port for exporting the agricultural products of Victoria especially wool and with a developing manufacturing sector protected by high tariffs An extensive radial railway network spread into the countryside from the late s Construction started on further major public buildings in the s and s such as the Supreme Court Government House and the Queen Victoria Market The central city filled up with shops and offices workshops and warehouses Large banks and hotels faced the main streets with fine townhouses in the east end of Collins Street contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks The Aboriginal population continued to decline with an estimated total decrease by due primarily to introduced diseases particularly smallpox frontier violence and dispossession of their lands br br br Land boom and bust br br The s saw extraordinary growth consumer confidence easy access to credit and steep increases in land prices led to an enormous amount of construction During this land boom Melbourne reputedly became the richest city in the world and the second largest after London in the British Empire br The decade began with the Melbourne International Exhibition in held in the large purpose built Exhibition Building A telephone exchange was established that year and the foundations of St Paul s were laid In electric light was installed in the Eastern Market and a generating station capable of supplying incandescent lamps was in operation by The Melbourne cable tramway system opened in and became one of the world s most extensive systems by br In visiting English journalist George Augustus Henry Sala coined the phrase Marvellous Melbourne which stuck long into the twentieth century and has come to refer to the opulence and energy of the s during which time large commercial buildings grand hotels banks coffee palaces terrace housing and palatial mansions proliferated in the city The establishment of the Melbourne Hydraulic Power Company in led to the availability of high pressure piped water allowing for the installation of hydraulically powered elevators which led to the construction of the first high rise buildings in the city The period also saw the huge expansion of a significant radial rail based transport network throughout the city and suburbs br Melbourne s land boom peaked in the year it hosted the Centennial Exhibition The brash boosterism that had typified Melbourne during that time ended in the early s The bubble supporting the local finance and property industries burst resulting in a severe economic depression Sixteen small land banks and building societies collapsed and limited companies went into liquidation The Melbourne financial crisis was a contributing factor to the Australian economic depression of the s and the Australian banking crisis of The effects of the depression on the city were profound with virtually no significant construction until the late s br br br Temporary capital of Australia and World War II br br At the time of Australia s federation on January Melbourne became the seat of government of the federated Commonwealth of Australia The first federal parliament convened on May in the Royal Exhibition Building subsequently moving to the Victorian Parliament House where it sat until it moved to Canberra in The Governor General of Australia resided at Government House in Melbourne until and many major national institutions remained in Melbourne well into the twentieth century br During World War II the city hosted American military forces who were fighting the Empire of Japan and the government requisitioned the Melbourne Cricket Ground for military use br br br Post war period br In the immediate years after World War II Melbourne expanded rapidly its growth boosted by post war immigration to Australia primarily from Southern Europe and the Mediterranean While the Paris End of Collins Street began Melbourne s boutique shopping and open air cafe cultures the city centre was seen by many as stale the dreary domain of office workers something expressed by John Brack in his famous painting Collins St pm Up until the st century Melbourne was considered Australia s industrial heartland br br Height limits in the CBD were lifted in after the construction of ICI House transforming the city s skyline with the introduction of skyscrapers Suburban expansion then intensified served by new indoor malls beginning with Chadstone Shopping Centre The post war period also saw a major renewal of the CBD and St Kilda Road which significantly modernised the city New fire regulations and redevelopment saw most of the taller pre war CBD buildings either demolished or partially retained through a policy of facadism Many of the larger suburban mansions from the boom era were also either demolished or subdivided br To counter the trend towards low density suburban residential growth the government began a series of controversial public housing projects in the inner city by the Housing Commission of Victoria which resulted in the demolition of many neighbourhoods and a proliferation of high rise towers In later years with the rapid rise of motor vehicle ownership the investment in freeway and highway developments greatly accelerated the outward suburban sprawl and declining inner city population The Bolte government sought to rapidly accelerate the modernisation of Melbourne Major road projects including the remodelling of St Kilda Junction the widening of Hoddle Street and then the extensive Melbourne Transportation Plan changed the face of the city into a car dominated environment br Australia s financial and mining booms during and resulted in establishment of the headquarters of many major companies BHP and Rio Tinto among others in the city Nauru s then booming economy resulted in several ambitious investments in Melbourne such as Nauru House Melbourne remained Australia s main business and financial centre until the late s when it began to lose this primacy to Sydney br Melbourne experienced an economic downturn between and following the collapse of several local financial institutions In the newly elected Kennett government began a campaign to revive the economy with an aggressive development campaign of public works coupled with the promotion of the city as a tourist destination with a focus on major events and sports tourism During this period the Australian Grand Prix moved to Melbourne from Adelaide Major projects included the construction of a new facility for the Melbourne Museum Federation Square the Melbourne Convention Exhibition Centre Crown Casino and the CityLink tollway Other strategies included the privatisation of some of Melbourne s services including power and public transport and a reduction in funding to public services such as health education and public transport infrastructure br br br Contemporary Melbourne br br Since the mid s Melbourne has maintained significant population and employment growth There has been substantial international investment in the city s industries and property market Major inner city urban renewal has occurred in areas such as Southbank Port Melbourne Melbourne Docklands and South Wharf Melbourne sustained the highest population increase and economic growth rate of any Australian capital city from to br From the growth of the city extended into green wedges and beyond the city s urban growth boundary Predictions of the city s population reaching million people pushed the state government to review the growth boundary in as part of its Melbourne Five Million strategy In Melbourne was less affected by the late s financial crisis in comparison to other Australian cities At this time more new jobs were created in Melbourne than any other Australian city almost as many as the next two fastest growing cities Brisbane and Perth combined and Melbourne s property market remained highly priced resulting in historically high property prices and widespread rent increases br Beginning in the s the State Government of Victoria initiated a number of major infrastructure projects designed to reduce congestion in Melbourne and encourage economic growth including the Metro Tunnel the West Gate Tunnel the Level Crossing Removal Project and the Suburban Rail Loop New urban renewal zones were initiated in inner city areas like Fisherman s Bend and Arden while suburban growth continued on the urban periphery in Melbourne s outer west and east in suburbs like Wyndham Vale and Cranbourne Middle suburbs like Box Hill became denser as a greater proportion of Melburnians began living in apartments A construction boom resulted in new skyscrapers being built in the central business district between and In Melbourne was classified as an Alpha city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network br Out of all major Australian cities Melbourne was the worst affected by the COVID pandemic and spent a long time under lockdown restrictions with Melbourne experiencing six lockdowns totalling days While this contributed to a net outflow of migration causing a slight reduction in Melbourne s population over the course of to Melbourne is projected to be the fastest growing capital city in Australia from onwards overtaking Sydney as the nation s largest city in at just over million exceeding million people the following year br br br Geography br br Melbourne is in the southeastern part of mainland Australia within the state of Victoria Geologically it is built on the confluence of Quaternary lava flows to the west Silurian mudstones to the east and Holocene sand accumulation to the southeast along Port Phillip The southeastern suburbs are situated on the Selwyn fault which transects Mount Martha and Cranbourne The western portion of the metropolitan area lies within the Victorian Volcanic Plain grasslands vegetation community and the southeast falls in the Gippsland Plains Grassy Woodland zone br Melbourne extends along the Yarra River towards the Yarra Valley and the Dandenong Ranges to the east It extends northward through the undulating bushland valleys of the Yarra s tributaries Moonee Ponds Creek toward Tullamarine Airport Merri Creek Darebin Creek and Plenty River to the outer suburban growth corridors of Craigieburn and Whittlesea br The city reaches southeast through Dandenong to the growth corridor of Pakenham towards West Gippsland and southward through the Dandenong Creek valley and the city of Frankston In the west it extends along the Maribyrnong River and its tributaries north towards Sunbury and the foothills of the Macedon Ranges and along the flat volcanic plain country towards Melton in the west Werribee at the foothills of the You Yangs granite ridge southwest of the CBD The Little River and the township of the same name marks the border between Melbourne and neighbouring Geelong city br Melbourne s major bayside beaches are in the various suburbs along the shores of Port Phillip Bay in areas like Port Melbourne Albert Park St Kilda Elwood Brighton Sandringham Mentone Frankston Altona Williamstown and Werribee South The nearest surf beaches are km mi south of the Melbourne CBD in the back beaches of Rye Sorrento and Portsea br br br Climate br br Melbourne has a temperate oceanic climate K ppen climate classification Cfb bordering on a humid subtropical climate K ppen climate classification Cfa with warm summers and cool winters Melbourne is well known for its changeable weather conditions mainly due to it being located on the boundary of hot inland areas and the cool southern ocean This temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause strong cold fronts to form These cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from gales to thunderstorms and hail large temperature drops and heavy rain Winters while exceptionally dry by south central Victorian standards are nonetheless drizzly and overcast The lack of winter rainfall is owed to Melbourne s rain shadowed location between the Otway and Macedon Ranges which block much of the rainfall arriving from the north and west br Port Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and or the land mass particularly in spring and autumn this can set up a bay effect similar to the lake effect seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places usually the eastern suburbs for an extended period while the rest of Melbourne and surrounds stays dry Overall the area around Melbourne is owing to its rain shadow nonetheless significantly drier than average for southern Victoria Within the city and surrounds rainfall varies widely from around mm in at Little River to mm in on the eastern fringe at Gembrook Melbourne receives clear days annually Dewpoint temperatures in the summer range from to C to F br Melbourne is also prone to isolated convective showers forming when a cold pool crosses the state especially if there is considerable daytime heating These showers are often heavy and can include hail squalls and significant drops in temperature but they often pass through very quickly with a rapid clearing trend to sunny and relatively calm weather and the temperature rising back to what it was before the shower This can occur in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times a day giving Melbourne a reputation for having four seasons in one day a phrase that is part of local popular culture The lowest temperature on record is C F on July The highest temperature recorded in Melbourne city was C F on February While snow is occasionally seen at higher elevations in the outskirts of the city and dustings were observed in it has not been recorded in the Central Business District since br The sea temperature in Melbourne is warmer than the surrounding ocean during the summer months and colder during the winter months This is predominately due to Port Phillip Bay being an enclosed and shallow bay that is largely protected from the ocean resulting in greater temperature variation across seasons br br br Urban structure br br Melbourne s urban area is approximately km the largest in Australia and the rd largest in the world The Hoddle Grid a grid of streets measuring approximately by mi by km forms the nucleus of Melbourne s central business district CBD The grid s southern edge fronts onto the Yarra River More recent office commercial and public developments in the adjoining districts of Southbank and Docklands have made these areas into extensions of the CBD in all but name A byproduct of the CBD s layout is its network of lanes and arcades such as Block Arcade and Royal Arcade br Melbourne s CBD has become Australia s most densely populated area with approximately residents per square kilometre and is home to more skyscrapers than any other Australian city the tallest being Australia situated in Southbank Melbourne s newest planned skyscraper Southbank By Beulah also known as Green Spine has recently been approved for construction and will be the tallest structure in Australia by br The CBD and surrounds also contain many significant historic buildings such as the Royal Exhibition Building the Melbourne Town Hall and Parliament House br Although the area is described as the centre it is not actually the demographic centre of Melbourne at all due to an urban sprawl to the southeast the demographic centre being located at Glen Iris br Melbourne is typical of Australian capital cities in that after the turn of the th century it expanded with the underlying notion of a quarter acre home and garden for every family often referred to locally as the Australian Dream This coupled with the popularity of the private automobile after led to the auto centric urban structure now present today in the middle and outer suburbs Much of metropolitan Melbourne is accordingly characterised by low density sprawl whilst its inner city areas feature predominantly medium density transit oriented urban forms The city centre Docklands St Kilda Road and Southbank areas feature high density forms br Melbourne is often referred to as Australia s garden city and the state of Victoria is known as the garden state There is an abundance of parks and gardens in Melbourne many close to the CBD with a variety of common and rare plant species amid landscaped vistas pedestrian pathways and tree lined avenues Melbourne s parks are often considered the best public parks in all of Australia s major cities There are also many parks in the surrounding suburbs of Melbourne such as in the municipalities of Stonnington Boroondara and Port Phillip southeast of the central business district Several national parks have been designated around the urban area of Melbourne including the Mornington Peninsula National Park Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park and Point Nepean National Park in the southeast Organ Pipes National Park to the north and Dandenong Ranges National Park to the east There are also a number of significant state parks just outside Melbourne The extensive area covered by urban Melbourne is formally divided into hundreds of suburbs for addressing and postal purposes and administered as local government areas of which are located within the metropolitan area br br br Housing br br Melbourne has minimal public housing and high demand for rental housing which is becoming unaffordable for some Public housing is managed and provided by the Victorian Government s Department of Families Fairness and Housing and operates within the framework of the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement by which both federal and state governments provide funding for housing br Melbourne is experiencing high population growth generating high demand for housing This housing boom has increased house prices and rents as well as the availability of all types of housing Subdivision regularly occurs in the outer areas of Melbourne with numerous developers offering house and land packages However since the release of Melbourne in planning policies have encouraged medium density and high density development in existing areas with good access to public transport and other services As a result of this Melbourne s middle and outer ring suburbs have seen significant brownfields redevelopment br br br Architecture br br On the back of the s gold rush and s land boom Melbourne became renowned as one of the world s great Victorian era cities a reputation that persists due to its diverse range of Victorian architecture High concentrations of well preserved Victorian era buildings can be found in the inner suburbs such as Carlton East Melbourne and South Melbourne Outstanding examples of Melbourne s built Victorian heritage include the World Heritage listed Royal Exhibition Building the General Post Office Hotel Windsor and the Block Arcade Comparatively little remains of Melbourne s pre gold rush architecture St James Old Cathedral and St Francis Church are among the few examples left in the CBD Many of the CBD s Victorian boom time landmarks were also demolished in the decades after World War II including the Federal Coffee Palace and the APA Building one of the tallest early skyscrapers upon completion Heritage listings and heritage overlays have since been introduced in an effort to prevent further losses of the city s historic fabric br br In line with the city s expansion during the early th century suburbs such as Hawthorn and Camberwell are defined largely by Federation and Edwardian architectural styles The City Baths built in are a prominent example of the latter style in the CBD The Nicholas Building is the city s grandest example of the Chicago School style while the influence of Art Deco is apparent in the Manchester Unity Building completed in br The city also features the Shrine of Remembrance which was built as a memorial to the men and women of Victoria who served in World War I and is now a memorial to all Australians who have served in war br Residential architecture is not defined by a single architectural style but rather an eclectic mix of large McMansion style houses particularly in areas of urban sprawl apartment buildings condominiums and townhouses which generally characterise the medium density inner city neighbourhoods Freestanding dwellings with relatively large gardens are perhaps the most common type of housing outside inner city Melbourne Victorian terrace housing townhouses and historic Italianate Tudor revival and Neo Georgian mansions are all common in inner city neighbourhoods such as Carlton Fitzroy and further into suburban enclaves like Toorak br br br Culture br br Often referred to as Australia s cultural capital Melbourne is recognised globally as a centre of sport music theatre comedy art literature film
