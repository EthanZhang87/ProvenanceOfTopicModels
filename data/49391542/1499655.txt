publicly traded companies do For example in the United States privately held companies are not generally required to publish their financial statements By not being required to disclose details about their operations and financial outlook private companies are not forced to disclose information that may potentially be valuable to competitors and can avoid the immediate erosion of customer and stakeholder confidence in the event of financial duress Further with limited reporting requirements and shareholder expectations private firms are afforded a greater operational flexibility by being able to focus on long term growth rather than quarterly earnings In addition private company executives may steer their ships without shareholder approval allowing them to take significant action without delays In Australia Part E of the Corporations Act requires that publicly traded companies file certain documents relating to their annual general meeting with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ASIC There is a similar requirement for large proprietary companies which are required to lodge Form H to the ASIC containing their financial report In the United States private
