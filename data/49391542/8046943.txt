title: Microtransaction
id: 8046943
Microtransactions mtx refers to a business model where users can purchase in game virtual goods with micropayments Microtransactions are often used in free to play games to provide a revenue source for the developers While microtransactions are a staple of the mobile app market they are also seen on PC software such as Valve s Steam digital distribution platform as well as console gaming br Free to play games that include a microtransaction model are sometimes referred to as freemium Another term pay to win is sometimes used pejoratively to refer to games where purchasing items in game can give a player an advantage over other players particularly if the items cannot be obtained through free means The objective with a free to play microtransaction model is to involve more players in the game by providing desirable items or features that players can purchase if they lack the skill or available time to earn these through regular game play Also presumably the game developer s marketing strategy is that in the long term the revenue from a micro transaction system will outweigh the revenue from a one time purchase game br Loot boxes are another form of microtransactions Through purchasing a loot box the player acquires a seemingly random assortment of items Loot boxes result in high revenues because instead of a one time purchase for the desired item users may have to buy multiple boxes This method has also been called a form of underage gambling Items and features available by microtransaction can range from cosmetic such as decorative character attire to functional such as weapons and items Some games allow players to purchase items that can be acquired through normal means but some games include items that can only be obtained through microtransaction Some developers ensure that only cosmetic items are accessible this way to keep gameplay fair and stable br The reasons why people especially children continue to pay for microtransactions are embedded in human psychology There has been considerable discussion over microtransactions and their effects on children as well as regulation and legislation efforts Microtransactions are most commonly provided through a custom store interface placed inside the app for which the items are being sold Apple and Google both provide frameworks for initiating and processing transactions and both take percent of all revenue generated by microtransactions sold through in app purchases in their respective app stores br br br History br Initially microtransactions in games took the form of exchanging real life money for the virtual currency used in the game that the user was playing The arcade game Double Dragon The Rosetta Stone was infamous for its use of microtransactions to purchase items in the game It had shops where players would insert coins into arcade machines to purchase upgrades power ups health weapons special moves and player characters The microtransaction revenue model gained popularity in South Korea with the success of Nexon s online free to play games starting with QuizQuiz followed by games such as MapleStory Mabinogi and Dungeon Fighter Online br Notable examples of games that used this model in the early s include the social networking site Habbo Hotel developed by the Finnish company Sulake and Linden Lab s virtual world game Second Life Both free games allow users to customize the clothing and style of their characters buy and collect furniture and purchase special flashy animations to show off to others using some type of virtual currency Habbo Hotel uses three different kinds of currency Credits or coins Duckets which are earned through accomplishing specific achievements during gameplay and Diamonds Diamonds are only obtained through buying Credits with real life money In Second Life the Linden Dollar L is the virtual currency used to power the game s internal economy L can be bought with real money through a marketplace developed by Linden Lab themselves LindeX Second Life in particular has generated massive amounts of economic activity and profits for both Linden Lab and Second Life s users In September worth of transactions were processed on the platform Both games are still active today br br The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion was released in March by Bethesda Softworks From April onwards Bethesda began releasing small downloadable packages of content from their website and over the Xbox Live Marketplace for the equivalent of between one and three US dollars The first package a set of horse armor barding for Oblivion s steeds was released on April costing Marketplace points equivalent to US or the corresponding PC release cost was US Bethesda offered no rationale for the price discrepancy These were not the first Oblivion related Marketplace releases the first was a series of dashboard themes and picture packs released prior to Oblivion s publication in February for a nominal fee nor were they entirely unexpected Bethesda had previously announced their desire to support the Xbox release with downloadable Marketplace content and other publishers had already begun to release similar packages for their games at similar prices A November release of a Winter Warrior Pack for Kameo Elements of Power was also priced at Marketplace points and similar content additions had been scheduled for Project Gotham Racing and Perfect Dark Zero Indeed Marketplace content additions formed a significant part of a March Microsoft announcement regarding the future of Xbox Live Downloadable in game content is a main focus of Microsoft s strategy heading into the next gen console war stated one GameSpot reporter With more consoles on their way to retail games available by June and new content and experiences coming to Xbox Live all the time there has never been a better time to own an Xbox announced Peter Moore Nonetheless although Xbox Live Arcade games picture packs dashboards and profile themes continued to be a Marketplace success for Microsoft the aforementioned in game content remained sparse Pete Hines asserted br We were the first ones to do downloadable content like that some people had done similar things but no one had really done additions where you add new stuff to your existing game There was no pressure from Microsoft to make the move br The horse armor content sold relatively poorly ranking ninth out of ten in DLC sales for Oblivion by Despite this Oblivion s horse armor became a model for many games that followed for implementing microtransactions in video games and is considered the first primary example and often synonymous for microtransactions br In June Electronic Arts introduced an online Store for The Sims It allowed players to purchase points that can be spent on in game items The Store has also been a part of The Sims since the game s release In The Sims Electronic Arts removed the ability to buy single items instead downloadable content is provided exclusively via expansion packs br In the late s and early s games like Facebook s FarmVille Electronic Arts s The Simpsons Tapped Out and Supercell s Clash of Clans pioneered a new approach to implanting microtransactions into games In conjunction with having virtual currency be used to purchase items tools furniture and animals These mobile games made it so users can purchase currency and then use that currency to reduce or eliminate the wait times attached to certain actions like planting and growing carrots or collecting taxes from the townspeople br In March the Ultimate Team game mode was introduced in FIFA in which gamers can buy packs containing items such as players stadiums and contract extensions with currency earned by playing the game or real world money EA followed this success by introducing the game mode to Madden NFL beginning with Madden NFL in January In March EA marked the fifth anniversary of Ultimate Team and shared statistics showing the explosive growth in popularity of the game mode By the late s Ultimate Team was generating billions of dollars every year br From around another major transition in how microtransactions are implemented in games occurred Live service games like Epic Games s Fortnite with constantly changing and updating content became more prevalent in the video game market These types of games heavily employ the use of the loot box microtransaction type According to the September report by the UK Parliament s House of Commons and the Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee they define loot boxes as items in video games that may be bought for real world money but which provide players with a randomised reward of uncertain value The widespread usage of loot boxes by game developers and publishers have garnered a great amount of criticism from gamers in the past decade Game developing corporations like Electronic Arts EA and Activision Blizzard make billions of dollars through the purchase of their microtransactions In FY EA raked in around billion and Activision Blizzard earned over billion respectively br The aforementioned Fortnite is an example of a microtransaction model in which all purchases are solely cosmetic players can choose to purchase skins cosmetic changes to the way characters weapons and vehicles look to show off to other players However a player can experience all the content of the game and be on an even playing field without purchasing any microtransactions because no feature or gameplay affecting piece of content is locked behind a payment These games still occasionally take accusations of being pay to win as combat focused video games such as Apex Legends or Call of Duty Warzone offer skins that are inspired by real world military equipment often including camouflage which technically can give players an advantage by obscuring them to human opponents br br br Impact br Mobile web analytics company Flurry reported on July that based on its research the revenue from free to play games had overtaken revenue from premium games that earn revenue through traditional means in Apple s App Store for the top grossing games when comparing the results for the months of January and June It used data that it analyzed through apps that installed the company s software in order to roughly determine the amount of revenue generated by other popular apps They discovered that free games represented of the total revenue from January and that the number jumped to by June helped in part by the fact that over of the top grossing apps are games This makes free to play the single most dominant business model in the mobile apps industry They also learned that the number of people that spend money on in game items in free to play games ranges from to depending on a game s quality and mechanics Even though this means that a large number of people will never spend money in a game it also means that the people that do spend money could amount to a sizeable number because the game was given away for free br A later study found that over of revenue generated on Android and iOS in came from free to play games such as Candy Crush Saga br Electronic Arts Corporate Vice President Peter Moore speculated in June that within to years all games will have transitioned to the microtransaction model Tommy Palm of King Candy Crush Saga expressed in his belief that all games will eventually be free to play According to Ex BioWare developer Manveer Heir in a interview microtransactions have become a factor in what types of games are planned for production br Free to play coupled with microtransactions may be used as a response to piracy An example of this is the mobile game Dead Trigger switching to a free to play model due to a high rate of piracy While microtransactions are considered a more robust and difficult to circumnavigate than digital rights management in some cases they can be circumvented In a server was created by a Russian developer which provided falsified authentication for iOS in app purchases This allowed users to obtain features requiring a microtransaction without paying br Consumer organizations have criticized that some video games do not describe adequately that these purchases are made with real currency rather than virtual currency Also some platforms do not require passwords to finalize a microtransaction This has resulted in consumers getting unexpectedly high bills often referred to as a bill shock br br br Criticism and regulation br br In the mid and late s people became increasingly aware of how microtransactions operate in games and they have become much more critical of their usage The commonly cited issues of microtransactions from gamers are br br Loot box rewards are determined by random chance and percentages plus they can directly influence gameplay via the items they bestow br They sometimes cost too much money for what they are worth For example a bundle of loot boxes in Blizzard s first person shooter game Overwatch costs br They may facilitate gambling behaviours in people already suffering from gambling issues Plus they can make people overspend money on the game whether or not they are able to do so br Games with loot boxes like FIFA can become pay to win in order to advance past certain points or to become the best in the game it is virtually required to pay real money to receive in game currency to purchase items or to pay for bigger and better items directly br Microtransactions in games that are not free to play means that gamers are paying more money after already paying to experience the full game br br br Legislative efforts to regulate microtransactions br The implementation of microtransactions and the subsequent backlash from gamers and the gaming media have caused governments from all around the world to look into these games and their microtransaction mechanics In April the Netherlands and Belgium banned the sale of microtransactions in games sold in their countries The specific games Belgium looked closer at were EA s Star Wars Battlefront II and FIFA Overwatch and Counter Strike Global Offensive developed by Valve All of those game s microtransactions except for Star Wars Battlefront II which removed their gameplay altering microtransactions in March but kept cosmetic microtransactions due to players calculating that it would take over hours of playing to obtain Luke Skywalker and then complaining about this extreme threshold to unlock popular characters to EA have been determined to be games of chance by the Belgian government As such they are highly regulated by the Belgian government under their gambling laws br Games would have to remove their microtransactions in order for it to be sold in their country If the game companies don t comply then Belgium s government said that it will enact a prison sentence of up to years and a fine of up to euros While most game publishers agreed to modify their games loot boxes in accordance with governmental laws or otherwise as a result of negative reactions others such as Electronic Arts have contested that they do not constitute as gambling However EA eventually complied with the Belgian government s declaration and made it so players in Belgium can not purchase FIFA Points the premium obtained by buying it with real money in game currency used in FIFA s Ultimate Team game mode Professional FIFA players in Belgium were disappointed because not being able to buy FIFA Points makes it harder for them to compete and succeed in the FIFA Global Series and the EA sponsored e sports competition for FIFA games showing just how pay to win they feel FIFA Ultimate Team is br In the United States there have been some calls to introduce legislation to regulate microtransactions in video games whether on mobile consoles or PC and numerous attempts have been made recently to pass such legislation In November Hawaii representatives Chris Lee and Sean Quinlan during a news conference explained how loot boxes and microtransactions prey on children and that they are working to introduce bills into their state s house and senate A few months later in February they successfully put four bills onto the floor of Hawaii State Legislature Two of those bills would make it so games containing loot boxes can not be sold to people under the age of and the other two would force game publishers to put labels on the case of their games that have loot boxes in them as well as make them be transparent about the item drop rates for the rewards in their game s loot boxes However all four bills failed to pass through the Hawaii State Legislature in March In May Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill named The Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act to ban loot boxes and pay to win microtransactions in games played by minors using similar conditions previously outlined in the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act The bill received some bi partisan support in the form of two co sponsors from Democrats Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Ed Markey of Massachusetts br The United Kingdom has also been closely observing microtransactions especially loot boxes and their effects on children A major report by the UK Parliament s House of Commons and the Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee released in September called for the banning or regulation of microtransactions and loot boxes to children as well as having the games industry to take up more responsibility with regards to protecting players from the harms of microtransactions that simulate gambling Specifically the committee s conclusion is that microtransactions should be classified as gambling in the UK and therefore subject to current gambling and age restriction laws In October the Children s Commissioner for England which promotes and protects children s rights released a report describing the experiences thoughts and effects positive and negative of gaming on children ages Within the report some of the children directly stated to the interviewers that the microtransactions and loot boxes that they encounter and subsequently buy are just like gambling The report concludes that showing the odds and percentages of certain microtransactions to players does not go far enough and does not actually solve the problem br Instead they suggest that certain new features to protect children should be implemented in all games featuring microtransactions like showing the all time spending on a child s in game account and having limits on the amount someone can spend daily Additionally they push for game developers and publishers to stop pressuring children to spend money on microtransactions in their games in order to progress through the game and for Parliament to change their current gambling laws to declare loot boxes as gambling and subject to gambling laws br br br Psychology and ethics br Alongside questioning the legality of the extensive use of microtransactions some gamers have also questioned the morality and ethics of selling microtransactions especially to children Researchers have studied the natural psychology behind both the selling and purchase of microtransactions br br br Psychology br According to a post made by Gabe Duverge on the Touro University Worldwide TUW website impulse buying is a significant part of the psychology behind people buying microtransactions Essentially many games especially in the realm of mobile games and the free to play market force a decision from the player to keep playing or not via a limited time pop up on the screen that tells them that if they pay a certain amount of money usually about cents or a dollar they can keep playing where they left off This is another type of microtransaction and it has become increasingly common in the mobile games sphere as of late Another psychological aspect that is used to get players to continue playing and buying microtransactions is called loss aversion When a player continues to lose over and over again they begin to crave the dopamine filled positive feelings that they feel when they win As such they become more inclined to spend money for items that will help them achieve that elusive win Then when they do win the player attributes their win with the item that they just bought making it more likely that they will spend money whenever the player gets on a losing streak and so the cycle continues on br br br Ethics of selling microtransactions to children br During the past two decades gaming has emerged as one of the top options children go to as a means of alleviating boredom In an August report conducted by Parent Zone in the UK they studied and gathered data directly from children between the ages of years old about their experiences with online gaming and the microtransactions that the games that they play hold as well as ask about how the microtransactions in these games have affected them and or their parents socially and financially A growing number of parents of children aged to years old are now concerned that their children could be pressured to perform microtransactions online br br br Statistics br According to the Parent Zone study in the United Kingdom of males and of females aged years old play video games About of people years old in the United Kingdom have played video games with many playing games that utilize an Internet connection Many online games targeting younger audiences may have the presence of microtransactions The primary items bought by children in these games are largely cosmetic items specifically skins which modify the appearance of the in game player br In the case of Fortnite many of the outfits and other cosmetics are locked behind a battle pass that the player must pay for A battle pass is a tiered system where the player buys the pass and must unlock the tiers on their own By completing challenges and other missions they earn in game items like outfits emotes special animations used to taunt opponents celebrate victories dance and show off and other cosmetics It is about or of Fortnite s in game virtual currency V Bucks but the player can also pay about or V Bucks instead to unlock the battle pass and they automatically complete the first tiers out of tiers of it br A majority of the children surveyed feel that these kinds of microtransaction systems in their online games are complete rip offs of them also believe that these online games purposely try to squeeze as much money as possible from them when they play the game About half of the children expressed that they need to spend money on the game in order for it to be fun to them this is due to many of these games features which are modes that the children want to play and experience being locked behind microtransaction paywalls As such there is a large gap between the gaming experiences that non paying players have and the experiences that paying players have br Some other statistics and thoughts regarding loot boxes specifically were also collected from the children Out of the of children that know about loot boxes a majority stated that the online games they play contain loot boxes in them of them would rather pay for in game content individually and directly instead of through a collective and randomized loot box and believe that if loot boxes were eliminated from their online games the games would actually be a lot better Plus of the children who played a game with loot boxes in them paid for one too Overall the report stated that of the children who were generally unhappy with the games they paid for or were gifted felt that way because certain features had to be bought after paying for the game already effectively making is so they had to pay more than the normal full price of the game in order to play the full game The game was simply just not worth paying for to of the unsatisfied children and of them also felt that in game microtransactions were not worth paying for either Ultimately children feel that spending money on microtransactions has become the norm and an expectation when playing modern video games br br br Social br For many children the excitement that they feel when they open loot boxes packs and obtain items through microtransactions is very addictive to them Opening these random boxes without knowing what is inside to them is the same as opening a present The excitement and suspense is amplified when the experience is felt alongside friends In the UK Children s Commissioner s report the children who played FIFA feel that opening player packs are a game within the game To them opening packs creates variety because they can play some football games in the Ultimate Team game mode and then open some packs when they get bored of playing normal football matches br Children might want to fit in by paying for microtransactions and loot boxes and obtaining very rare items in front of their friends creating a lot of hype and excitement among them This makes paying for microtransactions a very positive experience for them However when children buy items in front of their friends peer pressure often set in Friends pressuring the player to continue buying packs hoping that they will be able to see them get a rare item can cause the player to spend more than they may actually be able to The pressure to spend money on in game content also stems from children seeing their friends have these special rare items and them wanting to have it themselves Essentially when everyone around them has it they will want it too in order to feel like a part of the group br Peer pressure is not the only way children s social gaming experiences are altered As noted in both the Parent Zone report and the Children s Commissioner s assessment children who play Fortnite explained that classism as in discrimination against people of different economic and social classes exists among the players of the game Some children fear that if they have the free default skin in Fortnite no one friends nor random strangers will want to play with them as the default skin is seen as a symbol of a player being bad at the game The default skin is used as judgement and an insult against the player whose in game avatar wears it too Players wearing default skins are considered financially poor and very uncool by their peers and the game s community so children spend money on microtransactions in order to avoid having that tag or target on them br The media that children consume outside of the game can also affect their social interactions and in game spending A popular mode of entertainment for children is watching YouTube videos of other people playing their favorite games In the case of FIFA children may watch a popular YouTubers constantly open player packs in the Ultimate Team game mode unlike the children the said content creators have the money to pay for the packs due to YouTube being their major source of income br br br Financial br The amount of money that children spend on microtransactions has continued to grow because the design of these online games as well as other outside influences have made spending money for in game content an essential aspect of the game itself In the UK different cases of children unknowingly spending money from their parents and their own in order to get what they want or need to progress through the game have surfaced In one instance the father of a family with four children all under years old bought an FIFA Ultimate Team player pack for them In the span of three weeks the children kept spending money on packs eventually spending altogether completely emptying their parents bank account but never receiving one of the best players in the game as well as the children s favorite player Lionel Messi br The children apologized to their parents and explained that at the time they did not understand how much they were impacting the family s financial situation There have been other situations where UK children spent and even on microtransactions in various mobile games usually as a result of them getting tricked by the game to pay for something in game or just not understanding that real money was being taken out of their or their parents bank accounts when they bought items in game Spending such large amounts of money on microtransactions have devastated some families financially including some who had to pay a bill full of microtransaction payments with college savings and even money in life savings accounts br In the Children s Commissioner s study children reported spending more and more money with each coming year despite also feeling that because they are rewarded completely unknown items they feel like they may be wasting money too One of the children that played FIFA in the study said that they spend anywhere from a day to upwards of in one year sometimes even buying multiple player packs at one time Some children have also stated that they have seen friends their siblings and acquaintances who have mental disorders spend all of their birthday money on in game microtransactions all while feeling like spending that money has not been a waste despite them not receiving any valuable items br br br Data br Microtransactions have become increasingly common in many types of video games Smartphone console and PC games all have conformed to the use of microtransactions due to its high profitability Many companies and games especially smartphone games have taken on a business model that offer their games for free and then relying purely on the success of microtransactions to turn a profit br br br Ethics br The collection of this data on consumers although technically legal in the United States or outside the EU can be considered unethical Companies can sell data about consumers involving their spending bank information and preferences to understand the consumer better overall making business models for gaming companies safer and more profitable With microtransactions under a negative spotlight from the gaming community there may be displeasure from those who are aware that their data is being shared to make microtransactions possible br br br Revenue br Data from a variety of sources show that microtransactions can vastly increase a companies profits Three free to play mobile games that made heavy use of the practice Clash Royale Clash of Clans and Game of War were all in the top five most profitable mobile games of Microtransactions are also used in larger budget games as well such as Grand Theft Auto V generating more revenue through them than retail sales by the end of This trend was consistent with many other popular games at the time leading to the practice being widespread in the s In its fiscal year Activision Blizzard earned billion with the majority of profit generated from microtransactions br br br See also br Pay to play br br br
