Energy drinks have the effects that caffeine and sugar provide but experts still argue about the possible effects of the other ingredients Most of the effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance

energy drinks can lead to cardiac and psychiatric conditions br The European Food Safety Authority EFSA concluded that exposure to taurine and glucuronolactone at the levels presently used in energy
