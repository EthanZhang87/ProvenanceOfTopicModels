Australia officially the Commonwealth of Australia is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands Australia is the largest country by area in Oceania and the world s sixth largest country Australia is the oldest flattest and driest inhabited continent with the least fertile soils It is a megadiverse country and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates with deserts in the centre tropical rainforests in the north east tropical savannas in the north and mountain ranges in the south east br The ancestors of Aboriginal Australians began arriving from south east Asia to years ago during the last glacial period They settled the continent and had formed approximately distinct language groups by the time of European settlement maintaining some of the longest known continuing artistic and religious traditions in the world Australia s written history commenced with European maritime exploration The Dutch were the first known Europeans to reach Australia in British colonisation began in with the establishment of the penal colony of New South Wales By the mid th century most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and five additional self governing British colonies were established each gaining responsible government by The colonies federated in forming the Commonwealth of Australia This continued a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom highlighted by the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act and culminating in the Australia Acts of br Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and ten territories the states of New South Wales Victoria Queensland Tasmania South Australia and Western Australia the major mainland Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory and other minor or external territories Its population of nearly million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard Canberra is the nation s capital while its most populous cities are Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth and Adelaide which each possess a population of at least one million inhabitants Australian governments have promoted multiculturalism since the s Australia is culturally diverse and has one of the highest foreign born populations in the world Its abundant natural resources and well developed international trade relations are crucial to the country s economy which generates its income from various sources predominantly services including banking real estate and international education as well as mining manufacturing and agriculture It ranks highly for quality of life health education economic freedom civil liberties and political rights br Australia has a highly developed market economy and one of the highest per capita incomes globally It is a middle power and has the world s thirteenth highest military expenditure It is a member of international groups including the United Nations the G the OECD the World Trade Organization Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation the Pacific Islands Forum the Pacific Community the Commonwealth of Nations and the defence and security organisations ANZUS AUKUS and the Five Eyes It is also a major non NATO ally of the United States br br br Etymology br br The name Australia pronounced in Australian English is derived from the Latin Terra Australis southern land a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient times Several th century cartographers used the word Australia on maps but not to identify modern Australia When Europeans began visiting and mapping Australia in the th century the name Terra Australis was applied to the new territories br Until the early th century Australia was best known as New Holland a name first applied by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in as Nieuw Holland and subsequently anglicised Terra Australis still saw occasional usage such as in scientific texts The name Australia was popularised by the explorer Matthew Flinders who said it was more agreeable to the ear and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the Earth The first time that Australia appears to have been officially used was in April when Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledged the receipt of Flinders charts of Australia from Lord Bathurst In December Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted In the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name The first official published use of the new name came with the publication in of The Australia Directory by the Hydrographic Office br Colloquial names for Australia include Oz Straya and Down Under Other epithets include the Great Southern Land the Lucky Country the Sunburnt Country and the Wide Brown Land The latter two both derive from Dorothea Mackellar s poem My Country br br br History br br br Indigenous prehistory br br Indigenous Australians comprise two broad groups the Aboriginal peoples of the Australian mainland and surrounding islands including Tasmania and the Torres Strait Islanders who are a distinct Melanesian people Human habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to have begun to years ago with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea crossings from what is now Southeast Asia It is uncertain how many waves of immigration may have contributed to these ancestors of modern Aboriginal Australians The Madjedbebe rock shelter in Arnhem Land is recognised as the oldest site showing the presence of humans in Australia The oldest human remains found are the Lake Mungo remains which have been dated to around years ago br Aboriginal Australian culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures on Earth At the time of first European contact Aboriginal Australians were complex hunter gatherers with diverse economies and societies and spread across at least different language groups Estimates of the Aboriginal population before British settlement range from to one million Aboriginal Australians have an oral culture with spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime Certain groups engaged in fire stick farming fish farming and built semi permanent shelters The extent to which some groups engaged in agriculture is controversial br The Torres Strait Islander people first settled their islands around years ago Culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Aboriginal peoples they were seafarers and obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas Agriculture also developed on some islands and villages appeared by the s br By the mid th century in northern Australia contact trade and cross cultural engagement had been established between local Aboriginal groups and Makassan trepangers visiting from present day Indonesia br br br European exploration and colonisation br br The Dutch are the first Europeans that recorded sighting and making landfall on the Australian mainland The first ship and crew to chart the Australian coast and meet with Aboriginal people was the Duyfken captained by Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early and made landfall on February at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York Later that year Spanish explorer Lu s Vaz de Torres sailed through and navigated the Torres Strait Islands The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent New Holland during the th century and although no attempt at settlement was made a number of shipwrecks left men either stranded or as in the case of the Batavia in marooned for mutiny and murder thus becoming the first Europeans to permanently inhabit the continent In Captain James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast which he named New South Wales and claimed for Great Britain br Following the loss of its American colonies in the British Government sent a fleet of ships the First Fleet under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip to establish a new penal colony in New South Wales A camp was set up and the Union Flag raised at Sydney Cove Port Jackson on January a date which later became Australia s national day br Most early settlers were convicts transported for petty crimes and assigned as labourers or servants to free settlers willing immigrants Once emancipated convicts tended to integrate into colonial society Martial law was declared to suppress convict rebellions and uprisings and lasted for two years following the Rum Rebellion the only successful armed takeover of government in Australia Over the next two decades social and economic reforms together with the establishment of a Legislative Council and Supreme Court saw New South Wales transition from a penal colony to a civil society br The indigenous population declined for years following European settlement mainly due to infectious disease British colonial authorities did not sign any treaties with Aboriginal groups As settlement expanded thousands of Indigenous people died in frontier conflicts while others were dispossessed of their traditional lands br br br Colonial expansion br br In a settlement was established in Van Diemen s Land present day Tasmania and in Gregory Blaxland William Lawson and William Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains west of Sydney opening the interior to European settlement The British claim extended to the whole Australian continent in when Major Edmund Lockyer established a settlement on King George Sound modern day Albany The Swan River Colony present day Perth was established in evolving into the largest Australian colony by area Western Australia In accordance with population growth separate colonies were carved from New South Wales Tasmania in South Australia in New Zealand in Victoria in and Queensland in South Australia was founded as a free colony it never accepted transported convicts Growing opposition to the convict system culminated in its abolition in the eastern colonies by the s Initially a free colony Western Australia practised penal transportation from to br The six colonies individually gained responsible government between and thus becoming elective democracies managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the British Empire The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters notably foreign affairs br In the mid th century explorers such as Burke and Wills charted Australia s interior A series of gold rushes beginning in the early s led to an influx of new migrants from China North America and continental Europe as well as outbreaks of bushranging and civil unrest the latter peaked in when Ballarat miners launched the Eureka Rebellion against gold license fees The s saw a surge in blackbirding where Pacific Islanders were forced into indentured labour mainly in Queensland br From Australian colonial governments began introducing policies resulting in the removal of many Aboriginal children from their families and communities The Second Boer War marked the largest overseas deployment of Australia s colonial forces br br br Federation to the World Wars br br On January federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning constitutional conventions and referendums resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia as a nation under the new Australian Constitution br After the Imperial Conference Australia and several other self governing British settler colonies were given the status of self governing dominions within the British Empire Australia was one of the founding members of the League of Nations in and subsequently of the United Nations in The Statute of Westminster formally ended the ability of the UK to pass laws with effect at the Commonwealth level in Australia without the country s consent Australia adopted it in but it was backdated to to confirm the validity of legislation passed by the Australian Parliament during World War II br The Australian Capital Territory was formed in as the location for the future federal capital of Canberra While it was being constructed Melbourne served as the temporary capital from to The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the federal parliament in Australia became the colonial ruler of the Territory of Papua which had initially been annexed by Queensland in in and of the Territory of New Guinea formerly German New Guinea in The two were unified as the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in and gained independence from Australia in br br In Australia joined the Allies in fighting the First World War and took part in many of the major battles fought on the Western Front Of about who served about were killed and another were wounded Many Australians regard the defeat of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ANZAC at Gallipoli in as the baptism of fire that forged the new nation s identity The beginning of the campaign is commemorated annually on Anzac Day a date which rivals Australia Day as the nation s most important br From to Australia joined the Allies in fighting the Second World War Australia s armed forces fought in the Pacific European and Mediterranean and Middle East theatres The shock of Britain s defeat in Singapore in followed soon after by the bombing of Darwin and other Japanese attacks on Australian soil led to a widespread belief in Australia that a Japanese invasion was imminent and a shift from the United Kingdom to the United States as Australia s principal ally and security partner Since Australia has been allied with the United States under the ANZUS treaty br br br Post war and contemporary eras br br In the decades following World War II Australia enjoyed significant increases in living standards leisure time and suburban development Using the slogan populate or perish the nation encouraged a large wave of immigration from across Europe with such immigrants referred to as New Australians br A member of the Western Bloc during the Cold War Australia participated in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency during the s and the Vietnam War from to During this time tensions over communist influence in society led to unsuccessful attempts by the Menzies Government to ban the Communist Party of Australia and a bitter split in the Labor Party in br As a result of a referendum the federal government gained the power to legislate with regard to Indigenous Australians and Indigenous Australians were fully included in the census Pre colonial land interests referred to as native title in Australia was recognised in law for the first time when the High Court of Australia held in Mabo v Queensland No that Australia was neither terra nullius land belonging to no one or desert and uncultivated land at the time of European settlement br Following the abolition of the last vestiges of the White Australia policy in Australia s demography and culture transformed as a result of a large and ongoing wave of non European immigration mostly from Asia The late th century also saw an increasing focus on foreign policy ties with other Pacific Rim nations The Australia Acts severed the remaining constitutional ties between Australia and the United Kingdom while maintaining the monarch in her independent capacity as Queen of Australia In a constitutional referendum of voters rejected abolishing the monarchy and becoming a republic br Following the September attacks on the United States Australia joined the United States in fighting the Afghanistan War from to and the Iraq War from to The nation s trade relations also became increasingly oriented towards East Asia in the st century with China becoming the nation s largest trading partner by a large margin br In during the COVID pandemic several of Australia s largest cities were locked down for extended periods and free movement across the national and state borders was restricted in an attempt to slow the spread of the SARS CoV virus br br br Geography br br br General characteristics br br Surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans Australia is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand The world s smallest continent and sixth largest country by total area Australia owing to its size and isolation is often dubbed the island continent and is sometimes considered the world s largest island Australia has km mi of coastline excluding all offshore islands and claims an extensive Exclusive Economic Zone of square kilometres sq mi This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory br Mainland Australia lies between latitudes and South and longitudes and East Australia s size gives it a wide variety of landscapes with tropical rainforests in the north east mountain ranges in the south east south west and east and desert in the centre The desert or semi arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land Australia is the driest inhabited continent its annual rainfall averaged over continental area is less than mm The population density is inhabitants per square kilometre although the large majority of the population lives along the temperate south eastern coastline The population density exceeds inhabitants per square kilometre in central Melbourne In Australia had of the global permanent meadows and pastureland br br The Great Barrier Reef the world s largest coral reef lies a short distance off the north east coast and extends for over km mi Mount Augustus claimed to be the world s largest monolith is located in Western Australia At m ft Mount Kosciuszko is the highest mountain on the Australian mainland Even taller are Mawson Peak at m ft on the remote Australian external territory of Heard Island and in the Australian Antarctic Territory Mount McClintock and Mount Menzies at m ft and m ft respectively br Eastern Australia is marked by the Great Dividing Range which runs parallel to the coast of Queensland New South Wales and much of Victoria The name is not strictly accurate because parts of the range consist of low hills and the highlands are typically no more than m ft in height The coastal uplands and a belt of Brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland and shrubland These include the western plains of New South Wales and the Mitchell Grass Downs and Mulga Lands of inland Queensland The northernmost point of the mainland is the tropical Cape York Peninsula br br The landscapes of the Top End and the Gulf Country with their tropical climate include forest woodland wetland grassland rainforest and desert At the north west corner of the continent are the sandstone cliffs and gorges of The Kimberley and below that the Pilbara The Victoria Plains tropical savanna lies south of the Kimberley and Arnhem Land savannas forming a transition between the coastal savannas and the interior deserts At the heart of the country are the uplands of central Australia Prominent features of the centre and south include Uluru also known as Ayers Rock the famous sandstone monolith and the inland Simpson Tirari and Sturt Stony Gibson Great Sandy Tanami and Great Victoria deserts with the famous Nullarbor Plain on the southern coast The Western Australian mulga shrublands lie between the interior deserts and Mediterranean climate Southwest Australia br br br Geology br br Lying on the Indo Australian Plate the mainland of Australia is the lowest and most primordial landmass on Earth with a relatively stable geological history The landmass includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological time periods spanning over billion years of the Earth s history The Pilbara Craton is one of only two pristine Archaean Ga billion years ago crusts identified on the Earth br Having been part of all major supercontinents the Australian continent began to form after the breakup of Gondwana in the Permian with the separation of the continental landmass from the African continent and Indian subcontinent It separated from Antarctica over a prolonged period beginning in the Permian and continuing through to the Cretaceous When the last glacial period ended in about BC rising sea levels formed Bass Strait separating Tasmania from the mainland Then between about and BC the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea separating New Guinea the Aru Islands and the mainland of Australia The Australian continent is moving toward Eurasia at the rate of to centimetres a year br The Australian mainland s continental crust excluding the thinned margins has an average thickness of km with a range in thickness from km to km Australia s geology can be divided into several main sections showcasing that the continent grew from west to east the Archaean cratonic shields found mostly in the west Proterozoic fold belts in the centre and Phanerozoic sedimentary basins metamorphic and igneous rocks in the east br The Australian mainland and Tasmania are situated in the middle of the tectonic plate and have no active volcanoes but due to passing over the East Australia hotspot recent volcanism has occurred during the Holocene in the Newer Volcanics Province of western Victoria and south eastern South Australia Volcanism also occurs in the island of New Guinea considered geologically as part of the Australian continent and in the Australian external territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands Seismic activity in the Australian mainland and Tasmania is also low with the greatest number of fatalities having occurred in the Newcastle earthquake br br br Climate br br The climate of Australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents including the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Ni o Southern Oscillation which is correlated with periodic drought and the seasonal tropical low pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia These factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year Much of the northern part of the country has a tropical predominantly summer rainfall monsoon The south west corner of the country has a Mediterranean climate The south east ranges from oceanic Tasmania and coastal Victoria to humid subtropical upper half of New South Wales with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates The interior is arid to semi arid br Driven by climate change average temperatures have risen more than C since Associated changes in rainfall patterns and climate extremes exacerbate existing issues such as drought and bushfires was Australia s warmest recorded year and the bushfire season was the country s worst on record Australia s greenhouse gas emissions per capita are among the highest in the world br Water restrictions are frequently in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages due to urban population increases and localised drought Throughout much of the continent major flooding regularly follows extended periods of drought flushing out inland river systems overflowing dams and inundating large inland flood plains as occurred throughout Eastern Australia in the early s after the s Australian drought br br br Biodiversity br br Although most of Australia is semi arid or desert the continent includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests Fungi typify that diversity an estimated species of which only have been described occur in Australia Because of the continent s great age extremely variable weather patterns and long term geographic isolation much of Australia s biota is unique About of flowering plants of mammals more than of birds and of in shore temperate zone fish are endemic Australia has at least species of reptile more than any other country in the world Besides Antarctica Australia is the only continent that developed without feline species Feral cats may have been introduced in the th century by Dutch shipwrecks and later in the th century by European settlers They are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species Seafaring immigrants from Asia are believed to have brought the dingo to Australia sometime after the end of the last ice age perhaps years ago and Aboriginal people helped disperse them across the continent as pets contributing to the demise of thylacines on the mainland Australia is also one of megadiverse countries br Australian forests are mostly made up of evergreen species particularly eucalyptus trees in the less arid regions wattles replace them as the dominant species in drier regions and deserts Among well known Australian animals are the monotremes the platypus and echidna a host of marsupials including the kangaroo koala and wombat and birds such as the emu and the kookaburra Australia is home to many dangerous animals including some of the most venomous snakes in the world The dingo was introduced by Austronesian people who traded with Indigenous Australians around BCE Many animal and plant species became extinct soon after first human settlement including the Australian megafauna others have disappeared since European settlement among them the thylacine br Many of Australia s ecoregions and the species within those regions are threatened by human activities and introduced animal chromistan fungal and plant species All these factors have led to Australia s having the highest mammal extinction rate of any country in the world The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is the legal framework for the protection of threatened species Numerous protected areas have been created under the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia s Biological Diversity to protect and preserve unique ecosystems wetlands are listed under the Ramsar Convention and natural World Heritage Sites have been established Australia was ranked st out of countries in the world on the Environmental Performance Index There are more than animals and plants on Australia s threatened species list including more than animals br Paleontologists discovered a fossil site of a prehistoric rainforest in McGraths Flat in South Australia that presents evidence that this now arid desert and dry shrubland grassland was once home to an abundance of life br br br Government and politics br br Australia is a constitutional monarchy a parliamentary democracy and a federation The country has maintained its mostly unchanged constitution alongside a stable liberal democratic political system since Federation in It is one of the world s oldest federations in which power is divided between the federal and state and territory governments The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the United Kingdom a fused executive constitutional monarchy and strong party discipline and the United States federalism a written constitution and strong bicameralism with an elected upper house resulting in a distinct hybrid br Government power is partially separated between three branches br br Legislature the bicameral Parliament comprising the monarch the Senate and the House of Representatives br Executive the Cabinet led by the prime minister the leader of the party or Coalition with a majority in the House of Representatives and other ministers they have chosen Formally appointed by the governor general br Judiciary the High Court and other federal courts br Charles III reigns as King of Australia and is represented in Australia by the governor general at the federal level and by the governors at the state level who by section of the Constitution and convention act on the advice of their ministers Thus in practice the governor general acts as a legal figurehead for the actions of the prime minister and the Cabinet The governor general may in some situations exercise powers in the absence or contrary to ministerial advice using reserve powers When these powers may be exercised is governed by convention and their precise scope is unclear The most notable exercise of these powers was the dismissal of the Whitlam government in the constitutional crisis of br br In the Senate the upper house there are senators twelve each from the states and two each from the mainland territories the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory The House of Representatives the lower house has members elected from single member electoral divisions commonly known as electorates or seats allocated to states on the basis of population with each of the current states guaranteed a minimum of five seats The lower house has a maximum term of three years but this is not fixed and governments usually dissolve the house early for an election at some point in the months before the maximum Elections for both chambers are generally held simultaneously with senators having overlapping six year terms except for those from the territories whose terms are not fixed but are tied to the electoral cycle for the lower house Thus only of the places in the Senate are put to each election unless the cycle is interrupted by a double dissolution br Australia s electoral system uses preferential voting for the House of Representatives and all state and territory lower house elections with the exception of Tasmania and the ACT which use the Hare Clark system The Senate and most state upper houses use the proportional system which combines preferential voting with proportional representation for each state Voting and enrolment is compulsory for all enrolled citizens years and over in every jurisdiction The party with majority support in the House of Representatives forms the government and its leader becomes Prime Minister In cases where no party has majority support the governor general has the constitutional power to appoint the prime minister and if necessary dismiss one that has lost the confidence of Parliament Due to the relatively unique position of Australia operating as a Westminster parliamentary democracy with a powerful and elected upper house the system has sometimes been referred to as having a Washminster mutation or as a semi parliamentary system br There are two major political groups that usually form government federally and in the states the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition which is a formal grouping of the Liberal Party and its minor partner the National Party The Liberal National Party and the Country Liberal Party are merged state branches in Queensland and the Northern Territory that function as separate parties at a federal level Within Australian political culture the Coalition is considered centre right and the Labor Party is considered centre left Independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in Australian parliaments mostly in upper houses The Australian Greens are often considered the third force in politics being the third largest party by both vote and membership br The most recent federal election was held on May and resulted in the Australian Labor Party led by Anthony Albanese being elected to government br br br States and territories br br Australia has six states New South Wales NSW Victoria Vic Queensland Qld Western Australia WA South Australia SA and Tasmania Tas and two mainland self governing territories the Australian Capital Territory ACT and the Northern Territory NT br The states have the general power to make laws except in the few areas where the constitution grants the Commonwealth exclusive powers The Commonwealth can only make laws on topics listed in the constitution but its laws prevail over those of the states to the extent of any inconsistency Since Federation the Commonwealth s power relative to the states has significantly increased due to the increasingly wide interpretation given to listed Commonwealth powers and because of the states heavy financial reliance on Commonwealth grants br Each state and major mainland territory has its own parliament unicameral in the Northern Territory the ACT and Queensland and bicameral in the other states The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly the House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council The head of the government in each state is the Premier and in each territory the Chief Minister The King is represented in each state by a governor At the Commonwealth level the King s representative is the governor general br The Commonwealth government directly administers the internal Jervis Bay Territory and the other external territories the Ashmore and Cartier Islands the Coral Sea Islands the Heard Island and McDonald Islands the Indian Ocean territories Christmas Island and the Cocos Keeling Islands Norfolk Island and the Australian Antarctic Territory The remote Macquarie Island and Lord Howe Island are part of Tasmania and New South Wales respectively br br br Foreign relations br br Australia is a middle power whose foreign relations has three core bi partisan pillars commitment to the US alliance engagement with the Indo Pacific and support for international institutions rules and co operation Through the ANZUS pact and its status as a major non NATO ally Australia maintains a close relationship with the US which encompasses strong defence security and trade ties In the Indo Pacific the country seeks to increase its trade ties through the open flow of trade and capital whilst managing the rise of Chinese power by supporting the existing rules based order Regionally the country is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum the Pacific Community the ASEAN mechanism and the East Asia Summit Internationally the country is a member of the United Nations of which it was a founding member the Commonwealth of Nations the OECD and the G This reflects the country s generally strong commitment to multilateralism br br Australia is a member of several defence intelligence and security groupings including the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the United States United Kingdom Canada and New Zealand the ANZUS alliance with the United States and New Zealand the AUKUS security treaty with the United States and United Kingdom the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with the United States India and Japan the Five Power Defence Arrangements with New Zealand the United Kingdom Malaysia and Singapore and the Reciprocal Access defence and security agreement with Japan br Australia has pursued the cause of international trade liberalisation It led the formation of the Cairns Group and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD and the World Trade Organization WTO Beginning in the s Australia has entered into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership multilateral free trade agreements as well as bilateral free trade agreements with the United States China Japan South Korea Indonesia the United Kingdom and New Zealand with the most recent deal with UK signed in br Australia maintains a deeply integrated relationship with neighbouring New Zealand with free mobility of citizens between the two countries under the Trans Tasman Travel Arrangement and free trade under the Closer Economic Relations agreement The most favourably viewed countries by the Australian people in include New Zealand the United Kingdom Japan Germany Taiwan Thailand the United States and South Korea It also maintains an international aid program under which some countries receive assistance Australia ranked fourth in the Center for Global Development s Commitment to Development Index br The power over foreign policy is highly concentrated in the prime minister and the national security committee with major decision such as joining the invasion of Iraq made with without prior Cabinet approval Similarly the Parliament does not play a formal role in foreign policy and the power to declare war lies solely with the executive government The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade supports the executive in its policy decisions br br br Military br br The two main institutions involved in the management of Australia s armed forces are the Australian Defence Force ADF and the Department of Defence together known as Defence The Australian Defence Force is the military wing headed by the chief of the defence force and contains three branches the Royal Australian Navy the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force In it had currently serving personnel including regulars and reservists The Department of Defence is the civilian wing and is headed by the secretary of defence These two leaders collective manage Defence as a diarchy with shared and joint responsibilities The titular role of commander in chief is held by the governor general however actual command is vested in the chief of the Defence Force The executive branch of the Commonwealth government has overall control of the military through the minister of defence who is subject to the decisions of Cabinet and its National Security Committee br In defence spending was of GDP representing the world s th largest defence budget In the ADF had active operations in the Middle East and the Indo Pacific including security and aid provisions was contributing to UN forces in relation to South Sudan Syria Israel and North Korea and domestically was assisting to prevent asylum seekers enter the country and with natural disaster relief br Major Australian intelligence agencies include the Australian Secret Intelligence Service foreign intelligence the Australian Signals Directorate signals intelligence and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation domestic security br br br Human rights br br Legal and social rights in Australia are regarded as among the most developed in the world Attitudes towards LGBT people are generally positive within Australia and same sex marriage has been legal in the nation since Australia has had anti discrimination laws regarding disability since However international organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have expressed concerns in areas including asylum seeker policy indigenous deaths in custody the lack of entrenched rights protection and laws restricting protesting br br br Economy br br Australia s high income mixed market economy is rich in natural resources It is the

states in the Pacific Kiribati Nauru and Tuvalu br Australian government debt about billion in June exceeds of the country s total GDP and is the world s eighth highest Australia had the second highest level of household debt in the world in after Switzerland Its house prices are among the highest in the world especially in the large urban areas The large service sector accounts for about of total GDP followed by the industrial sector while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest making up only of total GDP Australia is the world s st largest exporter and th largest importer China is Australia s largest trading partner by a wide margin accounting for roughly of the country s exports and of its imports Other major export markets include Japan the United States and South Korea br Australia has high levels of competitiveness and economic freedom and was ranked fifth in the Human Development Index in As of it is ranked twelfth in the Index of Economic Freedom and nineteenth in the Global Competitiveness Report It attracted million international tourists in and was ranked thirteenth among the countries of Asia Pacific in for inbound tourism The Travel and Tourism

research contributors in the world CSIRO Australia s national science agency contributes of all research in the country while the rest is carried out by universities Its most notable contributions include the invention of atomic absorption spectroscopy the essential components of Wi Fi technology and the development of the first commercially successful polymer banknote br Australia is a key player in supporting space exploration Facilities such as the Square Kilometre Array and Australia Telescope Compact Array radio telescopes telescopes such as the Siding Spring Observatory and ground stations such as the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex are of great assistance in deep space exploration missions primarily by NASA br br br Demographics br br Australia has an average population density of persons per square kilometre of total land area which makes it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world The population is heavily concentrated on the east coast and in particular in the south eastern region between South East Queensland to the north east and Adelaide to the south west br Australia is also highly urbanised with of the population living in the Greater Capital City Statistical Areas metropolitan areas of the state and mainland territorial capital cities in Metropolitan areas with more than one million inhabitants are Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth and Adelaide br In common with many other developed countries Australia is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population with more retirees and fewer people of working age In the average age of the population was years In of the Australian population lived overseas one of the lowest proportions worldwide br br br Ancestry and immigration br br Between and the Second World War the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles principally England Ireland and Scotland although there was significant immigration from China and Germany during the th century Following Federation in a strengthening of the white Australia policy restricted further migration from these areas However in the decades immediately following the Second World War Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades All overt racial discrimination ended in with multiculturalism becoming official policy Subsequently there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world with Asia being the largest source of immigrants in the st century br Today Australia has the world s eighth largest immigrant population with immigrants accounting for of the population the highest proportion among major Western nations In permanent migrants were admitted to Australia with a net migration population gain of people inclusive of non permanent residents Most entered on skilled visas however the immigration program also offers visas for family members and refugees br The Australian Bureau of Statistics asks each Australian resident to nominate up to two ancestries each census and the responses are classified into broad ancestry groups At the census the most commonly nominated ancestry groups as a proportion of the total population were European including North West European and Southern and Eastern European Oceanian Asian including Southern and Central Asian North East Asian and South East Asian North African and Middle Eastern Peoples of the Americas and Sub Saharan African At the census the most commonly nominated individual ancestries as a proportion of the total population were br br At the census of the Australian population identified as being Indigenous Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders br br br Language br br Although English is not the official language of Australia in law it is the de facto official and national language Australian English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling General Australian serves as the standard dialect br At the census English was the only
