Hotel in Montreal on November after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization the National Hockey Association NHA which had been founded in at Renfrew Ontario The NHL immediately took the NHA s place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in br At its inception the NHL had four teams all in Canada thus the adjective National in the league s name The league expanded to the United States in when the Boston Bruins joined and has since consisted of both American and Canadian teams From to the league had only six teams collectively if not contemporaneously nicknamed the Original Six The NHL added six new

awarded a rd franchise in as it acquired the hockey assets of the Arizona franchise which became inactive thus maintaining the total number of teams at Arizona subsequently ceased efforts to re activate shortly thereafter bringing the league back to franchises br The NHL is the fifth highest grossing professional sport league in the world by revenue after the National Football League NFL Major League Baseball MLB the National Basketball Association NBA and the Premier League PL The league s headquarters have been in Manhattan since when the head office moved from Montreal There have been four league wide work stoppages in NHL history all occurring after br The NHL s regular season is typically held from October to April with each team playing games Following the conclusion of the regular season teams advance to the Stanley Cup playoffs a four round tournament that runs into June to determine the league champion Since the league s founding in the Montreal Canadiens have won the most combined NHL titles with winning three NHL championship series before the league took full exclusivity of the Stanley Cup in and Stanley Cups afterwards The reigning league champions are the Florida Panthers who defeated the Edmonton Oilers in the Stanley Cup Finals br br The National Hockey League was established in as the successor to the National Hockey Association NHA Founded in the NHA began play in with seven teams in Ontario and Quebec and was one of the first major leagues in professional ice hockey However by its eighth season a series of disputes with Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone led team owners of the Montreal Canadiens the Montreal Wanderers the Ottawa Senators and the Quebec Bulldogs to hold a meeting to discuss the league s future Realizing the NHA constitution left them unable to force Livingstone out the four teams voted instead to suspend the NHA and on November formed the National Hockey League Frank Calder was chosen as the NHL s first president serving until his death in br The Bulldogs were unable to play in the NHL and the remaining owners founded the Toronto Arenas to compete with the Canadiens Wanderers and Senators The first games were played on December The Montreal Arena burned down in January causing the Wanderers to cease operations and the NHL continued on as a three team league until the Bulldogs returned in br br The NHL replaced the NHA as one of the leagues that competed for the Stanley Cup an interleague competition at the time Toronto won the first NHL title and then defeated the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association PCHA for the Stanley Cup The Canadiens won the league title in but the series in the Stanley Cup Finals against the PCHA s Seattle Metropolitans was abandoned due to the Spanish Flu epidemic In Montreal won their first Stanley Cup as a member of the NHL The Hamilton Tigers won the regular season title in but refused to play in the championship series unless they were given a C bonus The league refused and declared the Canadiens the league champion after they defeated the Toronto St Patricks formerly the Arenas in the semi final Montreal was then defeated by the Victoria Cougars of the Western Canada Hockey League WCHL in It was the last time a non NHL team won the trophy as the Stanley Cup became the de facto NHL championship in after the WCHL ceased operation br The National Hockey League embarked on a rapid expansion in the s adding the Montreal Maroons and the Boston Bruins in the latter being the first American team to join the league The New York Americans began play in after purchasing the assets of the Hamilton Tigers and they were joined by the Pittsburgh Pirates The New York Rangers were added in and the Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Cougars later the Red Wings were added after the league purchased the assets of the defunct WCHL A group purchased the Toronto St Patricks in and immediately renamed them the Toronto Maple Leafs br In Native American Taffy Abel became the first non white player in the NHL and broke the league s color barrier by playing for the New York Rangers br In the first NHL All Star Game was held to benefit Ace Bailey whose career ended on a vicious hit by Eddie Shore The second was held in in support of Howie Morenz s family when he died of a coronary embolism after breaking his leg during a game br br The Great Depression and the onset of World War II took a toll on the league The Pirates became the Philadelphia Quakers in then folded a year later The Senators likewise became the St Louis Eagles in also lasting only a year The Maroons did not survive as they suspended operations in The Americans were suspended in due to a lack of available players and they were never reactivated br br For the season the NHL was reduced to six teams the Boston Bruins the Chicago Black Hawks the Detroit Red Wings the Montreal Canadiens the New York Rangers and the Toronto Maple Leafs a line up often referred to as the Original Six that would remain constant for the next years In the league reached an agreement with the Stanley Cup trustees to take full control of the trophy allowing it to reject challenges from other leagues that wished to play for the Cup br In Maurice Rocket Richard became the first player to score goals doing so in a game season Richard later led the Canadiens to five consecutive titles between and a record no team has matched br In Asian Canadian Larry Kwong became the first Asian player in the NHL by playing for the New York Rangers In Willie O Ree became the first black player in the league s history when he made his debut with the Boston Bruins br br By the mid s the desire for a network television contract in the United States coupled with concerns that the Western Hockey League was planning to declare itself a major league and challenge for the Stanley Cup spurred the NHL to undertake its first expansion since the s The league doubled in size to teams for the season adding the Los Angeles Kings the Minnesota North Stars the Philadelphia Flyers the Pittsburgh Penguins the California Seals and the St Louis Blues However Canadian fans were outraged that all six teams were placed in the United States so the league responded by adding the Vancouver Canucks in along with the Buffalo Sabres both located on the Canada United States border Two years later the emergence of the newly founded World Hockey Association WHA led the league to add the New York Islanders and the Atlanta Flames to keep the rival league out of those markets In the Washington Capitals and the Kansas City Scouts were added bringing the league up to teams br br The NHL fought the WHA for players losing to the new league in its first season of including the Chicago Black Hawks Bobby Hull who signed a year million contract with the Winnipeg Jets then the largest in hockey history The league attempted to block the defections in court but a counter suit by the WHA led to a Philadelphia judge ruling the NHL s reserve clause to be illegal thus eliminating the elder league s monopoly over the players Seven years of battling for players and markets financially damaged both leagues leading to a merger agreement in that saw the WHA cease operations while the NHL absorbed the Winnipeg Jets the Edmonton Oilers the Hartford Whalers and the Quebec Nordiques The owners initially rejected this merger agreement by one vote but a massive boycott of Molson Brewery products by Canadian fans resulted in the Montreal Canadiens which was owned by Molson reversing its position along with the Vancouver Canucks In a second vote the plan was approved br Wayne Gretzky played one season in the WHA for the Indianapolis Racers eight games and the Edmonton Oilers games before the Oilers joined the NHL for the season Gretzky went on to lead the Oilers to win four Stanley Cup championships in and and set single season records for goals in assists in and points in as well as career records for goals assists and points In he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in a deal that dramatically improved the league s popularity in the United States By the turn of the century nine more teams were added to the NHL the San Jose Sharks the Tampa Bay Lightning the Ottawa Senators the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim the Florida Panthers the Nashville Predators the Atlanta Thrashers and in the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets Also in the mid to late s the Quebec Nordiques original Winnipeg Jets and Hartford Whalers relocated to Denver Phoenix and Raleigh In the Atlanta Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg and the Winnipeg Jets were revived On July the NHL confirmed that it had received applications from prospective ownership groups in Quebec City and Las Vegas for possible expansion teams and on June NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced the addition of a st franchise based in Las Vegas and later named the Vegas Golden Knights into the NHL for the season On December the league announced a nd franchise in Seattle later named the Seattle Kraken which joined in the season On April the Arizona Coyotes suspended operations and sold their hockey assets including players and other personnel to a new team in Salt Lake City Utah Two months after Utah s foundation the Coyotes ceased their efforts to re activate within the five year window granted to do so bringing the NHL back to franchises br br There have been four league wide work stoppages in NHL history all occurring after The first was an April strike by the National Hockey League Players Association which lasted for ten days but was settled quickly with all affected games rescheduled br A lockout at the start of the season forced the league to reduce the schedule from games to with the teams playing only intra conference games during the reduced season The resulting collective bargaining agreement CBA was set for renegotiation in and extended to September br With no new agreement in hand when the contract expired league commissioner Gary Bettman announced a lockout of the players union and closed the league s head office for the season The league vowed to install what it dubbed cost certainty for its teams but the Players Association countered that the move was little more than a euphemism for a salary cap which the union initially said it would not accept The lockout shut down the league for days making it the longest in sports history as the NHL became the first professional sports league to lose an entire season A new collective bargaining agreement was eventually ratified in July including a salary cap The agreement had a term of six years with an option of extending the collective bargaining agreement for an additional year at the end of the term allowing the league to resume as of the season br On October the first post lockout season took to the ice with all teams The NHL received record attendance in the season with an average of per game However its television audience was slower to rebound due to American cable broadcaster ESPN s decision to drop its NHL coverage The league s post lockout agreement with NBC gave the league a share of revenue from each game s advertising sales rather than the usual lump sum paid up front for game rights The league s annual revenues were estimated at billion br On September the labour pact expired and the league again locked out the players The owners proposed reducing the players share of hockey related revenues from percent to percent All games were cancelled up to January along with the NHL Winter Classic and the NHL All Star Weekend On January a tentative agreement was reached on a year deal On January the league and the Players Association signed a memorandum of understanding on the new deal allowing teams to begin their training camps the next day with a shortened game season schedule that began on January br br Player safety has become a major issue in the NHL with concussions resulting from a hard hit to the head being the primary concern Recent studies have shown how the consequences of concussions can last beyond player retirement This has significant effects on the league as elite players have suffered from the aftereffects of concussions such as Sidney Crosby being sidelined for approximately ten and a half months which adversely affects the league s marketability In December Brendan Shanahan was hired to replace Colin Campbell and was given the role of senior vice president of player safety Shanahan began to hand out suspensions on high profile perpetrators responsible for dangerous hits such as Raffi Torres receiving games for his hit on Marian Hossa br To aid with removing high speed collisions on icing which had led to several potential career ending injuries such as to Hurricanes defenceman Joni Pitkanen the league mandated hybrid no touch icing for the NHL season br On November ten former NHL players Gary Leeman Rick Vaive Brad Aitken Darren Banks Curt Bennett Richie Dunn Warren Holmes Bob Manno Blair Stewart and Morris Titanic sued the league for negligence in protecting players from concussions The suit came three months after the National Football League agreed to pay former players US million due to a player safety lawsuit br br From to Marguerite Norris served as president of the Detroit Red Wings being the first female NHL executive and the first woman to have her name engraved on the Stanley Cup In Manon Rh aume became the first woman to play a game in any of the major professional North American sports leagues as a goaltender for the Tampa Bay Lightning in a pre season game against the St Louis Blues stopping seven of nine shots In Dawn Braid was hired as the Arizona Coyotes skating coach making her the first female full time coach in the NHL The first female referees in the NHL were hired in a test run during the league s preseason prospect tournaments in September br In the NHL hosted the Outdoor Women s Classic an exhibition game between the Boston Pride of the National Women s Hockey League and the Les Canadiennes of the Canadian Women s Hockey League as part of the NHL Winter Classic weekend festivities In the NHL invited four women from the US and Canadian Olympic teams to demonstrate the events in All Star skills competition before the All Star Game Due to Nathan MacKinnon choosing not to participate following a bruised ankle Team USA s Kendall Coyne Schofield competed in the Fastest Skater competition in his place becoming the first woman to officially compete in the NHL s All Star festivities The attention led the NHL to include a on women s game before the All Star Game Rheaume returned to perform as a goaltender for the NHL All Star Game s Breakaway Challenge br br The Board of Governors is the ruling and governing body of the National Hockey League In this context each team is a member of the league and each member appoints a Governor usually the owner of the club and two alternates to the Board The current chairman of the Board is Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs The Board of Governors exists to establish the policies of the league and to uphold its constitution Some of the responsibilities of the Board of Governors include br br review and approve any changes to the league s rules br hiring and firing of the commissioner br review and approve the purchase sale or relocation of any member club br review and approve the salary caps for member clubs br review and approve any changes to the structure of the game schedule

Bettman and chairman Jeremy Jacobs is responsible for vetting new ownership applications collective bargaining and league expansion Other members include Mark Chipman N Murray Edwards Craig Leipold Ted Leonsis Geoff Molson Henry Samueli Larry Tanenbaum Jeff Vinik and David Blitzer br br From the season to the season the NHL consisted of teams based in the United States and in Canada The NHL divided the teams into two conferences the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference Each conference was split into two divisions the Eastern Conference contained teams eight per division while the Western Conference had teams seven in the Central and eight in the Pacific The league temporarily realigned for the season but returned to the previous alignment the following year With the addition of the Seattle Kraken in to the Pacific Division and the Arizona Coyotes move from the Pacific to the Central all four divisions now have eight teams each and both conferences have teams br The number of NHL teams held constant at teams from the season when the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets joined the league as expansion teams until That expansion capped a period in the s of rapid expansion and relocation when the NHL added nine teams to grow from to teams and relocated four teams mostly from smaller northern cities to larger more southern metropolitan areas Minneapolis to Dallas Quebec City to Denver Winnipeg to Phoenix and Hartford to Raleigh The league has not contracted any teams since the Cleveland Barons were merged into the Minnesota North Stars in The league expanded for the first time in years to teams with the addition of the Vegas Golden Knights in then to with the addition of the Seattle Kraken in In April a new expansion team in Utah was created after Alex Meruelo sold the hockey assets of the Arizona Coyotes to Ryan Smith owner of the Utah Jazz Meruelo was granted until to secure an arena in Arizona in order to re activate the team bringing the total number of franchises in the NHL up to however these efforts were abandoned two months later leaving the NHL at franchises once again br According to Forbes in the top five most valuable teams were four of the Original Six teams and the Los Angeles Kings br br Toronto Maple Leafs US billion br New York Rangers US billion br Montreal Canadiens US billion br Los Angeles Kings US billion br Boston Bruins US billion br The remaining members of the Original Six the Chicago Blackhawks and the Detroit Red Wings respectively ranked sixth at US billion and hypothetically th at US billion Compared with the Maple Leafs surpassed the Rangers as the most valuable NHL team and Los Angeles overtook both Chicago and Boston making its way into the top five br br Notes br br The National Hockey League s rules are one of the two standard sets of professional ice hockey rules in the world the other being the rules of the International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF as used in tournaments such as the Olympics The IIHF rules are derived from the Canadian amateur ice hockey rules of the early th century while the NHL rules evolved directly from the first organized indoor ice hockey game in Montreal in updated by subsequent leagues up to when the NHL adopted the existing NHA set of rules The NHL s rules are the basis for rules governing most professional and major junior ice hockey leagues in North America br The NHL hockey rink is by feet m m approximately the same length but much narrower than IIHF standards A trapezoidal area appears behind each goal net The goaltender can play the puck only within the trapezoid or in front of the goal line if the goaltender plays the puck behind the goal line and outside the trapezoidal area a two minute minor penalty for delay of game is assessed The rule is unofficially nicknamed the Martin Brodeur rule Brodeur at the time was one of the best goaltenders at getting behind the net to handle the puck Since the season the league trimmed the goal frames by inches cm on each side and reduced the size of the goalies leg pads br br The league has regularly modified its rules to counter perceived imperfections in the game The penalty shot was adopted from the Pacific Coast Hockey Association to ensure players were not being blocked from opportunities to score For the season the league changed some of the rules regarding being offside First the league removed the offside pass or two line pass rule which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team s defending zone was completed on the offensive side of the centre line unless the puck crossed the line before the player Furthermore the league reinstated the tag up offside which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone The changes to the offside rule were among several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid nineties and the increased prevalence of the neutral zone trap Since when a team is guilty of icing the puck they are not allowed to make a line change or skater substitution of any sort before the following face off except to replace an injured player or re install a pulled goaltender Since the league has used hybrid icing where a linesman stops play due to icing if a defending player other than the goaltender crosses the imaginary line that connects the two face off dots in their defensive zone before an attacking player is able to This was done to counter a trend of player injury in races to the puck br Fighting in the NHL leads to major penalties while IIHF rules and most amateur rules call for the ejection of fighting players Usually a penalized team cannot replace a player that is penalized on the ice and is thus short handed for the duration of the penalty but if the penalties are coincidental for example when two players fight both teams remain at full strength Also unlike minor penalties major penalties must be served to their full completion regardless of number of goals scored during the power play br The league also imposes a conduct policy on its players Players are banned from gambling and criminal activities have led to the suspension of players The league and the Players Association agreed to a stringent anti doping policy in the collective bargaining agreement The policy provides for a twenty game suspension for a first positive test a sixty game suspension for a second positive test and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test br At the end of regulation time the team with the most goals wins the game If a game is tied after regulation time overtime ensues During the regular season overtime is a five minute three on three sudden death period in which whoever scores a goal first wins the game If the game is still tied at the end of overtime the game enters a shootout Three players for each team in turn take a penalty shot The team with the most goals during the three round shootout wins the game If the game is still tied after the three shootout rounds the shootout continues but becomes sudden death Whichever team ultimately wins the shootout is awarded a goal in the game score and thus awarded two points in the standings The losing team in overtime or shootout is awarded one point Shootout goals and saves are not tracked in hockey statistics shootout statistics are tracked separately br There are no shootouts during the playoffs Instead multiple sudden death minute five on five periods are played until one team scores Two games have reached six overtime periods but none have gone beyond six During playoff overtime periods the only break is to clean the loose ice at the first stoppage after the period is halfway finished br br The National Hockey League season is divided into a preseason September and early October a regular season from early October through early to mid April and a postseason the Stanley Cup playoffs br Teams usually hold a summer showcase for prospects in July and participate in prospect tournaments full games that do not feature any veterans in September Full training camps begin in mid to late September including a preseason consisting of six to eight exhibition games Split squad games in which parts of a team s regular season roster play separate games on the same day are occasionally played during the preseason br During the regular season clubs play each other in a predefined schedule Since in the regular season all teams play games games each of home and road playing games in their own geographic division four against five of their seven other divisional opponents plus three against two others games against the eight remaining non divisional intra conference opponents three games against every team in the other division of its conference and against every team in the other conference twice home and road br The league s regular season standings are based on a point system Two points are awarded for a win one point for losing in overtime or a shootout and zero points for a loss in regulation At the end of the regular season the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion and the league s overall leader is awarded the Presidents Trophy br The Stanley Cup playoffs which go from April to the beginning of June are an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best of seven series in order to advance to the next round The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup champion Eight teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs the top three teams in each division plus the two conference teams with the next highest number of points The two conference champions proceed to the Stanley Cup Finals In all rounds the higher ranked team is awarded home ice advantage with four of the seven games played at this team s home venue In the Stanley Cup Finals the team with the most points during the regular season has home ice advantage br br The annual NHL Entry Draft consists of a seven round off season draft held in June on a date of the commissioner s choosing Early NHL drafts took place at the Queen Elizabeth currently Fairmont Hotel in Montreal Amateur players from junior collegiate or European leagues are eligible to enter the Entry Draft The selection order is determined by a combination of the standings at the end of the regular season playoff results and a draft lottery The teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round with the last place team having the best chance of winning the lottery Once the lottery determines the initial draft picks the order for the remaining non playoff teams is determined by the standings at the end of the regular season For those teams that did qualify for the playoffs the draft order is then determined by total regular season points for non division winners that are eliminated in the first two rounds of the playoffs then any division winners that failed to reach the Conference Finals Conference finalists receive the th and th picks depending on total points with the Stanley Cup runner up given the st pick and the Stanley Cup champions the final pick br br The most prestigious team award is the Stanley Cup which is awarded to the league champion at the end of the Stanley Cup playoffs The team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the Presidents Trophy br The Montreal Canadiens are the most successful franchise in the league Since the formation of the league in they have NHL championships three between and when the Stanley Cup was still contested in an interleague competition twenty two since after the Stanley Cup became the NHL s championship trophy They also lead all teams with Stanley Cup championships one as an NHA team twenty three as an NHL team Of the four major professional sports leagues in North America the Montreal Canadiens are surpassed in the number of championships only by the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball who have three more br The longest streak of winning the Stanley Cup in consecutive years is five held by the Montreal Canadiens from to The edition of the Montreal Canadiens the second of four straight Stanley Cup champions was named by ESPN as the second greatest sports team of all time br The next most successful NHL franchise is the Toronto Maple Leafs with Stanley Cup championships most recently in The Detroit Red Wings with Stanley Cup championships are the most successful American franchise br The same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards The Stanley Cup much like its counterpart in the Canadian Football League CFL is unique in this aspect as opposed to the Vince Lombardi Trophy Larry O Brien Trophy and Commissioner s Trophy which have new ones made every year for that year s champion Despite only one trophy being used the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the Stanley Cup The same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year br br Apart from the NHL sanctioned trophies which teams often recognize by putting up banners in the rafters of their arenas many teams also claim titles which are not represented by trophies often also by putting up banners in their rafters One example is the division title or division championship The term unambiguously refers to the team that received the most points in its division at the end of the regular season but in some previous seasons for example from to and from to when the playoffs where organized along divisions the term without qualification could also refer to the team which won the corresponding playoff series The NHL has made clear in the past that it only allows teams to recognize regular season division titles br br There are numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season they include among others the Art Ross Trophy for the league scoring champion goals and assists the Maurice Rocket Richard Trophy for the goal scoring leader and the William M Jennings Trophy for the goaltender s for the team with the fewest goals against them br The other player trophies are voted on by the Professional Hockey Writers Association or the team general managers These individual awards are presented at a formal ceremony held in late June after the playoffs have concluded The most prestigious individual award is the Hart Memorial Trophy which is awarded annually to the Most Valuable Player the voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season The Vezina Trophy is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goaltender as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the NHL The James Norris Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the National Hockey League s top defenceman the Calder Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the top rookie and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship all three of these awards are voted on by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association br In addition to the regular season awards the Conn Smythe Trophy is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the NHL s Stanley Cup playoffs Furthermore the top coach in the league wins the Jack Adams Award as selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association The National Hockey League publishes the names of the top three vote getters for all awards and then names the award winner during the NHL Awards Ceremony br Players coaches officials and team builders who have had notable careers are eligible to be voted into the Hockey Hall of Fame Players cannot enter until three years have passed since their last professional game currently tied with the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame for the shortest such time period of any major sport One unique consequence has been Hall of Fame members specifically Gordie Howe Guy Lafleur and Mario Lemieux coming out of retirement to play once more If a player was deemed significant enough the three year wait would be waived only ten individuals have been honoured in this manner In Wayne Gretzky joined the Hall and became the last player to have the three year restriction waived After his induction the Hall of Fame announced that Gretzky would be the last to have the waiting period waived br br In addition to Canadian and American born and trained players who have historically composed a large majority of NHL rosters the NHL also draws players from an expanding pool of other nations where organized and professional hockey is played Since the collapse of the Soviet Bloc political ideological restrictions on the movement of hockey players from this region have disappeared leading to a large influx of players mostly from the Czech Republic Slovakia and Russia into the NHL Swedes Finns and Western European players who were always free to move to North America came to the league in greater numbers than before br Many of the league s top players in recent years have come from these European countries including Daniel Alfredsson Erik Karlsson Henrik Sedin Daniel Sedin Henrik Lundqvist Jaromir Jagr Patrik Elias Zdeno Chara Pavel Datsyuk Evgeni Malkin Nicklas Lidstrom and Alexander Ovechkin European players were drafted and signed by NHL teams in an effort to bring in more skilled offensive players although as of there has been a decline in European players as more American players enter the league The addition of European players changed the style of play in the NHL and European style hockey has been integrated into the NHL game br As of the season the NHL has players from countries with coming from Canada and from the United States while players from a further countries make up of NHL rosters The following table shows the seven countries that make up the vast majority of NHL players The table follows the Hockey Hall of Fame convention of classifying players by the currently existing countries in which their birthplaces are located without regard to their citizenship or where they were trained br br The NHL lists its several official corporate partners into three categories North American Partners USA Partners and Canada Partners Discover Card is the league s official credit card in the United States while competitor Visa is an official sponsor in Canada Likewise Tim Hortons is the league s official coffee and doughnuts chain in Canada while Dunkin Donuts is the NHL s sponsor in the United States br Among its North American corporate sponsors Kraft Heinz sponsors Kraft Hockeyville an annual competition in which communities compete to demonstrate their commitment to the sport of ice hockey The winning community gets a cash prize dedicated to upgrading their local home arena as well as the opportunity to host an NHL pre season game Two contests are held one for communities across Canada and a separate competition for communities in the US br At least two of the North American corporate sponsors have ties to NHL franchise owners the Molson family founders of Molson Brewery has owned the Montreal Canadiens for years while SAP was co founded by Hasso Plattner the current majority owner of the San Jose Sharks br Many of these same corporate partners become the title sponsors for the league s All Star and outdoor games br Beginning in the NHL season the league allowed for advertising on its gameday uniforms for the first time starting with helmet ads The NHL will have advertising on the front of team jerseys for the first time starting in the season br On May NHL and the sports betting company Betway announced a multi year partnership in which Betway became the official sports betting partner to the NHL in North America br br Broadcasting rights in Canada have historically included the CBC s Hockey Night in Canada HNIC a Canadian tradition dating

to the other American professional leagues The league s American broadcast partners had been in flux for decades prior to Hockey broadcasting on a national scale was particularly spotty prior to NBC CBS and ABC held rights at various times during that period but with limited schedules during the second half of the regular season and the playoffs along with some but not all of the Stanley Cup Finals The NHL primarily was then only available on cable television after airing on the USA Network SportsChannel America and ESPN at various times Since national coverage has been split between broadcast and cable first with Fox and ESPN from to then followed by ABC and ESPN from to The U S national rights were then held by NBC and OLN later renamed Versus then NBCSN between the NHL lockout

regionally within a team s home market and are subject to blackout outside of them These broadcasters include regional sports network chains Certain national telecasts are non exclusive and may also air in tandem with telecasts of the game by local broadcasters However national telecasts of these games are blacked out in the participating teams markets to protect the local broadcaster br br The
