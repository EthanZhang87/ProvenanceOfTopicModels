Eastern Conference Finals br br br League business br Throughout the regular season and playoffs teams wore a patch celebrating the turn of the millennium see above br Beginning this season teams would earn one point for an overtime loss in the regular season instead of zero It was hoped that this change would stop teams from playing very defensively during the overtime to guarantee the single point from a tie The number of ties had been going up for some years and the NHL was hoping to counter this trend and did so quite successfully with this rule change br Wayne Gretzky s jersey number
