The American Hockey League AHL is a professional ice hockey league based in the United States and Canada that serves as the primary developmental league for the National Hockey League NHL As of the AHL season All NHL teams held affiliations with an AHL team Historically when an NHL team does not have an AHL affiliate its players are assigned to AHL teams affiliated with other NHL franchises br Twenty six AHL teams are located across the United States whereas the remaining six are situated in Canada The league offices are located in Springfield Massachusetts and its current president is Scott Howson br A player must be at least years of age to play in the AHL or not currently be beholden to a junior ice hockey team The league limits the number of experienced professional players in a team s lineup during any given game only five skaters can have accumulated more than games played at the professional level goaltenders are exempt from this rule br The annual playoff champion is awarded the Calder Cup named for Frank Calder the first President of the NHL The defending champions following the season are the Hershey Bears winning their th Calder Cup in franchise history br br br History br br br Predecessor leagues br The AHL traces its origins directly to two predecessor professional leagues the Canadian American Hockey League the Can Am League founded in and the first International Hockey League established in Although the Can Am League never operated with more than six teams the departure of the Boston Bruin Cubs after the season reduced it down to just four member clubs the Springfield Indians Philadelphia Ramblers Providence Reds and New Haven Eagles for the first time in its history At the same time the then rival IHL lost half of its eight members after the season leaving it with just four member teams the Buffalo Bisons Syracuse Stars Pittsburgh Hornets and Cleveland Falcons br br br br With both leagues down to the bare minimum number of teams to be viable the governors of both leagues recognized the need for action to assure their member clubs long term survival Their solution was to play an interlocking schedule While the Can Am was based in the Northeast and the IHL in the Great Lakes their footprints were close enough for this to be a viable option The two leagues eight surviving clubs began joint play in November as a new two division circuit of mutual convenience known as the International American Hockey League The four Can Am teams became the I AHL East Division with the IHL quartet playing as the West Division The IHL also contributed its former championship trophy the F G Teddy Oke Trophy which would go to the regular season winners of the merged league s West Division until The Oke Trophy is now awarded to the regular season winners of the AHL s North Division br A little more than a month into that first season the balance and symmetry of the new combined circuit suffered a setback when its membership unexpectedly fell to seven teams The West s Buffalo Bisons were forced to cease operations on December after playing just games because of what proved to be insurmountable financial problems and lack of access to a suitable arena the Bisons original arena Peace Bridge Arena had collapsed the previous season a new Buffalo Bisons team would return to the league in after a new arena was constructed for them The makeshift new I AHL played out the rest of its first season as well as all of the next with just seven teams br At the end of the season a modified three round playoff format was devised and a new championship trophy the Calder Cup was established The Syracuse Stars defeated the Philadelphia Ramblers in the final three games to one to win the first ever Calder Cup championship The Calder Cup continues on today as the AHL s playoff championship trophy br br br Formal consolidation of the I AHL br br After two seasons of interlocking play the governors of the two leagues seven active teams met in New York City on June and agreed that it was time to formally consolidate Maurice Podoloff of New Haven the former head of the Can Am League was elected the I AHL s first president The former IHL president John D Chick of Windsor Ontario became vice president in charge of officials br The new I AHL also added an eighth franchise at the meeting to fill the void in its membership left by the loss of Buffalo two years earlier with the admission of the then two time defending Eastern Amateur Hockey League EAHL champion Hershey Bears The Bears remain the only one of these eight original I AHL AHL franchises to have been represented in the league without interruption since the season The newly merged circuit also increased its regular season schedule for each team by six games from to br br br Contraction resurrection and expansion br br After the season the I AHL renamed itself the American Hockey League It generally enjoyed both consistent success on the ice and relative financial stability over its first three decades of operation In the late s and early s however the cost of doing business in professional ice hockey began to rise sharply with NHL expansion and relocation the NHL placed teams in Pittsburgh and Buffalo forcing two long time AHL clubs the Pittsburgh Hornets and Buffalo Bisons to fold and especially the formation of the World Hockey Association WHA which forced the relocation and subsequent folding of the Cleveland Barons Baltimore Clippers and Quebec Aces The number of major league teams competing for players rose from six to thirty in just seven years Player salaries at all levels shot up dramatically with the increased demand and competition for their services br This did not seem to affect the AHL at first as it expanded to teams by However to help compensate for the rise in player salaries many NHL clubs cut back on the number of players they kept under contract for development and players under AHL contracts could now also demand much higher paychecks to remain with their clubs As a result half of the AHL s teams folded from to The league bottomed out in the summer of with news that the Rhode Island formerly Providence Reds the last remaining uninterrupted franchise from the season and the oldest continuously operating minor league franchise in North America had decided to cease operations after years in Rhode Island br The AHL appeared in serious danger of folding altogether if this downward trend was not reversed However two events in the fall of helped reverse the trend The first of these was the decision of the NHL s Philadelphia Flyers to return to the league as a team owner and the second was the unexpected collapse of the North American Hockey League just weeks before the start of the season br The Flyers new AHL franchise became the immediately successful Maine Mariners which brought the new AHL city of Portland Maine both the regular season and Calder Cup playoff titles in each of that club s first two seasons of operation The folding of the NAHL meanwhile suddenly left two of its stronger teams the Philadelphia Firebirds and Binghamton New York based Broome Dusters without a league to play in The owners of the Dusters solved their problem by buying the Reds franchise and moving it to Binghamton as the Binghamton Dusters while the Firebirds crossed over to the AHL from the NAHL The Dusters and Firebirds together with the Hampton Gulls who had joined the league from the Southern Hockey League boosted the AHL to nine member clubs as the season opened Hampton folded on February but was replaced the next year by the New Brunswick Hawks With franchise stability improving after the demise of the WHA in the league continued to grow steadily over the years reaching clubs by the season br br br Absorption of the IHL br br In the AHL s membership jumped dramatically to teams mostly by the absorption of six teams Milwaukee Chicago Houston Utah Manitoba and Grand Rapids from the International Hockey League The IHL had established itself as the second top level minor league circuit in North America but folded in due to financial problems One oddity caused by the AHL s expansion was that the league had two teams with the same nickname the Milwaukee Admirals and the Norfolk Admirals The latter team transferred to the league from the mid level ECHL in This situation lasted until the end of the season when the Norfolk team moved to San Diego and was replaced by another ECHL team with the same name br The Utah Grizzlies suspended operations after the season the franchise was sold in and returned to the ice in Cleveland in as the Lake Erie Monsters now known as the Cleveland Monsters The Chicago Wolves Houston Aeros Milwaukee Admirals and Grand Rapids Griffins have all won Calder Cup titles since joining the AHL from the IHL Chicago and Milwaukee have also made multiple trips to the Calder Cup Finals and Houston made their second Finals appearance in br The Manitoba Moose moved to St John s Newfoundland and Labrador in and were renamed the St John s IceCaps after the NHL s Atlanta Thrashers moved to Winnipeg as the second incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets In Houston moved to Des Moines Iowa to become the Iowa Wild This left Chicago Grand Rapids and Milwaukee as the only ex IHL teams still in their original cities until the relocations when the IceCaps moved back to Winnipeg as the Manitoba Moose br br br Relocations and western shift br br Beginning with the season twelve franchises have since relocated due to NHL parent clubs influence on their development teams and players Of the twelve relocated franchises nine were relocated because they were directly owned by NHL teams and the NHL parent club wished to make call ups from the AHL more practical by having closer affiliates br In January the AHL announced the relocation of five existing AHL franchises Adirondack Manchester Norfolk Oklahoma City and Worcester to California as the basis for a new Pacific Division becoming Stockton Ontario San Diego Bakersfield and San Jose respectively The relocated teams were all affiliated and owned or purchased by teams in the NHL s Pacific Division The franchise movements continued with two more relocations involving Canadian teams with the St John s IceCaps going back to Winnipeg as the Manitoba Moose and the Hamilton Bulldogs becoming another iteration of the IceCaps to fulfill the arena contract in St John s br In the following seasons more NHL organizations influenced league membership In the Springfield Falcons franchise was purchased by the Arizona Coyotes and relocated to become the Tucson Roadrunners and join the one year old Pacific Division The Falcons were subsequently replaced by the Springfield Thunderbirds the relocated Portland Pirates franchise under a new ownership group The Montreal Canadiens owned IceCaps relocated to the Montreal suburb of Laval Quebec and became the Laval Rocket in The Binghamton Senators were also purchased by the Ottawa Senators and were relocated to Belleville Ontario to become the Belleville Senators while the New Jersey Devils owned Albany Devils were relocated to become the Binghamton Devils br br For the season a st team joined the league with the Colorado Eagles as the NHL s Colorado Avalanche affiliate With the NHL planning to expand to teams in with the Seattle Kraken the Seattle ownership group was approved for a AHL expansion team later announced to be the Coachella Valley Firebirds based in Palm Springs California following the construction of a new arena The original plans for the new arena was eventually cancelled and the team postponed their launch by a year while new arena plans were developed br In February the San Antonio Rampage franchise was bought and relocated by the NHL s Vegas Golden Knights for the season as the Henderson Silver Knights and was moved to the Pacific Division For the season the Vancouver Canucks relocated their franchise from Utica to Abbotsford while the Utica Comets agreed to relocate and operate the franchise that was operating as the Binghamton Devils On May it was announced that the Stockton Heat would be relocating to Calgary Alberta starting the season br For the season the Chicago Wolves operated as the league s only unaffiliated team making them the first team to operate without an NHL partner since the inaugural season of the Worcester IceCats during the season Consequently the Carolina Hurricanes became the only NHL team currently without an AHL affiliate However the Hurricanes loaned some players to the Wolves such as Vasili Ponomaryov and Antti Raanta On May the Hurricanes and Wolves committed to a three year affiliation beginning with
