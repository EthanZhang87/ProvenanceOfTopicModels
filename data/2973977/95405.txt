gave access to resources in the area By these lots numbered about after which they were displaced and integrated into the expanding city of Edmonton br Anthony Henday may have been the first European to enter the area of modern day Edmonton while exploring the prairies of Rupert s Land for the Hudson s Bay Company in the autumn of br By many trading posts had been established around the present metropolitan area and by they had all moved to the current site of the city of Edmonton Fort Edmonton as it was known became the main centre for trade in the area after the merger of the HBC and the NWC Edmonton remained sparsely populated until the Canadian acquisition of Rupert s Land in followed eventually by the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway in its inauguration as a city in and its

taking the fort s namesake from the hometown of the Lake family at least five of whom were influential members of the Hudson s Bay Company between and In turn the name of Edmonton derives from Adelmetone meaning farmstead estate of adhelm from adhelm an Old English personal name and t n this earlier form of the name appears in the Domesday Book of Fort Edmonton was also called Fort des Prairies by French Canadians trappers and coureurs des bois br Indigenous languages refer to the Edmonton area by multiple names which reference the presence of fur trading posts In Cree the area is known as amiskwac w skahikan which translates to Beaver Hills House and references the location s proximity to the Beaver Hills east of Edmonton In Blackfoot the area is known as Omahkoyis in Nakota Sioux the area is known as Tit ga in Tsuut ina the area is known as N s gh ch anglicised as Nasagachoo The Blackfoot name translates to big lodge while the Nakota Sioux and Tsuut ina names translate

Edmonton around BC and perhaps as early as BC when an ice free corridor opened as the last glacial period ended and timber water and wildlife became available in the region br The site of present day Edmonton was home to several First Nations peoples including the Cree Nakota Sioux Blackfoot Tsuut ina Ojibwe and Denesuline The valley of the North Saskatchewan River in particular the area of Edmonton was settled to varying degrees for thousands of years and provided many essential resources including fish medicine and materials for tool making such as chert or quartzite which are abundant in the area around the modern city and which can be easily knapped into tools such as axes knives and arrowheads br br In Anthony Henday an explorer for the Hudson s Bay Company HBC may have been the first European to enter the Edmonton area His expeditions across the Prairies of Rupert s Land were mainly to seek contact with the Indigenous population for establishing the fur trade as the competition was fierce between the HBC and the North West Company NWC br By Fort Edmonton was established on the river s north bank as a major trading post for the HBC near the mouth of the Sturgeon River close to present day Fort Saskatchewan Fort Edmonton was built within musket shot range of the rival NWC s Fort Augustus Although both forts were initially successful declines in beaver pelt

Strathcona on the river s south side across from Edmonton The arrival of the CPR and the C E Railway helped bring settlers and entrepreneurs from eastern Canada Europe the U S and other parts of the
