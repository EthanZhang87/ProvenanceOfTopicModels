Switzerland officially the Swiss Confederation is a landlocked country located in west central Europe It is bordered by Italy to the south France to the west Germany to the north and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east Switzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau the Alps and the Jura the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory whereas most of the country s population of million are concentrated on the plateau which hosts its largest cities and economic centres including Zurich Geneva and Basel br Switzerland originates from the Old Swiss Confederacy established in the Late Middle Ages following a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy the Federal Charter of is considered the country s founding document Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in Switzerland has maintained a policy of armed neutrality since the th century and has not fought an international war since It joined the United Nations only in but pursues an active foreign policy that includes frequent involvement in peace building br Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross and hosts the headquarters or offices of most major international institutions including the WTO the WHO the ILO FIFA and the UN It is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association EFTA but not part of the European Union EU the European Economic Area or the eurozone however it participates in the European single market and the Schengen Area Switzerland is a federal republic composed of cantons with federal authorities based in Bern br Switzerland is one of the world s most developed countries with the highest nominal wealth per adult and the eighth highest gross domestic product GDP per capita Switzerland ranks first in the Human Development Index since and also performs highly on several international metrics including economic competitiveness and democratic governance Cities such as Zurich Geneva and Basel rank among the highest in terms of quality of life albeit with some of the highest costs of living br It has four main linguistic and cultural regions German French Italian and Romansh Although most Swiss are German speaking national identity is fairly cohesive being rooted in a common historical background shared values such as federalism and direct democracy and Alpine symbolism Swiss identity transcends language ethnicity and religion leading to Switzerland being described as a Willensnation nation of volition rather than a nation state Due to its linguistic diversity Switzerland is known by multiple native names Schweiz va ts German Suisse s is French Svizzera zvittsera Italian and Svizra vi tsr vi ts Romansh On coins and stamps the Latin name Confoederatio Helvetica frequently shortened to Helvetia is used instead of the spoken languages br br br Etymology br br The English name Switzerland is a portmanteau of Switzer an obsolete term for a Swiss person which was in use during the th to th centuries and land The English adjective Swiss is a loanword from French Suisse also in use since the th century The name Switzer is from the Alemannic Schwiizer in origin an inhabitant of Schwyz and its associated territory one of the Waldst tte cantons which formed the nucleus of the Old Swiss Confederacy The Swiss began to adopt the name for themselves after the Swabian War of used alongside the term for Confederates Eidgenossen literally comrades by oath used since the th century The data code for Switzerland CH is derived from Latin Confoederatio Helvetica Helvetic Confederation br The toponym Schwyz itself was first attested in as Old High German Suittes perhaps related to swedan to burn cf Old Norse sv a to singe burn referring to the area of forest that was burned and cleared to build The name was extended to the area dominated by the canton and after the Swabian War of gradually came to be used for the entire Confederation The Swiss German name of the country Schwiiz is homophonous to that of the canton and the settlement but distinguished by the use of the definite article d Schwiiz for the Confederation but simply Schwyz for the canton and the town The long i of Swiss German is historically and still often today spelled y rather than ii preserving the original identity of the two names even in writing br The Latin name Confoederatio Helvetica was neologised and introduced gradually after the formation of the federal state in harking back to the Napoleonic Helvetic Republic It appeared on coins from inscribed on the Federal Palace in and after used in the official seal e g the ISO banking code CHF for the Swiss franc and the country top level domain ch are both taken from the state s Latin name Helvetica is derived from the Helvetii a Gaulish tribe living on the Swiss Plateau before the Roman era br Helvetia appeared as a national personification of the Swiss confederacy in the th century in a play by Johann Caspar Weissenbach br br br History br br The state of Switzerland took its present form with the adoption of the Swiss Federal Constitution in Switzerland s precursors established a defensive alliance in forming a loose confederation that persisted for centuries br br br Beginnings br br The oldest traces of hominid existence in Switzerland date to about years ago The oldest known farming settlements in Switzerland which were found at G chlingen date to around BC br br The earliest known tribes formed the Hallstatt and La T ne cultures named after the archaeological site of La T ne on the north side of Lake Neuch tel La T ne culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age from around BC possibly influenced by Greek and Etruscan civilisations One of the most important tribal groups was the Helvetii Steadily harassed by Germanic tribes in BC the Helvetii decided to abandon the Swiss Plateau and migrate to western Gallia Julius Caesar s armies pursued and defeated them at the Battle of Bibracte in today s eastern France forcing the tribe to move back to its homeland In BC Tiberius later the second Roman emperor and his brother Drusus conquered the Alps integrating them into the Roman Empire The area occupied by the Helvetii first became part of Rome s Gallia Belgica province and then of its Germania Superior province The eastern portion of modern Switzerland was integrated into the Roman province of Raetia Sometime around the start of the Common Era the Romans maintained a large camp called Vindonissa now a ruin at the confluence of the Aare and Reuss rivers near the town of Windisch br The first and second century AD was an age of prosperity on the Swiss Plateau Towns such as Aventicum Iulia Equestris and Augusta Raurica reached a remarkable size while hundreds of agricultural estates Villae rusticae were established in the countryside br Around AD the fall of the Agri Decumates territory north of the Rhine transformed today s Switzerland into a frontier land of the Empire Repeated raids by the Alamanni tribes provoked the ruin of the Roman towns and economy forcing the population to shelter near Roman fortresses like the Castrum Rauracense near Augusta Raurica The Empire built another line of defence at the north border the so called Donau Iller Rhine Limes At the end of the fourth century the increased Germanic pressure forced the Romans to abandon the linear defence concept The Swiss Plateau was finally open to Germanic tribes br In the Early Middle Ages from the end of the fourth century the western extent of modern day Switzerland was part of the territory of the Kings of the Burgundians The Alemanni settled the Swiss Plateau in the fifth century and the valleys of the Alps in the eighth century forming Alemannia Modern day Switzerland was then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and Burgundy The entire region became part of the expanding Frankish Empire in the sixth century following Clovis I s victory over the Alemanni at Tolbiac in AD and later Frankish domination of the Burgundians br Throughout the rest of the sixth seventh and eighth centuries Swiss regions continued under Frankish hegemony Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties but after its extension under Charlemagne the Frankish Empire was divided by the Treaty of Verdun in The territories of present day Switzerland became divided into Middle Francia and East Francia until they were reunified under the Holy Roman Empire around AD br By the Swiss Plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of Savoy Z hringer Habsburg and Kyburg Some regions Uri Schwyz Unterwalden later known as Waldst tten were accorded the Imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes With the extinction of its male line in the Kyburg dynasty fell in AD The Habsburgs under King Rudolph I Holy Roman Emperor in laid claim to the Kyburg lands and annexed them extending their territory to the eastern Swiss Plateau br br br Old Swiss Confederacy br br The Old Swiss Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps The Confederacy was governed by nobles and patricians of various cantons who facilitated management of common interests and ensured peace on mountain trade routes The Federal Charter of is considered the confederacy s founding document even though similar alliances likely existed decades earlier The document was agreed among the rural communes of Uri Schwyz and Unterwalden br By the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of Glarus and Zug and the Lucerne Zurich and Bern city states to form the Old Confederacy of eight states that obtained through the end of the th century The expansion led to increased power and wealth for the confederation By the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the Jura mountains and the University of Basel was founded with a faculty of medicine establishing a tradition of chemical and medical research This increased after victories against the Habsburgs Battle of Sempach Battle of N fels over Charles the Bold of Burgundy during the s and the success of the Swiss mercenaries The Swiss victory in the Swabian War against the Swabian League of Emperor Maximilian I in amounted to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire In Basel and Schaffhausen joined the Old Swiss Confederacy br The Confederacy acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars but expansion of the confederation suffered a setback in with the Swiss defeat in the Battle of Marignano This ended the so called heroic epoch of Swiss history The success of Zwingli s Reformation in some cantons led to inter cantonal religious conflicts in and Wars of Kappel It was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that in under the Peace of Westphalia European countries recognised Switzerland s independence from the Holy Roman Empire and its neutrality br During the Early Modern period of Swiss history the growing authoritarianism of the patriciate families combined with a financial crisis in the wake of the Thirty Years War led to the Swiss peasant war of In the background to this struggle the conflict between Catholic and Protestant cantons persisted erupting in further violence at the First War of Villmergen in and the Toggenburg War or Second War of Villmergen in br br br Napoleonic era br br In the revolutionary French government invaded Switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution This centralised the government of the country effectively abolishing the cantons moreover M lhausen left Switzerland and the Valtellina valley became part of the Cisalpine Republic The new regime known as the Helvetic Republic was highly unpopular An invading foreign army had imposed and destroyed centuries of tradition making Switzerland nothing more than a French satellite state The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September was an example of the oppressive presence of the French Army and the local population s resistance to the occupation br When war broke out between France and its rivals Russian and Austrian forces invaded Switzerland The Swiss refused to fight alongside the French in the name of the Helvetic Republic In Napoleon organised a meeting of the leading Swiss politicians from both sides in Paris The Act of Mediation was the result which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a Confederation of cantons Henceforth much of Swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons tradition of self rule with the need for a central government br In the Congress of Vienna fully re established Swiss independence and the European powers recognised permanent Swiss neutrality Swiss troops served foreign governments until when they fought in the siege of Gaeta The treaty allowed Switzerland to increase its territory with the admission of the cantons of Valais Neuch tel and Geneva Switzerland s borders saw only minor adjustments thereafter br br br Federal state br br The restoration of power to the patriciate was only temporary After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the Z riputsch of civil war the Sonderbundskrieg broke out in when some Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance the Sonderbund The war lasted less than a month causing fewer than casualties most of which were through friendly fire The Sonderbundskrieg had a significant impact on the psychology and society of Switzerland br The war convinced most Swiss of the need for unity and strength Swiss from all strata of society whether Catholic or Protestant from the liberal or conservative current realised that the cantons would profit more from merging their economic and religious interests br Thus while the rest of Europe saw revolutionary uprisings the Swiss drew up a constitution that provided for a federal layout much of it inspired by the American example This constitution provided central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self government on local issues Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons the Sonderbund Kantone the national assembly was divided between an upper house the Council of States two representatives per canton and a lower house the National Council with representatives elected from across the country Referendums were made mandatory for any amendments This new constitution ended the legal power of nobility in Switzerland br br A single system of weights and measures was introduced and in the Swiss franc became the Swiss single currency complemented by the WIR franc in Article of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad marking the end of foreign service It came with the expectation of serving the Holy See and the Swiss were still obliged to serve Francis II of the Two Sicilies with Swiss Guards present at the siege of Gaeta in br An important clause of the constitution was that it could be entirely rewritten if necessary thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a time br This need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the Industrial Revolution that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly The population rejected an early draft in but modifications led to its acceptance in It introduced the facultative referendum for laws at the federal level It also established federal responsibility for defence trade and legal matters br In the constitution was revised with uncommonly strong elements of direct democracy which remain unique today br br br Modern history br br Switzerland was not invaded during either of the world wars During World War I Switzerland was home to the revolutionary and founder of the Soviet Union Vladimir Illych Ulyanov Vladimir Lenin who remained there until Swiss neutrality was seriously questioned by the short lived Grimm Hoffmann affair in In Switzerland joined the League of Nations which was based in Geneva after it was exempted from military requirements br During World War II detailed invasion plans were drawn up by the Germans but Switzerland was never attacked Switzerland was able to remain independent through a combination of military deterrence concessions to Germany and good fortune as larger events during the war intervened General Henri Guisan appointed the commander in chief for the duration of the war ordered a general mobilisation of the armed forces The Swiss military strategy changed from static defence at the borders to organised long term attrition and withdrawal to strong well stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the Reduit Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers br Switzerland s trade was blockaded by both the Allies and the Axis Economic cooperation and extension of credit to Nazi Germany varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion and the availability of other trading partners Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through Vichy France was severed in leaving Switzerland together with Liechtenstein entirely isolated from the wider world by Axis controlled territory Over the course of the war Switzerland interned over refugees aided by the International Red Cross based in Geneva Strict immigration and asylum policies and the financial relationships with Nazi Germany raised controversy only at the end of the th century br During the war the Swiss Air Force engaged aircraft of both sides shooting down intruding Luftwaffe planes in May and June then forcing down other intruders after a change of policy following threats from Germany Over Allied bombers and their crews were interned Between and Switzerland was bombed by the Allies causing fatalities and property damage Among the cities and towns bombed were Basel Brusio Chiasso Cornol Geneva Koblenz Niederweningen Rafz Renens Samedan Schaffhausen Stein am Rhein T gerwilen Thayngen Vals and Zurich Allied forces maintained that the bombings which violated the th Article of War resulted from navigation errors equipment failure weather conditions and pilot errors The Swiss expressed fear and concern that the bombings were intended to put pressure on Switzerland to end economic cooperation and neutrality with Nazi Germany Court martial proceedings took place in England The US paid SFR M for reparations br Switzerland s attitude towards refugees was complicated and controversial over the course of the war it admitted as many as refugees while refusing tens of thousands more including Jews persecuted by the Nazis br After the war the Swiss government exported credits through the charitable fund known as the Schweizerspende and donated to the Marshall Plan to help Europe s recovery efforts that ultimately benefited the Swiss economy br During the Cold War Swiss authorities considered the construction of a Swiss nuclear bomb Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic possibility In the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies Financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial funds from being allocated and the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty of was seen as a valid alternative Plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by Switzerland joined the Council of Europe in br br Switzerland was the last Western republic the Principality of Liechtenstein followed in to grant women the right to vote Some Swiss cantons approved this in while at the federal level it was achieved in and after resistance in the last canton Appenzell Innerrhoden one of only two remaining Landsgemeinde along with Glarus in After obtaining suffrage at the federal level women quickly rose in political significance The first woman on the seven member Federal Council executive was Elisabeth Kopp who served from to and the first female president was Ruth Dreifuss in br In areas from the canton of Bern attained independence from the Bernese forming the new canton of Jura On April the Swiss population and the cantons voted in favour of a completely revised federal constitution br In Switzerland became a full member of the United Nations leaving Vatican City as the last widely recognised state without full UN membership Switzerland is a founding member of the EFTA but not the European Economic Area EEA An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May but did not advance since rejecting the EEA in December when Switzerland conducted a referendum on the EEA Several referendums on the EU issue ensued due to opposition from the citizens the membership application was withdrawn Nonetheless Swiss law is gradually changing to conform with that of the EU and the government signed bilateral agreements with the European Union Switzerland together with Liechtenstein has been surrounded by the EU since Austria s entry in On June Swiss voters agreed by a majority to join the Schengen treaty a result that EU commentators regarded as a sign of support In September a referendum calling for a vote to end the pact that allowed a free movement of people from the European Union was introduced by the Swiss People s Party SVP However voters rejected the attempt to retake control of immigration defeating the motion by a roughly margin br On February of Swiss voters approved a ballot initiative launched by the Swiss People s Party SVP UDC to restrict immigration This initiative was mostly backed by rural approval and suburban groups approval and isolated towns approval as well as by a strong majority approval in Ticino while metropolitan centres rejection and the French speaking part rejection rejected it In December a political compromise with the EU was attained that eliminated quotas on EU citizens but still allowed favourable treatment of Swiss based job applicants On September of Swiss voters rejected the anti free movement referendum by SVP br br br Geography br br Extending across the north and south side of the Alps in west central Europe Switzerland encompasses diverse landscapes and climates across its square kilometres sq mi br Switzerland lies between latitudes and N and longitudes and E It contains three basic topographical areas the Swiss Alps to the south the Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau and the Jura mountains on the west The Alps are a mountain range running across the central and south of the country constituting about of the country s area The majority of the population live on the Swiss Plateau The Swiss Alps host many glaciers covering square kilometres sq mi From these originate the headwaters of several major rivers such as the Rhine Inn Ticino and Rh ne which flow in the four cardinal directions spreading across Europe The hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of fresh water in Central and Western Europe among which are Lake Geneva Lac L man in French Lake Constance Bodensee in German and Lake Maggiore Switzerland has more than lakes and contains of Europe s freshwater stock Lakes and glaciers cover about of the national territory Lake Geneva is the largest lake and is shared with France The Rh ne is both the main source and outflow of Lake Geneva Lake Constance is the second largest and like Lake Geneva an intermediate step by the Rhine at the border with Austria and Germany While the Rh ne flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the French Camargue region and the Rhine flows into the North Sea at Rotterdam about kilometres miles apart both springs are only about kilometres miles apart in the Swiss Alps br br Forty eight mountains are metres ft or higher in height At m ft Monte Rosa is the highest although the Matterhorn m or ft is the best known Both are located within the Pennine Alps in the canton of Valais on the border with Italy The section of the Bernese Alps above the deep glacial Lauterbrunnen valley containing waterfalls is well known for the Jungfrau m or ft Eiger and M nch peaks and its many picturesque valleys In the southeast the long Engadin Valley encompassing St Moritz is also well known the highest peak in the neighbouring Bernina Alps is Piz Bernina m or ft br The Swiss Plateau has greater open and hilly landscapes partly forested partly open pastures usually with grazing herds or vegetable and fruit fields but it is still hilly Large lakes and the biggest Swiss cities are found there br Switzerland contains two small enclaves B singen belongs to Germany while Campione d Italia belongs to Italy Switzerland has no exclaves br br br Climate br br The Swiss climate is generally temperate but can vary greatly across localities from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland s southern tip Some valley areas in the southern part of Switzerland offer cold hardy palm trees Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall ideal for pastures grazing The less humid winters in the mountains may see weeks long intervals of stable conditions At the same time the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion during such periods hiding the sun br A weather phenomenon known as the f hn with an identical effect to the chinook wind can occur any time and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind bringing low relative humidity air to the north of the Alps during rainfall periods on the south facing slopes This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect The driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their moisture content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas Large alpine areas such as Graub nden remain drier than pre alpine areas and as in the main valley of the Valais wine grapes are grown there br The wettest conditions persist in the high Alps and in the Ticino canton which has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time Precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year with a peak in summer Autumn is the driest season winter receives less precipitation than summer yet the weather patterns in Switzerland are not in a stable climate system They can vary from year to year with no strict and predictable periods br br br Environment br Switzerland contains two terrestrial ecoregions Western European broadleaf forests and Alps conifer and mixed forests br Switzerland s many small valleys separated by high mountains often host unique ecologies The mountainous regions themselves offer a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes The climatic geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change According to the Environmental Performance Index Switzerland ranks first among nations in safeguarding the environment due to its high scores on environmental public health its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy hydropower and geothermal energy and its level of greenhouse gas emissions In it was ranked third out of countries The country pledged to cut GHG emissions by by compared to the level of and plans to reach zero emissions by br However access to biocapacity in Switzerland is far lower than the world average In Switzerland had hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory per cent less than world average of In contrast in Swiss consumption required hectares of biocapacity their ecological footprint times as much as Swiss territory can support The remainder comes from other countries and the shared resources such as the atmosphere impacted by greenhouse gas emissions Switzerland had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of ranking it th globally out of countries br br br Urbanisation br br About of the population live in urban areas Switzerland went from a largely rural country to an urban one from to After urban development claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the prior years Urban sprawl affects the plateau the Jura and the Alpine foothills raising concerns about land use During the st century population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside br Switzerland has a dense network of complementary large medium and small towns The plateau is densely populated with about people per km and the landscape shows uninterrupted signs of human presence The weight of the largest metropolitan areas Zurich Geneva Lausanne Basel and Bern tend to increase The importance of these urban areas is greater than their population suggests These urban centers are recognised for their high quality of life br The average population density in was inhabitants per square kilometre sq mi In the largest canton by area Graub nden lying entirely in the Alps population density falls to inhabitants per square kilometre sq mi In the canton of Zurich with its large urban capital the density is per square kilometre sq mi br br br Government and politics br br The Federal Constitution adopted in is the legal foundation of Switzerland s federal state A new Swiss Constitution was adopted in that did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure It outlines rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs divides the powers between the Confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority Three main bodies govern on the federal level the bicameral parliament legislative the Federal Council executive and the Federal Court judicial br br br Parliament br The Swiss Parliament consists of two houses the Council of States which has representatives two from each canton and one from each half canton who are elected under a system determined by each canton and the National Council which consists of members who are elected under a system of proportional representation reflecting each canton s population Members serve part time for four years a Milizsystem or citizen legislature When both houses are in joint session they are known collectively as the Federal Assembly Through referendums citizens may challenge any law passed by parliament and through initiatives introduce amendments to the federal constitution thus making Switzerland a direct democracy br br br Federal Council br br The Federal Council directs the federal government the federal administration and serves as a collective head of state It is a collegial body of seven members elected for a four year term by the Federal Assembly which also oversees the council The President of the Confederation is elected by the Assembly from among the seven members traditionally in rotation and for a one year term the President chairs the government and executes representative functions The president is a primus inter pares with no additional powers and remains the head of a department within the administration br The government has been a coalition of the four major political parties since each party having a number of seats that roughly reflects its share of the electorate and representation in the federal parliament The classic distribution of two CVP PDC two SPS PSS two FDP PRD and one SVP UDC as it stood from to was known as the magic formula Following the Federal Council elections the seven seats in the Federal Council were distributed as follows br br seat for the Center Party Die Mitte br seats for the Free Democratic Party FDP PRD br seats for the Social Democratic Party SPS PSS br seats for the Swiss People s Party SVP UDC br br br Supreme Court br The function of the Federal Supreme Court is to hear appeals against rulings of cantonal or federal courts The judges are elected by the Federal Assembly for six year terms br br br Direct democracy br br Direct democracy and federalism are hallmarks of the Swiss political system Swiss citizens are subject to three legal jurisdictions the municipality canton and federal levels The and Swiss Constitutions define a system of direct democracy sometimes called half direct or representative direct democracy because it includes institutions of a representative democracy The instruments of this system at the federal level known as popular rights German Volksrechte French droits populaires Italian diritti popolari include the right to submit a federal initiative and a referendum both of which may overturn parliamentary decisions br By calling a federal referendum a group of citizens may challenge a law passed by parliament by gathering signatures against the law within days If so a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject the law Any eight cantons can also call a constitutional referendum on federal law br Similarly the federal constitutional initiative allows citizens to put a constitutional amendment to a national vote if voters sign the proposed amendment within months The Federal Council and the Federal Assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counterproposal Then voters must indicate a preference on the ballot if both proposals are accepted Constitutional amendments whether introduced by initiative or in parliament must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the popular cantonal votes br br br Cantons br br The Swiss Confederation consists of cantons br br These cantons are known as half cantons br The cantons are federated states They have a permanent constitutional status and in comparison with other countries a high degree of independence Under the Federal Constitution all cantons are equal in status except that referred to often as the half cantons are represented by one councillor instead of two in the Council of States and have only half a cantonal vote with respect to the required cantonal majority in referendums on constitutional amendments Each canton has its own constitution and its own parliament government police and courts However considerable differences define the individual cantons particularly in terms of population and geographical area Their populations vary between Appenzell Innerrhoden and Zurich and their area between km sq mi Basel Stadt and km sq mi Grisons br br br Municipalities br br As of the cantons comprised municipalities br br br Federal City br Until the loosely coupled Confederation did not have a central political organisation Issues thought to affect the whole Confederation were the subject of periodic meetings in various locations br br In the federal constitution provided that details concerning federal institutions such as their locations should be addressed by the Federal Assembly BV Art Thus on November the Federal Assembly voted in the majority to locate the seat of government in Bern and as a prototypical federal compromise to assign other federal institutions such as the Federal Polytechnical School the later ETH to Zurich and other institutions to Lucerne such as the later SUVA and the Federal Insurance Court Other federal institutions were subsequently attributed to Lausanne Federal Supreme Court in and EPFL in Bellinzona Federal Criminal Court and St Gallen Federal Administrative Court and Federal Patent Court br The Constitution does not mention a Federal City and the Federal Council has yet to address the matter Thus no city in Switzerland has the official status either of capital or of Federal City Nevertheless Bern is commonly referred to as Federal City German Bundesstadt French ville f d rale Italian citt federale br br br Foreign relations and international institutions br br Traditionally Switzerland avoids alliances that might entail military political or direct economic action and has been neutral since the end of its expansion in Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in Swiss neutrality has been questioned at times In Switzerland became a full member of the United Nations It was the first state to join it by referendum Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states Switzerland is not a member of the European Union the Swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early s However Switzerland does participate in the Schengen Area br br Many international institutions have headquarters in Switzerland in part because of its policy of neutrality Geneva is the birthplace of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement the Geneva Conventions and since hosts the United Nations Human Rights Council Even though Switzerland is one of the most recent countries to join the United Nations the Palace of Nations in Geneva is the second biggest centre for the United Nations after the headquarters in New York Switzerland was a founding member and hosted the League of Nations br Apart from the United Nations headquarters the Swiss Confederation is host to many UN agencies including the World Health Organization WHO the International Labour Organization ILO the International Telecommunication Union ITU the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR and about other international organisations including the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization The annual meetings of the World Economic Forum in Davos bring together business and political leaders from Switzerland and foreign countries to discuss important issues The headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements BIS moved to Basel in br Many sports federations and organisations are located in the country including the International Handball Federation in Basel the International Basketball Federation in Geneva the Union of European Football Associations UEFA in Nyon the International Federation of Association Football FIFA and the International Ice Hockey Federation both in Zurich the International Cycling Union in Aigle and the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne br Switzerland is scheduled to become a member of the United Nations Security Council for the period br br br Switzerland and the European Union br br Although not a member Switzerland maintains relationships with the EU and European countries through bilateral agreements The Swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with those of the EU in an effort to compete internationally EU membership faces considerable negative popular sentiment It is opposed by the conservative SVP party the largest party in the National Council and not advocated by several other political parties The membership application was formally withdrawn in The western French speaking areas and the urban regions of the rest of the country tend to be more pro EU but do not form a significant share of the population br br An Integration Office operates under the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Economic Affairs Seven bilateral agreements liberalised trade ties taking effect in This first series of bilateral agreements included the free movement of persons A second series of agreements covering nine areas was signed in including the Schengen Treaty and the Dublin Convention br In a referendum approved billion francs of supportive investment in Southern and Central European countries in support of positive ties to the EU as a whole A further referendum will be needed to approve million francs to support Romania and Bulgaria and their recent admission br The Swiss have faced EU and international pressure to reduce banking secrecy and raise tax rates to parity with the EU Preparatory discussions involved four areas the electricity market participation in project Galileo cooperating with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and certificates of origin for food products br Switzerland is a member of the Schengen passport free zone Land border checkpoints apply on to goods movements but not people br br br Military br br The Swiss Armed Forces including the Land Forces and the Air Force are composed mostly of conscripts male citizens aged from to in exceptional cases up to years Being a landlocked country Switzerland has no navy however on lakes bordering neighbouring countries armed boats patrol Swiss citizens are prohibited from serving in foreign armies except for the Swiss Guards of the Vatican or if they are dual citizens of a foreign country and reside there br The Swiss militia system stipulates that soldiers keep their army issued equipment including fully automatic personal weapons at home Women can serve voluntarily Men usually receive military conscription orders for training at the age of About two thirds of young Swiss are found suitable for service for the others various forms of alternative service are available Annually approximately persons are trained in recruit centres for to weeks The reform Army XXI was adopted by popular vote in replacing Army reducing the rolls from to about Of those are active in periodic Army training and are non training reserves br The newest reform of the military Weiterentwicklung der Armee WEA English Further development of the Army started in and was expected to reduce the number of army personnel to by the end of br br Overall three general mobilisations have been declared to ensure the integrity and neutrality of Switzerland The first mobilisation was held in response to the Franco Prussian War of while the second was in response to the First World War outbreak in August the third mobilisation took place in September in response to the German attack on Poland br Because of its neutrality policy the Swiss army does not take part in armed conflicts in other countries but joins some peacekeeping missions Since the armed force department has maintained the Onyx intelligence gathering system to monitor satellite communications br Gun politics in Switzerland are unique in Europe in that million guns are in the hands of civilians giving the nation an estimate of guns per people As per the Small Arms Survey only guns are owned by the military Only are in the hands of soldiers However ammunition is no longer issued br br br Economy and labour law br br Switzerland has a stable prosperous and high tech economy It is the world s wealthiest country per capita in multiple rankings The country ranks as one of the least corrupt countries in the world while its banking sector is rated as one of the most corrupt in the world It has the world s twentieth largest economy by nominal GDP and the thirty eighth largest by purchasing power parity As of it is the thirteenth largest exporter and the fifth largest per capita Zurich and Geneva are regarded as global cities ranked as Alpha and Beta respectively Basel is the capital of Switzerland s pharmaceutical industry hosting Novartis Roche and many other players It is one of the world s most important centres for the life sciences industry br Switzerland had the second highest global rating in the Index of Economic Freedom while also providing significant public services On a per capita basis nominal GDP is higher than those of the larger Western and Central European economies and Japan while adjusted for purchasing power Switzerland ranked th in fifth in and ninth in br The World Economic Forum s Global Competitiveness Report ranked Switzerland s economy as the world s most competitive as of it ranks fifth globally The European Union labeled it Europe s most innovative country and the most innovative country in the Global Innovation Index in as it had done in and It ranked th of countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index Switzerland s slow growth in the s and the early s increased support for economic reforms and harmonisation with the European Union In IMD placed Switzerland first in attracting skilled workers br For much of the th century Switzerland was the wealthiest country in Europe by a considerable margin per capita GDP Switzerland has one of the world s largest account balances as a percentage of GDP In the canton of Basel City had the highest GDP per capita ahead of Zug and Geneva According to Credit Suisse only about of residents own their own homes one of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe Housing and food price levels were and of the EU index in compared to and in Germany br
