title: Penalty (ice hockey)
id: 567846
A penalty in ice hockey is a punishment for an infringement of the rules Most penalties are enforced by sending the offending player to a penalty box for a set number of minutes During the penalty the player may not participate in play Penalties are called and enforced by the referee or in some cases the linesman The offending team may not replace the player on the ice although there are some exceptions such as fighting leaving them short handed as opposed to full strength When the opposing team is said to be on a power play they will have one more player on the ice than the short handed team The short handed team is said to be on the penalty kill until the penalty expires and the penalized player returns to play While standards vary somewhat between leagues most leagues recognize several common varieties of penalties as well as common infractions br The statistic used to track penalties is called penalty minutes and abbreviated to PIM spoken as single word pims PIM is an acronym for penalties in minutes though the full term is rarely used today It represents the total assessed length of penalties each player or team has accrued br br br History br br The first codified rules of ice hockey known as the Halifax Rules were brought to Montreal by James Creighton who organized the first indoor ice hockey game in Two years later the Montreal Gazette documented the first set of Montreal Rules which noted that charging from behind tripping collaring kicking or shinning the ball shall not be allowed The only penalty outlined by these rules was that play would be stopped and a bully faceoff would take place Revised rules in mandated that any player in violation of these rules would be given two warnings but on a third offence would be removed from the game br It was not until that players were ruled off the ice for infractions At that time a referee could assess a two three or five minute penalty depending on the severity of the foul By all penalties were five minutes in length reduced to three minutes two years later and the offending player was given an additional fine When the National Hockey League NHL was founded in it mandated that a team could not substitute for any player who was assessed a penalty thus requiring them to play shorthanded for the duration The penalty was shortened to two minutes for the season while five and ten minute penalties were added two years later br br br Types of penalties br Both the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF recognize the common penalty degrees of minor and major penalties as well as the more severe misconduct game misconduct and match penalties br br br Quick reference chart br br br Minor penalty br A minor penalty is the least severe type of penalty A minor penalty is two minutes in length The offending player is sent to the penalty box and in most cases his team will play shorthanded If the offending player is the goaltender or a coach the team is given a bench minor penalty assessed against the team rather than an individual player then any skater who was on the ice at the time of the infraction may serve the penalty In rare cases when the offending player suffers an injury on the same play whoever is on the ice at the time of the penalty may also serve the penalty as was the case of Game of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals series during the Stanley Cup playoffs when Phil Kessel served a penalty in place of Tom K hnhackl br A team with a numerical advantage in players will go on a power play If they score a goal during this time the penalty will end and the offending player may return to the ice In hockey s formative years teams were shorthanded for the entire length of a minor penalty The NHL changed this rule following the season where the Montreal Canadiens frequently scored multiple goals on one power play Most famous was a game on November when Jean B liveau scored three goals in seconds all on the same power play in a victory over the Boston Bruins br Coincidental or matching minor penalties occur when an equal number of players from each team are given a minor penalty at the same time The permission of a substitute player depends on the league and the situation at the time of the infractions In some leagues such as the NHL the teams will play four on four for the duration of the penalties if they occurred when both teams were at even strength However if there is already a manpower differential then both teams are allowed to make substitutions while the penalized players will remain in the penalty box until the first stoppage in play after their penalty expires In other competitions such as IIHF events coincidental penalties do not affect manpower in any situation Coincidental minor penalties are not ended when a goal is scored by either team br In some cases a referee can impose a double or triple minor The infraction is counted as two or three separate minor penalties If a team scores a power play goal during such a penalty only the current block of two minutes being counted down is cancelled the penalty clock is then reset to the next lowest interval of two minutes ex a goal with a double minor penalty clock at is reset to Expiration rules of double or triple minor penalties due to goals being scored are identical to that of regular minor penalties being served back to back br br br Major penalty br A major penalty is a stronger degree of penalty for a more severe infraction of the rules than a minor Most infractions which incur a major penalty are more severe instances of minor penalty infractions one exception is fighting which always draws a major A player who receives a major penalty will remain off the ice for five minutes of play during which his team will be short handed A major penalty cannot end early even if a goal is scored against the short handed team unless the goal is scored during an overtime period which ends the game If major penalties are assessed to one player on each team at the same time they may be substituted for and teams will not be reduced by one player on the ice The penalized players will remain in the penalty box until the first stoppage of play following the end of the penalties This commonly occurs with majors for fighting br Starting with the season NHL referees are required to use on ice video review for all major non fighting penalties in order to either confirm the call or reduce the call to a minor penalty br Under IIHF rules every major penalty carries an automatic game misconduct penalty in other competitions earning three major penalties in a game results in a game misconduct penalty though a number of infractions that result in a major penalty automatically impose a game misconduct as well br Infractions that often call for a major penalty include spearing fighting butt ending charging and boarding br br br Misconduct penalty br br A player who receives a misconduct penalty will remain off the ice for ten minutes The player may be substituted for on the ice and may return to the ice at the first stoppage in play following the expiration of the penalty unless other penalties were assessed however in practice misconduct penalties are normally assessed along with two minute minor penalties resulting in a penalty combination colloquially called a two and ten If an additional penalty is incurred with a misconduct penalty the times run concurrently simultaneously with another eligible player serving the other penalty in the offender s place to enforce a disadvantage For example if a player receives a minute minor plus a misconduct for boarding two players will be sent to the penalty box the offender and a teammate of his frequently one who was on the ice at the time The team is allowed to immediately substitute for the offender so there is only a one man disadvantage Once the boarding penalty ends the teammate can return to the ice and both teams are at full strength again while the offender remains in the penalty box until the first stoppage in play after his her ten minutes have elapsed This is according to USA Hockey Rule a and NHL Rule In the event the other penalty is a non coincidental major most adult leagues allow deferring placing the substitute player into the penalty box so long as he is in place before the major penalty expires but the team must still play shorthanded In such cases only a player from the penalty box can emerge in place of the offender after the end of the major penalty br Misconduct penalties are usually called to temporarily take a player off the ice and allow tempers to cool They are sometimes also assessed in conjunction with fighting majors giving the offending players the opportunity to calm down as they sit out their ten minutes br IIHF rules state that a player who gets another misconduct penalty risks a game misconduct penalty and is ejected br br br Game misconduct penalty br A player whether a skater or goaltender or any member of any team s coaching staff who receives a game misconduct penalty is ejected and is sent to the team s dressing room The player may be immediately substituted for on the ice however in practice game misconduct penalties are often assessed as an addition to a particularly egregious infraction that has also earned the player a two minute minor penalty or more often a five minute major penalty in which case another player will serve this penalty in place of the ejected player Regardless of the time during the game that the penalty is given the player is charged with ten penalty minutes twenty in the IIHF rules for statistical purposes for the game misconduct This rule also applies to match penalties see below br In most leagues the referee has the discretion to call a game misconduct on a player charged with boarding due to the likelihood of injury to the boarded player However in the NHL if a boarded player suffers a head or facial injury a concussion risk the offending player receives an automatic game misconduct br Any player who is dismissed twice for stick infractions boarding or checking from behind or dismissed three times for any reason in a single NHL regular season incurs an automatic one match ban and further discipline is possible for subsequent ejections For each subsequent game misconduct penalty the automatic suspension shall be increased by one game Salary lost as a result of a ban is usually donated to a league supported charity or to a program to assist retired players br Examples of a game misconduct penalty include getting out of the penalty box before the penalty time is served trying to join or attempt to break up a fight third man in or earning a second misconduct penalty in the same game br br br Match penalty br A player who receives a match penalty is ejected A match penalty is imposed for deliberately injuring another player or attempting to injure another player Many other penalties automatically become match penalties if injuries actually occur under NHL rules butt ending goalies using blocking glove to the face of another player head butting kicking punching an unsuspecting player spearing and tape on hands during altercation must be called as a match penalty if injuries occur Under IIHF rules match penalty used to be imposed for kneeing and checking to the head or neck area if injuries occurred since the edition of IIHF rules match penalty has been removed from the rules and a major penalty with a game misconduct penalty should be imposed for dangerous actions br NHL referees are required to use on ice video review for all match penalties in order to either confirm the call or reduce the call to a minor penalty br The team of the offending player must choose a substitute player to place in the box from any of the eligible players excluding the goaltender The substitute serves a five minute penalty similar to a major penalty except in overtime goals scored against the penalized team do not end the penalty early If the goaltender receives a match penalty another player serves the time so that the team may immediately insert a backup In most cases offending players are suspended from the next game their team plays and often face hearings with the possibility of a lengthier ban In the NHL a match penalty and a game misconduct are virtually identical in application However a match penalty carries a larger fine and the offending player is suspended indefinitely until the Commissioner rules on the issue br In NCAA hockey a similar penalty called a game disqualification results in automatic suspension for the number of games equal to the number of game disqualification penalties the player has been assessed in that season br For statistical purposes match penalty is counted as fifteen minutes in NHL since previously ten minutes and as twenty five minutes under the IIHF rules br Match penalties can also be used in cases where severe unsportsmanlike conduct has occurred such as taunting that is offensive on the basis of race sexual orientation etc as well as acts that are exceptionally disrespectful to an opponent or official regardless of whether or not an injury occurred An example of this occurred when New York Rangers defenseman K Andre Miller was assessed such a penalty for spitting on Los Angeles Kings defenseman Drew Doughty during a game at Madison Square Garden on February br br br Penalty shot br br A penalty shot is a special case of penalty for cases in which a scoring opportunity was lost as a result of an infraction like being tripped or hooked while on a breakaway or a player other than the goaltender covers the puck with his hand inside the crease The player who was deprived of the opportunity in cases the infraction was against him for example on breakaways or one chosen by the team in cases where the infraction is not against a specific player is allowed an unchallenged opportunity to score on the opposing goaltender as compensation If the infraction occurred when the penalized team has pulled their goalie and the infraction occurs during a breakaway a goal is immediately awarded to the other team rather than a penalty shot Regardless of whether or not the penalty shot is successful the penalty is now treated as if a goal had been scored during that penalty a minor penalty is negated and a double minor is reduced to a regular minor Major match and misconduct penalties are served in their entirety as these are not affected by goals If the non offending team scores a goal in the delayed penalty situation the penalty shot is not taken and the penalized team serves the time instead br Apart from their use as a penalty penalty shots also form the shootout that is used to resolve ties in many leagues and tournaments br br br Gross misconduct penalty br Similar to a game misconduct in severity gross misconduct penalties have been eliminated from the NHL rulebook It was imposed for an action of extreme unsportsmanlike conduct such as abuse of officials or spectators and could be assessed to any team official in addition to a player Infractions which garnered a gross misconduct now earn a game misconduct The penalty had last been assessed in on Atlanta Thrashers coach Bob Hartley due to post game comments made regarding referee Mick McGeough s blown call during a game versus Edmonton The Phoenix Coyotes Shane Doan was the last player to be given a gross misconduct penalty in for alleged ethnic slurs directed at French Canadian referees later investigated and subsequently cleared by the NHL br However this penalty is still in effect in Canadian hockey A Gross Misconduct penalty shall be assessed to any player or team official who conducts herself in such a manner as to make a travesty of the game br br This penalty can be assessed for actions which include the consumption of alcohol prior or during the game br Where a player or team official becomes involved in a fight with a team official or spectator br Any player or team official who sprays water on or at an official br Any player or team official who engages in verbal taunts based on discriminatory grounds race ethnicity religion gender sexual orientation br br br Enforcement of penalties br The referees make most penalty calls Linesmen may stop play and enforce only certain infractions as defined by the rules governing the league in which they officiate such as too many players on the ice The official will initially put an arm in the air to signal a penalty the official will stop play only once the offending team has control of the puck or play is stopped by normal means A delayed penalty is one in which the penalty is called but play is not yet stopped because the non offending team retains the puck Because the play will stop immediately upon the offending team gaining control of the puck the goaltender of the non offending team will often go to the players bench upon seeing the arm signal to allow an extra attacker on the ice until the play is stopped Because the offending team will not be able to take a shot on goal before the play is stopped this is generally seen as a risk free play However there have been instances in which the non offending team accidentally puts the puck into their own net usually on a failed backwards pass Once the offending team touches the puck and the play is stopped the referee will signal the specific infraction If the penalized player was injured on the play and cannot return another player on the team would serve the penalty if it involves a team being short handed br In the NHL if the non offending team scores a goal in a delayed penalty situation then it is treated as if a goal was scored during that penalty Thus if the delayed penalty is a minor the penalty is waved off If the delayed penalty is a double minor only the first two minute block is waved off and the offending player must still serve the second time block These rules used to be in college hockey as well until the season when it was changed so that the penalty would still be imposed even if a goal was scored Major penalties misconduct penalties and match penalties which are not affected by goals are enforced in the usual manner in both college hockey and the NHL whether or not a goal is scored br The offending player or players are sent to the penalty box where they must remain until the penalty has expired Typically a team will not be allowed to replace the penalized player on the ice the player will return directly to the ice once the penalty has expired This creates a power play during which the penalized team will have one player fewer than their opponent and is said to be short handed If two players on a team are in the penalty box at the same time the situation is called a five on three as is customary the goalies are not counted in this expression or two man advantage Additional players may be penalized but a team will never play with fewer than three skaters on the ice Additional penalties will be delayed until one of the earlier penalties has expired see stacked penalties below br In leagues which play with a shorthanded overtime with only three or four attackers on the ice should a team be penalized with only three players on the ice the penalized player may be immediately substituted by the offending team but an additional skater is then allowed on the other team to create an advantage until a five on three is produced If a penalty in this situation expires without a goal being scored the penalized player will be allowed back on the ice and will play normally until there is a stoppage both teams will then be reduced back to the correct numbers Ending coincidental penalties produce a similar situation with both teams playing with additional players until play is stopped allowing teams to be reduced again br While goaltenders can be assessed penalties a goaltender cannot go to the penalty box and the penalty must be instead served by another player from their team who was on the ice at the time of the infraction the PIM will be charged to the goaltender If the goaltender receives either a three major penalties NHL Rule b one game misconduct penalty NHL Rule or c one match penalty NHL Rule however he or she is ejected for the remainder of the game and must be substituted br While a team is short handed they are permitted to ice the puck as they wish without having the icing infraction called against them This allows short handed teams to relieve pressure more easily when defending with fewer skaters than their opponents This exemption does not apply to teams whose opponents have pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker unless the defending team is killing a penalty at the same time br br br Stacked penalties br A team must have a minimum of three skaters on the ice at all times If an accumulation of penalties would otherwise force a team to fall below this minimum the situation becomes known as stacked penalties This means that the new penalty will start when one of the already penalized players causing the disadvantage is allowed back onto the ice whether the time expires or the opposing team scores on the power play This also means that the player whose penalty expires first out of the three must wait for a stoppage in play or the expiration of the second penalty before leaving the penalty box so that it is appropriately on on and on in succession for each respective situation Penalties that allow for immediate substitution certain coincidental penalties and misconduct penalties do not produce a disadvantage and thus do not count for stacked penalties Stacked penalties still apply in shorthanded overtimes because two penalties still result in a five on three situation regardless of the initial lineup due to the rules allowing an extra attacker as needed br br br Final five minutes br In a situation where there are fewer than five minutes remaining in play the final five minutes of regulation time or the five minutes of regular season overtime should unequal simultaneous penalties be assessed a minor or double minor penalty against one team and a major or match penalty against the other then instead of both sides serving their full times which is impossible in the case of the major match penalty as fewer than five minutes remain the minor penalty is cancelled and its time subtracted from the major penalty which is then assessed against that team br In addition under most leagues fight instigator rules a player penalized as a fight instigator in the final five minutes or during overtime is charged with a game misconduct penalty and further disciplinary action This is intended to discourage revenge fights started by badly losing teams br br br List of infractions br In the NHL infractions that result in penalties include br br Abuse of officials br Arguing with insulting using obscene gestures or language directed at or in reference to or deliberately making violent contact with any on or off ice official This generally is issued in addition to other penalties or as a bench penalty against a coach or off ice player and is grounds for ejection under a game misconduct or match penalty in most leagues including the NHL br Aggressor penalty br Assessed to a player who engages in a fight with an unwilling combatant This is independent of the instigator penalty and both are usually not assessed to the same player at one time in that case the player s penalty for fighting is usually escalated to attempt to injure a match penalty br Attempt to injure br Deliberately trying to harm an opponent in any manner This type of infraction carries an automatic match penalty br Biting br Carries a major penalty and Game Misconduct br Boarding br Pushing tripping or checking an opposing player violently into the boards br Butt ending or Stabbing br Jabbing an opponent with the end of the shaft of the stick It carries an automatic major penalty and game misconduct br Broken stick br Engaging in play while holding a broken stick br Charging br Taking more than three strides or jumping before hitting an opponent br Checking from behind br Hitting an opponent from behind is illegal It carries an automatic minor penalty and misconduct or a major penalty and game misconduct if it results in injury See checking This is generally allowed in the NHL unless it s covered by another infraction such as boarding or illegal check to the head br Clipping br Delivering a check below the knees of an opponent If injury results a major penalty and a game misconduct will result br Cross checking br Hitting an opponent with the stick when it is held with two hands and no part of the stick is on the ice br Delay of game br Stalling the game for example shooting the puck out of play from the defensive zone holding the puck in the hand refusing to send players out for a faceoff or repeated deliberate offsides Starting in the AHL season and advanced to the NHL in the a year later an automatic delay of game penalty is charged to goaltenders that go into the corners behind the goal line outside a trapezoid shaped area just behind the net to play the puck Some delay of game offenses such as taking too long to send players to take a faceoff are not punished with a penalty instead the official may choose to eject the centre of the offending team from the face off circle and order him replaced with another player already on the ice An unsuccessful coach s challenge will result in a minor penalty for delay of game for the first unsuccessful challenge and a double minor penalty for each additional unsuccessful challenge br Diving or embellishment br Falling to the ice after a hit exaggerating the effect of the hit in an attempt to draw a penalty for the opposing team br Elbowing br Hitting an opponent with the elbow If injury results a major penalty and a game misconduct will result br Eye gouging br Carries a major penalty and often a match penalty br Fighting br Engaging in a physical altercation with an opposing player usually involving the throwing of punches with gloves removed Minor altercations such as simple pushing and shoving and punching with gloves still in place are generally called as roughing br Goaltender interference br Physically impeding or checking the goaltender Visually impeding the goaltender s view of the play with the body called screening is legal but at no time may a goaltender be hit or checked br Goaltender leaving the crease br A goaltender may not leave the vicinity of his crease during an altercation Once he has left the crease during an altercation he may be given a penalty br Head butting br Hitting an opponent with the head A match penalty is called for doing so br br High sticking br Touching an opponent with the stick above shoulder level A minor penalty is assessed to the player If blood is drawn a double minor minutes is usually called A common yet false belief is that blood drawn automatically warrants a double minor There is no such rule this is however the precedent that has been in place for years Referees may use their discretion to assess only a minor penalty even though blood was drawn They may also assess a double minor when blood is not drawn if they believe that the player was sufficiently injured or that the offending player used excessively reckless action with his stick If a player while in the action of following through on a shot strikes an opposing player in the head or face area with his stick high sticking is not called unless the referee can determine that the player taking the shot was deliberately aiming to strike the opposing player A penalty is also not called when the puck is hit by a high stick but play will be stopped and the ensuing faceoff will take place at a spot which gives the non offending team an advantage Also a goal that is scored by means of hitting the puck with a stick above the height of the crossbar will not be counted unless it is done by a player of the defending team Note that the requirements for high sticking the puck for purposes of allowing disallowing goal is different from the other forms of high sticking NHL referees can use on ice video review to confirm or overturn a double minor high sticking call br Holding br Grabbing an opponent s body equipment or clothing with the hands or stick Generally a minor USA Hockey rules call for a major and a game misconduct for grabbing and holding a facemask or visor br Holding the stick br Grabbing and holding an opponent s stick also called when a player deliberately wrenches a stick from the hands of an opposing player or forces the opponent to drop it by any means that is not any other infraction such as Slashing br Hooking br Using a stick as a hook to slow an opponent no contact is required under new standards br Illegal check to the head br As of the start of the NHL season any form of a hit to an opponent where the player s head is targeted and or the principal point of contact is punishable with a combination five minute major penalty and game misconduct due to the increasing concern following concussion injuries to NHL players following incidents such as David Booth and Marc Savard s concussions in the NHL season A second incident of this type caused by the same player in a season or post season playoffs results in an automatic suspension for the following game their team plays with the potential for increasing durations of suspension from active play for any subsequent checks to opposing players head areas The following season it was changed to any hit to an opposing player s head that is targeted and the principal point of contact An illegal check to the head is punishable with either a two minute minor penalty or a match penalty In the NHL season the rule was clarified to A hit resulting in contact with an opponent s head where the head was the main point of contact and such contact to the head was avoidable is not permitted known as illegal check to the head As mentioned before that is punishable with either a two minute minor penalty or a match penalty Rule Illegal Check to the Head br Illegal equipment br Using equipment that does not meet regulations either by size length width or number two sticks or other guidelines e g a goaltender s facemask can no longer be the Jason Voorhees style form fit mask a skater may not have a stick with a curve exceeding mm nor may they play with a goaltender s stick a goaltender may play with a regular player s stick If a player non goaltender breaks a stick it is mandatory to drop the stick immediately and play without it until getting a replacement from the bench Otherwise a penalty will be assessed to the offending player some game summaries call this playing with a broken stick In addition in the NHL a player may not pick a broken stick up off the ground after it has been dropped they can only receive a stick from another player or from the bench goaltenders may not go to the bench but must have a stick carried out to them This rule is generally not enforced in amateur leagues except for broken sticks or egregiously out of spec equipment as the cost of acquiring gear that meets NHL specifications since a and further in rule change is prohibitive especially for goalies Goaltenders will now receive a two game suspension for the use of oversized equipment Their teams will also be fined the trainer will be docked the coach and general manager fined and the owner fined br Instigator penalty br An instigator of an altercation is a player who demonstrates any of the following actions distance travelled gloves off first first punch thrown menacing attitude A player deemed an instigator will receive an instigating minor penalty A player who instigates a fight in the final five minutes of a game or in overtime in the regular season will instead be charged a game misconduct and given an automatic one game suspension The length of the suspension would double for each additional incident The player s coach will be fined a penalty that would double for each recurrence br Interference br Impeding an opponent who does not have the puck or impeding any player from the bench No contact is required under the new standards br Joining a fight br Also called the third man in rule the first person who was not part of a fight when it broke out but participates in said fight once it has started for any reason even to pull the players apart is charged with an automatic game misconduct in addition to any other penalties they receive for fighting br Kicking br Kicking an opponent with the skate or skate blade Kicking carries a match penalty if done with intent to injure but otherwise carries a major penalty and a game misconduct Under Hockey Canada rules kicking or attempting to kick an opponent always carries a Match Penalty regardless of intent br Kneeing br Hitting an opponent with the knee If injury results a major penalty and a game misconduct will result br Leaving the penalty bench br A penalized player who leaves the penalty bench before his penalty has expired whether play is in progress or not shall incur an additional minor penalty after serving his unexpired penalty Any player who having entered the penalty bench leaves the penalty bench prior to the expiration of his penalty for the purpose of challenging an official s ruling shall be assessed a game misconduct penalty He shall also be automatically suspended for at least the next three regular league or playoff games of his club A player exiting the penalty bench or player s bench during an altercation or for the purpose of starting an altercation will be given a game misconduct and suspended the next games br Participating in the play beyond the centre red line goaltender br A rare infraction carries a minor penalty and is only assessed against the goaltender br Playing with too many sticks br When a player plays with more than one stick For example if a goaltender were to lose his stick and a player from his team skates over to pick up the goaltender stick and then while skating back to the goaltender with both sticks attempts to touch a live puck with either stick will be called for Playing with too many sticks br Roughing br Pushing or shoving after the whistle has been blown or when it takes place away from the play often called against a player from each team resulting in a coincidental minors situation but can also be called on a single player also called when the hands make contact with an opponent s head face on an otherwise legal check called in non checking leagues when a body check is made Non checking leagues may also refer to this as simply body checking In the NHL a minor penalty for roughing is assessed when a player intentionally removes the helmet of an opponent If injury results a major penalty and a game misconduct will result br Secondary altercation br This infraction is not listed in the NHL Rulebook but it is prevalent in the Central Hockey League United States and other minor leagues It is most commonly issued when players engage in or attempt to engage in fight after the original fight between two separate players This infraction carries an automatic game misconduct penalty br Slashing br Swinging a stick at an opponent no contact is required under new standards If injury results a major penalty and a game misconduct will result br Slew footing br This occurs when a player uses his feet or knees to knock an opponent s skates out from under him with a kicking or leg dragging motion from behind If injury results a major penalty and a game misconduct will result Slew footing as a separate infraction does not exist in the USA Hockey rulebook as of br Spearing br Stabbing an opponent with the stick blade It carries an automatic major penalty and game misconduct br Starting the wrong lineup br This very rare bench minor penalty is assessed when the offending team s starting lineup contains any player not listed in the lineup submitted before the game For this to be called the captain of the non offending team must bring this breach of the rules to the referee s attention immediately at the first stoppage of play Also the penalty may be assessed if a player is not put on the scoresheet at the beginning of the game and plays The only way for this to be called is if the official scorer notifies the referee of this oversight br Substitution infraction Illegal Substitution br This rare bench minor penalty is assessed when a substitution or addition is attempted during a stoppage of play after the linesmen have signaled no more substitutions once the face off is set or if a team pulls its goaltender and then attempts to have the goaltender re enter play at any time other than during a stoppage of play Too many men on the ice and or starting the wrong lineup can also simply be called a substitution infraction br Throwing the stick Throwing stick Throwing equipment br Often accompanied by a penalty shot If any player on the ice who throws his stick or any part thereof or any other object i e equipment in the direction of the puck or an opponent in any zone except when such act has been penalized by the assessment of a penalty shot or the awarding of a goal then a minor penalty will be assessed Should any player coach or non playing person on the players bench or penalty bench throw anything on the ice during the progress of the game or during a stoppage of play a bench minor penalty unsportsmanlike conduct shall be assessed Can be upgraded to game misconduct or match penalty depending on severity br Too many men on the ice br Having more than the allowable number of players six including the goaltender if not already short handed on the ice involved in the play at any given time Involved in the play is key players that are entering the ice as substitutes for players coming off line changing may enter the ice once the player returning to the bench is less than five feet from his team s bench Rule at that point the returning player is considered out of the play even if the play passes in front of the bench unless he actively makes a move for the puck Players entering the ice are part of the play as soon as their skates touch the ice br Tripping br Using a stick or one s body to trip an opponent no contact is required under new standards If injury results a major penalty and a game misconduct will result br Unsportsmanlike conduct br Arguing with a referee fan opponent or teammate using slurs against an opponent teammate or fan playing with illegal equipment making obscene gestures or abusing an official fan opponent or teammate Can carry either a minor major misconduct game misconduct or match penalty depending on the gravity of the infraction for instance using obscene language to a referee initially results in a minor but making an obscene gesture to an opponent teammate fan or official carries a game misconduct Also in some leagues the penalty progression is different for players and team officials for example in the USA Hockey rulebook players get a minor for their first infraction a misconduct for their second and a game misconduct for their third whereas the option of a misconduct is removed for coaches in addition after each penalty for a team official the penalty count resets itself Unsportsmanlike conduct may also be called if a player drops gloves and stick in preparation for a fight but the non offending player does not drop the corresponding equipment and has committed no action verbal or physical harassment to attempt to instigate a fight Since the NHL has ruled that standing in front of an opposing goaltender and engaging in actions such as waving his arms or stick in front of the goaltender s face for the purpose of improperly interfering with and or distracting the goaltender will draw a minor unsportsmanlike conduct penalty a rule interpretation inspired by the play of Sean Avery against Martin
