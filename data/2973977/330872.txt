The ECHL formerly the East Coast Hockey League is a professional minor ice hockey league based in Shrewsbury New Jersey with teams across the United States and Canada Competitively it is a tier below the American Hockey League The league serves as a farm system to the American Hockey League AHL and National Hockey League NHL br The ECHL and the AHL are the only minor leagues recognized by the collective bargaining agreement between the NHL and the National Hockey League Players Association NHLPA meaning any player signed to an entry level NHL contract and designated for assignment must report to a club in either the ECHL or the AHL Additionally the league s players are represented by the Professional Hockey Players Association in negotiations with the ECHL itself At least players have played at least one game in the NHL after appearing in the ECHL br As of the season of the NHL teams held affiliations with an ECHL team with only the Carolina Hurricanes Columbus Blue Jackets

relocate to former AHL cities with the Bakersfield Condors Ontario Reign and Stockton Thunder relocating to become the Norfolk Admirals Manchester Monarchs and Adirondack Thunder respectively By the season the ECHL had also expanded into other markets recently vacated by the AHL in the Maine Mariners Newfoundland Growlers and Worcester Railers br There were two expansion teams added in the Iowa Heartlanders and the Trois Rivi res Lions with Iowa going into the Central Division and Trois Rivi res going into the North This brought the league up to teams The league added the Savannah Ghost

a franchise s league license until the next Board of Governors Meeting br At the Board of Governors meeting the Board elected to limit the league to teams with an emphasis on adding teams to the Western Conference However it was decided at the Board of Governors meeting that the cap should be expanded to teams hoping to eventually match the NHL and AHL s then team totals In ECHL commissioner Ryan Crelin commented that the eventual goal was to match the AHL and NHL expansion to teams br br br Defunct and relocated teams br br Since starting with five franchises in its inaugural season the ECHL has had dozens of franchises join and leave the league Typically these teams fold or relocate due to operation issues or financial losses The Johnstown Chiefs became the last remaining founding franchise of the East Coast Hockey League to remain in its original city until it relocated to Greenville South Carolina following the completion of the season br While the ECHL has stated in recent years they would not grant voluntary suspensions of franchises for more than one year both the Toledo Storm now the Toledo Walleye and Mississippi Sea Wolves now defunct were granted two year suspensions the Sea Wolves because of Hurricane Katrina and the Storm in order to demolish their present arena and construct a new one in downtown Toledo The Mississippi Sea Wolves resumed play for the season while the Toledo Walleye resumed play in their new arena for the season br Seven former ECHL franchises have been directly replaced in their respective markets by American Hockey League franchises The Greensboro Monarchs were the first being replaced by the Carolina Monarchs in The Hampton Roads Admirals were the second giving way to the Norfolk Admirals in The Peoria Rivermen were the third In their case the replacement franchise retained the Worcester IceCats history but assumed the Rivermen identity for their first AHL season of The Charlotte Checkers were the fourth yielding to a franchise that retained the Albany River Rats history following the club s move to Charlotte following the season and assumed the Checkers identity In each of these cases the ECHL franchise was relinquished to the league by its respective ownership group In the three California franchises Bakersfield Condors Ontario Reign and Stockton Thunder were displaced by the formation of an AHL Pacific Division Each ECHL franchise involved in the territorial shift was either owned or purchased by their NHL affiliate prior to being relocated br br br Timeline br Current member Former member Future

and the next six teams in the conference This eliminated the Western Conference first round bye br Similar to the National Hockey League NHL at the time the division winners were seeded as the top three seeds in the Eastern Conference and the top two seeds in the Western Conference the conference winner faced the eighth seed second faces seventh third faces sixth and fourth faces fifth in the conference quarterfinal round The winner of the st th series played the winner of the th th series while the nd th winner played against the rd th winner in the conference semifinal series The Board of Governors also elected to change the playoff format such that all rounds of the playoffs are now best of seven series For the Conference Finals and Kelly Cup Finals will use a two referee system br Because of the late addition of the CHL teams for the season and its subsequent conference alignment the top four teams in each division qualified for the playoffs and the first two playoff rounds were played within the divisions br For the realignment prior to the season the playoffs changed once again to a six division format At the end of the regular season the top team in each division
