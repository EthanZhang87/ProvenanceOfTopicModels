The IIHF World Junior Championship WJC sometimes referred to as World Juniors is an annual event organized by the International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF for national under ice hockey teams from around the world It is traditionally held in late December ending in early January beginning from Boxing Day to January The tournament usually attracts the top hockey players in this age category br The main tournament features the top ten ranked hockey nations in the world comprising the Top Division from which a world champion is crowned There are also three lower pools Divisions I II and III that each play separate tournaments playing for the right to be promoted to a higher pool or face relegation to a lower pool br The competition s profile is particularly high in Canada and this is partly for historical reasons because prior to NHL players being allowed in the Winter Olympics this was a rare tournament where the best western players faced the best players from the Soviet Bloc and the only other tournament of similar stature where this occurred was the irregularly scheduled Canada Cup for senior sides The tournament s stature in Canada can also be credited to Canada s strong performance in the tournament it has won the gold medal twenty times since its inception the role of hockey in Canadian culture along with strong media coverage and fan attendance As such in recent years nearly half of the tournaments have been held in Canadian cities with the remainder being held in Europe and the United States br The United States is the defending champion having defeated Sweden to win the edition in Gothenburg Sweden br br br History br The first official tournament was held in although the first three tournaments were held unofficially from to The tournament has been dominated by the teams from Canada and Soviet Union CIS Russia together accounting for of the overall gold medals awarded through The USSR won the first four official tournaments while the Canadians put together five straight championships between and and another five straight from to Canada leads the all time gold medal count with golds while the Soviet Union the CIS and Russia combined have golds br When it began the World Junior Championship was a relatively obscure tournament It has since grown in prestige particularly in Canada where the tournament ranks as one of the most important events on the sports calendar and during the holiday season The Globe and Mail writer Bruce Dowbiggin credits TSN along with Canada s strong performance at the tournament for turning it from an obscure non event when it acquired the rights in which had started to grow in prominence due to the Punch up in Piestany to one of Canada s most beloved annual sports events and at the same time cementing the link between Canadian nationalism and hockey and inspiring the NHL s Winter Classic Based on increasing attendances for countries repeatedly hosting the event the popularity of the tournament seems to be growing in other nations as well br At editions of the tournament held in the country games involving Team Canada consistently sell out NHL arenas offering large profit guarantees to Hockey Canada and the IIHF In the st century Canada has and will continue to host the tournament every second or third year due to the significantly greater following the tournament has in Canada compared to other participating countries br Originally Switzerland was selected to host the WJHC in but withdrew br Buffalo New York in the United States hosted the tournament in and in both cases proximity to Canada s population core in Southern Ontario was a key factor to the city winning the bidding rights br The tournament offers one of the most prestigious stages for young hockey players significantly boosting a player s value for upcoming NHL Entry Drafts br br br Punch up in Piestany br br One of the most infamous incidents in WJC history occurred in in Piestany Czechoslovakia now part of Slovakia where a bench clearing brawl occurred between Canada and the Soviet Union It began when the Soviet Union s Pavel Kostichkin took a two handed slash at Canadian player Theoren Fleury The Soviet Union s Evgeny Davydov then came off the bench eventually leading to both benches emptying The officials unable to break up the numerous fights left the ice and eventually tried shutting off the arena lights but the brawl lasted for minutes before the IIHF declared the game null and void A minute emergency meeting was held resulting in the delegates voting the sole dissenter was Canadian Dennis McDonald to eject both teams from the tournament The Canadian team chose to leave rather than stay for the end of tournament dinner from which the Soviet team was banned br While the Soviets were out of medal contention Canada was playing for the gold medal and was leading at the time of the brawl The gold medal ultimately went to Finland hosts Czechoslovakia took the silver and Sweden who had previously been eliminated from medal contention was awarded the bronze br br br Medalists br br The winners by season listed below br br br
