several future NHL players The defensive corps included Dave Shaw and Al MacInnis Wendell Young was the team s starting goaltender and the top scoring line on the team was Jeff Larmer Brian Bellows and Grant Martin Stevens and Shaw were an integral part of the Rangers defence playing in every game of the season en route to the team s Memorial Cup victory In addition both played in the OHL All

Larry Murphy had more points among defencemen His penalty minutes would lead the team he would ultimately lead the Capitals in the category five times during his tenure with the team and eventually set the team record for most career penalty minutes by a defenceman However Stevens success did not translate to the Capitals who were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by the Islanders During this period Stevens learned from veterans Rod Langway and defensive linemate Brian Engblom on the finer points of playing defence Head coach Bryan Murray also helped calm the fiery young Stevens who would learn to fight less and play harder Stevens spoke fondly of his time with the Capitals years later saying We had a great bunch of guys and we worked hard We were great defensively We might have been at times a little challenged scoring and we might have been a bit challenged in the goal at times But there are no regrets br The season would be a breakout year for Stevens He set a team record for defencemen by scoring power play goals and tied a team record for goals by a defenceman with His performance was good enough to land him a spot in the All Star Game Stevens would lead all Capitals defencemen in scoring for the first time finishing the year with goals and assists and earned the team s Fan Favorite Award His offensive abilities and size made Murray consider moving him to winger The Capitals finished second in the Patrick Division but were out of the playoffs early again this time courtesy of the Islanders Before the next season the Capitals acquired Dwight Schofield in the waiver draft Schofield was known for his abilities as an enforcer and his goal was to keep other teams hitters away from Stevens and Langway who were deemed too valuable to lose to penalties The plan worked as Stevens finished with penalty minutes the lowest in his career to that point He also added goals and assists that season However the Capitals continued their playoff woes after defeating the Islanders in the first round they lost to the New York Rangers in the division finals br The season saw Stevens return to his old ways as he spent a career high minutes in the

Patrick Division in the season and Stevens points including a team leading assists led Caps defencemen He had penalty minutes this was the last time Stevens would have over minutes in his career He was named to his second All Star game and added an assist as the Wales Conference lost to the Campbell Conference However the Caps could not translate their regular season success into the playoffs as they lost in the first round to the Flyers The season saw mixed success for Stevens He struggled as he was beset with injuries including a broken foot that caused him to miss nearly two months In addition he was suspended for three games for gouging Chicago Blackhawks player Dave Manson in the eye during a fight Stevens said he never hit Manson s eye but that the eye hit Stevens helmet during the fight Missing a third of the season led to Stevens lowest point total since his rookie year he finished with just goals and assists for points although it was still second among Capitals

in the conference finals for the first time in team history where they were swept by the Bruins br Over eight seasons with the Capitals Stevens finished with goals and points in games He also set team records all since broken for penalty minutes games played by a defenceman points by a defenceman goals by a defenceman assists by a defenceman playoff games played playoff points playoff assists and playoff goals by a defenceman br br After eight seasons in Washington Stevens felt it was time to move on The St Louis Blues courted him and offered a four year deal worth million Since he was a restricted free agent Washington had the option to match the offer sheet However they declined and consequently received two first round draft picks plus in cash turning into five first round picks if the Capitals did not have a top seven draft pick in the or entry drafts as compensation two of these picks would become Sergei Gonchar and Brendan Witt br Stevens signing had far reaching ramifications on player contracts in the NHL At the time the deal made him the highest paid defenceman in the league In addition the deal included a million signing bonus Several defencemen considered superior players to Stevens including Ray Bourque and Chris Chelios were earning less money and Capitals defenceman Kevin Hatcher held out until he received a contract similar to Stevens General managers worried that these players would begin demanding bigger contracts The players did end up asking for more money and this escalation was one of the factors in the NHL lockout several seasons later br After he arrived in St Louis Stevens was named captain of the Blues He scored goals and added assists for points good enough for fifth on a team led by Brett Hull and Adam Oates He also made the Campbell Conference All Star team The Blues were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by the Minnesota North Stars br br Stevens time with the Blues would only last one season In the offseason following the NHL season the Blues signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils who like Stevens the year before was a restricted free agent entitling the Devils to compensation As the Blues still owed first round picks to the Capitals now five instead of two as the pick given up ended up being the st pick other compensation had to be negotiated and the Blues and Devils could not agree on what the compensation was the Blues offered goalie Curtis Joseph forward Rod Brind Amour and two draft picks but the Devils only wanted Stevens The case went to arbitration and arbitrator Edward Houston awarded Stevens to the Devils as compensation on September with cited news reports the next day first appearing on September br br Initially Stevens refused to report to the Devils for training camp and would not report until September days after the arbitration ruling The Devils were already worried after captain Kirk Muller walked out of camp Stevens and his wife had made plans to settle in St Louis and he wanted to end his career with the Blues In addition he was concerned about the apparent lack of unity in the organization citing Muller s walkout as proof Several Devils players were upset over the feeling that Stevens was being forced upon the team some players including Ken Daneyko wanted more money while other players wanted general manager Lou Lamoriello to trade Stevens He would eventually report to the Devils three weeks later br Stevens finished his first season in New Jersey fifth on the team in scoring first among defencemen and good enough for a spot on the second All Star team He earned a spot on the All Star roster for the second consecutive season and would miss only one All Star game for the remainder of his career as a Devil The Devils would be taken out of the playoffs by their rival the Rangers in seven games In the off season Stevens replaced Bruce Driver as team captain a title he held until his retirement br Although he would miss part of the following season with a concussion his goals and assists still led all Devils defencemen in scoring The Devils were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs again losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in five games Stevens stepped up his offensive game in He posted goals and assists good enough for the team lead and a career high in points He won the NHL Plus Minus Award finishing with a

Game Stevens finished as a runner up to Ray Bourque for the Norris Trophy the four vote difference was the closest in Norris Trophy voting history br After the season Stevens was a potential free agent Officials from the St Louis Blues discussed a return to the team with him and persuaded him to sign an offer sheet worth million over four years on July Five days later the Devils matched the offer and thus Stevens remained in New Jersey However the Devils later found out Stevens had heard from St Louis management before the free agency period began which was illegal under NHL policy After a five year investigation the league fined the Blues million and awarded the Devils two of St Louis first round draft picks Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello felt the punishment was not enough he wanted five first round draft picks plus damages Despite the investigation there was no evidence Stevens was aware of any wrongdoing br After the season was delayed due to an owners lockout the Devils were off to a slow start winning only of their first games Despite the reduced schedule Stevens managed goals and assists once again leading defencemen in scoring The Devils finished fifth in the conference and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where they swept the heavily favoured Detroit Red Wings to win the franchise s first championship Stevens reputation as a hard hitter was reinforced in Game where he leveled Vyacheslav Kozlov with a body check that temporarily knocked him out of the game It was later determined that Kozlov suffered a concussion Stevens then turned to Wings forward and former Washington teammate Dino Ciccarelli who was upset about the check and said You re next br br The Devils expected to defend their Stanley Cup title the following season However they became the first team in years to miss the playoffs following a championship Stevens voiced the team s disappointment saying After winning the Cup you expect to definitely be in the playoffs the next year

returned to a solid style of play and finished the season atop the Atlantic Division though they would be eliminated in the playoffs once again by the Hudson River rival New York Rangers Stevens finished second on the team among defencemen in scoring behind Scott Niedermayer br br Stevens leadership continued into the next season He signed a contract extension with the Devils stating at the time that he wanted to finish his career with the team Stevens was especially important to the Devils defensive corps as longtime Devil Ken Daneyko was undergoing rehabilitation for alcoholism However he suffered a hip pointer injury against the Tampa Bay Lightning and missed several games Stevens once again had a good defensive season although his lack of scoring kept him out of consideration for the Norris Trophy The Devils finished as the top seed in the Eastern Conference but were eliminated in the first round by the Ottawa Senators br The Devils made several changes before the season including the hiring of Robbie Ftorek as head coach to replace Jacques Lemaire The team continued its focus on defence as the solid corps of Stevens Daneyko and Niedermayer finished with plus minuses

reinforced by their goals scored good enough for second in the league With four players scoring over points including rookie Scott Gomez s team leading assists Stevens points were only good enough for

second half of the season he was still voted in as a starter for the Eastern Conference All Star team Scott Niedermayer filled in as captain in Stevens absence but the loss of Stevens as well as
