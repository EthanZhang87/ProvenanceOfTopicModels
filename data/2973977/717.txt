Alberta is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada It is a part of Western Canada and is one of the three prairie provinces Alberta borders British Columbia to the west Saskatchewan to the east the Northwest Territories to the north and the U S state of Montana to the south It is one of the only two landlocked provinces in Canada with Saskatchewan being the other The eastern part of the province is occupied by the Great Plains while the western part borders the Rocky Mountains The province has a predominantly continental climate but experiences quick temperature changes due to air aridity Seasonal temperature swings are less pronounced in western Alberta due to occasional Chinook winds br Alberta is the fourth largest province by area at square kilometres square miles and the fourth most populous being home to people Alberta s capital is Edmonton while Calgary is its largest city The two are Alberta s largest census metropolitan areas More than half of Albertans live in either Edmonton or Calgary which contributes to continuing the rivalry between the two cities English is the official language of the province In of Albertans were anglophone were francophone and were allophone br Alberta s economy is based on hydrocarbons petrochemical industries livestock and agriculture The oil and gas industry has been a pillar of Alberta s economy since when substantial oil deposits were discovered at Leduc No well It has also become a part of the province s identity Since Alberta is the province most rich in hydrocarbons it provides of the oil and natural gas produced on Canadian soil In Alberta s output was CA billion of Canada s GDP br Until the s Alberta s political landscape consisted of major parties the centre left Liberals and the agrarian United Farmers of Alberta Today Alberta is generally perceived as a conservative province The right wing Social Credit Party held office continually from to before the centre right Progressive Conservatives held office continually from to the latter being the longest unbroken run in government at the provincial or federal level in Canadian history br Since before becoming part of Canada Alberta has been home to several First Nations like Plains Indians and Woodland Cree It was also a territory used by fur traders of the rival companies Hudson s Bay Company and North West Company The Dominion of Canada bought the lands that would become Alberta as part of the NWT in From the late s to early s many immigrants arrived to prevent the prairies from being annexed by the US Growing wheat and cattle ranching also became very profitable In the Alberta Act was passed creating the province of Alberta Massive oil reserves were discovered in The exploitation of oil sands began in br Alberta is renowned for its natural beauty richness in fossils and for housing important nature reserves Alberta is home to six UNESCO designated World Heritage Sites the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks Dinosaur Provincial Park Head Smashed In Buffalo Jump Waterton Glacier International Peace Park Wood Buffalo National Park and Writing on Stone Provincial Park Other popular sites include Banff National Park Elk Island National Park Jasper National Park Waterton Lakes National Park and Drumheller br br br Etymology br Alberta was named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta the fourth daughter of Queen Victoria Princess Louise was the wife of John Campbell Marquess of Lorne Governor General of Canada Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in her honour br The name Alberta is a feminine Latinized form of Albert the name of Princess Louise s father the Prince Consort cf Medieval Latin Albertus masculine and its Germanic cognates ultimately derived from the Proto Germanic language A alaberhtaz compound of noble bright famous br br br Geography br br Alberta with an area of square kilometres square miles is the fourth largest province after Quebec Ontario and British Columbia br Alberta s southern border is the th parallel north which separates it from the U S state of Montana The th parallel north divides Alberta from the Northwest Territories The th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at N br The province extends kilometres miles north to south and kilometres miles east to west at its maximum width Its highest point is metres feet at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is metres feet on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast br With the exception of the semi arid climate of the steppe in the south eastern section the province has adequate water resources There are numerous rivers and lakes in Alberta used for swimming fishing and a range of water sports There are three large lakes Lake Claire km sq mi in Wood Buffalo National Park Lesser Slave Lake km sq mi and Lake Athabasca km sq mi which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels km mi from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca br The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of m s cu ft s The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River a tributary of the Mackenzie River br Alberta s capital city Edmonton is located at about the geographic centre of the province It is the most northerly major city in Canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada With its proximity to Canada s largest oil fields the region has most of western Canada s oil refinery capacity Calgary is about km mi south of Edmonton and km mi north of Montana surrounded by extensive ranching country Almost of the province s population lives in the Calgary Edmonton Corridor The land grant policy to the railways served as a means to populate the province in its early years br br Most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest while the Rocky Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely temperate coniferous forests of the Alberta Mountain forests and Alberta British Columbia foothills forests The southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it The central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests from Calgary north to Edmonton and then east to Lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain farming or cattle ranching with mixed farming more common in the north and centre while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south br The Alberta badlands are located in southeastern Alberta where the Red Deer River crosses the flat prairie and farmland and features deep canyons and striking landforms Dinosaur Provincial Park near Brooks showcases the badlands terrain desert flora and remnants from Alberta s past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape br br br Climate br br Alberta extends for over km mi from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably Average high temperatures in January range from C F in the southwest to C F in the far north The presence of the Rocky Mountains also influences the climate to the southwest which disrupts the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a rain shadow over much of Alberta The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean Annual precipitation ranges from mm in in the southeast to mm in in the north except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach mm in annually br br Northern Alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate The agricultural area of southern Alberta has a semi arid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants The southeastern corner of Alberta part of the Palliser Triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter Chinook winds Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north br Alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters The province is open to cold Arctic weather systems from the north which often produce cold winter conditions As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta the temperature can change rapidly Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from C F in northern Alberta to C F in southern Alberta although temperatures at these extremes are rare br In the summer continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from C F in the mountains to over C F in southeastern Alberta Alberta is a sunny province Annual bright sunshine totals range between up to just under hours per year Northern Alberta gets about hours of daylight in the summer The average daytime temperatures range from around C F in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north up to around C F in the dry prairie of the southeast The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures The south and east central portions are prone to drought like conditions sometimes persisting for several years although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation sometimes resulting in flooding br In the winter the Alberta clipper a type of intense fast moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of southern Canada and the northern tier of the United States In southwestern Alberta the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm dry Chinook winds blowing from the mountains which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period During one Chinook recorded at Pincher Creek temperatures soared from to C to F in just one hour The region around Lethbridge has the most Chinooks averaging to Chinook days per year Calgary has a chance of a white Christmas while Edmonton has an chance br After Saskatchewan Alberta experiences the most tornadoes in Canada with an average of verified per year Thunderstorms some of them severe are frequent in the summer especially in central and southern Alberta The region surrounding the Calgary Edmonton Corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in Canada which is caused by orographic lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains enhancing the updraft downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail br br br Ecology br br br Flora br br In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring is marked by the early flowering of the prairie crocus Pulsatilla nuttalliana anemone this member of the buttercup family has been recorded flowering as early as March though April is the usual month for the general population Other prairie flora known to flower early are the golden bean Thermopsis rhombifolia and wild rose Rosa acicularis Members of the sunflower Helianthus family blossom on the prairie in the summer months between July and September The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by short prairie grass which dries up as summer lengthens to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower Ratibida fleabane and sage Artemisia Both yellow and white sweet clover Melilotus can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province br The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides These are largely deciduous typically aspen poplar and willow Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain North of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres Aspen poplar balsam poplar Populus balsamifera or in some parts cottonwood Populus deltoides and paper birch Betula papyrifera are the primary large deciduous species Conifers include jack pine Pinus banksiana Rocky Mountain pine lodgepole pine Pinus contorta both white and black spruce and the deciduous conifer tamarack Larix laricina br br br Fauna br br The four climatic regions alpine boreal forest parkland and prairie of Alberta are home to many different species of animals The south and central prairie was the homeland of the American bison also known as buffalo with its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement but since then buffalo have made a comeback living on farms and in parks all over Alberta br Herbivores are found throughout the province Moose mule deer elk and white tailed deer are found in the wooded regions and pronghorn can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta Bighorn sheep and mountain goats live in the Rocky Mountains Rabbits porcupines skunks squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province Alberta is home to only one venomous snake species the prairie rattlesnake br Alberta is home to many large carnivores such as wolves grizzly bears black bears and mountain lions which are found in the mountains and wooded regions Smaller carnivores of the canine and feline families include coyotes red foxes Canada lynx and bobcats Wolverines can also be found in the northwestern areas of the province br br Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north are the nesting ground of many migratory birds Vast numbers of ducks geese swans and pelicans arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta Eagles hawks owls and crows are plentiful and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect eating birds can be found Alberta like other temperate regions is home to mosquitoes flies wasps and bees Rivers and lakes are populated with pike walleye whitefish rainbow speckled brown trout and sturgeon Native to the province the bull trout is the provincial fish and an official symbol of Alberta Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province Frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in Alberta br Alberta is the only province in Canada as well as one of the few places in the world that is free from Norwegian rats Since the early s the Government of Alberta has operated a rat control program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail In Alberta Agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos universities and colleges and recognized research institutions In several rats were br found and captured in small pockets in southern Alberta putting Alberta s rat free status in jeopardy A colony of rats was subsequently found in a landfill near Medicine Hat in and again in br br br Paleontology br br Alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of Late Cretaceous dinosaur fossils worldwide Taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons isolated material microvertebrate remains and even mass graves At least dinosaur type specimens were collected in the province The Foremost Formation Oldman Formation and Dinosaur Park Formations collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur bearing strata in Alberta br Dinosaur bearing strata are distributed widely throughout Alberta The Dinosaur Provincial Park area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation In Alberta s central and southern regions are intermittent Scollard Formation outcrops In the Drumheller Valley and Edmonton regions there are exposed Horseshoe Canyon facies Other formations have been recorded as well like the Milk River and Foremost Formations The latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites Additional geologic formations that have produced only a few fossils are the Belly River Group and St Mary River Formations of the southwest and the northwestern Wapiti Formation which contains two Pachyrhinosaurus bone beds The Bearpaw Formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression Dinosaurs are known from this formation but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older sediments br br br History br br Paleo Indians arrived in Alberta at least years ago toward the end of the last ice age They are thought to have migrated from Siberia to Alaska on a land bridge across the Bering Strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the Rocky Mountains through Alberta to settle the Americas Others may have migrated down the coast of British Columbia and then moved inland Over time they differentiated into various First Nations peoples including the Plains Indians of southern Alberta such as those of the Blackfoot Confederacy and the Plains Cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo and the more northerly tribes such as the Woodland Cree and Chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for a living br The first Europeans to visit Alberta were French Canadians during the late th century working as fur traders French was the predominant language used in some early fur trading forts in the region such as the first Fort Edmonton in present day Fort Saskatchewan After the British arrival in Canada approximately half of the province of Alberta south of the Athabasca River drainage became part of Rupert s Land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into Hudson Bay This area was granted by Charles II of England to the Hudson s Bay Company HBC in and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it br The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Arctic Ocean instead of Hudson Bay and they were prime habitats for fur bearing animals The first European explorer of the Athabasca region was Peter Pond who learned of the Methye Portage which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of Rupert s Land Other North American fur traders formed the North West Company NWC of Montreal to compete with the HBC in The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on Lac la Biche in Roderick Mackenzie built Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later in His cousin Sir Alexander Mackenzie followed the North Saskatchewan River to its northernmost point near Edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the Athabasca River which he followed to Lake Athabasca It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name the Mackenzie River which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean Returning to Lake Athabasca he followed the Peace River upstream eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean and so he became the first European to cross the North American continent north of Mexico br The extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French and Spanish territory of Louisiana and was sold to the United States in In the Treaty of the portion of Louisiana north of the Forty Ninth Parallel was ceded to Great Britain br br Fur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC and in the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities The amalgamated Hudson s Bay Company dominated trade in Alberta until when the newly formed Canadian Government purchased Rupert s Land Northern Alberta was included in the North Western Territory until when it and Rupert s land became Canada s North West Territories br br First Nations negotiated the Numbered Treaties with the Crown in which the Crown gained title to the land that would later become Alberta and the Crown committed to the ongoing support of the First Nations and guaranteed their hunting and fishing rights The most significant treaties for Alberta are Treaty Treaty and Treaty br The District of Alberta was created as part of the North West Territories in As settlement increased local representatives to the North West Legislative Assembly were added After a long campaign for autonomy in the District of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of Alexander Cameron Rutherford as the first premier Less than a decade later the First World War presented special challenges to the new province as an extraordinary number of volunteers left relatively few workers to maintain services and production Over of Alberta s doctors volunteered for service overseas br On June during the Alberta floods Alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the Bow Elbow Highwood and Oldman rivers and tributaries A dozen municipalities in Southern Alberta declared local states of emergency on June as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders br In the Fort McMurray wildfire resulted in the largest fire evacuation of residents in Alberta s history as more than people were ordered to evacuate br From until restrictions were lifted in Alberta was affected by the COVID pandemic br br br Demographics br br The Canadian census reported Alberta had a population of living in of its total dwellings an change from its population of With a land area of km sq mi it had a population density of km in Statistics Canada estimated the province to have a population of in Q of br Since Alberta s population has experienced a relatively high rate of growth mainly because of its burgeoning economy Between and the province had high birthrates on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia relatively high immigration and a high rate of interprovincial migration compared to other provinces br In Alberta continued to have the youngest population among the provinces with a median age of years compared with the national median of years Also in Alberta had the smallest proportion of seniors among the provinces and one of the highest population shares of children further contributing to Alberta s young and growing population br About of the population lives in urban areas and only about in rural areas The Calgary Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of Canada Many of Alberta s cities and towns have experienced very high rates of growth in recent history Alberta s population rose from in to according to the census br According to the census Alberta has residents between the ages of residents between the ages of and residents aged and over br Additionally as per the census residents hold a postsecondary certificate diploma or degree residents have obtained a secondary high school diploma or equivalency certificate and residents do not have any certificate diploma or degree br br br Municipalities br br br Language br br As of the Canadian Census the ten most spoken languages in the province included English or French or Tagalog or Punjabi or Spanish or Hindi or Mandarin or Arabic or Cantonese or and German or The question on knowledge of languages allows for multiple responses br As of the census English is the most common mother tongue with native speakers This is followed by Tagalog with speakers German with speakers French with native speakers and Punjabi with speakers br The census found that English with native speakers was the most common mother tongue of Albertans representing of the population The next most common mother tongues were Chinese with native speakers followed by German with native speakers and French with Other mother tongues include Punjabi with native speakers Tagalog with Ukrainian with Spanish with Polish with Arabic with Dutch with and Vietnamese with The most common aboriginal language is Cree Other common mother tongues include Italian with speakers Urdu with and Korean with then Hindi Persian Portuguese and Hungarian br According to Statistics Canada Alberta is home to the second highest proportion of Francophones in western Canada after Manitoba Despite this relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue Many of Alberta s French speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province after migration from other areas of Canada or descending from M tis br br br Ethnicity br br Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity In line with the rest of Canada many are descended from immigrants of Western European nations notably England Scotland Ireland Wales and France but large numbers later came from other regions of Europe notably Germany Ukraine and Scandinavia br In the Canadian census the most commonly reported ethnic origins among Albertans were English German Canadian Scottish Irish French Ukrainian Dutch Polish North American Indian Norwegian and Chinese Each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable Amongst those of British heritage the Scots have had a particularly strong influence on place names with the names of many cities and towns including Calgary Airdrie Canmore and Banff having Scottish origins br Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic Chinatowns and Calgary has Canada s third largest Chinese community The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the s br In of the population consisted of visible minorities and of the population was Indigenous mostly of First Nations and M tis descent There was also a small number of Inuit in the province The Indigenous population has been growing at a faster rate than the population of Alberta as a whole br br br Religion br br According to the census religious groups in Alberta included br br Christianity persons or br Irreligion persons or br Islam persons or br Sikhism persons or br Hinduism persons or br Buddhism persons or br Indigenous Spirituality persons or br Judaism persons or br Other persons or br As of the National Household Survey the largest religious group was Roman Catholic representing of the population Alberta had the second highest percentage of non religious residents among the provinces after British Columbia at of the population Of the remainder of the population identified themselves as belonging to the United Church of Canada while were Anglican Lutherans made up of the population while Baptists comprised br Members of LDS Church are mostly concentrated in the extreme south of the province Alberta has a population of Hutterites a communal Anabaptist sect similar to the Mennonites and has a significant population of Seventh day Adventists Alberta is home to several Byzantine Rite Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration including the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada s Western Diocese which is based in Edmonton Muslims made up of the population Sikhs Buddhists and Hindus Many of these are immigrants but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies Canada s oldest mosque the Al Rashid Mosque is located in Edmonton whereas Calgary is home to Canada s largest mosque the Baitun Nur Mosque Alberta is also home to a growing Jewish population of about people who constituted of Alberta s population Most of Alberta s Jews live in the metropolitan areas of Calgary and Edmonton br br br Economy br br Alberta s economy was one of the strongest in the world supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent agriculture and technology In Alberta s per capita GDP exceeded that of the United States Norway or Switzerland and was the highest of any province in Canada at CA This was higher than the national average of CA and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces In the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history According to the census the median annual family income after taxes was in Alberta compared to in Canada as a whole In Alberta had the second largest economy in Canada after Ontario with a GDP exceeding CA billion The GDP of the province calculated at basic prices rose by in to billion which was the largest increase recorded in Canada and it ended two consecutive years of decreases br Alberta s debt to GDP ratio is projected to peak at in fiscal year falling to the following year br The Calgary Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada The region covers a distance of roughly km mi north to south In the population of the Calgary Edmonton Corridor was million of Alberta s population It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country A study by TD Bank Financial Group found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a United States level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style quality of life offering universal health care benefits The report found that GDP per capita in the corridor was above average United States metropolitan areas and above other Canadian cities at that time br The Fraser Institute states that Alberta also has very high levels of economic freedom and rates Alberta as the freest economy in Canada and second freest economy amongst U S states and Canadian provinces br In merchandise exports totalled US billion Energy revenues totalled billion and Energy resource exports totalled billion Farm Cash receipts from agricultural products totalled billion Shipments of forest products totalled billion while exports were billion Manufacturing sales totalled billion and Alberta s information and communications technology ICT industries generated over billion in revenue In total Alberta s GDP amassed billion in dollars or billion in dollars In Alberta s GDP grew unstably despite low oil prices with growth rates as high and as low as br br br Agriculture and forestry br br Agriculture has a significant position in the province s economy The province has over three million head of cattle and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market Forty percent of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta The province also produces the most bison meat in Canada Sheep for wool and mutton are also raised br Wheat and canola are primary farm crops with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production other grains are also prominent Much of the farming is dryland farming often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation Continuous cropping in which there is no fallow season is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion Across the province the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing farmers typically truck the grain to central points br Alberta is the leading beekeeping province of Canada with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta then migrating north during the summer into the Peace River valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed Hybrid canola also requires bee pollination and some beekeepers service this need br br Forestry plays a vital role in Alberta s economy providing over jobs and contributing billions of dollars annually Uses for harvested timber include pulpwood hardwood engineered wood and bioproducts such as chemicals and biofuels br br br Industry br Alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil synthetic crude natural gas and gas products in Canada Alberta is the world s second largest exporter of natural gas and the fourth largest producer Two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in North America are located in central and north central Alberta In both Red Deer and Edmonton polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world Edmonton s oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of Edmonton br The Athabasca oil sands surrounding Fort McMurray have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world estimated to be barrels km Many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non conventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands As of late there were over billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta br Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil The oil price increases since have made it profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss By mid rising costs and stabilizing oil prices threatened the economic viability of some projects An example of this was the shelving of the Joslyn North project in the Athabasca region in May br With concerted effort and support from the provincial government several high tech industries have found their birth in Alberta notably patents related to interactive liquid crystal display systems With a growing economy Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds br br br Tourism br br Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the th century with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing hiking and camping shopping locales such as West Edmonton Mall Calgary Stampede outdoor festivals professional athletic events international sporting competitions such as the Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games as well as more eclectic attractions According to Alberta Economic Development Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually Banff Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year Alberta tourism relies heavily on Southern Ontario tourists as well as tourists from other parts of Canada the United States and many other countries br There are also natural attractions like Elk Island National Park Wood Buffalo National Park and the Columbia Icefield Alberta s Rockies include well known tourist destinations Banff National Park and Jasper National Park The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic Icefields Parkway Banff is located km mi west of Calgary on Highway and Jasper is located km mi west of Edmonton on the Yellowhead Highway Five of Canada s fourteen UNESCO World Heritage Sites are located within the province Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks Waterton Glacier International Peace Park Wood Buffalo National Park Dinosaur Provincial Park and Head Smashed In Buffalo Jump A number of these areas hold ski resorts most notably Banff Sunshine Lake Louise Marmot Basin Norquay and Nakiska br br About million people visit the Calgary Stampede a celebration of Canada s own Wild West and the cattle ranching industry About people enjoy Edmonton s K Days formerly Klondike Days and Capital EX Edmonton was the gateway to the only all Canadian route to the Yukon gold fields and the only route which did not require gold seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous Chilkoot Pass br Another tourist destination that draws more than visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley located northeast of Calgary Drumheller known as the Dinosaur Capital of The World offers the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada s largest coal producers during the war years Another attraction in east central Alberta is Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions a popular tourist attraction operated out of Stettler that offers train excursions into the prairie and caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year br br br Government and politics br br The Government of Alberta is organized as a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral legislature Its unicameral legislature the Legislative Assembly consists of members elected first past the post FPTP from single member constituencies Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide br As King of Canada Charles III is the head of state of Alberta His duties concerning the Government of Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor Salma Lakhani The King and lieutenant governor are figureheads whose actions are highly restricted by custom and constitutional convention The lieutenant governor handles numerous honorific duties in the name of the King The government is headed by the premier The premier is normally a member of the Legislative Assembly and draws all the members of the Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government the capital of Alberta The current premier is Danielle Smith who was sworn in on October br br Alberta s elections have tended to yield much more conservative outcomes than those of other Canadian provinces From the s to the s Alberta had three main political parties the Progressive Conservatives Conservatives or Tories the Liberals and the social democratic New Democrats The Wildrose Party a more libertarian party formed in early gained much support in the election and became the official opposition a role it held until when it was dissolved and succeeded by the new United Conservative Party created by the merger of Wildrose and the Progressive Conservatives The strongly conservative Social Credit Party was a power in Alberta for many decades but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in br For years the Progressive Conservatives governed Alberta They lost the election to the NDP which formed their own government for the first time in provincial history breaking almost consecutive years of right wing rule suggesting at the time a possible shift to the left in the province also indicated by the election of progressive mayors in both of Alberta s major cities Since becoming a province in Alberta has seen only five changes of government only six parties have governed Alberta the Liberals from to the United Farmers of Alberta from to the Social Credit Party from to the Progressive Conservative Party from to from to the Alberta New Democratic Party and from the United Conservative Party with the most recent transfer of power being the first time in provincial history that an incumbent government was not returned to a second term br br br Administrative divisions br The province is divided into ten types of local governments urban municipalities including cities towns villages and summer villages specialized municipalities rural municipalities including municipal districts often named as counties improvement districts and special areas M tis settlements and Indian reserves All types of municipalities are governed by local residents and were incorporated under various provincial acts with the exception of improvement districts governed by either the provincial or federal government and Indian reserves governed by local band governments under federal jurisdiction br br br Law enforcement br br Policing in the province of Alberta upon its creation was the responsibility of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police In due to pressures of the First World War the Alberta Provincial Police was created This organization policed the province until it was disbanded as a Great Depression era cost cutting measure in It was at that time the now renamed Royal Canadian Mounted Police resumed policing of the province specifically RCMP K Division With the advent of the Alberta Sheriffs Branch the distribution of duties of law enforcement in Alberta has been evolving as certain aspects such as traffic enforcement mobile surveillance and the close protection of the Premier of Alberta have been transferred to the Sheriffs In Alberta formed the Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams ALERT to combat organized crime and the serious offences that accompany it ALERT is made up of members of the RCMP Sheriffs Branch and various major municipal police forces in Alberta br br br Military br Military bases in Alberta include Canadian Forces Base CFB Cold Lake CFB Edmonton CFB Suffield and CFB Wainwright Air force units stationed at CFB Cold Lake have access to the Cold Lake Air Weapons Range CFB Edmonton is the headquarters for the rd Canadian Division CFB Suffield hosts British troops and is the largest training facility in Canada br br br Taxation br According to Alberta s budget government revenue in that year came mainly from royalties on non renewable natural resources personal income taxes corporate and other taxes and grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects In Alberta received billion in bitumen royalties With the drop in the price of oil in it was down to billion In Alberta received about million in royalty payments from oil sands Royalty Projects According to the fiscal plan the two top sources of revenue in were personal income tax at million and federal transfers of million with total resource revenue at million Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial sales tax Alberta residents are subject to the federal sales tax the Goods and Services Tax of br br From to Alberta was the only Canadian province to have a flat tax of of taxable income which was introduced by Premier Ralph Klein as part of the Alberta Tax Advantage which also included a zero percent tax on income below a generous personal exemption br In under Premier Rachel Notley while most Albertans continued to pay the income tax rate new tax brackets and for those with higher incomes annually or more were introduced Alberta s personal income tax system maintained a progressive character by continuing to grant residents personal tax exemptions of in addition to a variety of tax deductions for persons with disabilities students and the aged Alberta s municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments who usually work in co operation with the provincial government By most Albertans continued to pay the income tax rate br According to a March Statistics Canada report the median household income in Alberta in was about which is higher than the Canadian national average br Based on Statistic Canada reports low income Albertans who earn less than and those in the high income bracket earning or more are the lowest taxed people in Canada Those in the middle income brackets representing those that earn about to pay more in provincial taxes than residents in British Columbia and Ontario In terms of income tax Alberta is the best province for those with a low income because there is no provincial income tax for those who earn or less Even with the progressive tax brackets up to Albertans who have the highest incomes those with a annual income or more about people in pay the least in taxes in Canada About million Albertans earned between and in br Alberta also privatized alcohol distribution By privatization had increased outlets from stores to jobs to jobs and products to products Tax revenue also increased from million to million br In Alberta collected about billion in education property taxes from municipalities Alberta municipalities raise a significant
