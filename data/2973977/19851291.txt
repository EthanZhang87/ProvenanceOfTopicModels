Canadians French Canadiens are people identified with the country of Canada This connection may be residential legal historical or cultural For most Canadians many or all of these connections exist and are collectively the source of their being Canadian br Canada is a multilingual and multicultural society home to people of groups of many different ethnic religious and national origins with the majority of the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization different waves or peaks of immigration and settlement of non indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today Elements of Indigenous French British and more recent immigrant customs languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada and thus a Canadian identity Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic geographic and economic neighbour the United States br Canadian independence from the United Kingdom grew gradually over the course of many years following the formation of the Canadian Confederation in The First and Second World Wars in particular gave rise to a desire among Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship Legislative independence was established with the passage of the Statute of Westminster the Canadian Citizenship Act took effect on January and full sovereignty was achieved with the patriation of the constitution in Canada s nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom Legislation since the mid th century represents Canadians commitment to multilateralism and socioeconomic development br br The word Canadian originally applied in its French form Canadien to the colonists residing in the northern part of New France in Quebec and Ontario during the th th and th centuries The French colonists in Maritime Canada New Brunswick Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island were known as Acadians br When Prince Edward a son of King George III addressed in English and French a group of rioters at a poll in Charlesbourg Lower Canada today Quebec during the election of the Legislative Assembly in June he stated I urge you to unanimity and concord Let me hear no more of the odious distinction of English and French You are all His Britannic Majesty s beloved Canadian subjects It was the first known use of the term Canadian to mean both French and English settlers in the Canadas br br As of Canadians make up of the world s total population having relied upon immigration for population growth and social development Approximately of current Canadians are first or second generation immigrants and of Canadian residents in the s were not born in the country Statistics Canada projects that by nearly one half of Canadians above the age of will be foreign born or have one foreign born parent Indigenous peoples according to the Canadian census numbered at or of the country s population br br While the first contact with Europeans and Indigenous peoples in Canada had occurred a century or more before the first group of permanent settlers were the French who founded the New France settlements in present day Quebec and Ontario and Acadia in present day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick during the early part of the th century br Approximately Irish born families would settle the Saint Lawrence Valley by assimilating into the Canadien population and culture During the th and th century immigration westward to the area known as Rupert s Land was carried out by Voyageurs French settlers working for the North West Company and by British settlers English and Scottish representing the Hudson s Bay Company coupled with independent entrepreneurial woodsman called coureur des bois This arrival of newcomers led to the creation of the M tis an ethnic group of mixed European and First Nations parentage br In the wake of the British Conquest of New France in and the Expulsion of the Acadians many families from the British colonies in New England moved over into Nova Scotia and other colonies in Canada where the British made farmland available to British settlers on easy terms More settlers arrived during and after the American Revolutionary War when approximately United Empire Loyalists fled to British North America a large portion of whom settled in New Brunswick After the War of British including British army regulars Scottish and Irish immigration was encouraged throughout Rupert s Land Upper Canada and Lower Canada br Between and some immigrants came to the colonies of British North America mainly from the British Isles as part of the Great Migration of Canada These new arrivals included some Gaelic speaking Highland Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances to Nova Scotia The Great Famine of Ireland of the s significantly increased the pace of Irish immigration to Prince Edward Island and the Province of Canada with over distressed individuals landing in Toronto in and Descendants of Francophone and Anglophone northern Europeans who arrived in the th th and th centuries are often referred to as Old Stock Canadians br Beginning in the late s the immigration of Chinese into the Colony of Vancouver Island and Colony of British Columbia peaked with the onset of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush The Chinese Immigration Act of eventually placed a head tax on all Chinese immigrants in hopes of discouraging Chinese immigration after completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway Additionally growing South Asian immigration into British Columbia during the early s led to the continuous journey regulation act of which indirectly halted Indian immigration to Canada as later evidenced by the infamous Komagata Maru incident br br The population of Canada has consistently risen doubling approximately every years since the establishment of the Canadian Confederation in In the mid to late th century Canada had a policy of assisting immigrants from Europe including an estimated unwanted Home Children from Britain Block settlement communities were established throughout Western Canada between the late th and early th centuries Some were planned and others were spontaneously created by the settlers themselves Canada received mainly European immigrants predominantly Italians Germans Scandinavians Dutch Poles and Ukrainians br Legislative restrictions on immigration such as the continuous journey regulation and Chinese Immigration Act that had favoured British and other European immigrants were amended in the s opening the doors to immigrants from all parts of the world While the s had still seen high levels of immigration by Europeans by the s immigrants were increasingly Chinese Indian Vietnamese Jamaican and Haitian During the late s and early s Canada received many American Vietnam War draft dissenters Throughout the late s and s Canada s growing Pacific trade brought with it a large influx of South Asians who tended to settle in British Columbia Immigrants of all backgrounds tend to settle in the major urban centres The Canadian public as well as the major political parties are tolerant of immigrants br The majority of illegal immigrants come from the southern provinces of the People s Republic of China with Asia as a whole Eastern Europe Caribbean Africa and the Middle East Estimates of numbers of illegal immigrants range between and br br Canadian citizenship is typically obtained by birth in Canada or by birth or adoption abroad when at least one biological parent or adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen who was born in Canada or naturalized in Canada and did not receive citizenship by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen It can also be granted to a permanent resident who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements Canada established its own nationality law in with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act which took effect on January The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada in as Bill C which replaced the Immigration Act as the primary federal legislation regulating immigration Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship Canada s naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the Immigration Act of br According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada there are three main classifications for immigrants family class persons closely related to Canadian residents economic class admitted on the basis of a point system that accounts for age health and labour market skills required for cost effectively inducting the immigrants into Canada s labour market and refugee class those seeking protection by applying to remain in the country by way of the Canadian immigration and refugee law In there were immigrants in the family class refugees and economic immigrants amongst the total immigrants to the country Canada resettles over one in of the world s refugees and has one of the highest per capita immigration rates in the world br As of a report by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada there were million Canadian citizens abroad This represents about of the total Canadian population Of those living abroad the United States Hong Kong the United Kingdom Taiwan China Lebanon United Arab Emirates and Australia have the largest Canadian diaspora Canadians in the United States constitute the greatest single expatriate community at over million in representing of all Canadians abroad Under current Canadian law Canada does not restrict dual citizenship but Passport Canada encourages its citizens to travel abroad on their Canadian passport so that they can access Canadian consular services br br According to the Canadian census over ethnic or cultural origins were self reported by Canadians The major panethnic origin groups in Canada are European North American Asian North American Indigenous African Latin Central and South American Caribbean Oceanian and Other Statistics Canada reports that of the population reported multiple ethnic origins thus the overall total is greater than br The country s ten largest self reported specific ethnic or cultural origins in were Canadian accounting for percent of the population followed by English percent Irish percent Scottish percent French percent German percent Indian percent Chinese percent Italian percent and Ukrainian percent br Of the million people enumerated in approximately million reported being white representing percent of the population The indigenous population representing percent or million individuals grew by percent compared to the non Indigenous population which grew by percent from to One out of every four Canadians or percent of the population belonged to a non White and non Indigenous visible minority the largest of which in were South Asian million people percent Chinese million percent and Black million percent br Between and the visible minority population rose by percent In less than two percent of Canada s population about people were members of visible minority groups The Census indicated that br million people or almost one quarter percent of the population reported themselves as being or having been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada above the Census previous record of percent In India China and the Philippines were the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada br br Canadian culture is primarily a Western culture with influences by First Nations and other cultures It is a product of its ethnicities languages religions political and legal system s Canada has been shaped by waves of migration that have combined to form a unique blend of art cuisine literature humour and music Today Canada has a diverse makeup of nationalities and constitutional protection for policies that promote multiculturalism rather than cultural assimilation In Quebec cultural identity is strong and many French speaking commentators speak of a Quebec culture distinct from English Canadian culture However as a whole Canada is a cultural mosaic a collection of several regional indigenous and ethnic subcultures br Canadian government policies such as official bilingualism publicly funded health care higher and more progressive taxation outlawing capital punishment strong efforts to eliminate poverty strict gun control the legalizing of same sex marriage pregnancy terminations euthanasia and cannabis are social indicators of Canada s political and cultural values American media and entertainment are popular if not dominant in English Canada conversely many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the United States and worldwide The Government of Canada has also influenced culture with programs laws and institutions It has created Crown corporations to promote Canadian culture through media and has also tried to protect Canadian culture by setting legal minimums on Canadian content br br Canadian culture has historically been influenced by European culture and traditions especially British and French and by its own indigenous cultures Most of Canada s territory was inhabited and developed later than other European colonies in the Americas with the result that themes and symbols of pioneers trappers and traders were important in the early development of the Canadian identity First Nations played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada particularly for their role in assisting exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade The British conquest of New France in the mid s brought a large Francophone population under British Imperial rule creating a need for compromise and accommodation The new British rulers left alone much of the religious political and social culture of the French speaking habitants guaranteeing through the Quebec Act of the right of the Canadiens to practise the Catholic faith and to use French civil law now Quebec law br The Constitution Act was designed to meet the growing calls of Canadians for autonomy from British rule while avoiding the overly strong decentralization that contributed to the Civil War in the United States The compromises made by the Fathers of Confederation set Canadians on a path to bilingualism and this in turn contributed to an acceptance of diversity br The Canadian Armed Forces and overall civilian participation in the First World War and Second World War helped to foster Canadian nationalism however in and conscription crisis highlighted the considerable rift along ethnic lines between Anglophones and Francophones As a result of the First and Second World Wars the Government of Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority With the gradual loosening of political ties to the United Kingdom and the modernization of Canadian immigration policies th century immigrants with African Caribbean and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture The multiple origins immigration pattern continues today with the arrival of large numbers of immigrants from non British or non French backgrounds br Multiculturalism in Canada was adopted as the official policy of the government during the premiership of Pierre Trudeau in the s and s The Canadian government has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration Multiculturalism is administered by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and reflected in the law through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act and section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms br br Canada as a nation is religiously diverse encompassing a wide range of groups beliefs and customs The preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms references God and the monarch carries the title of Defender of the Faith However Canada has no official religion and support for religious pluralism Freedom of religion in Canada is an important part of Canada s political culture With the role of Christianity in decline it having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life commentators have suggested that Canada has come to enter a post Christian period in a secular state with irreligion on the rise The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives but still believe in God The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and within the state br The Canadian census reported that of Canadians identify as being Christians of this number Catholics make up the largest group accounting for percent of the population The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada accounting for of Canadians followed by Anglicans and Baptists About of Canadians declare no religious affiliation including agnostics atheists humanists and other groups The remaining are affiliated with non Christian religions the largest of which is Islam followed by Hinduism Sikhism Buddhism and Judaism br Before the arrival of European colonists and explorers First Nations followed a wide array of mostly animistic religions During the colonial period the French settled along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River specifically Latin Church Catholics including a number of Jesuits dedicated to converting indigenous peoples an effort that eventually proved successful The first large Protestant communities were formed in the Maritimes after the British conquest of New France followed by American Protestant settlers displaced by the American Revolution The late nineteenth century saw the beginning of a substantive shift in Canadian immigration patterns Large numbers of Irish and southern European immigrants were creating new Catholic communities in English Canada The settlement of the west brought significant Eastern Orthodox immigrants from Eastern Europe and Mormon and Pentecostal immigrants from the United States br The earliest documentation of Jewish presence in Canada occurs in the British Army records from the French and Indian War In General Jeffrey Amherst st Baron Amherst attacked and won Montreal for the British In his regiment there were several Jews including four among his officer corps most notably Lieutenant Aaron Hart who is considered the father of Canadian Jewry The Islamic Jains Sikh Hindu and Buddhist communities although small are as old as the nation itself The Canadian Census first Canadian national census indicated thirteen Muslims among the populace while the Sikh population stood at approximately by The first Canadian mosque was constructed in Edmonton in when there were approximately Muslims in Canada Buddhism first arrived in Canada when Japanese immigrated during the late th century The first Japanese Buddhist temple in Canada was built in Vancouver in The influx of immigrants in the late th century with Sri Lankan Japanese Indian and Southeast Asian customs has contributed to the recent expansion of the Jain Sikh Hindu and Buddhist communities br br A multitude of languages are used by Canadians with English and French the official languages being the mother tongues of approximately and of Canadians respectively As of the Census just over million Canadians listed a non official language as their mother tongue Some of the most common non official first languages include Chinese first language speakers Punjabi Spanish Tagalog Arabic German and Italian Less than one percent of Canadians just over individuals can speak an indigenous language About half this number reported using an indigenous language on a daily basis Additionally Canadians speak several sign languages the number of speakers is unknown of the most spoken ones American Sign Language ASL and Quebec Sign Language LSQ as it is of Maritime Sign Language and Plains Sign Talk There are only speakers of the Inuit sign language Inuktitut br English and French are recognized by the Constitution of Canada as official languages All federal government laws are thus enacted in both English and French with government services available in both languages Two of Canada s territories give official status to indigenous languages In Nunavut Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government In the Northwest Territories the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages Chipewyan Cree English French Gwich in Inuinnaqtun Inuktitut Inuvialuktun North Slavey South Slavey and T ch Multicultural media are widely accessible across the country and offer specialty television channels newspapers and other publications in many minority languages br br In Canada as elsewhere in the world of European colonies the frontier of European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place as cultures using different languages met and interacted The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade and in some cases intermarriage led to the development of mixed languages Languages like Michif Chinook Jargon and Bungi creole tended to be highly localized and were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language Plains Sign Talk which functioned originally as a trade language used to communicate internationally and across linguistic borders reached across Canada the United States and into
