id: 74678
The playoffs play offs postseason or finals of a sports league are a competition played after the regular season by the top competitors to determine the league champion or a similar accolade Depending on the league the playoffs may be either a single game a series of games or a tournament and may use a single elimination system or one of several other different playoff formats Playoff in regard to international fixtures is to qualify or progress to the next round of a competition or tournament br In team sports in the U S and Canada the vast distances and consequent burdens on cross country travel have led to regional divisions of teams Generally during the regular season teams play more games in their division than outside it but the league s best teams might not play against each other in the regular season Therefore in the postseason a playoff series is organized Any group winning team is eligible to participate and as playoffs became more popular they were expanded to include second or even lower placed teams the term wild card refers to these teams br In England and Scotland playoffs are used in association football to decide promotion for lower finishing teams rather than to decide a champion in the way they are used in North America In the EFL Championship the second tier of English football teams finishing rd to th after the regular season compete to decide the third promotion spot to the Premier League br br br American football br br br National Football League br br Evidence of playoffs in professional football dates to at least when the New York Pro Championship was held in Western New York it is possible one was held in but that is not known for sure The Buffalo and Rochester metropolitan areas each played a final the winners of which would advance to the New York Pro Championship on Thanksgiving weekend The top New York teams were eventually absorbed into the National Football League upon its founding in but the league mostly driven by an Ohio League that did not have true finals though they frequently scheduled de facto championship matchups did not adopt the New York league s playoff format opting for a championship based on regular season record for its first twelve seasons as a result four of the first six championships were disputed Technically a vote of league owners was all that was required to win a title but the owners had a gentlemen s agreement to pledge votes based on a score wins divided by the sum of wins and losses with a few tiebreakers When two teams tied at the top of the standings in an impromptu playoff game was scheduled to settle the tie br The NFL divided its teams into divisions in and began holding a single playoff final between division winners In the NFL absorbed three teams from the rival All America Football Conference and the former divisions were now called conferences echoing the college use of that term In the NFL expanded and created four divisions under the two conferences which led to the institution of a larger playoff tournament After the AFL NFL merger brought the American Football League into the NFL the NFL began to use three divisions and a single wild card team in each conference for its playoffs in order to produce eight contenders out of six divisions this was later expanded in and so that more wild card teams could participate br In the NFL added its nd team the Houston Texans and significantly reshuffled its divisional alignment The league went from division winners and wild card spots to division winners and only wild card qualifiers by the number of wild card qualifiers returned to six The winners of each division automatically earn a playoff spot and a home game in their first rounds the three top non division winners from each conference also make the playoffs as wild card teams The division winner with the best record in the regular season gets a first round bye and each of the other division winners plays one of the three wild card teams In the divisional round the lowest seeded winner of a wild card game then plays the lone bye team the two wild card winners also advance to play each other The winners of these two games go to the conference championships and the winners of those conference finals then face each other in the Super Bowl br br br College football br br br Division I NCAA Football FBS br br The College Football Playoff National Championship is a post season college football bowl game used to determine a national champion of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision FBS which began play in the college football season The game serves as the final of the College Football Playoff a bracket tournament between the top four teams in the country as determined by a selection committee which was established as a successor to the Bowl Championship Series and its similar BCS National Championship Game Unlike the BCS championship the participating teams in the College Football Playoff National Championship are determined by two semi final bowls hosted by two of the consortium s six member bowls yearly and the top two teams as determined by the selection committee do not automatically advance to the game in lieu of other bowls br The game is played at a neutral site determined through bids by prospective host cities similarly to the Super Bowl and NCAA final four When announcing it was soliciting bids for the and title games playoff organizers said that the bids must propose host stadiums with a capacity of at least spectators and cities cannot host both a semi final game and the title game in the same year br The winner of the game is awarded a new championship trophy instead of the Crystal Football which has been given by the American Football Coaches Association AFCA since officials wanted a new trophy that was unconnected with the previous BCS championship system The new College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy is sponsored by Dr Pepper which paid an estimated million for the sponsorship rights through The inch high pound trophy was unveiled on July br br br Division I NCAA Football FCS br br The NCAA Division I Football Championship is an American college football tournament played each year to determine the champion of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision FCS Prior to the game was known as the NCAA Division I AA

Football Championship began in Before most of the schools now in Division III competed either in the NCAA College Division or the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics NAIA NCAA Divisions II and III were created by splitting the College Division in two with schools that wished to continue awarding athletic scholarships placed in Division II and those that did not want to award them placed in Division III br The Division III playoffs begin with teams selected to participate in them The Division III final known as the Stagg Bowl has been played annually in Salem Virginia at Salem Football Stadium since It was previously played in Phenix City Alabama at Garrett Harrison Stadium at the College Football Hall of Fame when the Hall was located in Kings Island Ohio at Galbreath Field and Bradenton Florida at Hawkins Stadium br br br Association football br As a rule international association football has only had championship playoffs when a league is divided into several equal divisions conferences or groups Premier League or when the season is split into two periods as in many leagues in Latin America In leagues with a single table done only once a year as in most of Europe playoff systems are not used to determine champions although in some countries such systems are used to determine teams to be promoted to higher leagues e g England or qualifiers for European club competitions such as Greece and the Netherlands usually between teams that didn t perform well enough to earn an automatic spot br A test match is a match played at the end of a season between a team that has done badly in a higher league and one that has done well in a lower league of the same football league system The format of a test match series varies for instance it can be a head to head between one of the worse finishers of the higher league and one of the better finishers of the lower league or it can be a mini league where all participants play each other or teams only play those from the other league The winner of the test match series play in the higher league the following season and the loser in the lower league br br br International playoffs br In international football playoffs were a feature of the and FIFA World Cup final tournaments They are still a feature of the qualification tournaments for the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Football Championship br In the qualification playoffs for the World Cup for example br br In Europe after the first place finishers in each of eight groups received automatic finals places along with the two second place teams that had earned the most points against teams in the top six of their individual groups the remaining six second placed teams entered playoffs to select three teams for the finals

Argentina br In Argentine football playoffs in the style of the English leagues occur in the Primera B Metropolitana part of the third tier and leagues below it Primera C Metropolitana and Primera D Metropolitana All Primera Metropolitana tourneys cover the area in and around Buenos Aires the capital city The Torneo Reducidos reduced tournaments however involve teams below the top two as opposed to br Before the top flight Argentine Primera Divisi n abandoned its traditional Apertura and Clausura format in in favor of an expanded single season there was no playoff between the Apertura and Clausura winners As a result the league crowned two champions each year After each Clausura the two teams with the lowest points per game total for the previous six tournaments three years counting only Primera Divisi n games were relegated to Primera B Nacional to be replaced by that league s champion and runner up teams the two teams immediately above contested promotion relegation series with the third and fourth places in Primera B Nacional counted by its aggregate table In Primera B Nacional the same procedure continues in use for relegation to either Primera B Metropolitana or Torneo Argentino A for non Buenos Aires clubs From onward relegation from the Primera Divisi n will be based solely on league position at the end of the season which effective in changed from a February December format to an August June format br br br Australia br The Australian A League which also features a team in New Zealand has determined its champions via a playoff system officially known as the Finals Series reflecting standard Australian English usage since its inception in the season br From the league s inception through the season the top four teams advanced to the finals series employed using a modified Page playoff system The top two teams at the end of league play were matched in one semifinal with the winner advancing directly to the grand final and the loser going into the Preliminary Final The next two teams played a semifinal for a place in the Preliminary Final whose winner took the other place in the grand final Both semifinals were two legged while the Preliminary Final and Grand Final were one off matches br When the league expanded to teams beginning in the finals expanded to six teams The format of the six team playoff established at that time was br br The semifinals were held over a two week period The pairings for Week of the semifinals were vs vs and vs br In Week the top two teams played the first leg of a two legged match and the remaining teams played one off knockout matches br In Week the top two teams played the second leg of their semifinal and the two other surviving teams played a one off match The winner of the two legged match advanced directly to the grand final while the loser of that match joined the winner of the last semifinal in the Preliminary Final br The Preliminary Final and Grand Final remained unchanged br Starting with the season the finals format has been changed to a pure knockout tournament consisting entirely of one off matches br br In Week two Elimination Finals will be held with the pairings being vs and vs br In Week the winners of the Elimination Finals advance to Semi Finals The top team on the regular season table called the premiers by the A League plays the lowest seeded survivor of the Elimination Finals and the second place team plays the other Elimination Final survivor br The Grand Final pitting the two Semi Final winners takes place in Week br The concept of a finals series playoff is standard in Australian sport br br br Belgium br The Belgian First Division A previously known as the First Division and Pro League has a fairly complex playoff system currently consisting of two levels and at one time three br Since the season playoffs have been held to determine the champion and tickets for the Champions League and Europa League The six highest ranked teams play home and away matches against each other a total of matches each The participating teams start with the points accumulated during the regular competition divided by two The first teams after the play offs get a European ticket The fourth ranked team or fifth when the cup holder is already qualified for European football plays a knock out match against the winner of play off From to through teams ranked played in two groups from to forward this playoff will continue to be contested in two groups but with a total of teams details below All points gained from the regular competition are lost The two group winners play a final match to determine the winner of play off The winning team plays a final match against the fourth ranked team or fifth for the last European ticket br The play off system has been criticized because more points per match can be earned in the play off stage than in the regular competition This way the team who wins the most matches isn t automatically the national champion The biggest upside in favor of the play off system is the higher number of matches instead of compared to the previous season and more top matches The extra matches also generate higher revenues for the teams br Nonetheless the higher number of matches takes an extra toll on teams and players Besides play offs the Royal Belgian Football Association KBVB also introduced Christmas football in order to complete the extra matches in time This posed some problems because a few matches had to be cancelled due to snowy pitches The delays will probably cause the tight schedule to fail and postpone the end of the season br Some structural changes were instituted in br br The team that finished atop the regular season table is now assured of a Europa League place if they fail to finish in a Champions League qualifying spot currently top two places br The first tiebreaker between Championship Round teams is now regular season position br Accumulated

which of these teams played in the First Division Pro League the oncoming season The lowest ranked team of the First Division Pro League was relegated and replaced by the Second Division champion br Originally these playoffs were introduced in and were part of the Second Division to determine which team was promoted to the highest level together with the division champions From the season on only one team was relegated directly from the First Division with the th team taking part in the playoff As a result this playoff was still called the Belgian Second Division final round although one team from the Pro League took part each year br Starting in this playoff was scrapped and replaced with direct relegation for the bottom Pro League First Division A team only br Further changes will be introduced to the Europa League playoffs from to forward The playoff will involve a total of teams nine from First Division A and three from First Division B the renamed Second Division The First Division A qualifiers will be those finishing between th and th on the regular season table The First Division B qualifiers will be the top three teams from that league s regular season table excluding the division champion which instead earns promotion to First Division A As in the previous format the teams will be divided into two groups each playing home and away within the group and the two group winners will play a one off final with the winner of that match advancing to a one off match against the fourth or fifth place team from the championship playoff depending on available European slots for the final Europa League place br br br Brazil br In Brazil the Copa do Brasil the second most prestigious country wide competition is contested in pure knockout format since its inception in While the top two tiers in the Brazilian League S rie A and S rie B are contested in double round robin format the lower tiers S rie C and S rie D include knockout rounds in their final stages br br br Bulgaria br Bulgaria instituted an elaborate playoff system in its top flight the First League in the season br After the league s teams play a full home and away season the league splits into two playoffs a team championship playoff and an team qualifying playoff with the latter split into two team groups Each playoff begins with teams carrying over all goals and statistics from the home and away season br Each team in the championship playoff plays the others home and away one additional time At the end of this stage br br The top team is declared league champion and earns the country s sole place in the UEFA Champions League br The second place team earns a place in the UEFA Europa League br The highest placed team that has not already qualified for European competition advances to an eventual one off match for the country s final Europa League place This will often be the third place team but if the winner of the Bulgarian Cup which earns an automatic Europa League place is in the top three of the playoff the fourth place team will take its place br Each group within the qualifying playoff also plays home and away within its group after this stage teams enter another level of playoffs depending on their positions in the group br The top two teams in each group enter a knockout playoff consisting entirely of two legged matches unless one of these teams is the winner of that season s Bulgarian Cup in which case it will not enter the playoff and the team that it would have played receives a bye into the playoff final The winner of this playoff then contests a one off match against the third place or fourth place team from the championship playoff with the winner claiming the final Europa League place br The bottom two teams from each group begin a series of relegation playoffs The series starts with a knockout playoff that also consists entirely of two legged matches The winner of the playoff remains in the First League for the following season The losing teams then enter the following series of two legged promotion relegation matches br br The losers of the knockout semifinals play with the loser relegated to the Second League br The loser of the knockout final plays the third place team from the Second League with the winner playing in the next season s First League br Finally the winner of Match above plays the second place team from the Second League with the winner also playing in the next season s First League br br br Dominican Republic br With the creation of the Liga Dominicana de F tbol in to replace the Primera Divisi n de Republica Dominicana it introduced a playoff system to determine the champion of the season br br br England and Wales br br When the Football League was first expanded to two divisions in test matches were employed to decide relegation and promotion between them but the practice was scrapped in favour of automatic relegation and promotion in br The use of play offs to decide promotion issues returned to the League in with the desire to reduce the number of mid table clubs with nothing to play for at the end of the season The Football Conference now known as the National League introduced play offs in after the Football League agreed to a two club exchange with the Conference br The top two teams in the EFL Championship and in EFL League One are automatically promoted to the division above and thus do not compete in the play offs The top three teams in EFL League Two and the champion of the National League formerly known as Conference Premier are also automatically promoted In EFL playoffs the four clubs finishing below the automatic promotion places compete in two legged semi finals with the higher placed club enjoying home advantage in the second leg In the National League however the six clubs finishing below the champions compete in playoffs the lower four competing in an elimination match to decide who plays in the semifinals the top two receive a bye into the semifinals The away goals rule does not apply for the semi finals The Football League play off finals were originally played in two legs at both teams home grounds but were later changed to one off affairs which are played at Wembley Stadium in London br Teams are also promoted using a play off tournament from levels six to eight of the football pyramid At level six the play off semi finals are two leg ties with the final being a single match played at the home ground of the highest placed of the two teams At levels seven and eight all of the ties are single matches played at the home ground of the team with the highest league position br In Gillingham proposed replacing the current play off system with one involving six clubs from each division and replacing the two legged ties with one off matches If adopted the two higher placed clubs in the play offs would have enjoyed first round byes and home advantage in the semi finals It was a controversial proposal some people did not believe a club finishing only in eighth position in the League could or should compete in the Premiership while others found the system too American for their liking Although League chairmen initially voted in favour of the proposal it was blocked by The FA and soon abandoned br The championship of every division in English football is determined solely by the standings in the league However a championship play off would be held if the top two teams were tied for points goal difference goals scored in both their overall league record and identical head to head record including head to head away goals scored to date this has never happened A play off would also be scheduled if two teams are tied as above for a position affecting promotion relegation or European qualification br br br Greece br Starting in the season Superleague Greece instituted a playoff system to determine all of its places in European competition for the following season except for those of the league champion and the cup winner Currently the league is entitled to two Champions League places and three in the Europa League with one of the Europa League places reserved for the cup winner The playoff currently takes the form of a home and away mini league involving the second through fifth place teams under the following conditions br br The fifth place team starts the playoffs at points br The remaining teams start with a number of bonus points determined as follows br The number of points earned by the fifth place team during the main league season is subtracted from the totals of each other club involved in the playoffs br The resulting number is then divided by and rounded to the nearest whole number br At the end of the playoffs the winner receives the country s second Champions League place The next two teams enter the Europa League at different points depending on their playoff finishes the last placed team is entirely out of European competition However if the cup winner finished in a playoff spot as happened in or the league champion also won the cup and the losing cup finalist finished in a playoff spot as happened in the bottom three teams in the playoff all receive Europa League berths br br br Italy br br In Italy s professional league introduced a promotion playoff to its second tier of football Serie B It operates almost identically to the system currently used in England The top two clubs in Serie B earn automatic promotion to Serie A with the next four clubs entering a playoff to determine who wins the third promotion place as long as fewer than points separate the third and fourth placed teams which often occurs br Like the English playoffs the Italian playoffs employ two legged semi finals with the higher finisher in the league table earning home advantage in the second leg If the teams are level on aggregate after full time of the second leg away goals are not used but extra time is used Unlike England the Italian playoff final is two legged again with the higher finisher earning home advantage in the second leg In both rounds if the tie is level on aggregate after extra time in the second leg the team that finished higher in the league standings wins br In Italy s football league used a two legged test match to determine one spot in the top level of its system Serie A Some leagues in continental Europe combine automatic promotion relegation with test matches For example in the Netherlands only one club is automatically relegated from its top level the Eredivisie each season with the winner of the second flight being promoted The next two lower placed teams enter a promotion relegation mini league with high placed teams from the Dutch First Division br br br Japan br J League in Japan used a test match series between the third from bottom team in J and third place team in J see J League promotion relegation Series from to The promotion relegation Series concept dates as far back as and the first season of the Japan Soccer League br The J League Championship was held in J League Division from the inaugural season in to the season and in the J League for the and seasons as a post season tournament to determine the annual champion br Promotion relegation Series occurred with the seasons of J League Division J League conditional on the top two J League JFL teams from to fulfilling J League club criteria In turn J implemented a promotion playoff to J on the style of England for the rd to th clubs br The Japan Football League the current Japanese th division uses the promotion relegation Series only when the number of clubs in the league needs to be filled with clubs from the Japanese Regional Leagues br br br Mexico br Mexico s top flight league Liga MX is contested annually by teams In each of two annual tournaments every team plays every other team in the league once games after which the top eight teams advance to the Liguilla br In the Liguilla all rounds are home and away Teams are drawn so the best team plays the worst the second best plays the second worst and so on After one round the teams are redrawn so the best remaining team again plays the worst remaining one and the second best faces the second worst in the semi finals The two winners of this round play each other for the championship br There is no playoff between the Apertura and Clausura winner As a result the league crowns two champions each year After each Clausura the team with the lowest points per game total for the previous six tournaments three years counting only Liga MX games is relegated to Ascenso MX to be replaced by that league s champion if eligible br br br Netherlands br In the Netherlands a playoff was introduced in the season It is used to determine which teams from the Eredivisie qualify for European football The playoff system has been criticized by clubs players and fans as the number of matches will increase Under the original playoff format it was possible though thoroughly unlikely that the runner up would not qualify for Europe the following year the format was changed so that the second place team was assured of no worse than a UEFA Cup berth Starting in the format was changed yet again The champion goes directly to the Champions League the runner up enters the second qualification round of the CL the number three enters the fourth and last qualification round of the UEFA Europa League EL the new name of the UEFA Cup from to onward and the number four goes to the third qualification round of the EL The only play off will be for the clubs placed th through th The winner of that play off receives a ticket for the second qualification round of the EL br Playoffs are also part of the promotion and relegation structure between the Eredivisie and the Eerste Divisie the two highest football leagues in the Netherlands br br br Philippines br The Philippines Football League PFL adopted a playoffs for its inaugural season The top four clubs of the regular season qualified for the playoffs which was dubbed as the Finals Series The Finals Series was dropped after the establishment of the Copa Paulino Alcantara which became the PFL s cup tournament br br br Scotland br The Scottish Football League SFL experimented briefly with test matches in and contested between the second bottom team of the Premier Division and the second placed team of the First Division br After the Scottish Premier League SPL and SFL merged in to form the Scottish Professional Football League SPFL reuniting the top four divisions of Scotland since the breakaway of the SPL in a modified test match format was introduced between the Scottish Premiership and Scottish Championship The bottom team from the first tier Premiership is automatically relegated and is replaced by the winners of the second tier Championship provided that club meets Premiership entry criteria The second third and fourth placed teams from the Championship qualify for a play off consisting of two legged ties with the second placed team receiving a bye to play the winner of the teams that finished third and fourth The winner of this play off then faces the second bottom Premiership team also over two legs with the winner of that tie taking up the final Premiership place again assuming that the Championship club meets Premiership criteria br The three lower divisions of the SPFL the Championship League One and League Two continue with the promotion relegation play off system their predecessor SFL leagues used the First Division Second Division and Third Division respectively In the Championship League One and League One League Two while the champions are automatically promoted and the bottom team relegated there are play offs of the second bottom teams against the second third and fourth placed teams from the division below Home and away ties decide semi finals and a final and the overall winner plays in the higher division the following season with the loser playing in the lower division br Beginning with the season promotion and relegation between the SPFL and the Scottish regional leagues were introduced Following the end of the league season the winners of the fifth level Highland and Lowland Leagues compete in a two legged playoff The winner then enters a two legged playoff against the bottom team from Scottish League Two with the winner of that tie either remaining in or promoted to League Two br Long before the SPL era two situations arose in which the top two teams in the table had to share the title as neither goal average nor goal difference had been instituted to break ties The first was the inaugural season in which Dumbarton and Rangers both earned points and had to play off for the title The match ended in a draw and both teams shared the title The second happened years later in the Second Division when Leith Athletic and Raith Rovers both earned points This time the clubs chose not to play off In goal average was finally instituted br br br Spain br br For the season the Segunda Divisi n experimented with promotion playoffs between the rd to th placed teams similar to the rules in the English and Italian systems However due to reserve teams being allowed to compete in the same football league system subsequent places may be allowed to play off depending on reserve teams finishing within the rd to th places br At a lower level playoffs in Segunda Divisi n B take place to decide the divisional title between the group winners and to decide which other teams would be promoted as follows br br The first set of matches are an elimination tournament between the group winners The winners of each match are promoted and then play a final for the tier title br After the tier final takes place the teams who finished nd in each of the groups play the teams who finished th whereas the teams who finished third play each other The winners along with the Group winners who lost their games in the earlier semifinals play in each other in a knockout format until there is teams remaining who are promoted br If within the qualifying places exist reserve teams whose senior teams are already in Segunda Divisi n subsequent places are allowed to play off If the senior teams are relegated from Segunda Divisi n during the season the reserve team is automatically disqualified from competing and relegated to Tercera Divisi n br Previously a playoff system had been used in which the teams finishing rd and th from last in La Liga had played off against the teams finishing rd

MLS Cup Playoffs are contested after the end of the regular season by the top teams in each conference The winner of the MLS Cup the final match in the playoffs is considered the league s champion for that season The number of teams that qualify has varied from the season to the season the top five teams in each of its two conferences played in the playoffs this was increased to six teams from to and later seven teams in the season which also switched all rounds to single elimination matches Under this system the conferences have separate playoff brackets br Since the edition the MLS Cup Playoffs has had nine teams from each conference playing in separate brackets until the MLS Cup final The preliminary round has the eighth seed hosting the ninth seed while the top seven seeds get a prelim round bye Whoever wins plays the top seed in Round One In Round One the top seed hosts the eighth ninth winner the runner up hosts the seventh seed the third hosts the sixth and fourth hosts the fifth in best of three games The remaining rounds the conference semifinals conference final and MLS Cup final are single elimination matches hosted by the higher seeded team percent of teams make the playoff under this new format br Since the MLS Cup is hosted by the conference champion with the most table points during the regular season br In the case of ties after regulation in any round minutes of extra time divided into two minute periods would be played followed by a penalty kick shootout if necessary to determine the winners br The defunct Women s Professional Soccer WPS which operated only in the U S conducted a four team stepladder tournament consisting of one off knockout matches The third seed hosted the fourth seed in the first round The winner of that game advanced to the Super Semifinal hosted by the second seed The Super Semifinal winner traveled to the top seed for the final The WPS s replacement the National Women s Soccer League which launched in uses a single elimination tournament The current NWSL playoff structure has a more standard eight team knockout playoff where the top seed hosts the eighth the runner up hosting the seventh the third ranked team playing the sixth ranked and the fourth playing the fifth The lowest seeded winner from the quarterfinals plays the highest seeded and the next lowest the next highest team in the semifinals The winners of two one off semifinals advance to the one off final From to the NWSL had a team tournament and to it had a team single elimination tournament br br br Australian rules football br br Playoffs are used throughout Australia in Australian rules football to determine the premiership The term finals is most commonly used to describe them br In each league between four and eight teams depending on league size qualify for the finals based on the league ladder at the end of the season Australian rules football leagues employ finals systems which act as a combination between a single elimination tournament for lower ranked teams and a double elimination tournament for higher ranked teams in order to provide teams with an easier pathway to the grand final as reward for strong performances throughout the season Finals are decided by single matches rather than series br The Australian Football League which is the top level of the sport currently has eight teams qualify for the finals under a system designed by the league in Between and variants of the McIntyre system were used to accommodate four five six and eight teams and prior to six different finals systems were used br In most other leagues from state level leagues such as the South Australian National Football League and West Australian Football League down to local suburban leagues it is most common for either four or five teams to qualify for the finals In these cases the Page McIntyre final four system or the McIntyre final five system are used universally br The Australian Football League which was known until as the Victorian Football League was the first league to introduce regular finals when it was established in The South Australian National Football League introduced finals in and other leagues soon followed br Prior to the premiership was generally awarded to the team with the best overall win loss record at the end of the season If two teams had finished with equal records a playoff match for the premiership was required this occurred in the Challenge Cup in the South Australian Inter club competition in the SAFA in and and in the VFA in br br br Baseball br br br South Korea br br The teams finishing in fourth and fifth place in the regular season face each other in the wildcard game The winner of the wildcard game faces the team that finished in third place in the first round of the play offs The winner of the first round faces the team that finished in second place during the regular season and the winner of that round faces the team that finished in first place for the championship in the Korean Series This type of format is known as the stepladder playoff br br br Japan br br Before the original Japanese Baseball League had been a single table league of franchises After it was reorganized into the Nippon Professional Baseball NPB system a series of playoffs ensued between the champions of the Central League and Pacific League br Before the playoff system was developed in both professional leagues the Pacific League had applied a playoff system on two occasions The first was between and when a split season was applied with a game playoff between the winning teams from both halves of season unless a team won both of the halves so that they did not need to play such a game The second time was between and when the top three teams played a two staged stepladder knockout games in the first stage and games in the second stage to decide the League Champion and the team playing in the Japan Series After this system was applied the Seibu Lions now Saitama Seibu Lions Chiba Lotte Marines and Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters which claimed the Pacific League Championship under this system were all able to clinch the following Japan Series in that season The success of such a playoff system convinced the Central League to consider a similar approach In a new playoff system named the Climax Series was introduced to both professional leagues in NPB to decide the teams that would compete for the Japan Series The Climax Series basically applied the rule of the playoff system in the Pacific League with one important change each League championship is awarded to the team finishing the regular season at the top of their respective league regardless of their fate in the playoffs This means that the two League Champions are not guaranteed to make the Japan Series The Chunichi Dragons took advantage of this in the first Climax Series season finishing second in the regular season but sweeping the Hanshin Tigers and the League Champion Yomiuri Giants in the Central League to win a place in the Japan Series they subsequently defeated the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters to claim their first Japan Series in years br In the format

for the League Championship Series and World Series One exception is when the first round series the Wild Card Series a best of three round was created along with the other rounds The first three seeds went to division champions the next three seeds to division runners up and the last two to the next best records The pairings for the Wild Card Series are as follows top seed vs eighth second vs seventh third vs sixth and fourth vs fifth The division series has the winner play the winner while the winner plays the winner br MLB uses a format for the final two rounds of its postseason tournament The singular term playoff is reserved for the rare situation in which two or more teams find themselves tied at the end of the regular season and are forced to have a tiebreaking playoff game or games to determine which team will advance to the postseason Thus a playoff is actually part of the regular season and can be called a pennant playoff However the plural term playoffs is conventionally used by fans and media to refer to baseball s postseason tournament not including the World Series br MLB is the oldest of the major American professional sports dating back to the s As

s split season format The winners of the first half season and the winners of the second half season are eligible to play in the playoffs but if the best overall team have not won either half season then they qualify into a wild card series against the weaker half season winner with the winner of this advancing into the Taiwan Series to face the other half season winner If the first and second half winners are different but one of them is also the best overall team then both teams progress directly to the Taiwan Series Finally if one team wins both halves of the season then a playoff will

separate playoff brackets for each conference In the season the first round series were expanded from best of to best of all other series have always been best of In all series home games alternate between the two teams in a format br The finals format was adopted from the Finals to copying the format that was then in effect in the National Hockey League Prior to almost all finals were played in the format although the Finals between Milwaukee and Baltimore were on an alternate home basis some s finals used the format and the Golden State Washington and and Seattle Washington Finals were on a basis Also prior to the s Eastern and Western playoffs were on an alternate home basis except for series when distance made the format more practical Since the NBA Finals restored the original format br Teams are seeded according to their regular season record Through the season the three division champions and best division runner up received the top four seeds with their ranking based on regular

there the playoffs continue as normal br br br Elsewhere br Top flight basketball leagues elsewhere also employ a playoff system mimicking the NBA s However most leagues are not divided into divisions and conferences and employ a double round robin format akin to league association football unlike the NBA where teams are divided into divisions and conferences which leads to different strengths of schedule per team Teams are seeded on regular season record The playoff structure can be single elimination or a best of series with the higher seed if held the playoffs are not held at a predetermined venue having the home court advantage br Aside from the playoffs some leagues also have a knockout tournament akin to the FA Cup running in parallel to the regular season These are not considered playoffs br In the EuroLeague after the regular season plays a best of playoffs in a format However from the semifinals on it is a single elimination tournament held at a predetermined

major basketball conferences ACC American Big East Big Ten Big Pac SEC hold their tournaments at a predetermined venue with all conference teams participating unless barred due to NCAA sanctions A few conferences hold early rounds at campus sites and later rounds at a predetermined site For example the Mid American Conference holds its first round games at campus sites but the rest of the tournament in Cleveland The Big South Conference holds its first round at campus sites gives hosting rights for its quarterfinals and semifinals to the regular season champion and plays its final at the home court of the top remaining seed The America East Conference ASUN Conference and Patriot League hold all tournament games at campus sites A small number of conferences do not invite all of their teams to the conference tournament with one example being the Ivy League in which only four of the eight members advance to the tournament which is at a predetermined site In many such tournaments higher seeds are afforded byes The winners and some losers which are selected as at large bids play in the NCAA tournament which is also single elimination and held at predetermined venues br In the WNBA Playoffs the league s best teams regardless of conference alignment compete and are seeded based on their regular season records The top two seeds are reserved for the conference

week during the Division Semifinal The second place team from each division hosts the third place team in the Division Semifinal unless the fourth place team from the opposite division finishes with a better record This crossover rule does not come into play if the teams have identical records there are no tiebreakers While the format means that it is possible for two teams in the same division to play for the Grey Cup so far only two crossover teams have won the divisional semifinal game The winners of each Division s Semifinal game then travel to play the first place teams in the Division

playoff system is an elimination tournament competition for the Stanley Cup consisting of four rounds of best of seven series The first three rounds determine which team from each conference will advance to the final round dubbed the Stanley Cup Finals The winner of that series becomes the NHL and Stanley Cup champion br Since the Conference Quarterfinals consists of four match ups in each conference based on the seedings division wise No vs No and No vs No The division winner with the best record in the conference plays the lowest wild card seed while the other division winner plays the top wild card seed wild card teams who are de facto th seeds may cross over to another division within the conference In the Conference Semifinals the four remaining teams in the conference face each other In the third round the Conference Finals the two surviving teams play each other with the conference champions proceeding to the Stanley Cup Finals br For the first two rounds the higher

Kontinental Hockey League br The Kontinental Hockey League based in Russia and including teams from several nearby countries operates a playoff system similar to that of the NHL also consisting of four rounds of single elimination best of seven series The first three rounds determine which team from each conference will advance to the final round dubbed the Gagarin Cup Finals The winner of that series becomes the KHL and Gagarin Cup champion br Like the NHL the Conference Quarterfinals consists of four match ups in each conference The winner of each division receives one of the top two seeds in its conference the others are based on regular season record Unlike the NHL divisional alignment plays no added role in playoff seeding all teams are seeded solely within their conference Playoff pairings are based on seeding number within the conference No vs No No vs No No vs No and No vs No The division winner with the best record in the conference plays the lowest wild card seed while the other division winner plays the next lowest seed wild card teams who are de facto th seeds may cross over to another division within the conference The playoff pairings are reseeded after the first round a feature that was once used in the NHL but now abandoned Therefore the Conference Semifinals feature the top remaining seed in the conference playing the lowest remaining seed and the two other

progresses br The semi finals and final are held over the course of a single weekend at the National Ice Centre in Nottingham Each consists of a single game with the losing team being eliminated with the two semi final games being played on the Saturday and the final on the Sunday There is also a third place game held earlier on the Sunday between the losing teams from the semi finals Unlike in the NHL the winners of the Elite League playoffs are not considered to be the league champions for that season that title goes to the team which finishes in first place in the league rather the playoffs are considered to be a separate competition although being crowned playoff champions is a prestigious accolade nonetheless The most recent playoff champions are the Nottingham Panthers br br br NASCAR br NASCAR implemented a playoff system beginning in which they coined the Chase for the NEXTEL Cup When first introduced only NASCAR s top series used the system although the other two national racing series currently known as the Xfinity Series and the Gander Outdoors Truck Series have since adopted similar systems One unique feature of the NASCAR playoffs is that the non qualifying drivers continue to compete alongside the playoff drivers the qualifying drivers merely have their championship points reset one or more times during the playoffs to figures so high that no non qualifying driver could ever catch them br There are actually two different playoffs going on at the end of the season in each series one for the drivers and another owner s points playoff for the racing teams Only one multi driver team has ever won the Cup series owner s point championship in Kyle Busch won the championship after missing the first races of the season due to injury other drivers drove the No car during his absence Because of the way the playoffs were structured that year however both he and his No team won their respective championships with points There have been two cases where a playoff driver failed to enter every playoff race In Kurt Busch was fired by Roush Racing with two races left in the season Busch finished th out of Chase drivers but Kenny Wallace stepped in to drive the No car to an th place finish in the owner s points race In Dale Earnhardt Jr missed two playoff races due to injury Regan Smith drove the No car for two races including a top finish at Kansas Speedway In that case Smith s additional championship points on top of Earnhardt s were not enough to pull the No team out of th place out of playoff contenders br In the original version of the Chase following the th race of the season all drivers in the top and any others within points of the leader got a spot in the race playoff Like the current system drivers in the Chase had their point totals adjusted However it was based on the number of points at the conclusion of the th race The first place driver in the standings led with points the second place driver started with Incremental five point drops continued through th place with points br The first major change to the Chase was announced by NASCAR chairman and CEO Brian France on January After races the top drivers advanced to contend for the points championship and points were reset to Each driver within the top received an additional points for each win during the regular season or first races thus creating a seeding based on wins As in previous years the Chase consisted of races and the driver with the most points at the conclusion of the races was the NEXTEL Cup Series Champion Under the points system then in use drivers could earn bonus points for leading the most laps and bonus points for leading a single lap br Brian France explained why NASCAR made the changes to the chase br br The adjustments taken Monday put a greater emphasis on winning races Winning is what this sport is all about Nobody likes to see drivers content to finish in the top We want our sport especially during the Chase to be more about winning br Beginning with the season the playoff became known as the Chase for the Sprint Cup due to the NEXTEL Sprint merger br The next format of the Chase was announced by France on January along with several other changes most significantly to the points system After races drivers still advanced to the Chase but the qualifying criteria changed as well as the number of base points that drivers received at the points reset br Under this system only the top drivers in points automatically qualified for the Chase They were joined by two wild card qualifiers specifically the two drivers ranked from th through th in points who had the most race wins with tiebreakers used if needed to select exactly two qualifiers These drivers then had their base points reset to instead of the previous reflecting the greatly reduced points available from each race a maximum of for the race winner as opposed to a maximum of in the pre system After the reset the automatic qualifiers received bonus points for each race win while the wild card qualifiers received no bonus br On January even more radical changes to the Chase were announced these took effect for the season br br The number of drivers qualifying for the Chase was expanded to with this group officially called the NASCAR Sprint Cup Chase Grid br The Chase Grid is now selected primarily on the basis of race wins during the first races also known as the regular season If fewer than drivers win races remaining spots on the Chase Grid are filled in order of regular season drivers points Note that the basic point system has not changed from br The Chase is now divided into four rounds After each of the first three rounds the four Chase Grid drivers with the fewest season points are eliminated from the Grid and championship contention Any driver on the Chase Grid who wins a race in the first three rounds automatically advances to the next round Also all drivers eliminated from the Chase have their points readjusted to the regular season points scheme although they retain their points total from the last Chase round in which they participated br Challenger Round races br Begins with drivers each with points plus a point bonus for each win in the first races br Contender Round races br Begins with drivers each with points br Eliminator Round races br Begins with eight drivers each with points br NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship final race br The last four drivers in contention for the season title start the race at points with the highest finisher in the race winning the Cup Series title br The Chase for the Sprint Cup has been generally panned since its inception as many drivers and owners have criticized the declining importance of the first races as well as very little change in schedule from year to year Mike Fisher the director of the NASCAR Research and Development Center has been one of the more vocal critics of the system saying that Due to NASCAR having the same competitors on the track week in week out a champion emerges In stick and ball sports every team has a different schedule so head to head series are necessary to determine a champion That does not apply to auto racing br NASCAR extended the Chase format to its other two national touring series the Xfinity Series and Gander Outdoors Truck Series then the Camping World Truck Series beginning in The formats used in the two lower series are broadly similar to the format used in the Cup Series but have some significant differences br br The Xfinity and Truck Series Chases are held over three rounds instead of four in the Cup Series br Each of the first two rounds of the Xfinity and Truck Series Chases consists of two races compared to three in the first three rounds of the Cup Series Chase br The Xfinity Series Dash Cash consisting of four short events with the winners receiving cash prizes has been incorporated into that series Chase A driver who wins two Dash Cash events is considered as having one regular race win which essentially qualifies the driver for the Chase even if he or she wins no other race during the season However there is no points bonus for Dash Cash wins br Instead of the drivers who qualify in the Cup Series drivers qualify in the Xfinity Series and in the Truck Series br Four drivers are eliminated at the end of each of the first two rounds of the Xfinity Series Chase as in the Cup Series The Truck Series Chase eliminates only two drivers at the end of its first two rounds All formats end with four drivers eligible to win the season title entering the season s last race br The rounds of the Chase now have a standard name across all series The rounds leading up to the final race are now officially called Round of X where X is the number of drivers eligible for the season title The drivers in the final race that are still eligible for the season title are called the Championship br Starting with the
