The Canadian men s national under ice hockey team is the ice hockey team representing Canada internationally in under competition Their primary participation in this age group comes at the International Ice Hockey Federation s World Junior Championship held annually every December and January The team also participates in various exhibition matches and occasional exhibition series such as the Super Series against their Russian counterparts an eight game exhibition series commemorating the th anniversary of the Summit Series br The Canadian junior team is the most successful in the world having medalled in of events held since winning a record gold medals Its success can be traced back to the formation of the Program of Excellence in by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association which created the first true national junior team Since that time Canada has won of World Junior championships including five in a row on two occasions and br br br History br br br Early tournaments br The International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF created an invitation only junior tournament for the top ice hockey nations in the world to be held in late December and early January in Leningrad Soviet Union It featured six teams the Soviet Union Czechoslovakia Sweden Finland the United States and Canada The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association CAHA hoped to send the defending Memorial Cup champion Toronto Marlboros to represent Canada but after they declined the Peterborough Petes runner up to Toronto in the Ontario Hockey Association OHA standings was sent The Petes finished third despite being the only club team in the tournament br A second tournament was held in primarily in Winnipeg Manitoba The CAHA sent an all star team made up of players representing the Western Canada Hockey League WCHL as Canada s representative The team finished in second place with a record their lone loss at the hands of the champion Soviet Union As the OHA and WCHL had each sent a representative already the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League QMJHL sent Canada s entry in the form of the Sherbrooke Beavers for the tournament The team finished second despite scoring only goals and giving up in four games br The growing popularity of international competition begun by the Summit Series and continued with the Canada Cup led the IIHF to formalize the tournament in as the IIHF World U Championship colloquially the World Junior Hockey Championship The defending Memorial Cup champion St Catharines Fincups of the OHA represented Canada at this first official tournament winning the silver medal while Dale McCourt was named the tournament s best forward The tournament was held in Montreal It was the first major international tournament for Wayne Gretzky a year old phenom whom the Montreal crowd cheered wildly Though he led the tournament in scoring with points Canada managed only a bronze medal after losing the final round robin game to Sweden in which they needed only a tie for silver br The following three years yielded poor results The team was represented primarily by the WHL s New Westminster Bruins and finished in fifth place The CAHA nearly chose not to send a team in due to travel costs but donations from the three major junior leagues ensured Canada s participation The Peterborough Petes formed the primary core of the team supplemented by players from other OHA squads The result however was another fifth place finish The tournament was even worse as the Cornwall Royals with some additions from other QMJHL teams finished in seventh place out of eight teams br br br Program of Excellence br The CAHA had long hoped to send a true national team to the tournament but were limited by costs To assemble such a team in would have cost four times the amount it spent to send the Cornwall Royals The CAHA lacked the resources for such a program and preferred not to send a team at all if it couldn t send its best However it was in a dispute at the time with Hockey Canada and feared that if it did not send a team the IIHF would turn to the rival governing body instead Though the CAHA typically sent the defending Memorial Cup champion those teams were typically weakened by the loss of graduating players and were often only a shadow of the team which won their championships Disappointed by frequent complaints from European teams that the Canadian juniors were just slugs who couldn t play the game at an elite level CAHA president Murray Costello finally set out to build a true national team program br Known as the Program of Excellence Costello and the CAHA proposed a multifaceted approach that would see Canada send its top eligible juniors from across the nation It included the creation of U and U programs to develop younger players and a summer training camp to evaluate potential players for the junior team The three major junior leagues were initially reluctant to support the proposal as it would have required them to surrender their top players for a longer period for the tournament as well as their younger players for regional development tournaments The CAHA ultimately gained the support of each league but not before having to also convince them to allow the organization to also invite eligible players from outside major junior hockey br The team that was sent to the Tournament in Rochester Minnesota was the first true national junior team sent It was composed of ten players from the WHL four from the OHL three from the QMJHL two playing United States college and one playing professionally in the Finnish league The team lacked star players but relied on a balanced offence and strong defence to post a record in the round robin tournament Canada defeated the Soviet Union in the second to last game the worst defeat the Soviets suffered in the tournament s history The game was played at the Winnipeg Arena before a rabid crowd which amazed the players The Canadians entered the final game against Czechoslovakia guaranteed a silver medal and needed only a tie to win gold Played at a half full arena in Rochester the Czechs entered the third period leading and would have had a larger lead if not for goaltender Mike Moffat Two third period goals gave Canada the lead before the Czechs tied it They held on despite a frenzied attack in the final minutes to end with a tie and win Canada s first gold medal in the tournament s history br The arena either did not have a copy of the Canadian anthem or had technical difficulty with it so was unable to follow the IIHF tradition of playing the winning team s anthem following the game The players themselves chose to sing the anthem badly off key an image that has since become an iconic moment in the junior program s history The gold medal marked the first international amateur championship for Canada in years and established the value of the Program of Excellence br br br Rivalry with the Soviet Union br Attempting to repeat as champions in Canada endured numerous incidents and mind games perpetrated by the host Soviet Union The Soviets initially refused to grant a sufficient number of visas for the Canadian delegation then when the team landed in Leningrad had their clothing and equipment seized immediately by government officials It was returned three hours later but only after the team threatened to withdraw from the tournament Canada s first three games all wins were played in a small empty arena The fourth game was against the hosts in a larger rink at full capacity which the team was denied the ability to practice in beforehand The players struggled to adapt to the new playing conditions losing and even surrendered a goal when they mistook a whistle from somewhere in the crowd for the referees whistle and stopped playing The Canadians finished with the bronze medal The game against the Soviets was a much closer affair in the following year ending in a tie However Canada needed a win in the game to retain a chance for gold Left with bronze as the best possibility the disheartened Canadians lost to Czechoslovakia in the final game of the tournament and finished in fourth place br Canada and Czechoslovakia entered their contest on the final day of the tournament in Sweden with identical records Playing for the gold medal the game was dominated by the goaltenders Craig Billington and Dominik Ha ek It ended in a draw and Canada claimed gold in the round robin tournament as a result of a better goal differential It was the nation s first World Championship won on European ice in years With records Canada and the Soviet Union again faced off for the gold medal in their match up at the in Hamilton The Soviets emerged victors and won the gold while Canada finished as silver medalists br Believing that the Canada Soviet match up would again determine who won gold the Czechoslovak hosts scheduled the two teams to be the final game of the tournament It did not turn out that way as the Soviets struggled and were eliminated from contention However Canada could win silver with a victory or gold with a victory of or more goals Norwegian referee Hans R nning assigned based on his neutrality despite his inexperience officiating at the international level quickly lost control as both teams frequently hacked and slashed each other Midway through the second period with Canada leading a line brawl broke out that ultimately involved nearly every player for both teams after the Soviets left their bench closely followed by the Canadians The melee lasted minutes ending only when the players were too exhausted to continue fighting The brawl which became known as the Punch up in Piestany resulted in the disqualification of Canada and the Soviet Union br Players who were on the team entered the tournament in Moscow seeking redemption They won the gold medal finishing the tournament at The victory over the Soviet Union was the difference maker dropping the tournament hosts to the silver medal Canada would achieve the same feat at the and tournaments capturing back to back gold medals for the first time hinging on crucial wins over the Soviet Union This ultimately broke the tie in points at the top of the standings each time leaving the Soviets with silver br br br Golden years br From through to Canada won a record five straight gold medals The streak started under difficult circumstances beginning at the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Sweden one of the most competitive engagements in tournament history The host Swedes led by Peter Forsberg Markus N slund and Niklas Sundstr m broke scoring records In the host Canadians benefited from a squad bolstered by the NHL lockout resulting in a perfect record en route to winning gold The streak culminated at the tournament in Switzerland with excellent defence and goaltending covering for an offence that struggled early in the competition br br br Medal streak br At the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships Canada won silver as hosts in Winnipeg dropping a final in overtime to a powerful deep Russian team The tournament set records for attendance This would also be the start of another unrivaled display of junior hockey by Canada claiming straight medals from including their second run of five straight gold medals from through to At the tournament in Ottawa where Team Canada last captured gold Canada faced defeat against Russia in the final seconds of their semi final before Jordan Eberle scored the equalizing goal with seconds remaining in the game forcing overtime Canada would win in a shootout and go on to rout Sweden in the final John Tavares the future first overall selection at the NHL Entry Draft was named most valuable player of the tournament br br br
