In an organized sports league a typical season is the portion of one year in which regulated games of the sport are in session for example in Major League Baseball the season lasts approximately from the last week of March to the last week of September In other team sports like association football or basketball it is generally from August or September to May although in some countries such as Northern Europe or East Asia the season starts in the spring and finishes in autumn mainly due to weather conditions encountered during the winter br A year can often be broken up into several distinct sections sometimes themselves called seasons These are a preseason a series of exhibition games played for training purposes a regular season the main period of the league s competition the postseason a playoff tournament played against the league s top teams to determine the league s champion and the offseason the time when there is no official competition br br br Preseason br In association football many clubs tour and then they have a series of exhibition games for training purposes br In baseball many clubs go to spring camp and then they have spring training br The National Football League preseason is a highly structured three game series of games in which teams are afforded a larger roster limit and play games that do not count toward the record It is used to evaluate and prepare talent for the upcoming regular season br In the highest levels of professional tennis the preseason November December consists of extensive period of training on and off the court gym fitness work as well as working on tennis specific skills like for example improving the accuracy of serve br br br Regular season br In sport the term regular season or home and away season refers to the sport s league competition The regular season is usually similar to a group tournament format teams are divided into groups conferences and or divisions and each club plays a set number of games against a set number of opponents In most countries the league is played in a double round robin format where every team plays every other team twice once at their home venue and once away at the opposition s venue as visitors The results over all games are accumulated and when every team has completed its full schedule of games a winner is declared br In North America the scheduling is different Rather than every team playing all others twice teams usually play more games against local rivals than teams in other parts of the country For example the NBA s Los Angeles Lakers will play the Los Angeles Clippers a team within their division a subdivision of the conference four times in a regular season while both will only play the Toronto Raptors who are in the opposite Eastern Conference twice Part of this is due to the vast geographic distances between some teams in North America measured in a straight line Los Angeles is kilometres from Toronto for instance and a desire to limit travel expenses In the scheduling system used in the NFL it is possible for two teams to only meet every four years and to only have common opponents in a season Major League Baseball has the most uneven schedules of all the four major North American sports In MLB the conferences are called leagues instead but have exactly the same effect as conferences as with all North American major leagues leagues conferences and division are not based on skill but instead geography history and rivalries Prior to scheduling changes in teams played games against each of the teams in their own division each year but only played games total against all of the teams in the other league Because each of the inter league match ups was part of a game series or a game series teams played no games at all against most teams from the other league They played of the teams in the other league a historically high number until interleague play was limited to exhibition matches and the postseason World Series and thus MLB teams did not play the other league s teams at all In teams played all interleague teams in a single season for the first time teams now play a game series against all teams except their designated interleague rival with games totalling to games later increased to games and a game series with their interleague rival for the forthcoming season br In Australia the two largest football leagues the AFL Australian rules football and NRL rugby league both grew out of competitions held within a single city respectively Melbourne and Sydney and only began expanding to the rest of the country when inexpensive air travel made a national league possible These leagues use a single table instead of being split into divisions The term home and away season is sometimes used instead of regular season br Many football leagues in Latin America have a very different system Because most Latin American countries never had a football cup competition they instead split their season into two parts typically known as the Apertura and Clausura Spanish for opening and closing Most countries that use this system Argentina being one notable example crown separate league champions for each part of the season using only league play A few others such as Uruguay crown one champion at the end of a playoff involving top teams from each half of the season Mexico operates its Apertura and Clausura as separate competitions that both end in playoffs Brazil has a different system the season starts with the state championships in January every Brazilian state have his own championship these state championships ends in April The Campeonato Brasileiro S rie A itself starts in May and ends in early December and is played in a double round robin format in the same way as the European championships br A system similar to the Apertura and Clausura developed independently in Philippine professional basketball with formerly two now three tournaments called conferences in one season with each conference divided into an elimination round the single round robin group stage and the playoffs in the North American sense Winning the playoffs is the ultimate goal of every team for every conference while there is no season championship winning all conferences within a single season is rare and has only happened five times since with the two most recent examples occurring in and The qualifying round and playoffs setup has permeated down to the local level and in most team sports although seasons are not divided into conferences br br br Postseason br br Many sports leagues have playoffs or finals that occur after the regular season is complete A subset of the teams enter into a playoff tournament usually a knockout tournament generally a pre determined number with better overall records more wins fewer losses during the regular season There are many variations used to determine the champion the league s top prize In many of these leagues winning the league s top prize at the conclusion of the postseason is more important than winning the regular season This includes the five major U S and Canada sports leagues Super Bowl Stanley Cup Finals NBA Finals World Series and MLS Cup the major Australian sports BBL Grand Final NBL Grand Final A League Grand Final AFL Grand Final and NRL Grand Final and the CFL s Grey Cup br European leagues have also started holding playoffs after a double round robin regular season The Football League started its promotion playoffs in with the third up to the sixth ranked teams participating for the final promotion berth the two top teams are automatically promoted Elsewhere relegation playoffs are also held to determine which teams would be relegated to the lower leagues One prominent top level football league the Eredivisie of the Netherlands uses two different playoffs one for relegation purposes and the other to determine one of the league s entrants in the following season s UEFA Europa League In Superleague Greece which currently has two places in the UEFA Champions League and three in the Europa League the teams that finish second through fifth in the regular season enter a home and away playoff mini league Since one Europa League place is reserved for the country s cup winner only three of the four teams are guaranteed a place in the next season s European competitions unless both the cup winner and runner up are already qualified for Europe by other means The playoff determines the country s second Champions League participant and the points at which the two or three Europa League entrants join that competition Conversely some leagues like the Premier League do not hold a postseason and therefore these leagues champions and relegation are instead based on the regular season records br Although rugby union did not become professional until that sport has a long history of playoffs primarily in France and the Southern Hemisphere The French national championship now known as Top staged a championship final in its first season of first used more than one round of playoffs in and has continuously operated a playoff system except during the two World Wars since South Africa s Currie Cup has determined its champions by playoffs since and New Zealand s National Provincial Championship the top level of which is now known as the Mitre Cup has used playoffs since its creation in Argentina s Nacional de Clubes has determined its champion by playoffs since its inception in Currently two separate competitions feed into the Nacional the Torneo de la URBA for Buenos Aires clubs held since and Torneo del Interior for the rest of the country both use playoffs to determine their champions Super Rugby involving regional franchises from Australia New Zealand and South Africa and national franchises in Argentina and Japan has used playoffs to determine its champions since its creation as Super in br By contrast other European countries were slow to adopt playoffs in rugby union The English Premiership only began playoffs in and did not use them to determine the league champion until The Celtic League now known as Pro resisted a playoff system even longer its champions were determined solely by league play from its inception in until playoffs began in br When the UEFA Champions League reformatted in it added a knockout stage involving four teams that finished at the top two places in their respective groups Like North American sports leagues this setup prevented some participants from facing each other necessitating a two round knockout stage to determine the champions It has since been expanded to the round knockout stage today The Copa Libertadores has applied a knockout stage since the tournament expanding to the current four round format next season All intercontinental club football competitions now feature a knockout stage br br br Off season br br The off season vacation time or close season is the time of year when there is no official competition Although upper management continues to work the athletes will take much vacation time off Also various events such as drafts transfers and important off season free agent signings occur Generally most athletes stay in shape during the off season in preparation for the next season Certain new rules in the league may be made during this time and will become enforced during the next regular season The Off season is characterized by a break in regular league or tournament play allowing athletes coaches and staff to rest recover and prepare for the upcoming season The off season typically follows the conclusion of the regular season or playoffs and precedes the start of preseason training or conditioning camps br During the off season athletes often take time off to recuperate both physically and mentally from the demands of competitive play This period of rest is essential for preventing burnout reducing the risk of injuries and allowing the body to recover from the wear and tear of regular training and competition Athletes may use this time to focus on rehabilitation from any lingering injuries undergo medical evaluations and engage in cross training activities to maintain overall fitness levels br In addition to rest and recovery the off season provides athletes with an opportunity to address weakness and areas for improvement in their performance Many athletes use this time to work on specific skills refine techniques and build strength and conditioning through targeted training programs Coaches and training staff often collaborate with athletes to develop individualized offseason training regimens tailored to their specific needs and goals br Off season training may include a combination of strength and conditioning workouts skill development sessions and team building activities Athletes may also participate in recreational sports or activities to maintain their competitive edge while enjoying a break from the rigors of their primary sport Furthermore athletes may take advantage of the off season to pursue personal interests further their education or engage in community service and outreach initiatives br Beyond individual training the off season is also a critical time for teams to regroup strategize and plan for the upcoming season Coaching staff and management may conduct player evaluations analyze performance data and make personnel decisions such as trades drafts and free agent signings Team bonding activities such as retreats workshops and social events may be organized to foster camaraderie and cohesion among teammates br br As most countries which have a league in a particular sport will operate their regular season at roughly the same time as the others international tournaments may be arranged during the off season br For example most European football league club competitions run from July or August to May subsequently major international competitions such as the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Football Championship are organised to occur in June and July br br br Seasons by league br br The table represents typical seasons for some leagues by month Blank or white denotes
