to entertain as film stars Private detective Eddie Valiant once a staunch ally of the toons alongside his brother and co worker Teddy has become a depressed alcoholic following Teddy s murder by an unknown toon five years earlier Maroon Cartoon Studios owner R K Maroon upset about the recent poor performance of his toon star Roger Rabbit hires Eddie to investigate rumors that Roger s glamorous toon wife Jessica is having an affair with Marvin Acme owner of both the Acme Corporation and Toontown the animated metropolis in which toons reside br After watching Jessica perform at The Ink and Paint Club Eddie secretly photographs her and Acme playing patty cake He shows the pictures to Roger who becomes distraught and flees refusing to believe Jessica was unfaithful The next morning Acme is found murdered and evidence at the scene implicates Roger as a suspect Eddie meets Judge Doom the sinister human judge of Toontown having bribed the electorate to gain their votes and his five weasel minions the Toon Patrol Doom confirms he plans to execute Roger using the Dip a chemical concoction of acetone benzene and turpentine which is capable of destroying the otherwise invulnerable toons br Roger s toon co star Baby Herman suggests to Eddie that Acme s missing will which supposedly bequeaths Toontown to the toons may have been the killer s true motive Eddie returns to his office and finds Roger waiting Roger insists he has been framed and Eddie reluctantly agrees to help after finding evidence of Acme s will he hides Roger in a bar tended by his girlfriend Dolores Jessica tells Eddie that Maroon threatened Roger s career unless she posed for the compromising photos Meanwhile Dolores s research uncovers that Cloverleaf Industries recently bought the city s Pacific Electric railway system and will purchase Toontown at midnight unless Acme s will is found Doom and the Toon Patrol find Roger but he and Eddie escape with help from Benny a toon taxi cab Sheltering in a local theater Eddie sees a newsreel of Maroon selling his studio to Cloverleaf br While Eddie goes to the studio to interrogate Maroon Jessica abducts Roger Maroon denies involvement in Acme s murder admitting he intended to blackmail Acme into selling his company as otherwise Cloverleaf would not buy the studio Maroon is assassinated and Eddie spots Jessica fleeing the scene Assuming she is the assailant he reluctantly follows her into Toontown choosing to discard the last of his alcohol After saving Eddie from being shot by Doom Jessica reveals her actions were to ensure Roger s safety and it was Doom who killed Acme and Maroon Acme gave his will to Jessica for safety but when she examined it the paper was blank br Doom and the Toon Patrol capture Jessica and Eddie bringing them to Acme s factory Doom reveals he is the sole shareholder of Cloverleaf and plans to erase Toontown with a Dip spraying machine so he can build a freeway in its place and decommission the railway system to force people to use it When Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine s sprayer Eddie distracts the weasels by performing a comedic vaudeville act full of pratfalls causing them to die of laughter before he kicks their leader into the Dip Doom is flattened by a steamroller while fighting with Eddie However Doom survives revealing he is actually a disguised toon and Teddy s murderer Struggling against Doom s toon abilities Eddie empties the machine s Dip supply spraying and dissolving Doom to death The machine crashes through the wall into Toontown where it is destroyed by a train br As police and toons gather at the scene Eddie realizes that Acme s will was written on the blank paper in temporarily invisible ink confirming the toons inherit Toontown Having regained his sense of humor Eddie happily enters Toontown alongside Dolores Roger Jessica and the toons br br br Cast br br br Live action cast br br br Voice cast br br br Production br br br Development br Walt Disney Productions purchased the film rights to Gary K Wolf s novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit shortly after its publication in Ron W Miller then president of Disney saw it as a perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster Jeffrey Price and Peter S Seaman were hired to write the script penning two drafts Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in but Disney declined as his two previous films I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Used Cars had been box office bombs Between and Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van Citters as animation director Paul Reubens voicing Roger Rabbit Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit The project was revamped in by Michael Eisner the then new CEO of Disney Amblin Entertainment which consisted of Steven Spielberg Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were approached to produce Who Framed Roger Rabbit alongside Disney The original budget was projected at million which Disney felt was too expensive br The film was finally green lit when the budget decreased to million which at the time would have still made it the most expensive animated film ever produced Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg argued that the hybrid of live action and animation would save Walt Disney Feature Animation Spielberg s contract included an extensive amount of creative control and a large percentage of the box office profits Disney kept all merchandising rights Spielberg convinced Warner Bros Fleischer Studios Harvey Comics King Features Syndicate Felix the Cat Productions Turner Entertainment and Universal Pictures Walter Lantz Productions to lend their characters to appear in the film with in some cases stipulations on how those characters were portrayed for example Disney s Donald Duck and Warner Bros Daffy Duck appear as equally talented dueling pianists and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny also share a scene Apart from the agreement and some of the original voice artists reprising their roles Warner Bros and the various other companies were not involved in the production of Roger Rabbit Executives at Warner Bros were displeased by animators using the Daffy design by Bob Clampett and demanded they use the design by Chuck Jones in response Zemeckis had separate artists animate Daffy using Jones design to satisfy Warner Bros in order to have Clampett s design in the final film The producers were unable to acquire the rights to use Popeye Tom and Jerry Little Lulu Casper or the Terrytoons characters for appearances from their respective owners King Features Turner Western Publishing Harvey Comics and Viacom br Terry Gilliam was offered the chance to direct but he found the project too technically challenging Pure laziness on my part he later admitted I completely regret that decision Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct in based on the success of Romancing the Stone and Back to the Future Disney executives were continuing to suggest Darrell Van Citters direct the animation but Spielberg and Zemeckis decided against it Richard Williams was eventually hired to direct the animation Zemeckis wanted the film to exhibit Disney s high quality of animation Warner Bros characterization and Tex Avery humor br br br Casting br Harrison Ford was Spielberg s original choice to play Eddie Valiant but his price was too high Chevy Chase was the second choice but he was not interested Bill Murray was also considered for the role but due to his idiosyncratic method of receiving offers for roles Murray missed out on it Eddie Murphy reportedly turned down the role as he misunderstood the concept of toons and humans co existing he later regretted this decision Robin Williams Robert Redford Jack Nicholson Sylvester Stallone Edward James Olmos Wallace Shawn Ed Harris Charles Grodin and Don Lane were also considered for the role Ultimately Bob Hoskins was chosen by Spielberg because of his acting skill and because Spielberg believed he had a hopeful demeanor and he looked like he belonged in that era To facilitate Hoskins performance Charles Fleischer dressed in a Roger Rabbit costume and stood in behind camera for most scenes Williams explained Roger was a combination of Tex Avery s cashew nut shaped head the swatch of red hair like Droopy s Goofy s overalls Porky Pig s bow tie Mickey Mouse s gloves and Bugs Bunny like cheeks and ears Eddie Deezen who had worked with Zemeckis previously auditioned to play Roger but did not get the part br Kathleen Turner provided the uncredited voice of Jessica Rabbit Roger Rabbit s wife br Tim Curry auditioned for the role of Judge Doom but was rejected because the producers found him too terrifying Christopher Lee was also considered for the role but turned it down John Cleese also expressed interest for the role but was deemed not scary enough Peter O Toole F Murray Abraham Roddy McDowall and Sting were also considered for the role Christopher Lloyd was cast because he previously worked with Zemeckis and Spielberg on Back to the Future He compared his part as Doom to his previous role as the Klingon commander Kruge in Star Trek III The Search for Spock both overly evil characters which he considered fun to play He avoided blinking his eyes while on camera to portray the character br Fleischer also voiced Benny the Cab Psycho and Greasy Lou Hirsch who voiced Baby Herman was the original choice for Benny the Cab but was replaced by Fleischer br br br Writing br br Price and Seaman were brought aboard to continue writing the script once Spielberg and Zemeckis were hired For inspiration the two writers studied the work of Walt Disney and Warner Bros Cartoons from the Golden Age of American animation especially Tex Avery and Bob Clampett cartoons The Cloverleaf streetcar subplot was inspired by Chinatown Price and Seaman said that the Red Car plot suburb expansion urban and political corruption really did happen Price stated In Los Angeles during the s car and tire companies teamed up against the Pacific Electric Railway system and bought them out of business Where the freeway runs in Los Angeles is where the Red Car used to be In Wolf s novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit the toons were comic strip characters rather than movie stars br During the writing process Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain but they made their final decision with the newly created character Judge Doom Doom was supposed to have an animated vulture sit on his shoulder but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed Doom would also have a suitcase of small animated kangaroos that act as a jury by having their joeys pop out of their pouches each with letters when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY This was also cut for budget and technical reasons br The Toon Patrol Stupid Smart Ass Greasy Wheezy and Psycho satirizes the Seven Dwarfs Doc Grumpy Happy Sleepy Bashful Sneezy and Dopey who appeared in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Originally seven weasels were to mimic the dwarfs complement but eventually two of them Slimey and Sleazy were written out of the script Further references included The Ink and Paint Club resembling the Harlem Cotton Club while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom s invention of the Dip to eliminate all the toons to Hitler s Final Solution Doom was originally the hunter who killed Bambi s mother Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a Volkswagen Beetle before being changed to a taxi cab Ideas originally conceived for the story also included a sequence set at Marvin Acme s funeral whose attendees included Eddie Foghorn Leghorn Mickey Mouse Minnie Mouse Tom and Jerry Heckle and Jeckle Chip n Dale Felix the Cat Herman and Katnip Yakky Doodle Mighty Mouse Superman Popeye Olive Oyl Bluto Clarabelle Cow Horace Horsecollar the Seven Dwarfs Baby Huey and Casper the Friendly Ghost in cameo appearances This scene was cut for pacing reasons at the storyboard stage Before finally agreeing on Who Framed Roger Rabbit as the film s title working titles included Murder in Toontown Toons Dead Toons Don t Pay Bills The Toontown Trial Trouble in Toontown and Eddie Goes to Toontown br br br Filming br br Williams admitted he was openly disdainful of the Disney bureaucracy and refused to work in Los Angeles Accommodating Williams and his animators production moved to England where a studio Walt Disney Animation UK subsuming Richard Williams Animation was created for this purpose located at The Forum Camden Street in Camden Town London while the live action production was based at Elstree Studios Disney and Spielberg also told Williams that in return for doing the film they would help distribute his unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler Supervising animators included Van Citters Dale Baer Michael Peraza Joe Ranft Tom Sito James Baxter David Bowers Andreas Deja Mike Gabriel Chris Jenkins Phil Nibbelink Nik Ranieri Simon Wells and Bruce W Smith Williams and associate producer Don Hahn spearheaded the animation production The animation production was split between Walt Disney Animation UK and a specialized unit in Los Angeles set up by Walt Disney Feature Animation and supervised by Baer The production budget continued to escalate while the shooting schedule ran longer than expected When the budget reached million Disney CEO Michael Eisner seriously considered shutting down production but studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg talked him out of it Despite the budget escalating to over million Disney moved forward on production because they were enthusiastic to work with Spielberg br VistaVision cameras installed with motion control technology were used for the photography of the live action scenes which would be composited with animation Rubber mannequins of Roger Rabbit Baby Herman and the Toon Patrol portrayed the animated characters during rehearsals to teach the actors where to look when acting with open air and imaginative cartoon characters Many of the live action props held by cartoon characters were shot on set with the props either held by robotic arms or manipulated with strings similar to a marionette For example a test was shot at ILM where an actor playing the detective would climb down a fire escape and the rabbit is supposed to follow and he knocks down some stacked boxes Naturally there would not be a rabbit during the test so the camera would go down the fire escape and the boxes would fall when a wire was pulled The actor who played the voice of Roger Charles Fleischer insisted on wearing a Roger Rabbit costume while on the set to get into character Filming began on November and lasted for seven and a half months at Elstree Studios with an additional month in Los Angeles and at Industrial Light Magic ILM for blue screen effects of Toontown The Dimco Buildings in London were dressed as the fictional Acme Factory The entrance of Desilu Studios in Los Angeles served as the fictional Maroon Cartoon Studio lot br br br Animation and post production br Post production lasted for months ILM had already used CGI and digital compositing in a few movies such as the stained glass knight scene in Young Sherlock Holmes but the computers were still not powerful enough to make a complicated movie like Who Framed Roger Rabbit so all the animation was done using cels and optical compositing First the animators and layout artists were given black and white printouts of the live action scenes known as photostats and they placed their animation paper on top of them The artists then drew the animated characters in relationship to the live action footage Due to Zemeckis dynamic camera moves the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not slipping and slipping all over the place Ensuring this did not happen and that the characters looked real Zemeckis and Spielberg met for about an hour and a half and came up with an idea If the rabbit sits down in an old chair dust comes up He should always be touching something real After the rough animation was complete it was run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the rostrum camera with no background Williams came up with the idea of making the cartoon characters dimensional and the animated footage was sent to ILM for compositing where technicians animated three lighting layers shadows highlights and tone mattes separately to give the characters a sense of depth and create the illusion of them affected by the set lighting Finally the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters who were in turn composited into the live action footage One of the most difficult effects in the film was Jessica s dress in the nightclub scene because it had to flash sequins an effect accomplished by filtering light through a plastic bag scratched with steel wool br br br Music br br Regular Zemeckis collaborator Alan Silvestri composed the film score performed by the London Symphony Orchestra LSO under the direction of Silvestri Zemeckis joked that the British musicians could not keep up with Silvestri s jazz tempo The performances of the music themes written for Jessica Rabbit were entirely improvised by a jazz combo performing with the LSO The work of American composer Carl Stalling heavily influenced Silvestri s work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit The film s soundtrack was originally released by Buena Vista Records on June and reissued on CD on April br On January Intrada Records released a three CD set with the complete score alternates and a remastered version of the original album plus music from three Roger Rabbit short films composed and conducted by Bruce Broughton and James Horner Mondo Records and Walt Disney Records reissued the original album on vinyl on September br The film features performances of Hungarian Rhapsody Tony Anselmo and Mel Blanc Why Don t You Do Right Amy Irving The Merry Go Round Broke Down Charles Fleischer and Smile Darn Ya Smile Toon Chorus br br br Release br Michael Eisner then CEO and Roy E Disney who was the vice chairman of The Walt Disney Company felt the film was too risqu with adult themes and sexual references Eisner and Zemeckis disagreed over various elements of it but since Zemeckis had final cut privilege he refused to make alterations Roy E Disney head of Walt Disney Feature Animation along with studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg felt it was appropriate to release the film under the studio s adult orientated Touchstone Pictures banner instead of the flagship Walt Disney Pictures banner br br br Box office br The film opened in the United States on June grossing in theaters during its opening weekend it was in first place at the US box office It was Disney s biggest opening weekend ever at the time of its

lights a cigar and tells the human director to go to hell we know we re in a new and special universe Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune praised the film s dazzling jaw dropping opening four minute sequence he noted that the sequence alone took nearly nine months to animate Siskel gave the film three and a half stars out of four Ebert and his colleague Siskel spent a considerable amount of time

technically marvelous film and a landmark that resulted from unprecedented cooperation between Warner Bros and Disney On CNN s miniseries The Movies Tom Hanks called it the most complicated movie ever

made a rather scathing attack on the film in his book Chuck Jones Conversations Among his complaints Jones accused Zemeckis of robbing Richard Williams of any creative input and ruining the piano duel that both Williams and he storyboarded br br br Accolades br br br Legacy br br The critical and commercial success of the film rekindled an interest in the Golden Age of American animation and in addition to sparking the Silver Age of American animation and the Disney Renaissance it has also gained a cult following In November a few months after the film s release Roger Rabbit made his guest appearance in the live action and animated television special broadcast on NBC called Mickey s th Birthday in which to celebrate the th anniversary of Mickey Mouse In Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey s Toontown for Disneyland based on the Toontown that appeared in the film The attraction also features a ride called Roger Rabbit s Car Toon Spin Three theatrical animated shorts were also produced Tummy Trouble was shown before Honey I Shrunk the Kids Roller Coaster Rabbit was shown before Dick Tracy and Trail Mix Up was shown before A Far Off Place The film also inspired a short lived comic book and video game spin offs including two PC games the Japanese version of The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle which features Roger instead of Bugs a game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System and a game released on the Game Boy br In December the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as culturally historically or aesthetically significant br Roger Rabbit served as inspiration for various live action animation films in the following decades including Cool World Space Jam Tom Jerry Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers and Once Upon a Studio br br br Controversies br With the film s LaserDisc release Variety first reported in March that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of Jessica Rabbit While undetectable when played at the usual rate of film frames per second the LaserDisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame by frame to uncover these visuals Whether or not they were actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown Many retailers said that within minutes of the LaserDisc debut their entire inventory was sold out The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy including stories on CNN and various newspapers br Another frequently debated scene includes one in which Baby Herman extends his middle finger as he passes under a woman s dress and re emerges with drool on his lip In the scene where Daffy Duck and Donald Duck are dueling on pianos some heard Donald call Daffy a goddamn stupid nigger rather than the scripted and recorded line doggone stubborn little br br br Legal issue br Gary K Wolf author of the novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit filed a lawsuit in against The Walt Disney Company He claimed he was owed royalties based on the value of gross receipts and merchandising sales In the trial court in the case ruled that these only referred to actual cash receipts Disney collected and denied Wolf s claim In its January ruling the California Court of Appeal disagreed finding that expert testimony introduced by Wolf regarding the customary use of gross receipts in the entertainment business could support a broader reading of the term The ruling vacated the trial court s order in favor of Disney and remanded the case for further proceedings In a March hearing Wolf estimated he was owed million Disney s attorneys not only disputed the claim but also said Wolf owed Disney million because of an accounting error discovered in preparing for the lawsuit Wolf won the decision in receiving between and in damages br br br Proposed sequel br Spielberg discussed a sequel in with J J Abrams as writer and Zemeckis as producer Abrams s outline was eventually abandoned Nat Mauldin was hired to write a prequel titled Roger Rabbit The Toon Platoon set in to Similar to the previous film Toon Platoon featured many cameo appearances by characters from The Golden Age of American Animation It began with Roger Rabbit s early years living on a farm in the midwestern United States With human Ritchie Davenport Roger travels west to seek his mother in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick his future wife a struggling Hollywood actress While Roger and Ritchie are enlisting in the Army Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro Nazi German broadcasts Roger and Ritchie must save her by going into Nazi occupied Europe accompanied by several other Toons in their Army platoon After their triumph Roger and Ritchie are given a Hollywood Boulevard parade and Roger is finally reunited with his mother and father Bugs Bunny br Mauldin later retitled his script Who Discovered Roger Rabbit Spielberg left the project when deciding he could not satirize Nazis after directing Schindler s List Eisner commissioned a rewrite in with Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver Although they kept Roger s search for his mother Stoner and Oliver replaced the WWII subplot with Roger s inadvertent rise to stardom on Broadway and Hollywood Disney was impressed and Alan Menken was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer One of the songs This Only Happens in the Movies was recorded in on the debut album of Broadway actress Kerry Butler Eric Goldberg was set to be the new animation director and began to redesign Roger s new character appearance br Spielberg became busy establishing DreamWorks while Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to remain as producers Test footage for Who Discovered Roger Rabbit was shot sometime in at the Disney animation unit in Lake Buena Vista Florida the results were a mix of CGI traditional animation and live action that did not please Disney A second test had the toons completely converted to CGI but this was dropped as the film s projected budget would escalate past million Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film In March producer Don Hahn doubted a sequel arguing that public tastes had changed since the s with the rise of computer animation There was something very special about that time when animation was not as much in the forefront as it is now br In December Marshall stated that he was still open to the idea and in April Zemeckis revealed he was still interested According to a MTV News story Jeffrey Price and Peter S Seaman were writing a new script for the project and the animated characters would be in traditional two dimensional while the rest would be in motion capture In Bob Hoskins had agreed to sign on for a sequel but expressed scepticism about the use of performance capture in the film Zemeckis said that the sequel would remain hand drawn animated and live action sequences will be filmed just like in the original film but the lighting effects on the cartoon characters and some of the props that the toons handle will be done digitally Also in Hahn who was the film s original associate producer confirmed the sequel s development in an interview with Empire He stated Yeah I couldn t possibly comment I deny completely but yeah if you re a fan pretty soon you re going to be very very very happy Hoskins retired from acting in after a Parkinson s disease diagnosis a year earlier and died from pneumonia in Marshall confirmed that the film would be a prequel similar to earlier drafts and that the writing was almost complete During an interview at the premiere of Flight Zemeckis stated that the sequel was still possible despite Hoskins absence and the script for the sequel was sent to Disney for approval from studio executives br In February Gary K Wolf writer of the original novel said Erik Von Wodtke and he were working on a development proposal for an animated Disney buddy comedy starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit called The Stooge based on the film of the same name The proposed film is set in a prequel taking place five years before Who Framed Roger Rabbit and part of the story is about how Roger met Jessica Wolf has stated the film is currently wending its way through Disney br In November while promoting his film Allied in England Zemeckis stated that the sequel moves the story of Roger and Jessica Rabbit into the next few years of period film moving on from film noir to the world of the s He also stated that the sequel would feature a digital Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant would return in ghost form While the director went on to state that the script is terrific and the film would still use hand drawn animation Zemeckis thinks that the chances of Disney green lighting the sequel are slim As he explained more in detail The current corporate Disney culture has no interest in Roger and they certainly don t like Jessica at all In December while promoting Welcome to Marwen his latest film and given the th anniversary of Who Framed Roger Rabbit Zemeckis reiterated in an interview with Yahoo Movies that though the sequel s script is wonderful Disney is still unlikely to ever produce it and he does not see the possibility of producing it as an original film for the streaming service Disney as he feels that it does not make any sense as there is no Princess in it br br br See also br List of films
