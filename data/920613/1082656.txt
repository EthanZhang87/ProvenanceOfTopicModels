in Rolling Stone felt the film perfectly updates Superman for the modern audience J Hoberman of The Village Voice called it surprisingly well made It s a summer blockbuster filled with mythology and sensitivity James Berardinelli reacted positively to the movie comparing it favorably with Richard Donner s film He felt Spacey was better than Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor describing him as more cruel and less flippant than Hackman There are no miscasts to be found in the supporting cast either Berardinelli said Superman Returns is near the top if not at the top of the superhero movie pile It offers nearly everything romance action humor and plenty of goose bumps br However Roger Ebert argued the film was a glum lackluster movie in which even the big effects sequences seem dutiful instead of exhilarating He also felt that Brandon Routh lacks charisma as Superman surmising that he may have been cast because he looks a little like Reeve Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that Warner Bros should have rebooted the series along the lines of Batman Begins He also felt Bosworth at years old was too young to portray Lois Lane and the climax did not match the potential of the tiring minute long film br br On May almost three years after the debut of Superman Returns filmmaker Quentin Tarantino declared his appreciation for Bryan Singer s directorial work on Superman Returns and that he would write a page review about Superman Returns br On January more than five years after the movie was released the independent film community daily news site IndieWire released a two part video essay that probes the melancholic nature of Superman Returns Produced by Matt Zoller Seitz and Ken Cancelosi the critique was inspired by a review that Seitz wrote for the New York Press in in which he stated that From the moment its hero returns to the sky to rescue Lois Lane from a plummeting jet Superman Returns flirts with greatness br In Singer stated that Superman Returns was made for Perhaps more of a female audience It wasn t what it needed to be I guess Singer stated that he would have cut about the first quarter off of the film and started it with the jet disaster sequence or something I could have grabbed the audience a little more quickly I don t know what would have helped Probably nothing If I could go again I would do an origin I would reboot it br Empire ranked the movie on its The Greatest Movies of All Time list stating It may have been a slighter return than some people had hoped for but Singer s vision of the Man of Steel is an heroic effort Plenty of spectacle and a lot of heart helps Kal El soar br br Superman Returns was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects but

Brandon Routh Kate Bosworth Kevin Spacey Sam Huntington Frank Langella and Tristan Lake Leabu were to reprise their roles Due to his commitment Singer dropped out of directing a remake of Logan s Run and an adaptation of The Mayor of Castro Street Writer Michael Dougherty wanted the sequel to be action packed featuring other Kryptonians with Brainiac and Bizarro also considered for primary villains The New Krypton landmass floating in space at the end of Superman Returns would have served as a plot device Although Superman Returns received mostly positive reviews Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures were disappointed by the film s box office return Warner Bros President Alan F Horn explained that Superman Returns was a very successful film but that it should have done million worldwide We should have had perhaps a little more action to satisfy the young male crowd Singer reacted incredulously to the studio complaints saying That movie made million I don t know what constitutes under performing these days million was the maximum budget Warner Bros was projecting for the sequel as Superman Returns cost million br Filming for the Superman Returns sequel was to start in mid before Singer halted development in favor of Valkyrie Filming was then pushed to March but writers Dougherty and Dan Harris left in favor of other career opportunities The Writers Guild of America strike pushed the release date to Singer still listed the sequel as a priority in March saying that the film was in early development Routh expected filming to begin in early Paul Levitz president of DC Comics expected Routh to reprise the title role from Superman Returns before his contract for a sequel expired in However with Warner Bros deciding to reboot the film series Singer dropped out in favor of directing Jack the Giant Slayer In August Warner Bros President of Production Jeff Robinov reflected Superman Returns didn t quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to It didn t position the character the way he needed to be positioned Had Superman worked in we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a Batman and Superman movie at all br br Brandon Routh reprised his role as Clark Kent Superman in addition to playing Ray Palmer The Atom in the Arrowverse TV series crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths Executive producer Marc Guggenheim was reluctant to call Routh s crossover appearance a sequel when addressing whether the character s appearance would constitute a sequel to Superman Returns I don t know if it s for me to say We re picking up so many years after the events of that movie maybe a coda is a better word than sequel Set on Earth in the Arrowverse this version of Superman has become an aged and beleaguered superhero similar to the iteration from the DC Comics mini series Kingdom Come adopting a black belt and an s shield with a black background as a sign of mourning after losing his friends and wife having been married to Lois at some point after revealing his secrets to her to a terrorist attack on the Daily Planet by a psychopath from Gotham City He is also similar to another iteration Kal L remained working as a newspaper s editor in chief instead of going into seclusion after what happened making this Superman an amalgam of the two as well as being a facsimile to Ray Palmer He is later recruited by heroes from across the multiverse to avert a Crisis caused by the Anti Monitor During the event Superman also references his son Jason implying that he had discovered his true paternity as well as the events from Superman III when the good Clark Kent fought an evil version of Superman This implies the Arrowverse retconned the Reeve Routh Superman continuity so that Superman III and possibly even Superman IV and Supergirl did happen after all and possibly now take place after Superman Returns br After the Crisis was averted and the multiverse was rebooted Superman of Earth is seen wearing a yellow s shield and belt br br Superman in film br br Official website br Official DC Comics website Archived June at the Wayback Machine br
