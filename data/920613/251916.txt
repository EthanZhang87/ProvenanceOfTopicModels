The Houston Chronicle is the largest daily newspaper in Houston Texas United States As of April it is the third largest newspaper by Sunday circulation in the United States behind only The New York

and photographers The Chronicle has bureaus in Washington D C and Austin The paper reports that its web site averages million page views per month br The publication serves as the newspaper of record

print edition the Chronicle offers Chron com a free online only ad supported newspaper covering breaking news weather traffic pop culture and city life Houstonchronicle com launched in is a subscriber only paper that contains everything found in the daily print edition br br br History br br From its inception the practices and policies of the Houston Chronicle were shaped by strong willed personalities who were the publishers The history of the newspaper can be best understood when divided into the eras of these individuals br br br Marcellus E Foster era br The Houston Chronicle was founded in by a former reporter for the now defunct Houston Post Marcellus E Foster Foster who had been covering the Spindletop oil boom for the Post invested in Spindletop and took of the return on that investment at the time equivalent to a week s wages and used it to fund the Chronicle br The Chronicle s first edition was published on October and sold for two cents per copy at a time when most papers sold for five cents each At the end of its first month in operation the Chronicle had a circulation of roughly one tenth of the population of Houston at the time Within the first year of operation the paper purchased and consolidated the Daily Herald br In Foster asked Jesse H Jones a local businessman and prominent builder to construct a new office and plant for the paper and offered a half interest in the newspaper as a down payment with twenty years to pay the remainder Jones agreed and the resulting Chronicle Building was one of the finest in the South br Under Foster the paper s circulation grew from about in to on weekdays and on Sundays by Foster continued to write columns under the pen name Mefo and drew much attention in the s for his opposition to the Ku Klux Klan KKK He sold the rest of his interest to Jesse H Jones on June and promptly retired br br br Goodfellows br br In city editor George Kepple started Goodfellows On Christmas Eve Kepple passed a hat among the Chronicle s reporters to collect money to buy toys for a shoe shine boy br Goodfellows continues today through donations made by the newspaper and its readers It has grown into a citywide program that provides needy children between the ages of two and ten with toys during the winter holidays In Goodfellows distributed almost toys to more than needy children in the Greater Houston area br br br Jesse H Jones era br In Jesse H Jones became the sole owner of the paper He had approached Foster about selling and Foster had answered What will you give me Jones described the buyout of Foster as follows br br Wanting to be liberal with Foster if I bought him out since he had created the paper and originally owned most of the stock and had made a success of it I thought for a while before answering and finally asked him how much he owed He replied On real estate and everything about dollars I then said to him that I would give him dollars in cash having in mind that this would pay his debts and give him spending money In addition I would give him a note for secured by a mortgage on the Chronicle Building the note to be payable interest and principal at the rate of a year for thirty five years which I figured was about his expectancy I would also pay him dollars a year as editor of the paper and dollars a year to continue writing the daily front page column MEFO on the condition that either of us could cancel the editorship and or the MEFO column contracts on six months notice and that if I canceled both the column and the editorship I would give him an additional dollars a year for life I considered the offer substantially more than the Chronicle was worth at the time No sooner had I finished stating my proposition than he said I will take it and the transaction was completed accordingly br In Jesse H Jones transferred ownership of the paper to the newly established Houston Endowment Inc Jones retained the title of publisher until his death in br According to the Handbook of Texas online the Chronicle generally represented very conservative political views during the s br br the Chronicle generally represented the very conservative political interests of the Houston business establishment As such it eschewed controversial political topics such as integration or the impacts of rapid economic growth on life in the city It did not perform investigative journalism This resulted in a stodgy newspaper that failed to capture the interests of newcomers to the city By circulation of the rival Houston Post had pulled ahead of the Chronicle br Jones a lifelong Democrat who organized the Democratic National Convention to be in Houston in and who spent long years in public service first under the Wilson administration helping to found the Red Cross during World War I and later famously under the Roosevelt administration described the paper s mission in these terms br br I regard the publication of a newspaper as a distinct public trust and one not to be treated lightly or abused for selfish purposes or to gratify selfish whims A great daily newspaper can remain a power for good only so long as it is uninfluenced by unworthy motives and unbought by the desire for gain A newspaper which can be neither bought nor bullied is the greatest asset of a city or state Naturally a newspaper makes mistakes in judgment as it does in type but so long as errors are honestly made they are not serious when general results are considered br The success or failure of a particular issue is of little consequence compared with the all important principle of a fearless and honest newspaper This I intend the Chronicle shall always be a newspaper for all the people democratic in fact and in principle standing for the greatest good to the greatest number championing and defending what it believes to be right and condemning and opposing what it believes to be wrong br br Such have always been the policies of the Chronicle and to such it is now rededicated br Under Jones watch the Chronicle bought KTRH one of Houston s oldest radio stations in In Jones led a syndicate that signed on Houston s third television station KTRK TV br br br John T Jones era br The board of Houston Endowment named John T Jones nephew of Jesse H Jones as editor of the Chronicle Houston Endowment president J Howard Creekmore was named publisher In John T Jones hired William P Steven as editor Steven had previously been editor of the Tulsa Tribune and the Minneapolis Star Tribune and credited with turning around the declining readership of both papers One of his innovations was the creation of a regular help column called Watchem where ordinary citizens could voice their complaints The Chicago Tribune later called this column a pioneer and prototype of the modern newspaper Action Line br Steven s progressive political philosophy soon created conflict with the very conservative views of the Houston Endowment board especially when he editorially supported the election of Lyndon B Johnson the Democratic candidate for president However more than political philosophy was involved Robert A Caro revealed in his biography of Johnson that written assurance of this support from John T Jones had been the price demanded by Johnson in January in return for approval of the merger of Houston s National Bank of Commerce in which Jones had a financial interest with another Houston bank the Texas National br In the Chronicle purchased the assets of its evening newspaper competitor the Houston Press becoming the only evening newspaper in the city By then the Chronicle had a circulation of the largest of any paper in Texas The Atlantic Monthly credited the growth to the changes instigated by Steven br In the summer of Jones decided to buy a local television station that was already owned by the Houston Endowment He resigned from the Houston Endowment board to avoid a conflict of interest though he remained as publisher of the Chronicle On September Jones made a late night visit to the Steven home where he broke the news that the Endowment board had ordered him to dismiss Steven Jones had to comply On September the paper published a story announcing that Everett Collier was now the new editor br No mention was made of Steven or the Houston Endowment board Houston Post staff wrote an article about the change but top management killed it Only two weekly papers in Houston mentioned it Forward Times which targeted the African American community and the Houston Tribune an ultra conservative paper Both papers had rather small circulations and no influence among the city s business community The two major newspapers in Houston never mentioned Steven for many years thereafter br br br J Howard Creekmore era br John J Jones left the Chronicle not long after Steven s ouster J Howard Creekmore president of the Houston Endowment took John Jones place at the Chronicle Everett D Collier replaced Steven as editor Collier remained in this position until his retirement in br J Howard Creekmore was born in Abilene Texas in His parents died while he was young so he was raised by his stepmother The family moved to Houston in Howard enrolled in Rice Institute where he graduated with degrees in history and English After graduation he went to work for Jesse Jones as a bookkeeper Jones took an interest in the young man s career and put him through law school Creekmore passed the bar exam in and returned to work for Jones He held several positions in the Jones business empire In he was named to the board of Houston Endowment and was promoted to president of the board in br By Creekmore had persuaded other directors of Houston Endowment to sell several business properties including the Chronicle Houston oilman John Mecom offered million for the newspaper its building a percent interest in Texas National Bank of Commerce and the historic Rice Hotel Early in Mecom encountered problems raising the additional cash to complete the transaction He then began lining up potential buyers for the newspaper which included non Houstonians such as Sam Newhouse Otis Chandler and the Scripps Howard organization Creekmore strongly believed that local persons should own the paper He insisted that Mecom pay the million debt immediately in cash Mecom cancelled his purchase agreement br In the Chronicle set a Texas newspaper circulation record br In the business pages which until then had been combined with sports became its own section of the newspaper Creekmore remained as publisher until Houston Endowment sold the paper to the Hearst Corporation br br br present Hearst Corporation era br On May the Hearst Corporation purchased the Houston Chronicle from Houston Endowment for million br Richard J V Johnson who had joined the paper as a copy editor in and worked up to executive vice president in and president in remained as chairman and publisher until he retired on April He was succeeded by Jack Sweeney br In the Chronicle switched to being a morning only paper With the demise of the Houston Post on April the next year the Chronicle became Houston s sole major daily newspaper br On October the paper endorsed Senator Barack Obama for President of the United States in the U S Presidential Election the first Democrat to be endorsed by the newspaper since when it endorsed Texan Lyndon B Johnson It endorsed Mitt Romney in but endorsed Hillary Clinton in and Joe Biden in br Locally the Chronicle endorsed Wendy Davis for governor in and Sylvester Turner for mayor in Additionally the Chronicle initially endorsed Jeb Bush for the Republican primary but did not endorse any other candidate after he dropped out br br br source fabrication scandal br In September then executive editor Nancy Barnes released a statement on the Chronicle s website notifying readers for the first time that the paper s Austin bureau chief Mike Ward had resigned and was the subject of an internal investigation after questions were raised by a staff member over fabricating sources Barnes opted not to disclose the source fabrication or Ward s resignation to Chronicle readers and the general public until she was contacted by reporters at other outlets pursuing a story about the Chronicle s scandal one full week after Ward had resigned By the time Barnes informed the public about what would turn into the biggest journalism scandal of it had already become one of the worst kept secrets in Austin among the capitol press corps that writes about Texas politicians The scandal had also become popular fodder among staffers who work at the capital Within minutes of being contacted by a freelance reporter for the Texas Observer Barnes hastily issued a press release announcing that one of her reporters bad been caught making up sources over the course of several years Barnes never explained why the Chronicle decided against being transparent to it readers immediately instead of waiting for word to leak to the extent that other news outlets started planning stories br The sources being questioned in Ward s reporting were the product of man on the street interviews from a story dealing with rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Harvey Barnes said Houston Chronicle researchers had problems finding a number of sources quoted in Ward s story so the newspaper hired investigative journalist David Wood a Pulitzer Prize winner br On November one day before Barnes left for a position as senior vice president of news at National Public Radio the Houston Chronicle released some of Wood s findings The paper announced it was retracting a total of eight stories br Barnes later went on to tell Columbia Journalism Review that the widespread fabrication apparent in Ward s articles was unprecedented in her experience I ve been an editor a long time and I have never seen anything like this period None of the Chronicle s editors responsible for overseeing Ward s stories including then managing editor Vernon Loeb assumed any responsibility for the fact that one of their reporters had been cheating for years under their noses In many instances over the course of years Loeb worked directly with Ward and even rewrote his stories for final publication br The Austin American Statesman where Ward worked as a reporter for years covering the state s political class prior to joining the Houston Chronicle in also conducted an internal review of his final years of work at the paper br A copy of the original story that led to the investigation has been removed from the Chronicle s website But Austin based NPR affiliate KUT interviewed Ward for the radio in the days after the story ran and still has the story posted on its website despite the fact that the sources used in Ward s reporting are suspected of being fake br br br Headquarters br br br Southwest Freeway br br On July the Chronicle announced that its Downtown employees were moving to the Loop campus at the intersection of the Loop and U S Route I Southwest Freeway br The facility previously used as the Houston Post headquarters will have a total of seven buildings with a total of over

one above In the Downtown facility the presses there were decommissioned in the late s The newsroom within the facility had bullpen style offices with a few private cubicles and offices on the edges The facility was connected to the downtown Houston tunnel system Turner wrote that in recent decades Texas Avenue offered viewers an architectural visage of unadorned boxiness An accretion of five buildings made into one it featured a maze of corridors cul de sacs and steps that seemed to spring on strollers at the most unexpected times br The facility which was years old in was originally four separate structures which were joined together to make one building Jesse H Jones erected the first Chronicle building a long narrow structure clad in granite on the corner of Travis Street and Texas

weeks following the September attacks the Houston Chronicle published a series of opinion articles by University of Texas journalism professor Robert Jensen that asserted the United States was just as guilty as the hijackers in committing acts of violence and compared that attack with the history of U S attacks on civilians in other countries The opinion piece resulted in hundreds of angry letters to the editor and reportedly over angry responses to Jensen br Among them were claims of insensitivity against the newspaper and of giving an unduly large audience to a position characterized as being extremist University of Texas president Larry Faulkner issued a response denouncing Jensen s as a fountain of undiluted foolishness on issues of public policy noting h e is not speaking in the

district most notably among Republicans who have voted for him before br Former Texas Secretary of State Jack Rains contacted the Chronicle s James Howard Gibbons alleging that the poll appeared to incorrectly count non Republican Primary voters in its sample Rains also asserted that Murray had a conflict of interest in the poll as Murray s son Keir was a political consultant working for Nick

publishing articles without properly adhering to its own ethics policy especially in regards to contacting subjects before publishing negative portrayals There were also claims suggesting retaliation against individuals for not purchasing advertisements This trust was further eroded in when the Chronicle retracted eight articles after it was revealed they were significantly based on sources whose existence could not be verified An extensive review of the articles penned by Austin bureau chief Mike Ward showed that out of individuals he quoted in various stories could not be located or confirmed Beyond the retractions an additional of Ward s stories required corrections due to the inclusion of unverified sources further tainting the paper s credibility This was a result of an
