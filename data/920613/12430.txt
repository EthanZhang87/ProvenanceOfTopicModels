The Game Boy Advance GBA is a bit handheld game console developed manufactured and marketed by Nintendo as the successor to the Game Boy Color It was released in Japan on March in North America on June in the PAL region on June and in mainland China as iQue Game Boy Advance on June br The GBA is part of the sixth generation of video game consoles The original model was followed in by the Game Boy Advance SP a redesigned model with a frontlit screen and clamshell form factor A newer revision of the SP with a backlit screen was released in A miniaturized redesign the Game Boy Micro was released in September br As of June million units of the Game Boy Advance series have been sold worldwide Its successor the Nintendo DS was released in November and is backward compatible with Game Boy Advance software br br When the original Game Boy was first introduced in many questioned why Nintendo had chosen to develop a monochrome handheld considering competitors like the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear boasted color screens However Nintendo s gamble paid off The rivals color displays while visually impressive were criticized for their poor battery life and bulky size The Game Boy in contrast offered superior portability and longevity propelling it to immense popularity Publicly Nintendo pledged to develop a color Game Boy only when technology addressed the limitations of existing color handhelds br Internally however a team led by Satoru Okada who played a key role in the original Game Boy s design was already experimenting with color displays Their early s prototype codenamed Project Atlantis featured a color screen and a powerful bit processor designed by Advanced RISC Machines ARM The team was not satisfied with the outcome and shelved further development by br However Nintendo was under pressure from other companies who were introducing next generation handhelds including the Neo Geo Pocket and WonderSwan To maintain consumer interest in the Game Boy the company decided to pair the color screen they had been testing for Project Atlantis with a faster version of the existing Game Boy s bit processor The Game Boy Color launched in br br Still under pressure from its competitors more technically advanced handhelds Nintendo quickly started developing a successor to the Game Boy Color with news of the project emerging at the Space World trade show in late August The project codenamed the Advanced Game Boy AGB would bring the bit processing power envisioned in Project Atlantis to market br Nintendo officially announced the Game Boy Advance on September revealing details about the system s specifications and teasing that the handheld would first be released in Japan in August with the North American and European launch dates slated for the end of the same year On August IGN showed images of a GBA development kit running a demonstrational port of Yoshi s Story and on August pre production images of the GBA were revealed in Famitsu magazine in Japan br Nintendo revealed the console to the public on August along with the Japanese and North American launch dates and launch games Unlike the Game Boy and Game Boy Color which have the portrait form factor designed by Gunpei Yokoi the Game Boy Advance has a landscape form factor putting the buttons to the sides of the device instead of below the screen It was designed by the French designer Gw na l Nicolas and his Tokyo based design studio Curiosity Inc br The GBA was then featured at Space World from August to alongside several peripherals for the system including the GBA Link cable the GameCube Game Boy Advance link cable a rechargeable battery pack for the system and an infrared communications adaptor which would allow systems to exchange data In March Nintendo revealed details about the system s North American launch including the suggested price of and the launch games Nintendo estimated that around new games would be released by the end of br br The Game Boy Advance uses a custom system on a chip SoC integrating the CPU and other major components into a single package named the CPU AGB by Nintendo and manufactured by the Sharp Corporation The CPU AGB contains two completely different CPUs the ARM TDMI running at a clock rate of megahertz MHz for Game Boy Advance games and the Sharp SM running at either MHz or MHz for backward compatibility with Game Boy and Game Boy Color games As such the console has two operating modes GBA mode using the ARM TDMI and the backward compatible CGB mode using the SM br The ARM TDMI is a bit processor developed by Advanced RISC Machines ARM that maximizes performance under power and storage constraints making it more suitable for use in a handheld device Like all processors using the ARM architecture the ARM TDMI uses a reduced instruction set computer RISC design with sixteen bit registers Although the console was marketed as a bit system to reduce costs Nintendo mixed bit and bit buses between the different modules within the CPU AGB As a result the majority of the console s memory is only accessible through a bit bus br The SM is a hybrid between two other bit processors the Intel and the Zilog Z The SM has the seven bit registers of the compared to on the Z but uses the Z s programming syntax and extra bit manipulation instructions Like the Game Boy Color the SM in the Advance could be commanded to operate at either MHz when playing games compatible with the original Game Boy or at MHz when playing games designed for the Game Boy Color The SoC also contains a KB bootstrap ROM which is used to start up the device in CGB mode br The CPU CGB incorporates an updated version of Nintendo s venerable Picture Processing Unit PPU which was used in the Game Boy Game Boy Color and Super Nintendo Entertainment System The PPU is essentially a basic GPU that renders visuals using kilobyte KB of Video RAM located inside the CPU CGB Inside the PPU itself is KB of object attribute memory and KB of palette RAM which are optimized for fast rendering The display itself is a inch diagonal thin film transistor TFT color liquid crystal display LCD measuring millimeters in wide by millimeters in high The screen is pixels wide by pixels high in a aspect ratio br Foreground objects are sprites with up to per frame sized from to pixels and with or colors Backgrounds can be rendered in one of six different modes The first three are the character modes which use traditional tile map graphics Mode offers four static layers Mode has three layers with one affine transformation layer which can be rotated and or scaled and Mode has two affine layers The other three are the bitmap modes which allow for rendering D geometry Mode has a single full sized fully colored colors frame Mode provides two full sized frames with colors each and Mode provides two half sized pixels fully colored frames Having two bitmaps allows page flipping to avoid the artifacts that can sometimes appear when re drawing a bitmap While the bitmap modes were considered cutting edge most games avoided using them because they cost a lot of CPU resources br For sound the Game Boy Advance features two PCM sample player channels which work in combination with the Audio Processing Unit APU a programmable sound generator first used by the legacy Game Boy The APU has four channels a pulse wave generation channel with frequency and volume variation a second pulse wave generation channel with only volume variation a wave channel that can reproduce any waveform recorded in RAM and a white noise channel with volume variation br The Game Boy Advance features a D pad directional pad and six action buttons labeled A B L R SELECT and START The top of the console has a link port that allows it to be connected to other Game Boy devices using a Game Link Cable or a Wireless Adapter or the GameCube home console with a special GameCube Game Boy Advance link cable br br The Game Boy Advance was available in numerous colors and limited editions throughout its production It was initially available in Arctic Black Orange Japan Only Fuchsia translucent pink Glacier translucent blue and Indigo Later in the system s lifespan additional colors and special editions were released including Red Clear Orange Black Platinum White Gold Japan Only Hello Kitty edition pink with Hello Kitty and logo on bezel The King of Fighters edition black with images on bezel and buttons Chobits edition translucent light blue with images on bezel and buttons Battle Network Rockman EXE light blue with images on bezel Mario Bros edition Glacier with Mario and Luigi on bezel and Yomiuri Giants edition Glacier with images on bezel br Several Pok mon themed limited edition systems were made available in Pok mon Center stores in Japan These editions include Gold Pok mon edition Gold with Pikachu and Pichu on bezel Suicune edition blue grey with greyscale Pikachu and Pichu on bezel and a Pok mon Center sticker on the back Celebi edition olive green with Celebi images on bezel and Latias Latios edition pink red and purple with images of Latias and Latios on bezel br br With hardware performance comparable to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System the Game Boy Advance represents progress for sprite based technology The system s library includes platformers SNES like role playing video games and games ported from various bit and bit systems of the previous generations This includes the Super Mario Advance series and the system s backward compatibility with all earlier Game Boy titles Though most GBA games primarily employ D graphics developers have ambitiously designed some D GBA games that push the limits of the hardware including first person shooters like a port of Doom racing games like V Rally and even platformers like Asterix Obelix XXL br Some cartridges are colored to resemble the game usually for the Pok mon series Pok mon Emerald for example being a clear emerald green Others have special built in features including rumble features Drill Dozer tilt sensors WarioWare Twisted Yoshi s Universal Gravitation and solar sensors Boktai br In Japan the final game to be released on the system was Final Fantasy VI Advance on November which was also the final game published by Nintendo on the system In North America the last game for the system was Samurai Deeper Kyo released on February In Europe the last game for the system is The Legend of Spyro The Eternal Night released on November The Japan only Rhythm Tengoku the first game in what would eventually become known outside Japan as the Rhythm Heaven Rhythm Paradise series is the final first party developed game for the system released on August br br An add on for the GameCube known as the Game Boy Player was released in as the successor to the Super Game Boy peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System This add on allows Game Boy Advance Game Boy and Game Boy Color games to be played on the GameCube However some games may have compatibility issues due to certain features requiring extra hardware for instance WarioWare Twisted would require the console to be rotated manually due to its nature as a tilt sensor game br The GBA is the last Nintendo handheld system to bear the Game Boy name Games developed for it are incompatible with older Game Boy systems and each game s box carries a label indicating that the game is not compatible with other Game Boy systems Conversely games designed for older Game Boy systems are compatible with the Game Boy Advance with options to play such games on either their standard aspect ratios or a stretched fullscreen br Game Boy Advance cartridges are compatible with Nintendo DS models that support them with a dedicated GBA cartridge slot beneath the touch screen specifically the original model and the Nintendo DS Lite although they do not support multiplayer or features involving the use of GBA accessories due to the absence of the GBA s external peripheral port on the DS They can also be used to unlock original content found in Nintendo DS games The Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL lack a GBA cartridge slot and therefore do not support backward compatibility with the GBA br br Since the Game Boy Advance was discontinued many of its games have been re released via digital distribution on later Nintendo consoles mainly in the form of emulation As part of an Ambassador Program for early adopters of the Nintendo DS system ten GBA games along with ten Nintendo Entertainment System games were made available free for players who bought a DS system before the price drop on August Unlike other Virtual Console games for the system features such as the Home menu or save states are missing since the games are running natively instead of via emulation In January Nintendo President Satoru Iwata announced that Game Boy Advance games would be released on the Wii U s Virtual Console in April The first set of GBA games including Advance Wars Metroid Fusion and Mario Luigi Superstar Saga were released on April All Virtual Console releases are single player only as they do not emulate multiplayer features enabled by Game Link cables br In February Nintendo added Game Boy Advance games to its Nintendo Switch Online service exclusively to those with the Expansion Pack tier For the first time players are able to play multiplayer games in their emulated form online This application emulates the Game Boy Player meaning that games that support GameCube controller rumble work with the vibration of the Switch controllers br br Nintendo released various addons for the Game Boy Advance which include br br Wireless Adapter Released in this adapter hooks up to the back of the Game Boy Advance It replaces link cables and allows many people to link together It was marketed for US equivalent to in and came included with Pok mon FireRed and LeafGreen Because it was released so late in the Game Boy Advance s life fewer than games support this hardware A special version was released for the Game Boy Micro which has full compatibility with other models br Game Boy Advance Infra Red Adapter This adapter is only compatible with Cyberdrive Zoids and was not sold separately It is not compatible with the Game Boy Micro br GameCube Game Boy Advance link cable Used to connect the Game Boy Advance to the GameCube for interoperability between corresponding games such as are Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Pac Man Vs and The Legend of Zelda Four Swords Adventures The cable also enables using the handheld as a controller for select games br Play Yan The Play Yan is an MP MPEG player for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS The cartridge is slightly broader than a normal Game Boy Advance cartridge and includes a built in headphone port as well as an SD card slot Music or videos that users have downloaded from the Internet can be transferred onto an SD card and slotted into the Play Yan device Nintendo released several mini games for the Play Yan that could be downloaded from their website although this functionality was later removed through a firmware update The Play Yan was initially available in Japan only but was released in Europe as the Nintendo MP Player on December with the MPEG functionality removed The Play Yan was never released in North America br e Reader The e Reader is a scanning device that plugs into the game cartridge slot of the Game Boy Advance It was released in Japan in December and North America in September Specialized cards with codes along the side and bottom are slid through the slot scanning the card into the Game Boy Advance e Reader cards include classic games like Donkey Kong and Excitebike that can be scanned for play on the handheld Other cards were released that unlock in game content in compatible GBA titles such as Super Mario Advance Super Mario Bros and Pok mon Ruby and Sapphire and in GameCube games like Animal Crossing The Pok mon Trading Card Game playing cards also adopt the e Reader codes The e Reader works with the Game Boy Player and Game Boy Advance SP but cannot fit into the Nintendo DS s Game Boy slot however it can fit into the Nintendo DS Lite s Game Boy slot br Game Boy Advance Video First released in North America in May these cartridges included two episodes of thirty minute cartoon programs such as Dragon Ball GT Pok mon SpongeBob SquarePants Sonic X Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Yu Gi Oh Three feature length movies Shrek Shrek and Shark Tale were also released for the format These cartridges display an error when inserted into a GameCube via a Game Boy Player to prevent users from attempting to record the episodes onto other media br Mobile System GB Connects the console to a mobile phone for remote play It was released in Japan and was compatible with Pok mon Crystal br br Other accessories for the Game Boy Advance include br br Afterburner The Afterburner is an internal front lighting system manufactured by Triton Labs and released in mid The installation consists of disassembling the system removing some plastic from the interior of the case attaching the lighting mechanism to the screen and soldering two wires to the motherboard for power Optionally a potentiometer or an integrated circuit could be added to allow adjusting the brightness of the light When the initial version of the Game Boy Advance SP was released it included a very similar integrated lighting system This was replaced in the subsequent version of the Game Boy Advance SP with a backlit display According to Triton Labs the Afterburner achieved considerable success during the lifespan of the GBA with many gamers buying it Though the kit voids the system s warranty the company had minor trouble keeping up with demand for the accessory during the holiday season br WormCam This camera by Nyko attaches to the top of the Game Boy Advance and connects to the link port The snapshots can then be uploaded to a computer with the USB cable and software br Glucoboy This is a blood glucose monitor with built in games released in Australia in for children with diabetes br br In early Nintendo introduced a new form factor for the handheld known as the Game Boy Advance SP model AGS The redesigned unit features a clamshell design that resembles a pocket size laptop computer including a folding case approximately one half the size of the original unit It has a rechargeable lithium ion battery a significantly brighter LCD screen and an internal front light that can be toggled on and off The redesign was intended to address some common complaints about the original Game Boy Advance which had been criticized for being somewhat uncomfortable to use especially due to a dark screen br br On September Nintendo released a new version of the SP model AGS that features a brighter backlit display The switch that controls the backlight now toggles between two brightness levels br br In September Nintendo released a second redesign of the Game Boy Advance This model dubbed the Game Boy Micro is similar in style to the original Game Boy Advance s horizontal orientation but is much smaller and sleeker The Game Boy Micro allows the user to switch between several colored faceplates to allow customization a feature which Nintendo advertised heavily around the Game Boy Micro s launch Nintendo also hoped that this fashion feature would help target audiences outside of typical video game players Unlike the previous Game Boy Advance models the Game Boy Micro is unable to support Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles The Game Boy Micro did not make much of an impact in the video game market as it was overshadowed by the Nintendo DS which also played Game Boy Advance games through the GBA cartridge slot br br Upon its North American release IGN praised the Game Boy Advance s graphical capabilities and battery life but criticized the system s shoulder button placement and noted the system s high price tag which may be a tad bit too high to swallow ultimately scoring the system with an out of They also pointed out the system s lack of a backlight which occasionally got in the way of playing games br ABC News praised the Game Boy Advance s graphics grip and larger screen stating that You ve never had as much fun playing old games br Reviewing for CNET Darren Gladstone scored the system with a out of praising its graphical performance and backward compatibility but being considerably critical of the system s lack of a backlit screen noting that it makes it nearly impossible to play in normal lighting conditions Gladstone ultimately recommended the sleeker and backlit Game Boy Advance SP instead despite noting that the cheaper price of the original model may appeal to gamers on a lower budget br ROM hacks fan games and Homebrew games are developed for the GBA br br Nintendo hoped to sell million Game Boy Advance units by the end of March with the system s Japanese debut and anticipated sales of million units before the end of many marketing analysts believed this to be a realistic goal due to the company s lack of major competition in the handheld video game market Within the first week of its North American launch in June the Game Boy Advance sold units making it the fastest selling video game console in the United States at the time In response to strong sales Nintendo ordered units to ship to retail stores hoping to ship another half million of them by the end of June The Game Boy Advance also became the fastest selling system in the United Kingdom selling units in its first week of release and beating the PlayStation s previous record of units In the system s sales in the United Kingdom surpassed one million units br On December Nintendo of America released launch to date information indicating that the company had sold million units of the Game Boy Advance series in the United States In a Kotaku article published on January Nintendo revealed that the Game Boy Advance series had sold million units in the United States as of January As of December million units of the Game Boy Advance series have been sold worldwide million of which are Game Boy Advance SP units and million of which are Game Boy Micro units br br Visteon Dockable Entertainment br br Official website archived br Game Boy Advance at Nintendo com archived versions at the Internet Archive Wayback
