The Ford Windstar later the Ford Freestar and Mercury Monterey is a minivan that was produced and sold by Ford The replacement for the Ford Aerostar the Windstar adopted the front wheel drive configuration of the Chrysler minivans From the to model years three generations of the model line were sold with the final generation renamed as the Ford Freestar br Unrelated to the Nissan developed Mercury Villager the Windstar was marketed without a Lincoln Mercury counterpart As part of the launch of the Ford Freestar Mercury introduced its first Ford produced minivan in a revival of the Mercury Monterey nameplate br Following a decline in sales across the minivan segment in the mid s the Freestar and Monterey were discontinued after the model year with no direct replacement In North America the model line was functionally matched by the passenger Ford Taurus X wagon CUV in Mexico the Freestar was replaced by the Ford Transit Tourneo In Ford reentered the segment as the Ford Transit Connect compact MPV gained passenger seating in North America br During its production the Ford Windstar Freestar and the Mercury Monterey were sourced from Oakville Assembly Oakville Ontario In total were produced Windstars Freestars and Montereys br br In Ford launched the Aerostar minivan with some degree of success while it outsold the Chevrolet Astro GMC Safari Volkswagen Vanagon and its Japanese competition it consistently remained in second place in terms of sales in the minivan segment To better compete with Chrysler Ford decided its next minivan would adopt the same front wheel drive layout popularized by Chrysler br Codenamed WIN development of the front wheel drive minivan commenced in with a projected introduction for the model year By design work was well underway with a concept design theme being settled on by December In the WIN exterior design by Camilo Pardo was frozen for scheduled production with prototypes being tested from early Trademarks were filed for the Windstar name at the USPTO on April with development ending in br While developed by the Ford truck division the designers of the Aerostar and Econoline Club Wagon the Windstar was designed predominantly by a women led engineering and design team Intended nearly exclusively for family use the design team considered design scenarios from the perspective of pregnant women women wearing skirts and high heels and adopted family friendly design features reconfigurable cupholders auxiliary stereo controls br br The Ford Windstar was released in March as a model preceding the launch of the third generation Chrysler minivans by over a year enabling Ford to cut into Chrysler minivan sales significantly While the competing model lines roughly benchmarked each other the Windstar was sold only as an equivalent to the long wheelbase Grand Chrysler vans with Lincoln Mercury selling the smaller unrelated Mercury Villager jointly developed with Nissan br From the to model years the Windstar was sold concurrently with its Ford Aerostar predecessor initially slated for discontinuation following the model year continued consumer and dealer demand for the Aerostar led Ford to market both vehicles For its first year on the market the Windstar was priced above both the Aerostar and the Mercury Villager By however the Villager s base price had surpassed the Windstar s by several hundred dollars and top of the line Villager Nautica models were priced some USD higher br In what would later become a design faux pas this generation of the model line was marketed without a driver side sliding door a feature popularized by the introduction of third generation Chrysler minivans During its development Ford claimed its focus groups did not identify it as an important feature previously vans of all sizes with a driver side sliding door had sold poorly in the United States br The Windstar was the first North American built van to be exported to Europe and sold through the official Ford Europe sales channel It was slotted above the Ford Galaxy in size and equipment level The sole powertrain was the L V engine and automatic transmission with no diesel engine nor manual transmission available As it wasn t available in right hand drive form and with left side sliding door it was not sold in the United Kingdom Ireland and other left hand rule of road countries br br The first generation Ford Windstar is codenamed WIN sharing the front wheel drive DN platform with the first generation Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable Using a inch wheelbase nearly inches longer than the Taurus the Windstar replaced the integrated frame rail design of the Aerostar with full unibody construction The front suspension used MacPherson struts while the rear suspension was a beam axle using coil springs air suspension was an option br Front brakes were discs with rear drum brakes anti lock braking was standard In four wheel disc brakes were introduced as an option when ordered with traction control or the towing package In contrast to the Aerostar inch wheels were fitted to the first generation Windstar except the Limited br br The Windstar shared its powertrains with the Ford Taurus Mercury Sable For its launch the L V was the sole engine in GL and LX Models producing hp a hp L V was introduced as the standard engine in October for base and lower GL models For the L V saw its output increased to hp br br To compete more closely with the Chrysler minivans Ford designers shifted from a one box design to a two box configuration influenced somewhat by the Mercury Villager the Windstar had a distinct hoodline and passenger compartment Benchmarked in size against the long wheelbase Grand Chrysler minivans the Windstar was given a longer wheelbase than the Aerostar and both the second and third generation Chrysler minivans only a long wheelbase version was marketed br In what would be a preview of the Ford Taurus the Windstar was designed with an oval rear window though adopting several design elements of the Mercury Villager Nissan Quest While far more vertically oriented the curved dashboard of the Windstar shares influences of the multi tiered design used by the Lincoln Mark VIII br For and there were no exterior changes except the base trim model renamed the L br The GL did however get the option of Quad Command Bucket Seats which was coupled with alloy wheels and a premium audio system Most dealers marketed it as a GLX model The Quad Command Seating changed the seats from the high back buckets in the front to the low back bucket seats br Traction control was also available on upper end GL Models br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The first generation Windstar underwent few revisions during its production After a shortened model year lasting from October to January the Windstar was introduced Coinciding with a mid cycle revision to compete with the introduction of driver side sliding doors Ford widened the driver side door and added an optional tilting sliding driver seat br The front fascia underwent a facelift adopting a trapezoidal grille and redesigned headlamps with amber turn signal lenses the optional fog lamps were moved out of the lower intake of the grille The rear saw mild revisions with revised tailgate badging with larger model script and the centering of the Ford Blue Oval over the license plate On all trim levels new wheel covers and alloy wheel designs were introduced the body side moldings were restyled the GL and LX Limited models featured specific bodyside moldings br The interior saw a minor revision coinciding with the addition of the tilt slide driver s seat the power vent switches were moved to the driver s door and an intermittent wipe was added for the rear wiper while the dashboard remained unchanged head restraints were added to the rear bench seats already on rear bucket seats Largely to make up for the retirement of the Aerostar Eddie Bauer a Northwoods appearance package was offered for the GL and LX offering leather LX or cloth vinyl GL seats gold trimmed wheels and luggage rack and a unique two tone exterior and bodyside moldings br br While adopting the front wheel drive form factor similar to the Chrysler minivans the Windstar adopted several design features from the Ford Aerostar and Mercury Villager including rear seat audio controls rear air conditioning and middle row bucket seats a digital instrument panel was coupled with a trip computer automatic headlamps and an auto dimming rearview mirror Shared with Ford sedans the Windstar offered a keyless entry system using a door mounted keypad along with an alarm system br In contrast to its lack of a driver side sliding door the Windstar introduced several features to the minivan segment including a door lock control from the rear door unless with the family security package the rear button was omitted and a wide angle mirror in the overhead console allowing a view of the rear passenger compartment br br In line with the Aerostar and the Econoline Club Wagon the Windstar was sold as both a passenger van and as a cargo van In place of using the XL XLT nomenclature used by Ford trucks and vans the Windstar adopted the model nomenclature used by the majority of the Ford car lineup For retail sales the base trim Windstar was the GL with the Windstar LX as the flagship model br For the Limited trim was introduced distinguished by its monochromatic exterior and five spoke inch chrome wheels wood interior trim was added Slotted above both the LX and the Mercury Villager LS the Windstar was offered with all optional features from the LX as standard br br Cargo Van br Windstar br Windstar L replaced unnamed base model and included

rating from the IIHS in all marks in which the driver survives the accident without any injuries br It was marketed as the Safest minivan on the market br br During and after its production this generation of the Windstar would become known for several notable reliability issues The L V Essex engine in models was susceptible to head gasket failure as it was in its Taurus and Sable stablemates However the Windstar s problem was a cast iron block with aluminum heads coupled with higher loads than the Taurus the van being pounds heavier In response Ford extended the warranty on the head gasket to miles on most Windstars with this engine The L V Vulcan engine was not susceptible to head gasket failure as it was a completely different engine design br The Windstar was paired with an AX S transaxle which was prone to internal failure The transmission suffered from cracked forward and reverse clutch pistons These transmission failures were most susceptible with the L engine as the transmission could not handle the extra torque and the extra vehicle weight br br The Windstar was also plagued with various suspension woes Due to the heft of the overall vehicle the tierod ends required constant replacement The front springs were prone to breaking Covered under safety recall in specific markets where extreme cold and heavy salt use in winter months occurred br br Released in the summer of as an early model the Ford Windstar was given a complete redesign As one of the first Ford vehicles in North America to adopt the New Edge styling language the redesign also was distinguished by the addition of a driver s side sliding door br While retaining mechanical commonality with the Taurus Sable Ford shifted the Windstar to a dedicated chassis architecture introducing the Ford V platform Several major features made their debut including front seat mounted side airbags on vans with VINs starting with FMDA dual power sliding doors and rear reverse sensors br br The Limited model returned as the most luxurious model A VCR based rear seat entertainment system featuring a flip down LCD screen was a new option on SE SEL and Limited models br Slight cosmetic changes were made to front and rear fascias for LX became the base model and a new SE Sport model joined the lineup The smaller L was gone leaving the L as the sole engine choice Models with nd row bucket seats now got their own center console Front seat side airbags became standard on Limiteds The chrome grille on the SE and SEL models was redesigned The steering wheel was updated to a more modern style with the blue Ford Logo placed in the center The transmission was updated to the F N br Dual sliding doors became standard on all models br The Windstar was the most dependable minivan on the market in the JD Powers dependability survey at three years in service in the survey The Windstar beat out the Toyota Sienna and the Honda Odyssey for these honors br br The last year of the Windstar no major changes were made in anticipation of a redesign In a new marketing strategy the upcoming third generation Windstar was rebranded as the Ford Freestar The last Ford Windstar was produced on July br br In Ford began a shift in trim levels that would be seen in many of its American market sedans through the s In place of the GL the LX was the new base model with the SE and SEL making their debut as the highest trim levels respectively br Although all versions of the Windstar wagon were sold with passenger seating LX trim Windstars are equipped with nd row bench seats SE and SEL trim examples are equipped with nd row bucket seats br br Cargo Van br base Included passenger seating air conditioning power mirrors power doors power locks and windows with automatic driver s side window

AM FM radio with in dash disc CD player and clock leather wrapped steering wheel trailer tow package floor mats and heated mirrors br br In August Ford issued a voluntary recall of Windstar minivans for rear axle problems This recall followed an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which had begun in May The NHTSA preliminary evaluation stated the design of the rear axle beam an inverted U channel design appeared to provide a collection point for road slurry In states which used much road salt corrosion progressively weakened the axle until it fractured The states covered by the recall were Connecticut Delaware Illinois Indiana Iowa Kentucky Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Missouri New Hampshire New Jersey New York Ohio Pennsylvania Rhode Island Utah Vermont West Virginia and Wisconsin as well as Washington D C In May of the minivans from Virginia were added to the axle recall bringing the overall total to more than vehicles between the U S and Canada br A class action lawsuit was filed against Ford Motor Company in May proceeding Ford s recall This lawsuit was filed by Plaintiff Aaron Martin against Defendant Ford Motor Company In this lawsuit documents were introduced which showed Ford s testing of the Benteler Axle in March resulted in failure of two out of the eleven axles tested In August Ford determined the cause of this failure was improper heat treating In September the axle manufacturer Bentley Automotive agreed with Ford s findings In October Ford s internal documents show lab testing proved the axle life could be doubled by heat treating but would require initial retooling cost and result in piece cost increase No changes were made until March br br In March the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Ford announced another Ford Windstar recall over corrosion concerns of the model year Windstar vans originally sold or currently registered in some cold weather states are part of the recall The problem involves rusting of the subframe Most of the corrosion occurs on the passenger side of the subframe If the subframe collapses while driving the vehicle could potentially lose all steering control and end up in an accident According to the NHTSA action PE some Ford Windstar owners had their drive axle detach from the transmission Ford is offering alternative transportation to owners if their vehicle is unsafe to drive If the minivan can t be repaired Ford will repurchase the vehicle br br The Ford Windstar received an Acceptable rating by the IIHS for fair structural performance moderate injuries to the left foot and fair dummy control Although most redesigned vehicles outperform their predecessors to cut down insurance costs and possible injuries to the driver this generation Windstar did not perform as well as its first generation predecessor The NHTSA graded the minivan an overall rating of stars in both the frontal and side impact tests br br For the model year the third generation Ford Windstar was released as part of a mid s rebranding of the Ford car model line with nameplates starting with the letter F the Windstar was renamed the Ford Freestar br Sharing the MV platform with the Ford Windstar the primary initiative of the million redesign focused on driveline reliability an issue that had plagued the Windstar since its introduction In its development the Freestar saw the addition of heavier duty drive axles larger wheel bearings and the standardization of four wheel disc brakes The L and L V engines were both retired in favor of two new engines In the United States only the Freestar was powered by a hp L V shared with the Ford Mustang while an optional hp L V the base engine of the Ford E was standard for Canada and export vans The L and L V engines were both enlarged versions of the long running L V As part of the initiative to improve driveline reliability the speed automatic transmission saw upgrades for improved shifting and reliability br Despite that transmission failures were still common NHTSA launched an investigation into the and Freestar and Monterey due to numerous complaints with regard to the equipped F N transmission Although the investigation is centered on the torque converter specifically the failure of the torque converter spline shaft these failures often required the entire transaxle be rebuilt or replaced Ford later recalled and Freestars and Montereys to have the torque converter replaced free of charge although models still suffered from torque converter problems despite not being recalled br In the redesign the Ford Freestar saw a minor exterior facelift While retaining much of the roofline of the previous generation Windstar in a shift away from New Edge design language the Freestar adopted styling elements from several Ford vehicles including the Ford Explorer Ford Freestyle and Ford Five Hundred Shifting from the trademark curved dashboard of the previous Ford Windstar the Ford Freestar adopted a flat dashboard sharing many design elements with the then upcoming Ford Five Hundred In line with a number of competitive minivans the Ford Freestar introduced a third row seat that folded flat into the floor br br The Freestar carried much of the trim lineup from the Windstar with two exceptions The LX and Sport trim levels were dropped in favor of the SES and S trims br br S and Included cloth upholstery L V engine steel rims with hubcaps keyless entry an AM FM stereo power locks power windows with automatic driver s side window adjustable pedals power points and manual sliding doors br SE Included L V engine three row seating rear air conditioning on and models an AM FM radio with single CD player and digital clock and four speakers

sensitive volume and rear audio controls analog clock turn signal mirrors cornering lamps message center power sliding doors automatic climate control and alloy rims later clad alloy rims br br The Ford Freestar received an Good rating in the offset frontal crash test from the IIHS and outperformed the Ford Windstar but resulted in moderate injuries only on the head and neck In the side impact tests it received a Poor rating without the optional side airbags for poor structural performance potential head and neck injuries and high forces on the driver s torso but fared better with the side airbags earning an overall Acceptable rating but resulted in a moderate head and neck injury to the driver br br In the Freestar scored second place in J D Power s Vehicle Dependability Study behind the Dodge Caravan br br For the model year the Ford Windstar Freestar gained a Mercury counterpart with the introduction of the Mercury Monterey replacing the Mercury Villager In line with Ford introducing F nameplates during the early s Mercury revived a historic M nameplate for its minivan the Monterey name was used from to In line with the Freestar the Monterey adopted design elements from other Mercury vehicles including the Mountaineer and Montego Larger than the Villager it was marketed as a competitor to the Buick Terraza which replaced the Oldsmobile Silhouette and the Chrysler Town Country br In line with the later Mariner Milan and Montego three trim levels were offered for the Monterey Convenience Luxury and Premier Features such as power sliding doors and a rear seat DVD player were available on Luxury and Premier trim lines Unique to the Premier was the option of heated and cooled front seats a class exclusive at the time The Monterey was offered solely with the L V engine br Sales of the Monterey fell far under projections driven primarily by an overall decline of the minivan segment in North America In total examples were sold over its three year production run br br After selling far under sales projections Ford discontinued the Freestar and Monterey after the model year The final Monterey was produced by Oakville Assembly on August the final Freestar was produced on December br In Mexico and export markets Ford largely replaced the Freestar by the V Ford Transit Tourneo front wheel drive In North America Ford became the first American manufacturer to withdraw from the minivan segment entirely with Ford shifting towards crossover wagons with the Ford Taurus X Freestyle marketed as a passenger vehicle by Ford in the Taurus X was replaced by the Flex and Explorer br For Ford began imports of the Ford Transit Connect compact MPV While imported in passenger van configuration most sales were intended for cargo van users As part of a redesign the Transit Connect gained a passenger configuration though offered with a inch wheelbase nearly identical to the Windstar Freestar Monterey most other dimensions of the second generation Transit Connect LWB more closely match the extended length Aerostar in size br br Ford Freestar Limited review by CanadianDriver br Ford Freestar review and rating by Consumer Guide
