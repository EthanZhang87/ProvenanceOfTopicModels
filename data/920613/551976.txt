The Volkswagen Type is a forward control light commercial vehicle introduced in by the German automaker Volkswagen as its second car model Known officially depending on body type as the Transporter Kombi or Microbus or informally as the Volkswagen Station Wagon US Bus also US Camper UK or Bulli Germany it was given the factory designation Type as it followed and was initially derived from Volkswagen s first model the Type Beetle br As one of the forerunners of the modern cargo and passenger vans the Type gave rise to forward control competitors in the United States in the s including the Ford Econoline the Dodge A and the Chevrolet Corvair Corvan the latter adapting the rear engine configuration of the Corvair car in the same manner in which the VW Type adapted the Type layout br European competition included the Citro n H Van the Renault Estafette both FF layout the semi forward control Bedford CA and the FR layout Ford Transit Japanese manufacturers also introduced similar vehicles such as the Nissan Caravan Toyota LiteAce and Subaru Sambar Like the Beetle the van has received numerous nicknames worldwide including the microbus minibus and because of its popularity during the counterculture movement of the s Hippie van bus br Brazil contained the last factory in the world that produced the T series of Type which ceased production on December due to the introduction of more stringent safety regulations in the country This after the termination of its T successor in South Africa marked the end of the era of rear engine Volkswagens which originated in with their Type prototypes br br The concept for the Type is credited to Dutch Volkswagen importer Ben Pon It has similarities in concept to the s Rumpler Tropfenwagen and s Dymaxion car by Buckminster Fuller neither of which reached production Pon visited Wolfsburg in intending to purchase Type s for import to the Netherlands where he saw a Plattenwagen an improvised parts mover based on the Type chassis and realized something better was possible using the stock Type pan He first sketched the van in a doodle dated April proposing a payload of kg lb and placing the driver at the very front The sketch is now in the Rijksmuseum Production would have to wait however as the factory was at capacity producing the Type br When capacity freed up a prototype known internally as the Type was produced in a short three months The stock Type pan proved to be too weak so the prototype used a ladder chassis with unit body construction Coincidentally the wheelbase was the same as the Type s Engineers reused the reduction gear from the Type enabling the ton van to use a hp kW flat four engine br Although the aerodynamics of the first prototypes were poor with an initial drag coefficient of Cd engineers used the wind tunnel at the Technical University of Braunschweig to optimize the design Simple changes such as splitting the windshield and roofline into a vee helped the production Type achieve Cd exceeding the Type s Cd Volkswagen s new chief executive officer Heinz Nordhoff appointed January approved the van for production on May and the first production model now designated Type rolled off the assembly line to debut November Only two models were offered the Kombi with two side windows and middle and rear seats that were easily removable by one person and the Commercial The Microbus was added in May joined by the Deluxe Microbus in June In all Type s were produced in their first year of production br An ambulance model was added in December which repositioned the fuel tank in front of the transaxle put the spare tire behind the front seat and added a tailgate style rear door These features became standard on the Type from to Type s were built in the model year br These were joined by a single cab pickup in August and it changed the least of the Type s until all were heavily modified in br br Unlike other rear engine Volkswagens which evolved constantly over time but never saw the introduction of all new models the Transporter not only evolved but was completely revised periodically with variations retrospectively referred to as versions T to T a nomenclature only invented after the introduction of the front drive T which replaced the T However only generations T to T can be seen as directly related to the Beetle see below for details br The Type along with the Citro n TUB and the Citro n H Van are among the first forward control vans in which the driver was placed above the front roadwheels They started a trend in Europe where the GM Bedford CA RAF Renault Estafette BMC Morris J and Commer FC also used the concept In the United States the Corvair based Chevrolet Corvan cargo van and Greenbrier passenger van adopted the use of the rear engine layout of the Corvair car in the same manner that the Type had used the rear engine layout of the Type using the Corvair s horizontally opposed cylinder air cooled engine for power Except for the Greenbrier various s s Fiat minivans and the Mazda Bongo the Type remained unique in being rear engined This was a disadvantage for the early barndoor Panel Vans which could not easily be loaded from the rear because the engine cover intruded on interior space but generally advantageous in traction and interior noise The Corvair pickup used a folding side panel that functioned as a ramp into the bed when opened and was called the Rampside The VW pickup in both single and double cab versions had a bed floor that was flat from front to back at the height of the engine compartment cover which had the advantage of a flat load floor but at a greater height while the Corvair pickup bed floor stepped down in front of the engine compartment to a much lower load floor which worked well with the unique Rampside configuration for loading br Decades after production of the Type ended Volkswagen announced in that they would be bringing an electric VW microbus out based on the new MEB platform in br br The Type was available as a br br Panel van a delivery van without side windows or rear seats br Double door Panel Van a delivery van without side windows or rear seats and cargo doors on both sides br High Roof Panel Van German Hochdach a delivery van with raised roof br Kombi from German Kombinationskraftwagen combination motor vehicle with side windows and removable rear seats both a passenger and a cargo vehicle combined br Bus also called a Volkswagen Caravelle a van with more comfortable interior reminiscent of passenger cars since the third generation br Lota o share taxi a version exclusive to Brazil with front hinged doors for the passenger area and bench seats catering to the supplemental public transport segment Available from to in both the split window and clipper fitted with the bay window front panel bodystyles br Samba Bus a van with skylight windows and cloth sunroof first generation only also known as a Deluxe Microbus They were marketed for touring the Alps br Flatbed pickup truck or Single Cab also available with wider load bed br Crew cab pick up a flatbed truck with extended cab and two rows of seats also called a Doka from German Doppelkabine br Westfalia camping van Westy with Westfalia roof and interior Included optional pop up top br Adventurewagen camping van with high roof and camping units from Adventurewagen br Semi camping van that can also still be used as a passenger car and transporter sacrificing some camping comforts Multivan or Weekender available from the third generation on br Apart from these factory variants there were a multitude of third party conversions available some of which were offered through Volkswagen dealers They included but were not limited to refrigerated vans hearses ambulances police vans fire engines and ladder trucks and camping van conversions by companies other than Westfalia There were even Klv rail going draisines built for Deutsche Bundesbahn in br In South Africa it is known as a well loved variation of the ice cream van first second and third generations br br The first generation of the Volkswagen Type with the split windshield informally called the Microbus Splitscreen or Splittie among modern fans was produced from March through the end of the model year From to the T not called that at the time was built in Wolfsburg from it was built at the completely new Transporter factory in Hanover Like the Beetle the first Transporters used the Volkswagen air cooled engine a cc cu in DIN rated kW PS bhp air cooled flat four cylinder boxer engine mounted in the rear This was upgraded to the a cc cu in kW PS bhp in A higher compression ratio became standard in while an unusual early version of the kW PS bhp engine debuted exclusively on the Type in Any models that retain that early engine today are rare Since the engine was discontinued almost immediately no spare parts were made available br The early versions of the T until were often called the Barndoor retrospectively called T a since the s owing to the enormous rear engine cover while the later versions with a slightly modified body the roofline above the windshield is extended smaller engine bay and roadwheels instead of the original ones are nowadays called the T b again only called this since the s based on VW s retrospective T etc naming system From the model year when the rear door was made wider same as on the bay window or T the vehicle could be referred to as the T c That year also saw the introduction of an optional sliding door for the passenger cargo area instead of the outwardly hinged doors typical of cargo vans br In a heavy duty Transporter was introduced as a factory option It featured a cargo capacity of kg lb instead of the previous kg lb smaller but wider roadwheels and a L kW PS bhp DIN engine This was so successful that only a year later the kg L Transporter was discontinued The model year introduced the engine cc cu in as standard equipment to the US market at kW PS bhp DIN with an mm in bore mm in stroke and compression ratio When the Beetle received the L engine for the model year its power was increased to kW PS bhp DIN br German production stopped after the model year however the T still was made in Brazil until when it was modified with a T style front end and big vintage taillights into the so called T and produced until The Brazilian T s were not identical to the last German models the T was locally produced in Brazil using the s and s era stamping dies to cut down on retooling alongside the Beetle Fusca where the pre body style was retained though they sported some characteristic features of the T a such as the cargo doors and five stud mm in Pitch Circle Diameter rims Wheel tracks varied between German and Brazilian production and with inch inch and inch wheel variants but commonly front track varied from mm to mm and rear track from mm to mm br br Among American enthusiasts it is common to refer to the different models by the number of their windows The basic Kombi or Bus is the window a k a three window bus because of three side windows with a split windshield two front cabin door windows six rear side windows and one rear window The DeLuxe model featured eight rear side windows and two rear corner windows making it the window not available in Europe Meanwhile the sunroof DeLuxe with its additional eight small skylight windows is accordingly the window From the model year with its wider rear door the rear corner windows were discontinued making the latter two the window and window respectively The and later window variants each carry the nickname Samba or in Australia officially Alpine br br The Volkswagen Samba officially the Kleinbus Sonderausf hrung small bus special version and marketed as the Microbus Deluxe and Sunroof Deluxe in the United States was the most luxurious version of the T Volkswagen started producing Sambas in in the name in the home market was changed to Sondermodell special model the precise origin of the Samba nickname is unclear sources refer to samba cars special train cars for dancing used by the Bundesbahn in the s while others suggest that it is an abbreviation for either Sonder Ausf hrung mit besonderer Ausstattung special version with special equipment or for Sonnendach Ausf hrung mit besonderem Armaturenbrett sunroof version with special dashboard The Samba name first appeared in official literature in Dutch price lists br In the US Volkswagen vans were informally identified by the window count This particular model had and later windows including eight high windows in the roof The window variant also had curved windows in the rear corners br The Samba had bi parting doors in lieu of a sliding door and could be ordered with a large fabric sunroof Volkswagen advertised the Samba for making tourist trips through the Alps br Standard paint finishes on the Samba were two tone usually with the upper bodywork in white The lower bodywork carried a contrasting color the areas separated by a decorative strip The roof carried slightly forward of the windshield at the front creating an integral visor The windows had chrome tables and the van had a more comprehensive dashboard than the normal T br When Volkswagen started producing the successor of the T the T the company also stopped producing the Samba ending the Samba and the concept of a van with such a high window count br br Certain models of the Volkswagen Type played a role in a historic episode during the early s known as the Chicken War France and West Germany had placed tariffs on imports of US chicken Diplomacy failed and in January two months after taking office President Johnson imposed a tax almost ten times the average US tariff on potato starch dextrin brandy and light trucks Officially the tax targeted items imported from Europe as approximating the value of lost American chicken sales to Europe br In retrospect audio tapes from the Johnson White House revealed a quid pro quo unrelated to chicken In January President Johnson attempted to convince United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther not to initiate a strike just before the election and to support the president s civil rights platform Reuther in turn wanted Johnson to respond to Volkswagen s increased shipments to the United States br The Chicken Tax directly curtailed importation of German built Type s in configurations that qualified them as light trucks that is commercial vans panel vans and pickups vans imported in passenger configuration were not affected In US imports of trucks from West Germany declined to a value of million about one third the value imported in the previous year After Volkswagen cargo vans and pickup trucks the intended targets practically disappeared from the US market While post Type commercial vans and single cab and double cab pickups can be found in the United States today they are exceedingly rare Any post specimen found ostensibly has had its import tariff paid The Chicken tax remains in effect today even though it is now commonly circumvented by converting passenger vehicles to utility vehicles after they have entered the United States a form of tariff engineering This practice is ironically exercised by Ford for its Transit Connect van one of the companies the tax was meant to protect br br In late the second generation of the Volkswagen Type T was introduced It was built in West Germany until In Mexico the Volkswagen Kombi and Panel were produced from to Early models are often called the T a or Early Bay models after are called the T b or Late Bay and models after are called the T c br br This second generation Type lost its distinctive split front windshield and was cm in longer and considerably heavier than its predecessor Its common nicknames are Breadloaf and Bay window or Loaf and Bay for short At L and kW PS bhp DIN the engine was also slightly larger The battery and electrical system was upgraded to volts making it incompatible with electric accessories from the previous generation The new model eliminated the swing axle rear suspension and transfer boxes previously used to raise ride height Instead half shaft axles fitted with constant velocity joints raised ride height without the wild changes in camber of the Beetle based swing axle suspension The updated Bus transaxle is sought by off road racers using air cooled Volkswagen components br br The T b was introduced by way of gradual change over three years The first models featured rounded bumpers incorporating a step for use when the door was open replaced by indented bumpers without steps on later models front doors that opened to from the body no lip on the front guards unique engine hatches and crescent air intakes in the D pillars later models after the Type engine option was offered have squared off intakes The Type featured a new L engine with dual intake ports on each cylinder head and was DIN rated at kW PS bhp An important change came with the introduction of front disc brakes and new roadwheels with brake ventilation holes and flatter hubcaps Up until front indicators are set low on the nose rather than high on either side of the fresh air grille giving rise to their being nicknamed Low Lights s most prominent change was a bigger engine compartment to fit the larger to litre engines from the Volkswagen Type and a redesigned rear end which eliminated the removable rear apron and introduced the larger late tail lights The air inlets were also enlarged to accommodate the increased cooling air needs of the larger engines br In the cc Type engine as used in the Beetle was supplemented with the cc Type engine as it was originally designed for the Type and models European vans kept the option of upright fan Type engine but the Type became standard for US spec models br br In the Type the Type engine or pancake engine was an option for the model year onward This engine was standard in models destined for the US and Canada Only with the Type engine did an automatic transmission become available for the first time in the model year Both engines were L DIN rated at kW PS bhp with the manual transmission and kW PS bhp with the automatic The Type engine was enlarged to L and kW PS bhp DIN for the model year and again to L and kW PS bhp DIN for the model year The two litre option appeared in South African manufactured models during originally only in a comparably well equipped Executive model The L now featured hydraulic valve lifters eliminating the need to periodically adjust the valve clearances as on earlier models The and later US model years received Bosch L Jetronic electronic fuel injection as standard equipment was the first year for electronic ignition utilizing a hall effect sensor and digital controller eliminating maintenance requiring contact breaker points As with all Transporter engines the focus in development was not on power but on low end torque The Type engines were considerably more robust and durable than the Type engines particularly in Transporter service br In for the model year exterior revisions included relocated front turn indicators squared off and set higher in the valance above the headlights Also square profiled bumpers which became standard until the end of the T in were introduced in Crash safety improved with this change because of a compressible structure behind the front bumper This meant that the T b was capable of meeting US safety standards for passenger cars of the time though not required of vans The VW emblem on the front valance became slightly smaller br Later model changes were primarily mechanical By the T had gained its final shape Very late in the T s design life during the late s the first prototypes of Type vans with four wheel drive WD were built and tested br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The T c with a roof raised by about cm in was built starting in the early s for the Mexican South American and Central American markets Since the T c has been built in M xico with the water cooled L inline four cylinder kW PS bhp carbureted engine easily identified by the large black front mounted radiator and since with the L air cooled engines for the Brazilian market br Once production of the original Beetle ended in late the T was the only Volkswagen model with an air cooled rear mounted boxer engine but then the Brazilian model shifted to a water cooled engine on December There was a L hp kW PS water cooled diesel engine available from to which gave fuel economy of km L to km L but gave slow performance and its insufficient cooling system led to short engine life br The end of the Volkswagen air cooled engine on a worldwide basis was marked by a Special Edition Kombi An exclusive silver paint scheme and limited edition emblems were applied to only units in late and were sold as models br Stricter emissions regulations introduced by the Brazilian government for forced a shift to a flexible fuel water cooled engine able to run on petrol or alcohol Borrowed from the Volkswagen Gol the engine is a rear mounted EA L v Total Flex cc cu in kW PS bhp on petrol and kW PS bhp when run on ethanol and N m lbf ft torque br br Production of the Brazilian Volkswagen Kombi ended in with a production run of Last Edition vehicles A short film entitled Os ltimos Desejos da Kombi English The Kombi s Last Wishes was made by Volkswagen Brazil to commemorate the end of production Brazilian requirements that new cars have driver and passenger airbags and anti lock brakes were also factors in the end of T production br br The Volkswagen Type T T within the UK or Vanagon in the United States the T platform was introduced in and was one of the last new Volkswagen platforms to use an air cooled engine The Volkswagen air cooled engine was phased out for a water cooled boxer engine still rear mounted in Compared to its predecessor the T the T was larger and heavier with square corners replacing the rounded edges of the older models The T is sometimes called the wedge by enthusiasts to differentiate it from earlier Kombis br br For the T generation was released with the model range dropping the Type name in favor of the Transporter nameplate Over years after the Golf was introduced as the replacement for the Type Beetle the Transporter range also adopted a front engine front wheel drive configuration Syncro WD returned as an option Worldwide the model range now used water cooled fuel injected engines with inline and later VR engines replacing the wasserboxer br Through much of the world the T was marketed as the Transporter with row passenger vans known as the Caravelle the Vanagon name was used in Japan In the United States the T was marketed as the Eurovan mid size van for and from to from to the Eurovan served as the basis for multiple recreational vehicles marketed through the United States and Canada Sales of the Transporter in North America ended in br br The Volkswagen Transporter T range is the fifth generation of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles medium sized light commercial vehicle and people movers Launched January the T went into full production in April replacing the fourth generation range br Key markets for the T are Germany the United Kingdom Russia France and Turkey It is not sold in the US market because it is classed as a light truck accruing the chicken tax on importation The T has a more aerodynamic design The angle of the windshield and A pillar is less this makes for a large dashboard and small bonnet br In June Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles announced the one millionth T rolled off the production line in Hanover br T GP introduced in Heavily facelifted with some new power plants including the bi turbo range topper These new engines saw the demise of the now dirty cylinder units br Late will see the arrival of the Neu Sechs the New The T will offer further engine changes in early but will launch with the previous generation engines The new engines will see the introduction of Ad Blu to meet with euro emission compliance The new was expected by many to be more than just a facelift br br The new T launched with the old Euro non AdBlue power plants but is offered with a Euro diesel engine with bhp and AdBlue Three further Euro Adblue diesel power plants with ps ps and ps are also offered br There is some debate in the community over whether the T is a new model or simply a face lift of the T There are obvious external changes to the nose and tailgate while internally there is a new dash in two different versions Volkswagen claims refinement to ride handling and noise levels br br In a Volkswagen Microbus Concept was created with design cues from the T generation in a spirit similar to the New Beetle nostalgia movement Volkswagen planned to start selling it in the United States market in but it was scrapped in May and replaced with a more cost effective design to be sold worldwide br br Like the Beetle from the beginning the Type earned many nicknames from its fans Popular nicknames in German include VW Bus Bulli Bully a portmanteau of Bus and Lieferwagen delivery van Hippie van or simply der Bus The Type was meant to be officially named the Bully but Heinrich Lanz producer of the Lanz Bulldog farm tractor intervened The model was then presented as the Volkswagen Transporter and Volkswagen Kleinbus but the Bully nickname still caught on br The official German language model names Transporter and Kombi Kombinationskraftwagen combined use vehicle have also caught on as nicknames Kombi is not only the name of the passenger variant but also the Australasian and Brazilian term for the whole Type family in much the same way that they are all called VW Bus in Germany even the pickup truck variations In Mexico the German Kombi was translated as Combi and became a household word thanks to the vehicle s popularity in Mexico City s public transportation system In Peru where the term Combi was similarly adopted the term Combi Asesina Murderous Combi is often used for buses of similar size because of the notorious recklessness and competition of bus drivers in Lima to get passengers In Portugal it is known as P o de Forma Breadloaf because its design resembles a bread baked in a mold Similarly in Denmark the Type is referred to as Rugbr d Rye bread Finns dubbed it Kleinbus mini bus as many taxicab companies adopted it for group transportation the name Kleinbus has become an appellative for all passenger vans The vehicle is also known as Kleinbus in Chile br In the US however it is a VW bus minibus hippie mobile hippie bus hippie van combie Microbus or Transporter to aficionados The early versions produced before used a split front windshield giving rise to the nickname Splitty and their comparative rarity has led to their becoming sought after by collectors and enthusiasts The next version sold in the US market from to is characterised by a large curved windshield and is commonly called a bay window It was replaced by the Vanagon of which only the Westfalia camper version has a common nickname Westy br A popular nickname for the T was i or transi in reference to the liter Microbus Caravelle sold in South Africa and their robust design being a popular choice for transportation of children respectively Kombi is also a generic nickname for vans and minibuses in South Africa Swaziland and Zimbabwe often used as a means of public transportation In Nigeria it is called Danfo br In the UK it is known as a Campervan In France it was called a camping car usually hyphenated though this has been expanded to include other often more specialized vehicles in more recent times br Among VW enthusiasts in countries of the former Yugoslavia especially in Serbia and Croatia VW T bus is commonly called a Terrorist probably due to its cameo appearance in the Back to the Future film in which it is driven by a group of Libyan terrorists br br T production began in at the Puebla assembly factory br Offered initially only as a nine passenger version called the Volkswagen Combi Kombi in Brazil and from also its cargo van version called the Volkswagen Panel both variants were fitted with the L air cooled boxer engine and four speed manual gearbox In the L bhp kW PS boxer engine replaced the previous one and production continued this way up to In the water cooled L bhp kW PS inline four cylinder engine replaced the air cooled L This new model is recognisable by its black grille for its engine coolant radiator bumpers and moldings br In Volkswagen de M xico ordered two specially made pickups from Germany one single cab and one double cab for the Puebla plant These were evaluated for the possibility of building pickups in Mexico and were outfitted with every option except the Arctic package including front and rear fog lights intermittent wipers trip odometer clock bumper rubber PVC tilt and dual doors on the single cab storage compartment VW de Mexico was interested in having the lights wiring brake systems and other parts manufactured in Mexico Ultimately VW de Mexico declined to produce pickups and the pickups were sold to an Autohaus a Volkswagen dealer in San Antonio Texas since they could not be sold in Mexico By law no German made Volkswagens were to be sold in Mexico These were probably the only pickups that were produced in Germany for Mexican import and have the ME export code on the M code plate The green double cab was sold to a new owner in New York and has been lost track of The light gray L licht grau single cab still exists Pickups were not manufactured in Mexico nor were they imported into Mexico from Germany save for these two examples br In a luxury variant the Volkswagen Caravelle made its debut in the Mexican market to compete with the Nissan Ichi Van which was available in cargo passenger and luxury versions br The main differences between the two are that the Caravelle was sold as an eight passenger version while the Combi was available as a nine passenger version the Caravelle was only painted in metallic colors while the Combi was only available in non metallic colors and the Caravelle was fitted with an AM FM stereo cassette sound system tinted windows velour upholstery reading lights mid and rear headrests and wheel covers from the European T model br In the cm in higher roof made its debut in all variants and the Combi began to be offered in eight or nine passenger variants In since Mexican anti pollution regulations required a three way catalytic converter a Digifant fuel injection system replaced the previous carburetor The three variants continued without change until br In production ended in Mexico with models being imported from Brazil The Caravelle was discontinued and both the Combi and the Panel were only offered in white color and finally in replaced by the T EuroVan Pasajeros and EuroVan Carga passenger and cargo van in long wheelbase version inline five cylinder L bhp and five speed manual gearbox imported from Germany br br The VW Type became popular with the counterculture of the s thanks to its ability to transport a large group of people while being cheap and easy to maintain Its design was simple yet spacious thanks largely to the rear mounted engine It contrasted with the large sedans and station wagons that were normal at the time giving the van an alternative and rebellious image Vans were often painted with extravagant designs in bright colors making them stand out on the road even more The hippie van remains iconic today thanks to being featured on the cover of albums by musicians such as Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys and being used by fans of the Grateful Dead while following the band on tour But most iconic of all the music festival Woodstock which was held in the summer of saw plenty of brightly painted vans transporting excited young crowds br br Van br Minibus br Volkswagen Bus br Volkswagen Transporter br Volkswagen I D Buzz br Volkswagen
