The Cadillac DeVille is a model name used by Cadillac over eight generations originally used to designate a trim level of the Cadillac Series and later to designate a standalone model in the brand range The last model marketed specifically as a DeVille was the full size sedan at the time Cadillac s largest model br For the Deville nameplate was retired when the model line was carried forward with minor revisions as the Cadillac DTS using a nomenclature adopted by the Cadillac STS and CTS br br The name DeVille is derived from the French de la ville or de ville meaning of the town In French coach building parlance a coup de ville from the French couper to cut i e shorten or reduce was a short four wheeled closed carriage with an inside seat for two and an outside seat for the driver and this smaller vehicle was intended for use in the town or city de ville An unshortened limousine or in the United States town car has a division between the passenger and driver compartments

chassis and featured a dummy air scoop chrome trim around front wheel openings and a one piece windshield and rear glass The interior was black and trimmed in gray leather including the headliner to match the roof color It was equipped with a telephone in the glove compartment a vanity case and a secretarial pad in the rear armrest power windows and highly decorative chrome interior trim The prototype Coupe de Ville was used by GM President Charles E Wilson until when he presented it to his secretary At some time during this period it acquired a dark Vicodec roof The prototype Coupe de Ville was found and restored in the s it was in a private collection in London Ontario Canada as of br br The Cadillac Series Coupe de Ville was introduced late in the model year Along with the Buick Roadmaster Riviera and the Oldsmobile Holiday it was among the first pillarless hardtop coupes ever produced At US in dollars it was only a dollar less than the Series convertible and like the convertible it came with power windows standard It was luxuriously trimmed with leather upholstery and chrome bows in the headliner to simulate the ribs of a convertible top In its first year the Series Coupe de Ville only sold units But sales more than doubled to and in sales more than doubled again to exceeding the sales for the Series Club Coupe that year Also in Coupe de Ville chrome script appeared on the rear roof pillar for the first time to further distinguish it from the Series Club Coupe br In the Series Coupe de Ville was joined by the Series Sedan de Ville Cadillac s first standard production door hardtop Similarly to the Coupe de Ville it was also more expensive and more luxuriously trimmed than the standard door Series With sold it also easily outsold the Series sedan in its very first year Given their sales success it was only natural that the Coupe de Ville and Sedan de Ville were moved to their own separate series in the Series being joined by a DeVille

available option at as was the popular Cabriolet roof option for Coupe de Ville at br s biggest news was the introduction of Cadillac s modulated displacement in V engine Developed by the Eaton Corporation with design elements that had been tested for over miles km allowed various engine computers to decide how many cylinders were needed to power the car for optimal fuel economy The theory was cylinders from a complete stop cylinders during usual driving and just four cylinders at cruising speed The changes in cylinder operation were slight and most drivers did not detect any difference in operation However in some cases reliability and component failure led to customer complaints Cadillac defended its micro processor controlled powerplant and even offered special extended warranties to customers Hemmings Motor News has described the operation of this engine in practice Disaster doesn t quite cover the scope of what happened br Also available was Oldsmobile s liter V diesel engine The horsepower kW Buick V teamed with an automatic transmission returned for after a short initial offering in the spring of Coupe de Ville was priced at while Sedan de Ville priced at now had the

the seat belt latched at all times and simply get in and out of the vehicle without having to unfasten the belt The option which would re appear as standard equipment on the Brougham was available

chrome header onto near the bottom of the grille itself The wide parking lamps below the quad headlamps now had clear frosted lenses previous years they were amber with satin gold colored winged Cadillac emblems centered on each lens A very minor change in the rear was the deletion of the chrome tips on both sides of the lower deck lid trim These little chrome corner pieces mounted on the filler panels were prone to pitting as they were made of a different material than the bright aluminum trunk trim and upper license late surround Coupe de Ville s popular Cabriolet roof package added to its sticker price While both models including the Sedan de Ville could be ordered with the d Elegance package Sales figures looked healthy with a total of De Ville and Fleetwood models br Because

considers the Fleetwood Brougham as an option package for the DeVille not a separate model br br Engines br br The sixth generation Deville marked a sea change for General Motors and Cadillac Under

using the first transversely mounted V engine in series production br The new C Body models along with their Oldsmobile and Buick counterparts were significantly shorter narrower lighter and more fuel efficient than the platform they replaced and were noted for having nearly the same key interior dimensions as their predecessors and a much more nearly flat passenger compartment floor albeit with thinner seats and dramatically less upper tumblehome locating windshield as well as side glass closer to passengers br Production of the new C body commenced December at the Orion Assembly Plant in Orion Township Michigan the redesigned models were introduced on April and marketing began in early for the model year with the front cover of the Deville brochure calling the sixth generation the Cadillac of Tomorrow br Cadillac s HT V remained the standard engine mounted transversely and coupled with a T automatic Oldsmobile s L V diesel was optional for but was dropped the following year Of GM s front drive C Body models Cadillac was the only line to offer a V engine the others were equipped with a Buick derived or V engine or for only Oldsmobile s L V diesel engine Later Deville model years would use larger variants of the Cadillac HT V All C bodies used four wheel independent suspension br The sixth generation DeVille was available as a sedan or coupe At introduction in part due to an extended model year beginning in April sales of the new downsized DeVille and Fleetwood models reached nearly units After the sixth generation s initial development and launch GM reconsidered the marketplace and provided an extensive facelift that added considerable length and associated weight br Model year changes br An anti lock braking system developed by Teves became available A

lamps This new sided tail lamp style was similar to the tail lamp design used on the DeVille Unlike the new one piece headlamps the changes to the rear end in had little to do with engineering but rather feedback from Cadillac s customer base who felt the car looked too short Although the revamp was still quite similar to the model so much in fact that it still used the previous year s deck lid the design was more in tune with the look that traditional Cadillac buyers were used to br Pricing for included Coupe de Ville at and Sedan de Ville at Fleetwood d Elegance at and the new Fleetwood Sixty Special was available for The Touring option priced at over DeVille s base cost also included aluminum wheels mounted on inch Goodyear Eagle GT tires At the end of the model year Cadillac
