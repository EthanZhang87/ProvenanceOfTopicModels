Johnson as Peter B Parker Spider Man Miles reluctant mentor a disheveled jaded and brown haired year old counterpart of the hero from another dimension He is intended to be an amalgamation of all pop

Parker SP dr A young Japanese American girl from an alternative anime like universe who copilots a biomechanical suit with a radioactive spider that she shares a telepathic link with The filmmakers initially considered using Silk as their Asian American Spider Man but eventually settled on Peni because of her more distinctive power set compared to the other Spider People Peni s designs went through a few iterations as her initial design was particularly iffy Production designer Justin Thompson considered Lord and Miller s desire to use an anime design and came up with the idea to portray her in an art style similar to Sailor Moon br Nicolas Cage as Peter Parker Spider Man Noir An alternate version of Peter Parker from a monochromatic universe set in the s Cage based his character on the films of Humphrey Bogart and the voices of actors from that era such as James Cagney and Edward G Robinson br Kathryn Hahn as Doctor Olivia Liv Octavius The head scientist and CEO of Alchemax and

Miles dimension Though he offers to mentor Miles he is murdered by Kingpin after the activation of the collider before he can do so This version of Parker was intended to be as competent a Spider Man as possible and combines elements from previous Spider Man portrayals but with slight differences to indicate that he is from a different universe than the others According to Parker s eulogy he was a

Spider Man co creator Stan Lee appears in a posthumous cameo as a character named Stan who sells a Spider Man costume to Morales Lord and Miller said it was important to give Lee a bigger moment in the film rather than just a passing cameo because he was so integral to the spirit of this movie and the role was extra meaningful following Lee s death in November Lee s character also has several brief Easter egg cameos throughout the film such as when he walks over Miles and Peter B when they are lying on the streets of New York City A young Matt Murdock from Gwen s dimension appears in an Easter egg cameo during Morales final train fight scene as an alternate universe adopted son of Kingpin br Cameos during the film s post credits include Oscar Isaac as Miguel O Hara Spider Man an

Parker Spider Man from the TV series replacing Paul Soles with the character being credited as Last Dude Donald Glover appears on a background TV screen which is displaying a scene from the episode Anthropology of Community in which Glover s character Troy Barnes wears Spider Man pajamas This scene a reference to an unsuccessful Twitter campaign suggesting Glover be cast in the lead role of The Amazing Spider Man was cited by Miles Morales creator Brian Michael Bendis as influencing the design and portrayal of the character Glover had previously voiced a version of Miles Morales in the Ultimate Spider Man animated series and played Aaron Davis in Spider Man Homecoming br Miles Morales s best friend and roommate Ganke Lee appears The character originally had a bigger role but was rewritten due to Spider Man Homecoming having the similar character Ned Leeds Pixar animator Peter Sohn was cast as Ganke before the character s dialogue was cut from the final film Sohn would later voice the character in the sequel Spider Man Across the Spider Verse br br br Production br br br Development br br Following the November hacking of Sony s computers emails between then Sony Pictures Entertainment co chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released saying that Sony was planning to rejuvenate the Spider Man franchise by developing an animated comedy film with Phil Lord and Christopher Miller During her time as Sony s co chairman Pascal approached Lord and Miller about making an animated Spider Man movie to which Lord and Miller agreed with the condition that they could adapt Dan Slott s Spider Verse comic book storyline and star Miles Morales as the protagonist Sony executives were set to talk about the project further in a discussion regarding several Spider Man spin off films at a summit in January At the CinemaCon in April Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman announced that the animated Spider Man film had a July release date and would be produced by Lord and Miller Avi Arad Matt Tolmach and Pascal with Lord and Miller also writing a treatment for the film Rothman said that it would co exist with the live action Spider Man films though Sony soon stated that the film would exist independently of the projects in the live action Spider Man universe as it is set in an alternate universe from those films without the version of Spider Man as seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU br That December Sony moved the film s release date to December By June Lord had written a script for the film and the studio chose Bob Persichetti to direct Miller said the film would feel different from previous Spider Man films and would stand on its own as a unique film going experience It was also rumored to focus on the Miles Morales version of Spider Man which Sony confirmed at a presentation for its upcoming animated films in January Peter Ramsey had joined the film as a co director by that point The next month Alex Hirsch was named as a story contributor and Christina Steinberg replaced Tolmach as a producer she previously collaborated with Ramsey on Rise of the Guardians while at DreamWorks Animation In April the release date was pushed up one week from December to December Lord and Miller announced the film s full title in December and said that multiple Spider Men would appear in the film By then Rodney Rothman who had previously co written the screenplay for Lord and Miller s Jump Street was added as a co director br br br Writing br The script is credited to Lord and Rothman from a story by Lord making it the first film Lord had written without Miller As six Spider Man films had been made already the team agreed they first needed to decide why this one needed to be made their answer was to tell the story of Morales who had yet to appear in a film Brian Michael Bendis co creator of Miles Morales consulted on the film adaptation The first full cut of animatics and storyboards for the film was over two hours long which is uncommon for animated films The directors attributed this mostly to Lord and Miller and their approach of adding as many elements to the film as they could at the outset with the intention of seeing what it could handle and then shaping the film from there They said that the final runtime would be between and minutes the standard length of an animated film They added that a balance would have to be found between the expectations of an animated film that will have a large audience of children and the requirements of the story The directors felt the plot was similar to the live action Spider Man films especially due to the large number of characters in the film One year prior to its release Lord and Rothman opted to rewrite the story as they had to figure out how to reshape sequences we had already boarded and animated and fold them in with new stuff They also added that they had substantially rewritten the third act br The film was originally set to feature a romance between Miles Morales and Spider Gwen While the idea was scrapped Gwen was still featured prominently in the film mostly due to the efforts of producer Christina Steinberg By August the directors had considered what a potential post credits scene for the film could be given that audiences have come to expect them from Marvel films At one point the writers wished to include a post credits scene with cameos by all three live action Spider Man actors Tobey Maguire Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland but this was canceled as Sony felt such a moment at the time would cause confusion and be too risky Holland recalled the scene was intended to include him as a passerby at a train station who says Hey kid to Miles In the original subplot Miles was going to become Spider Man from learning from a audio commentary featuring James Cameron and Tom Cruise br br br Casting br Shameik Moore was cast as Miles Morales in April along with Liev Schreiber as the film s then unspecified main villain A month later Mahershala Ali and Brian Tyree Henry joined the cast as Morales s uncle Aaron Davis and father Jefferson Davis respectively That December Lord and Miller said that an adult Peter Parker Spider Man would appear in the film as a mentor to Morales Maguire who played Spider Man in the Sam Raimi films was initially considered to be cast as this version of Spider Man but the idea was dropped so as not to confuse the audience with the concept of the Spider Verse Jake Johnson was ultimately cast in the role in April It was also announced that the characters Green Goblin Kingpin and Prowler would also appear with their designs based on the Ultimate Marvel comic series Kathryn Hahn was cast as a female variant of Doctor Octopus called Olivia Octavius earlier drafts for the film had the character s known male version as a The Big Lebowski type of character but Persichetti came up with changing the character s gender due to his kids being friends with Hahn s br In June Sony confirmed further casting including Schreiber playing Kingpin Hailee Steinfeld as Spider Gwen Luna Lauren V lez as Morales s mother Rio and Lily Tomlin as Parker s Aunt May A month later Nicolas Cage who was considered for the role of Green Goblin in the first Spider Man film John Mulaney and Kimiko Glenn were announced as the voices of Spider Man Noir Spider Ham and Peni Parker respectively Chris Pine as the Peter Parker of Miles universe and Oscar Isaac as Spider Man were announced in November Pine was also involved in Ramsey s previous film Rise of the Guardians Lord and Miller explained that the alternate Spider Man characters were chosen based on the comics they had read as well as research they conducted on Marvel Comics with the intention of including actual characters from the comics who were as diverse as possible br br br Music br br Daniel Pemberton was announced as the film s composer in July A full soundtrack album was released by Republic Records on December the day of the film s release and was curated to represent what a teen like Miles Morales would listen to Artists on the soundtrack include Jaden Smith Nicki Minaj Lil Wayne Post Malone Ty Dolla Sign Juice Wrld Swae Lee Ski Mask the Slump God Vince Staples Thutmose and the late XXXTentacion who was marketed as a special guest on the Lil Wayne and Ty Dolla Sign song Scared of the Dark A separate album containing Pemberton s score was released by Sony Classical Records on December On December Sony Pictures Animation announced an extended play album A Very Spidey Christmas based on a throwaway joke at the beginning of the film and consisting of five Christmas songs performed by cast members Shameik Moore Jake Johnson and Chris Pine The EP was released on digital platforms the next day br Elliphant recorded the song To the End for the film where it served as the introduction music for Spider Woman The song was released as a single in January a month after the film was released br br br Animation and design br The film s animation was handled by Sony Pictures Imageworks in Vancouver who had handled nearly all of Sony Pictures Animation s prior films as well as visual effects for all prior Spider Man films According to Lord and Miller they wanted the film to feel like the viewer had walked inside a comic book and were excited about telling the story in a way they believed the live action films could not Persichetti concurred feeling that animation was the best medium to honor the comics allowing the production team to adapt year old comic art techniques for the film s visual language It took around a year for two animators to create seconds of footage that reflected the producers vision the animation work was created from there During initial development the directors worked with a single animator Alberto Mielgo to establish the film s look Although Mielgo was let go by Sony before the movie had been significantly produced due to artistic differences this number eventually grew to animators during production It became clear that they could not complete the film on time so the crew was expanded further The number had reached animators by August and at one point to animators the largest animation crew that Sony Pictures Imageworks had ever used for a film Animation work was completed in October br The CGI animation for the film was combined with line work and painting and dots and all sorts of comic book techniques to make it look like it was created by hand which was described as a living painting This was achieved by artists taking rendered frames from the CGI animators and working on top of them in D with the goal of making every frame of the film look like a comic panel Lord described this style of animation as totally revolutionary and explained that the design combines the in house style of Sony Pictures Animation with the flavor of comic artists such as Sara Pichelli who co created Miles Morales and Robbi Rodriguez The film s tone and visual style also drew influence from Japanese anime and manga works such as Hayao Miyazaki films and Akira br To make the film feel more like a comic book it was animated without motion blur instead using an older technique of D animation called motion smearing as seen in the Looney Tunes short The Dover Boys The frame rate varied between images animating on ones and images animating on twos per second the latter case using the same image twice The producers described the effect as making the animation crunchy Sometimes the two frame rates would be used in the same scene such as when Miles and Peter Parker swing through the forest Miles was animated at frames to show his inexperience while Peter was animated at frame to give him smoother movement With characters being held up for one two and three frames it made their motion look jittery which was named stepped animation To create depth of field another technique was used deliberately misaligned colors as if the colors had been slightly misprinted as happens with ink printing in real comics Other methods to make the film look more like a comic were halftones and Ben Day dots to create colors tones and gradients crisscrossed lines to create texture and shadows Kirby Krackle to create the illusion of energy motion lines to show movement and onomatopoeia words on the image to represent sounds and motion br Rather than using animation principles like squash and stretch the animators came up with substitute versions so that in texture and feel it felt different but it still achieved the same goal to either feel weight or anticipation or impact or things like that Different comic styles were emulated throughout the film for the different characters with Gwen s animation based on the designs in her comics Spider Man Noir having a black and white color scheme Spider Ham being designed as cartoony as possible and Peni Parker being based on Japanese anime and manga such as Sailor Moon Former Disney concept artist Shiyoon Kim served as overall character designer while Craig Kellman designed the exaggerated look for Spider Ham Justin K Thompson served as production designer after having done so on the Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs films for Lord Miller and Sony Pictures Animation Danny Dimian who had worked on both the Spider Man film and the first Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs film while at Imageworks served as visual effects supervisor for the film He compared the approach the company took with Spider Verse to the film Hollow Man Animation co director Patrick O Keefe said that committing fully to each Spider s unique art style was like making five movies In universe comic books in the film were designed as a combination of the artwork of Steve Ditko and John Romita Jr Chris Pine s Peter Parker s cover was designed by Keith Pollard while Erik Larsen designed the cover for Jake Johnson s Peter Parker and Miles Morales s co creator Sara Pichelli also contributed art for the film br The directors all felt that the film would be one of the few that audiences actually need to watch in D due to the immersive nature of the animated world created and the way that the hand drawn animation elements designed specifically for the film create a unique experience Persichetti described the experience as a combination of the effects of an old fashioned hand drawn multiplane camera and a modern virtual reality environment One scene in Aaron Davis s apartment includes an image of Donald Glover in the background which references Glover s part in fan campaigns to see a non white version of Spider Man as well as a scene from the Community episode Anthropology where Glover s character of Troy Barnes wakes up in Spider Man pajamas Glover also portrayed Aaron Davis in Spider Man Homecoming and voiced Miles in the Ultimate Spider Man television series br br br Release br br br Marketing br A thirty second sizzle reel from the film was shown at a Sony Pictures Animation presentation in January revealing that the film focuses on Miles Morales Scott Mendelson at Forbes said the footage looked incredible sic stylized and resembled a cross between an Alex Ross image and a psychedelic comic cover but felt the most significant element of the presentation was the confirmation of Morales meaning will offer another comic book superhero movie featuring a hero of color during the same year as Marvel s Black Panther A teaser trailer for the film debuted at the Comic Con Experience and was then released online Chris Cabin at Collider felt the trailer looks much better than it ever needed to The style and design that is on display is vibrant and immediately engaging on a visual level showing a genuine sense of personality to the production io s Julie Muncy called the trailer s visual design elegant and fresh and highlighted the use of music by Vince Staples which was also used for the Black Panther trailers br The official trailer for the film was released online at the start of June and was praised by Chaim Gartenberg of The Verge for its absolutely gorgeous art style also highlighting Miles and Gwen s appearances For Cartoon Brew Amid Amidi praised the trailer for focusing on drama rather than action and for seemingly targeting a slightly hipper more urban and teen oriented crowd He felt that animated films were usually focused on pleasing all ages all audiences which marked this film as a radical change for United States feature animation Dani Di Placido of Forbes praised the trailer for inspiring interest in the Spider Man property after several different incarnations of the character had appeared in films He said it achieved this by leaning into the comic storyline of the Spider Verse and having multiple versions of the character in one film and by its beautifully rendered visuals that differentiated it from other major animated films Placido said it s nice to see a movie just go nuts and embrace the weirdness of comic books and their eternally shapeshifting storylines The trailer generated thousand conversations across social media platforms within a day of its release and in three days had been viewed million times making the film one of Sony s most viral alongside Sausage Party br Sony released a second trailer for the film in October ahead of a promotional panel at New York Comic Con where the first minutes of the film were shown Lord and Miller explained that they chose not to show clips from throughout the film because they would lack context for the audience so instead aired an extended sequence for the presentation even though it had some unfinished animation and music At the time Sony s film Venom was playing in theaters featuring another extended clip from Into the Spider Verse as a post credits scene The scene confirmed that the shared universe that Venom is part of is one of the universes connected within the Spider Verse multiverse br In November Sony launched Spider Verse Web AR Experience a mobile augmented reality experience created by th Wall and Trigger to run on Amazon Web Services Inspired by the film the AR experience allows users to include Spider Man in photos they take of their environment The film also received a million promotional boost from various companies one of the largest such campaigns for a Sony film including the Ad Council who included the

praised the film s atmosphere and visual effects adding that it has a wonderfully trippy dreamlike quality about it Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote the freshest and most stimulating aspect of the film is the visual style which unites the expected Marvel mix of universes it used to be assumed there was only one universe in creation with animation that looks both computer driven and hand drawn boasts futuristic as well as funky urban elements moves the camera a lot and brings together a melting pot of mostly amusing new characters br William Bibbiani of The Wrap felt the film represents some of the best superhero storytelling on the market and that it captures the sprawling interconnectivity of comic book universes in a way that no other feature film has calling it the best Spider Man film since Spider Man Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times said that What distinguishes Spider Man Into the Spider Verse in the end is that it takes its mission seriously even when it s being transparently silly David Sims of The Atlantic said that the film somehow through sheer creative gumption does something new in the superhero genre particularly praising the use of comic book s visual language as well as the characters dynamic and felt that the anarchic fingerprints of producers Lord and Miller were all over the movie Katie Walsh of Tribune News Service said that the film is unlike any other superhero or animated film that has come before comparing the animation to watching a comic book come to life and feeling that the film firmly exists in a post Deadpool environment where it seems the only fresh way into a century old superhero is to skewer the tropes make fun of the merchandising and acknowledge the cultural significance of it all in a cheeky and self reflective manner She added that Lord who wrote the story and co wrote the screenplay was the key to the balance of self aware and sweet present in the film br br br Industry response and legacy br Actor Tom Holland who plays Peter Parker Spider Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe praised Into the Spider Verse as one of the coolest films he has ever seen and he would later reiterate his statement on the film in calling it the best Spider Man movie that s ever been made Chris Pratt who worked with Lord and Miller on The Lego Movie films described it as an emotionally moving cutting edge progressive diverse funny meta action packed silly visually stunning masterpiece Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt who worked with Lord and Miller on Jump Street and appeared on Marvel s Agents of S H I E L D

techniques created for Into the Spider Verse were notably reused for The Mitchells vs the Machines another Sony Pictures Animation film that Lord and Miller co produced and similarly influenced the animation style for DreamWorks Animation s The Bad Guys and Puss in Boots The Last Wish both Directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah said Spider Verse inspired them to create the hand drawn style of visual effects for the live action MCU series Ms Marvel Mitchells co director Jeff Rowe also cited the film as a major influence for his directorial debut Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem claiming that it showed that a movie can look like the concept artwork and can be critically and financially successful That opened a lot of doors and I think we tried to take that football and run with it on Mitchells and then on Turtles The film was similarly cited as an inspiration for the animation of the Marvel Disney series Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur and Netflix Special Entergalactic br During a special lecture at Takarazuka University anime director Yoshiyuki Tomino commented on the film s Best Animated Feature win at the Academy Awards br At first glance it looks like a live action film and it s very experimental in various places For American filmgoers it may be their first time watching an animated film that isn t expressly for kids I won t appraise the film s quality but on a technical level I can see how much hard work the staff put into it He also expressed a belief that the anime industry should strive to surpass Into the Spider Verse and other high profile American animated features br Director Kemp Powers who would later co direct the sequel Spider Man Across the Spider Verse watched an early cut of the movie with the crew of Pixar s Soul and said that despite
