Knick Knack is a American animated short film produced by Pixar that was written and directed by John Lasseter The short is about a snow globe snowman who wants to join the other travel souvenirs in a summer themed party However the glass dome that surrounds him prevents him from doing so thus leading to his many tries to break out of his snow globe Knick Knack is Pixar s fourth short and the final short produced during the company s tenure as a hardware company It was also the final Pixar short film released before the company s first feature length film Toy Story br The short stands out from Lasseter s other early short films at Pixar in its reliance on pure comedy to drive the story It was inspired by Tom and Jerry Looney Tunes and the work of animators Chuck Jones and Tex Avery Lasseter and his wife Nancy collected snow globes and also enjoyed souvenirs from distant places and those elements made their way into the short as well Singer Bobby McFerrin improvised the a cappella vocal jazz soundtrack to the film while watching a rough cut which was eventually left unchanged in its final edition br Knick Knack debuted at the SIGGRAPH convention in Boston and was presented in D The short has enjoyed positive reviews since its debut and has been screened as a part of numerous film festivals The short has now been associated with Finding Nemo with a remastered version of the short being shown before it in that film s original theatrical runs br br br Plot br On a bookshelf filled with vacation themed souvenirs a lonely and grumpy playboy knick knack snowman named Knick who resides in a Nome Sweet Nome Alaska snow globe wants to reach a female Sunny Miami knick knack that shows an attractive blonde and tanned pool lounger wearing a blue speedo and sunglasses Knick tries several unsuccessful methods to break out of the globe which includes ramming the glass with the snow globe s igloo backdrop using his carrot nose and a hammer on the glass using a jackhammer which causes his facial features to fall off trying to cut the glass using a blowtorch and an igniter and detonating TNT explosives The latter causes the globe to fall over the edge Knick notices an emergency exit in the base and frees himself just before he and the globe fall into a fishbowl where Knick sees an identical mermaid souvenir from Sunny Atlantis and starts gawking at her this only backfires when he attempts to run towards her the globe settles to the bottom and traps him again much to his annoyance br br br Background br In Pixar s third short film Tin Toy won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film the first computer animated film to claim the Academy Award It was also the first win for the hardware company which was still struggling to sell its main product the Pixar Image Computer The key animator and director behind Tin Toy John Lasseter had once worked at Disney several years prior but was fired by unknowingly stepping on his superiors toes with his support for computer animation Now Disney took notice of the Oscar win for Tin Toy and began a campaign to win Lasseter back br Lasseter turned the studio s offer for a directorial position down remarking to Pixar co founder Ed Catmull I can go to Disney and be a director or I can stay here and make history Jeffrey Katzenberg the then head of Walt Disney Studios had a reputation for being difficult and controlling In contrast Lasseter received complete creative freedom at Pixar s small animation division and was highly respected by his colleagues In addition to capturing Disney s interest Pixar owner Steve Jobs interest in the animation group was invigorated and he approved production of another short br br br Production br After the headaches of animating Billy the baby in Tin Toy Lasseter backed away from depicting human characters The team all agreed to do something simpler that would not drive us all crazy according to producer Ralph Guggenheim When watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit during the production of Tin Toy Lasseter became inspired to create a Chuck Jones type of cartoon Rather than challenge the limitations of the computer as they had done in the previous shorts the animators wanted to make a short based on geometric shapes instead which was a strength of the computer In a discussion with the group Lasseter brought up famed Warner Bros and MGM director Tex Avery noting that his cartoons were wild and exuberant yet not necessarily very complex Lasseter collected snow globes and also enjoyed souvenirs from distant places from those elements Knick Knack the only pure comedy among Lasseter s early short films at Pixar began to fall into place br The rest of the team were also fans of Tom and Jerry cartoons and the work of Chuck Jones and found the idea of cartoonish violence appealing Animator Flip Phillips and production coordinator Deirdre Warin simultaneously hit on the idea of the snow globe falling into a fishbowl Craig Good came up with the idea of an iris out a shrinking circle at the close as a reference to Looney Tunes A skeleton on the shelf in the short was a D model from an Ohio State University skeleton data set called George though the Pixar team stretched George s arms for comic effect Also distorted were the two female characters the bikini attired woman and a mermaid whose breasts were ultra exaggerated thanks to a technical director who was a pinup enthusiast br The singer Bobby McFerrin created the musical soundtrack and a cappella vocal jazz track which he improvised while watching a rough cut of the film As the rough cut ended the placeholder credits read blah blah blah blah so he sang those words and it remained in the film s score McFerrin did the score for free out of a belief that the film was cool to be involved with Gary Rydstrom of Lucasfilm created the sound effects for the short br br br Release and re releases br Knick Knack debuted at the SIGGRAPH in Boston It was one of the last pieces of animation that Lasseter would animate personally during Pixar s years as an independent company In it won the Best Short Film award at the Seattle International Film Festival When Lasseter presented it at the London Film Festival in The Independent of London called it a four minute masterpiece and The Guardian hailed Lasseter as probably the closest thing to God that has ever graced the electronic images community In Terry Gilliam selected it as one of the ten best animated films of all time After Knick Knack Pixar took a break from animated shorts and re focused on animating television commercials to build income and hire new animators br The film has been released in two versions and each of these has been shown in both D and D The original version was shown in D in at the SIGGRAPH program and was released on the VHS and LaserDisc Tiny Toy Stories and also on the Toy Story Deluxe CAV LaserDisc edition The short was later released on May in theaters with Finding Nemo For this release the film was re rendered with design adjustments for the woman on the Miami knick knack and the mermaid in the fishbowl Both characters now have much smaller breasts and the mermaid is now wearing a seashell bra rather than just starfish pasties Lasseter defended the changes by saying It wasn t big bad Disney coming in and insisting we do this it was our own choice It was just crossing the line for me personally as a father So I decided to reduce these characters breast size br This updated version is preceded with the message In six years before Toy Story Pixar Animation
