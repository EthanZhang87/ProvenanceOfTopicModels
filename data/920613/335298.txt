unhappy with the film s quality Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend Although most Pixar features take years to develop the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story was compressed into nine months br Despite production struggles Toy Story debuted on November to a successful box office run eventually grossing over million It received widespread critical acclaim from critics and audiences with a rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes like its predecessor It is considered by critics to be one of the few sequel

around a month after the film s opening in December A few days after Toy Story s release John Lasseter was traveling with his family and found a young boy clutching a Sheriff Woody doll at an airport Lasseter described how the boy s excitement to show it to his father touched him deeply Lasseter realized that his character no longer belonged to him only but rather it belonged to others as well The memory was a defining factor in the production of Toy Story with Lasseter moved to create a great film for that child and for everyone else who loved the characters br Ed Catmull Lasseter and Ralph Guggenheim visited Joe Roth successor to recently ousted Jeffrey Katzenberg as chairman of Walt Disney Studios shortly afterward Roth was pleased and embraced the idea of a sequel Disney had recently begun making direct to video sequels to its successful features and Roth wanted to handle the Toy Story sequel this way as well Prior releases such as s Aladdin sequel The Return of Jafar had returned an estimated million in profits br Initially everything regarding Toy Story was uncertain whether stars Tom Hanks and Tim Allen would be available and affordable what the story premise would be and even whether the film would be computer animated at Pixar or traditionally hand drawn at Walt Disney Feature Animation Lasseter regarded the project as a chance to groom new directing talent as top choices were already immersed in other projects Andrew Stanton as co director of A Bug s Life and Pete Docter as director of what would eventually become Monsters Inc Ash Brannon a young animator who was previously animation director on Toy Story was selected by Lasseter to direct after admiring his work on the first film Brannon a CalArts graduate joined the Toy Story team in Disney and Pixar officially announced the sequel in a press release on March br br br Story br br Lasseter s intention with a sequel was to respect the original Toy Story film and create that world again The story originated with him wondering what a toy would find upsetting how a toy would feel if it were not played with by a child or worse a child growing out of a toy Brannon suggested the idea of a yard sale where the collector recognizes Woody as a rare artifact The concept of Woody as a collectible set came from the draft story of A Tin Toy Christmas an original half hour special pitched by Pixar to Disney in The obsessive toy collector named Al McWhiggin who had appeared in a draft of Toy Story but was later expunged was inserted into the film Lasseter claimed that Al was inspired by himself br Secondary characters in Woody s set were inspired by s s Western and puppet shows for children such as Four Feather Falls Hopalong Cassidy and Howdy Doody The development of Jessie was kindled by Lasseter s wife Nancy who pressed him to include a strong female character in the sequel one with more substance than Bo Peep The scope for the original Toy Story was basic and only extended over two residential homes roadways and a chain restaurant whereas Toy Story has been described by Unkrich as something all over the map br To make the project ready for theaters Lasseter would need to add minutes or so of material and strengthen what was already there The extra material would be a challenge since it could not be mere padding it would have to feel as if it had always been there an organic part of the film With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away Lasseter called Stanton Docter Joe Ranft and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend There he hosted what he called a story summit a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in just two days br Back at the office that Monday Lasseter assembled the company in a screening room and pitched the revised version of Toy Story from exposition to resolution Story elements were recycled from the original drafts of the first Toy Story film The first film s original opening sequence featured a Buzz Lightyear cartoon playing on television which evolved into the Buzz Lightyear video game that would be shown in the opening scene of Toy Story A deleted scene from Toy Story featuring Woody having a nightmare involving him being thrown into a trash can was incorporated in a milder form for depicting Woody s fear of losing Andy The idea of a squeak toy penguin with a broken squeaker also resurfaced from an early version of Toy Story br br br Animation br As the story approached the production stage in early it was unclear whether Pixar would produce the film as the entire team of was busy working on A Bug s Life for a release The Interactive Products Group with a staff of had its own animators art department and engineers Under intense time pressure they had put out two successful CD ROM titles the previous year Disney s Animated Storybook Toy Story and The Toy Story Activity Center Between the two products the group had created as much original animation as there was in Toy Story itself Steve Jobs made the decision to shut down the computer games operation and the staff became the initial core of the Toy Story production team br Before the switch from direct to video to feature film the Toy Story crew had been on its own placed in a new building that was well separated from the rest of the company by railroad tracks We were just the small film and we were off playing in our sandbox co producer Karen Jackson said Lasseter looked closely at every shot that had already been animated and called for tweaks throughout The film reused digital elements from Toy Story but true to the company s prevailing culture of perfectionism it reused less of Toy Story than might be expected Character models received major upgrades internally and shaders went through revisions to bring about subtle improvements The team freely borrowed models from other productions such as Geri from Pixar s short Geri s Game who became the Cleaner in Toy Story Supervising animator Glenn McQueen inspired the animators to do spectacular work in the short amount of time given assigning different shots to suit each animators strengths br While producing Toy Story the crew was careful in creating new locations working within available technology at that time By the time of production on Toy Story technology had advanced farther to allow more complicated camera shots than were possible in the first film In making the sequel the team at Pixar did not want to stray too far from the first film s look but the company had developed a lot of new software since the first feature had been completed To achieve the dust visible after Woody is placed on top of a shelf the crew was faced with the challenge of animating dust an incredibly difficult task After much experimentation a tiny particle of dust was animated and the computer distributed that image throughout the entire shelf Over two million dust particles are in place on the shelf in the completed film br br br Troubled production br br Disney became unhappy with the pace of the work on the film and demanded in June that Guggenheim be replaced as producer and Pixar complied As a result associate producers Karen Jackson and Helene Plotkin were moved up into the roles of co producers br In November Roth and head of Walt Disney Feature Animation Peter Schneider viewed the film s story reels with some finished animation in a screening room at Pixar They were impressed with the quality of work and became interested in releasing Toy Story in theaters In addition to the unexpected artistic caliber there were other reasons that made the case for a theatrical release more compelling The economics of a direct to video Pixar release were lackluster due to the higher salaries of the crew After negotiations Jobs and Roth agreed that the split of costs and profits for Toy Story would follow the model of a newly created five film deal but Toy Story would not count as one of the five films Disney had bargained in the contract for five original features not sequels thus assuring five sets of new characters for its theme parks and merchandise Jobs gathered the crew and announced the change in plans for the film on February br The work done on the film to date was nearly lost in when one of the animators while routinely clearing some files accidentally entered the deletion command code bin rm r f on the root folder of the Toy Story assets on Pixar s internal servers br Associate technical director Oren Jacob was one of the first to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress They shut down the file servers but had already lost of the last two years of work and it was also found that the backups had not been working for about a month The film was saved when technical director Galyn Susman who had been remote working to take care of her newborn child revealed she had a backup copy of the film on her home computer The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets save for a few recent days of work allowing the film to proceed br Many of the creative staff at Pixar were not happy with how the sequel was turning out Upon returning from the European promotion tour of A Bug s Life Lasseter watched the development reels and agreed that it was not working Pixar met with Disney telling them that the film would have to be redone Disney disagreed and noted that Pixar did not have enough time to remake the film before its established release date Pixar decided that they simply could not allow the film to be released in its existing state and asked Lasseter to take over the production Lasseter agreed recruiting the first film s creative team including Stanton and Docter to redevelop the story and taking over as director from Brannon who would remain on the project as co director alongside Lee Unkrich who was also fresh from A Bug s Life having served as supervising editor To meet Disney s deadline Pixar had to complete the entire film in nine months Unkrich concerned with the dwindling amount of time remaining asked Jobs whether the release date could be pushed back Jobs explained that there was no choice presumably in reference to the film s licensees and marketing partners who were getting toys and promotions ready br Brannon focused on development story and animation Lasseter was in charge of art modeling and lighting and Unkrich oversaw editorial cinematography and layout The three met daily to discuss their progress with each other they wanted to ensure they were all progressing in the same direction which caused the boundaries of their responsibilities to overlap As was common with Pixar features the production became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer Still Toy Story with its highly compressed production schedule was especially trying While hard work and long hours were common to the team by that point especially so to Lasseter running flat out on Toy Story for month after month began to take a toll The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators and repetitive strain injuries for others Catmull would later disclose that a full third of the staff ended up with some form of RSI by the time the film was finished Pixar did not encourage long hours and in fact set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime Employees self imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints and were especially common to younger employees In one instance an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare one morning and in a mental haze forgot the baby in the back seat of his car in the parking lot Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were working too hard wrote David Price in his book The Pixar Touch br br br Music br br Randy Newman who composed and conducted music for the original Toy Story film returned to score the sequel He wrote two original songs When She Loved Me performed by Sarah McLachlan and Woody s Roundup performed by Riders in the Sky besides composing the score The song from Toy Story You ve Got a Friend in Me was also reused It was sung at two different points during the film by Tom Hanks as Woody and Robert Goulet the singing voice of Wheezy The score released by Walt Disney Records on November The track When She Loved Me which was considered to be among the saddest sequences in both Disney and Pixar films and the saddest film songs ever written received acclaim for McLachlan s singing and Newman s compositions The song was nominated at the Academy Awards in for Best Original Song though the award went to Phil Collins for You ll Be in My Heart from another Disney animated film Tarzan br br br Release br br br Theatrical br Pixar showed the completed film at CalArts on November in recognition of the school s ties with Lasseter and more than other alumni who worked on the film The students were captivated The film held its official premiere the next day at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles the same venue as Toy Story and was released across the United States on November The film s initial theatrical and video releases include Luxo Jr Pixar s first short film released in starring Pixar s titular mascot Before Luxo Jr a disclaimer appears reading In Pixar Animation Studios produced their first film This is why we have a hopping lamp in our logo On December within a month of the film s theatrical release a blooper reel was added to the film s mid credits which features the characters Flik and Heimlich from A Bug s Life br br br Re releases br In both Toy Story and Toy Story were converted to D for a two week limited theatrical re release which was extended due to its success Lasseter said The Toy Story films and characters will always hold a very special place in our hearts and we re so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy in a whole new way thanks to the latest in D technology With Toy Story shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz Woody and the gang from Andy s room we thought it would be great to let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way br Translating the films into D involved revisiting the original computer data and virtually placing a second camera into each scene creating left eye and right eye views needed to achieve the perception of depth Unique to computer animation Lasseter referred to this process as digital archaeology The lead stereographer Bob Whitehill oversaw this process and sought to achieve an effect that impacted the film s emotional storytelling It took four months to resurrect the old data and get it in working order Then adding D to each of the films took six months per film br The double feature opened in theaters on October and made million in its opening weekend finishing in third place at the box office The features closed on November with a worldwide gross of million Unlike other countries the UK and Argentina received the films in D as separate releases Toy Story was released January in the UK and February in Argentina br br br Home media br Toy Story was released on both VHS and DVD and as a DVD two pack with Toy Story on October That same day an Ultimate Toy Box set was released containing the first and second films and a third disc of bonus materials The standard DVD release allowed the viewer to pick the version of the film either in widescreen aspect ratio or fullscreen family friendly aspect ratio without pan and scan A sneak peek of Monsters Inc was attached to these releases which were THX certified The standard VHS DVD DVD two pack and the Ultimate Toy Box sets returned to the vault on May It was re released as a Special Edition disc DVD on December Both editions returned to the Disney Vault on January br A brief controversy involving the Ultimate Toy Box edition took place in which around copies of the box set that were shipped to Costco stores had a pressing error which caused a scene from the R rated film High Fidelity to play in the middle of the film The scene in question which featured the use of the word fuck multiple times prompted a number of complaints from consumers causing Costco to eventually recall the defective units from shelves and later go on to replace them The defect was caused by a content mix error according to Technicolor which manufactured the discs and only affected the U T B Box set copies of Toy Story which were included with the two pack were not affected by the manufacturing error According to Buena Vista Home Entertainment less than of the discs shipped were printed with the glitch br Toy Story was available for the first time on Blu ray Disc in a Special Edition Combo Pack released on March along with the first film On November the first three Toy Story films

that featured the Prospector suggestively enticing a pair of Barbie dolls with a role in Toy Story Media outlets inferred this change was a result of the Me Too movement which saw John Lasseter
