The International Harvester Company often abbreviated IH or International was an American manufacturer of agricultural and construction equipment automobiles commercial trucks lawn and garden products household equipment and more It was formed from the merger of McCormick Harvesting Machine Company and Deering Harvester Company and three smaller manufacturers Milwaukee Plano and Warder Bushnell and Glessner manufacturers of Champion brand Its brands included McCormick Deering and later McCormick Deering as well as International Along with the Farmall and Cub Cadet tractors International was also known for the Scout and Travelall vehicle nameplates In the s all divisions were sold off except for International Trucks which changed its parent company name to Navistar International NYSE NAV br br Given its monumental importance to the building of rural communities the brand continues to have a massive cult following The International Harvester legacy non profits host some of the largest agriculture related events in the United States br Following years of financial and economic decline International began selling its separate equipment divisions starting with the sale of the construction division to Dresser Industries in In November IH finalized a deal with Tenneco to sell the farm equipment division to Tenneco s subsidiary Case Corporation and the brand continues as Case IH which is owned by CNH The European division exists today as McCormick Tractors and is owned by ARGO SpA of Italy International became solely a truck and engine manufacturer and brand and reorganized as Navistar International in Throughout its existence International Harvester was headquartered in Chicago Illinois In Volkswagen agreed to fully purchase the remaining shares of Navistar br br br History br br br Founding br br The roots of International Harvester run to the s when Virginia inventor Cyrus Hall McCormick perfected his version of a horse drawn reaper which he field demonstrated in and for which he received a patent in Together with his brother Leander J McCormick he moved to Chicago in to be closer to the Midwestern grain fields and founded the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company The reaper sold well partially as a result of savvy and innovative business practices Their products came onto the market just as the development of railroads offered wide distribution to distant territories He developed a vast support network to demonstrate field operations McCormick died in and his company passed to his son Cyrus McCormick Jr whose antipathy toward organized labor helped spark the Haymarket affair the origin of May Day as a labor holiday br In the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company and Deering Harvester Company along with three smaller agricultural equipment firms Milwaukee Harvesting Machine Co Plano Manufacturing Co and Warder Bushnell and Glessner manufacturers of Champion brand merged to create the International Harvester Company The most important motivation for the merger was elimination of competition in order to increase profits Banker J P Morgan provided the financing The architect of the merger was George W Perkins one of the Morgan executives who Cyrus McCormick described as the most brilliant negotiator he had ever known The new company was valued at million In IH bought the Parlin and Orendorff factory in Canton Illinois a leader in plow manufacturing renaming it Canton Works International Harvester was one of the main clients of Product Miniature Company br br br Sustained success br In IH s Farmall Works built a new plant in Rock Island Illinois By the th Farmall was produced IH next set their sights on introducing a true general purpose tractor to satisfy the needs of the average American family farmer The resulting letter series of Raymond Loewy designed Farmall tractors in proved a huge success IH dominated the market through the s despite stiff competition from Ford Allis Chalmers Massey Ferguson and John Deere br IH ranked rd among United States corporations in the value of World War II production contracts Different plants of the corporation produced torpedoes and their components artillery systems and their parts artillery shells and some civilian products for the military like bulldozers and truck engines In IH acquired a defense plant in Louisville Kentucky which was adapted for production of the Farmall A B and the new tractors It acquired the Metropolitan Body Company of Bridgeport Connecticut in The commercially successful Metro line of forward control vans and trucks were produced here from until br In Pacific Trucks was purchased In the five millionth IHC tractor a was produced at the Rock Island Farmall plant br Throughout the s and s despite good sales IH s profit margins remained slim The continual addition of unrelated business lines created a somewhat unwieldy corporate organization Overly conservative management and a rigid policy of in house promotion tended to stifle new management strategies and technical innovation IH faced strong competition and increased production costs primarily due to labor and government imposed environmental and safety regulations br br br Downfall br In IH named a new CEO Archie McCardell who was determined to improve profit margins and drastically cut costs Unprofitable lines were terminated and factory production was curtailed By the end of the year profits were at their highest levels in years but cash reserves were still low Union members became increasingly irate over these measures and in the spring of IH prepared to face a strike On November IH announced McCardell had received a million bonus After he pressed for more concessions from the United Auto Workers a strike was called on November By the time it ended the strike had cost the company almost million over billion today br By IH s finances were at their lowest point ever and investors had lost faith in the company and its management In Louis W Menk who was a former president and CEO of the Burlington Northern Railroad was appointed as IH s new chairman and CEO Under Menk s guidance IH went through a twenty month reorganization process and he hired a new management team Menk also ensured that IH made necessary cutbacks and it involved the sale of the company s Payline division of construction equipment to Dresser Industries Further assets were sold to Tenneco Inc in br Following the merger tractor production at Farmall Works ceased in Production of the new Case IH tractors moved to J I Case in Racine Wisconsin Production of IH Axial Flow combines continued at the East Moline Illinois factory The Memphis Works plant was closed The truck and engine divisions remained and in Harvester changed the corporate name to Navistar International Corporation having sold the International Harvester name to Tenneco Navistar International Corporation continues to manufacture medium and heavy duty trucks school buses and engines under the International brand name br br br Divisions and products br br br Agriculture Division br br The International Harvester Agricultural Division may have been second to the Truck Division but it was the best known subsidiary One of its early products was the Traction Engine a frame manufactured by Morton Traction Truck Company later bought by IHC featuring an IHC engine br br From to the early s the McCormick and Deering dealerships kept their original branding with Mogul tractors sold by McCormick and Titan tractors at Deering due to the still present competitiveness of the former rivals br br br The early tractors br IH produced a range of large gasoline powered farm tractors under the Mogul and Titan brands Sold by McCormick dealers the Type C Mogul was little more than a stationary engine on a tractor chassis fitted with friction drive one speed forward one reverse Between and were built These tractors had varied success but the trend going into the mid s was toward small and cheap The company s first important tractors were the and models Introduced in they were primarily used as traction engines to pull plows and for belt work on threshing machines The and had similar Mogul and Titan versions br Concurrently IHC purchased a number of smaller competitors Parlin Orendorff P O Plow and Chattanooga Plow were purchased in Other brand names they incorporated include Keystone D M Osborne Kemp Meadows Sterling Weber Plano and Champion br br In IH introduced the Farmall a smaller general purpose tractor to fend off competition from Ford Motor Company s Fordson tractors Farmall was a leader in the emerging row crop tractor segment br Following the introduction of Farmall several similarly styled F Series models were introduced while the original design continued to be produced as the Regular br In IH produced their first diesel engine for the McCormick Deering TD crawler This engine would start on gasoline and then switch to diesel Other diesel engines of this era were difficult to start in cold weather and using gasoline allowed the engine to thoroughly warm up first In it was used in the WD becoming the first diesel tractor on wheels in North America the world s first diesel tractor was Germany s Benz Sendling BS in br br br Heavy tractors br The market for industrial tractors grew in the s The TD the first of IH s heavy equipment crawlers was suited for a wide range of environments As demand for construction equipment grew so did the competition The diversification of the agricultural tractor range into genuine construction equipment whetted appetites for further expansion In IH engaged designer Raymond Loewy to revamp its product line and logo In the first such model was the TD heavy tractor later renamed the TD br br br The letter and standard series br br For model year Raymond Loewy created the styling for the Farmall letter series A B BN C H and M and the McCormick Deering standard series W W and W For the MD model was introduced as the first row crop diesel powered tractor over a decade later IH s largest competitor John Deere introduced a diesel option on their row crop models The letter series tractors were updated to the super series in with the exception of the A which had become a super in and the B and BN which were discontinued in Many of these tractors especially the largest the H M and W models are still in operation on farms today Especially desirable are the diesel powered MD WD and WD s br The letter and standard series of tractors was produced until and was a defining product in IH history br In the smallest tractor in the Farmall line was introduced the Cub With a cu in four cylinder engine and a inch wheelbase the Cub was aimed at small farms which had previously relied on horse drawn equipment Like the various John Deere L LA LI models one of the mechanization resistant markets it hoped to penetrate was the small one mule family farms of the rural American Deep South but the Cub also sold to owners of larger farms needing a second tractor Production of the Cub commenced at the newly acquired and updated Farmall Works Louisville plant formerly the wartime Curtiss Wright Aircraft factory in Louisville Kentucky Selling for in the Cub proved extremely popular and its design continued largely unchanged mechanically until br For in IH tractors the numbered hundred series was offered Although given slightly different styling and few new features they were still updates to the models introduced in The only new tractor in the lineup was the Utility In power was increased in some models and the Utility was introduced br br br Heavy tractors the s br IH would sell TD series tractors between and The TD would be replaced by an upgraded TD A in and variants in In the TD crawler was introduced br br br Series recall br In July IH launched a major campaign to introduce a new line of tractors the series At the Hinsdale Illinois Testing Farm IH entertained over dealers from over countries The series included the first of its kind six cylinder and tractors Unfortunately just a year later these models were recalled due to final drive component failures They had not been updated since and would fail rapidly under the stress of the more powerful series engines Some customers lost faith in IH and migrated to John Deere s New Generation of Power tractors introduced in br br br s br br Throughout the s IH introduced new tractors and new sales techniques As producing tractors was the lifeblood of the company IH would have to remain competitive in this field They both succeeded and failed at this goal but farming was about to change In IH introduced the hp kW and hp kW tractors Until the series all numbered series tractors followed a simple numbering system The first digits was the horsepower rating and the last number was the number of cylinders so a was rated hp and had a cyl engine while the had hp and a v engine In IH made its four millionth tractor an In IH introduced its first hp kW two wheel drive tractor the Another option became available in for the and the new a factory installed cab made by Stopler Allen Co often called the ice cream box due to its shape It could be equipped with a fan and heater By over models and were built The was also built at this time becoming popular for smaller farms with tighter lanes and fields due to its lighter weight br In was the introduction of the bigger and more powerful series tractors as replacements for the popular series These new models included the hp kW hp kW the hp kW and the hp kW The ice cream box cab was still an option In IH introduced the Turbo at hp kW Also that year the hp kW was introduced with the option of gearshift or hydrostatic transmissions The ice cream box cab was dropped and replaced with a new custom cab made by Exel Industries which could be equipped with factory air conditioning heat and an AM radio Another milestone was the introduction of the Hydro basically a hydrostatic version of the and at that time the most powerful hydrostatic transmission tractor made in the US with hp kW br br br s br In IH introduced the series line The new models included the hp kW the hp kW the hp kW turbo the hp kW Turbo and the hp kW V The hp kW WD was also introduced The and were available with Hydro or gearshift transmissions and the choice of two post roll over protection structures ROPs or two different cabs the custom and the deluxe Both could be equipped with air conditioning heat and AM FM radios br In the replaced the long running the hp kW V replaced the and the hp kW and the hp kW WD were introduced Also later that year four post ROPs replaced two post the custom cab was dropped and the deluxe cab was now painted red instead of white Due to horsepower confusions the and Hydro models were restriped the Hydro and the Hydro became the Hydro On February at am the five millionth tractor came off the assembly line at the Farmall Plant in Illinois IH was the first tractor manufacturer to accomplish this Also in IH officially dropped the Farmall name from its tractor This ended an era that began with the first Farmall Regular back in br The hp kW V WD was introduced in In the entire tractor line got a new paint job and decal pattern No longer were the side panels all white with chrome and black decals they were now all red with a black striped sticker This was done to clear inventory for the forthcoming Pro Ag Line br In September IH released their series Pro Ag Line The models included the hp kW the hp kW the hp kW the hp kW Hydro the hp kW the hp kW and the hp kW These new tractors had a new cab dubbed the Control Center that came standard with air conditioning heat and several radio CB options The driver sat well ahead of the rear axle and the fuel tank was mounted behind the cab over the rear axle This increased balance and ride Also in the hp kW along with the series four wheel drives were introduced including the and br In International Harvester introduced the first Axial Flow rotary combine This machine produced at East Moline Illinois was the first generation of over years of Axial Flow combines br In IH introduced two all new tractors the and known as the WD line These tractors were the result of taking two rear ends and hooking them together with a transfer case A year later the was introduced Although these tractors performed well in the field they never sold well br br br s br As the s began IH faced a stable economy yet an unknown fate In September IH announced at a dealership meeting the new Series of tractors which included the hp kW the hp kW and the hp kW IH also released the series which included the hp kW the hp kW the hp kW Hydro and the hp kW These new tractors proved once again that IH was innovative Designed and styled by IH industrial designer Gregg Montgomery Montgomery Design International the new stylish design of the and series changed the look of tractors from that time forward IH spent over million to develop this new series and the result was the last great lineup of tractors from International Harvester br Many technology related innovations were used in the new series A computer monitoring system Sentry was developed and IH became the first manufacturer to add a computer to a farm tractor Other innovations included a Z shift pattern an speed synchronized transmission a forward air flow cooling system which sucked air from above the hood and blew it out the front grille Power Priority three pump hydraulic system color coded hydraulic lines and controls and a new rear hitch system The Series had an unprecedented three year or hour engine and drive train warranty which later became an industry standard Although no new sales records were set IH sold a respectable number of these tractors during their short production time IH also released the series s and planned on making the Super series s but only a handful of these exist today On May the last IH tractor rolled off the factory line a FWA br In the late s IH entered a deal with Spain s Enasa to build diesel engines there as Internacional de Motores After a downturn in the market coupled to problems with Spain s entry into the European Economic Community threatened the profitability of this project International Harvester withdrew in In return for being allowed to escape all conditions of the joint venture IH lost their up front investment in the engine plant and ended up selling British truck manufacturer Seddon Atkinson which had belonged to IH since to Enasa in br br br Brand names of the agriculture division br br IH over the years used a number of brand names to market their tractor and harvesting products br br International br Titan br Mogul br McCormick Deering br McCormick br Farmall br Fairway br Electrall br Cub br br br Other agricultural products br Along with the prominent tractor division IH also sold several different types of farm related equipment such as balers cultivators combines self propelled and pull behind combine heads corn shellers cotton pickers manure spreaders hay rakes crop dusters disk harrows elevators feed grinders hammer mills hay conditioners milking machines planters mills discs plows and miscellaneous equipment br Also produced were twine stationary engines and wagons br br br Earthmoving division br IH built up its earthmoving division over a period of time buying companies and acquiring technology Its heavy tractor range was an established offering however IH wanted to offer innovative new construction technology Significant moves included the purchase of the Frank G Hough company which produced an iconic machine called a PayLoader and the purchase of French company Yumbo which produced hydraulic excavators br Between and IH developed and sold a range of off road dump trucks which were known commercially as PayHaulers br International manufactured and sold an extensive range of heavy equipment In IH renamed this division the Payline division br br br Payloaders br The original payloader model was literally a tractor which had forks welded to the front Frank Hough was the man who invented the concept and Hough s company worked closely with IH until it was purchased in The terminology came to mean any type of front loader machine and loaders were manufactured in a number of varieties included wheeled and track loaders rear wheel loaders or an articulated steering design br br br PayScrapers br In the early s contractors worldwide began using motor scrapers as a means of shifting dirt IH had a hole in its product range it did not offer a motor scraper product to the market One of IH s suppliers a company named Heil Earthmovers manufactured a range of scrapers called Heiliners br Rather than spend money on R D and enter the market at a later date in IH bought Heil s road machinery division incorporating a range of motor and towed scrapers br br br Attachments blades buckets rippers and compaction equipment br IH International had a supply agreement for its heavy tractor attachments with a br company called Bucyrus Erie Amongst a variety of attachment solutions Bucyrus Erie made a range of cable and hydraulically operated blades which fitted International Harvester track type tractors br IH purchased the blades range from Bucyrus Erie in the s and absorbed these into its machinery division br IH also purchased attachments for the tractor range from Isaacson including logging arches and dozer blades Carrying on with its expansion IH purchased Isaacson s attachments division in br br br Electrall br The Electrall system was introduced in it was a short lived attempt to market electrically operated farm equipment and accessories The system co developed with General Electric consisted of a V three phase alternating current generator connected with electric cables to the device to be powered The generator could even power a household A kW Electrall generator was an option on the Farmall tractor and a kW PTO driven version was made The possible applications of Electrall power were many but few made it to market IH marketing materials showed a haybaler being Electrall powered One of the more novel applications of the Electrall was a device to electrocute insects in the field at night basically like a modern day bug zapper but on a larger scale br br br Road vehicles br br br Light duty trucks br IH is often remembered as a maker of relatively successful and innovative light lines of vehicles competing directly against the Big Three The most common were pickup trucks IH made light trucks from to beginning with the Model A Auto Wagon sometimes called the Auto Buggy Production commenced in February at IH s McCormick Works in Chicago although production was moved to Akron Ohio in October that year Powered by a horizontally opposed air cooled twin around hp kW it was a right hand drive model popular in rural areas for high ground clearance on the poor roads typical of the era It featured a rear seat convertible to a carrier bed The Auto Wagon was renamed the Motor Truck in and was a forerunner to the successful modern pickup truck They were called IHC until when the International name was first applied The final light line truck was made on May br Following the early success with the Auto Buggy International released their K and KB series trucks in the mid s They were simpler and sturdier than other trucks released in that era This was followed by the L series in which was replaced by the R series in followed by the S series a name re used later for IH s larger medium duty trucks in In to celebrate IH s golden anniversary as a truck manufacturer this was replaced by the new A line A stands for anniversary With light modifications to its appearance but more serious changes under the shell and a number of new names this design continued in production until replaced by the D in late which looked very similar to the Scout which was already in production br Corresponding with the truck letter lines was the Metro line of step delivery vans Starting in and manufactured through the Metro series was produced and updated with each iteration of IH s truck lines Also special use variants were sold such as the Metro Coach a bus version with windows and passenger seats and Metro front end section and chassis for full commercial customization Additional variants were based on the medium duty engine and chassis lines br IH abandoned sales of passenger vehicles in to concentrate on commercial trucks and school buses br The Scout and Light Truck parts business was sold to Scout Light Line Distributors Inc in br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Sport utility vehicles br One of the company s light duty vehicles was the Travelall which was similar in concept to the Chevrolet Suburban The Travelette was a crew cab available in two or four wheel drive A three door version was available starting in and a four door version was available starting in The Travelette four door crewcab was the first six passenger four door truck of its time br The Scout first introduced in is a small two door SUV similar to a Jeep In the Scout became the Scout II and in Dana axles power steering and power disc brakes became standard After the Light Line pickups and Travelall were discontinued in the Scout Traveler and Terra became available both with a longer wheelbase than a standard Scout II br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Motorhomes br In the s motorhomes were manufactured using IHC engines and bare chassis Most of the bodies were constructed of fiberglass br br br Commercial trucks Truck and Engine Division br International Harvester was an early manufacturer of medium and heavy duty trucks Although based upon truck chassis IH also became the leading manufacturer of the chassis portion of body on chassis conventional type C school buses In IH offered the International Harvester Loadstar which became the premier medium duty truck In IH offered the International Harvester S Series which replaced the Loadstar in br With the truck and engine divisions remaining following the sale of the agricultural division International Harvester Company changed their corporate name to Navistar International in Today Navistar International s subsidiary International Truck and Engine Corporation manufactures and markets trucks and engines under the International brand name From to Ford Motor Company offered International V diesel engines in heavy duty pickup trucks vans and SUVs using the Power Stroke name after br br br s br br In the DCO Emeryville model line was expanded with a conventional officially named the D the model line shared its cab with the COE and was the first International conventional produced with a tilting hood br In International began to phase out the R line series of trucks dating to In place of a comprehensive model line ranging from half ton pickup trucks to its largest Class trucks International introduced two purpose built model lines for commercial use Slotted above its Light Line pickup trucks the Loadstar was a medium duty conventional cab truck For International introduced the heavier duty Fleetstar a short hood conventional slotted between the Loadstar and the heavier duty R and V Line conventionals While no longer serving as a comprehensive model range the Loadstar shared its cab with the A series pickup truck and its derivatives as a cowled chassis the Loadstar was produced for bus use the IHC Schoolmaster Sharing only its name with its conventional cab namesake the Loadstar CO was a low cab COE with a forward tilting cab br In International introduced the CO the first heavy duty COE designed entirely by the company replacing the DCO Emeryville COE which sourced its cab design from Diamond T In a design feature that would be adopted by International COEs into the s the cab was designed with a large trapezoidal grille br In International redesigned the Fleetstar adopting the cab of the Light Line pickups Renamed the Fleetstar A the redesign marked the consolidation of the Fleetstar with the previous R line and V line trucks The largest R and R remained dropping their R prefix alongside the newly introduced M series as the largest International trucks sharing a common cab dating back to The Transtar name made its first appearance as the CO was replaced by the Transtar CO while visually similar to its predecessor the Transtar CO was designed with an all new cab to accommodate larger diesel engines br For International introduced the final version of the Emeryville model line with the DC Transtar replacing the D br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br s br br In International split the CO Loadstar into its own product line dubbed the Cargostar As part of a model update the Cargostar received a larger grille and wider cab over its predecessor Competing directly against the Ford C Series the Cargostar was a medium duty truck fitted with both gasoline and diesel engines shared with the Loadstar conventional br marked the end of the Emeryville product lines as the DC Transtar was replaced by the Transtar Developed as a Class highway tractor the Transtar introduced an all new cab that would be used for International heavy duty trucks through Competing against a wide range of manufacturers the Transtar conventional was offered in both short and long hood configurations for both regional and long distance shipping br In the Paystar series was introduced replacing the and M series trucks dating to Developed for severe service use primarily construction and related applications the Paystar shared its cab with the Transtar using a heavier duty chassis steel fenders and a flat panel hood The medium duty Loadstar received an optional tilting hood with a larger grille and straighter edge fenders updating its appearance for the first time in years br In the Transtar II COE was introduced following a redesign of the Transtar Distinguished by top mounted windshield wipers the Transtar II standardized the previous raised cab option as the previous cubic inch Detroit Diesel V V was replaced by some of the largest displacement engines ever fitted to a road going vehicle including the Cummins KTA diesel I cubic inches and the Caterpillar diesel V cubic inches On the other end of the size scale the Cargostar underwent a second update with a slightly wider cab and a much larger grille sharing the black trim band of the Transtar COE grille br For International launched its Eagle flagship brand used into the s br In the International S series was introduced consolidating the Fleetstar and Loadstar into a single model range While less comprehensive than the product ranges of the s to the s the S series product line included medium duty heavy duty severe service and highway trucks along with a new generation of the Schoolmaster bus chassis from the Class to Class size ranges At its launch the S series was introduced to replace the Fleetstar with lighter duty models phased in to replace the Loadstar during Competing against an extensive segment of the truck industry the S Series was produced in multiple layouts hood lengths and axle configurations gasoline and diesel engines were offered br Produced as a cowled chassis Schoolmaster straight truck or semitractor the S Series was produced from to remaining the longest produced vehicle line ever produced by International as either International Harvester or Navistar br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br s br br In International introduced the CO replacing the Transtar II Sharing only the trapezoidal grille with the previous Transtar II the CO was designed with a larger cab with improved visibility and improved access larger windshield shared doors with the Transtar Paystar conventional to increase fuel economy the Cummins KTA diesel was replaced by a turbocharged Cummins N series I br For the Transtar conventional was reintroduced becoming the International series while the short hood Transtar was discontinued overlapped by the S and S Class tractors the long hood was renamed the International Sharing its cab with the Transtar the was restyled with a larger grille and vertically stacked quad headlamps br br After seeing almost no change since International ended production of the Cargostar the final Loadstar based truck As the company did not develop a tilt cab truck derived from the S series or a distinct vehicle International introduced the low cab COE produced by Nissan Diesel UD The first imported vehicle marketed by the company the was marketed through br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Overseas subsidiaries br br br Australia br br br Australian Army designs br International Harvester Australia a subsidiary of the US manufacturer had a long relationship with the Australian Army with the US designed AS series trucks in the early s The AS x used as a tractor unit and the x AS used as a trayback troop transport br The association between International Harvester Australia and the Australian Army developed and in conjunction with the Army Design Establishment of the Australian Commonwealth Department of Supply designed and constructed a range of trucks for the Australian Army With the body loosely based upon the design of cab of the Canadian Military Pattern truck the first prototype built in was the International Truck Cargo Ton General Service Australian No Mk which was followed by the Mk prototype A variant with a midmounted lb winch resulted in the first production model the Mk entering service in just in time for Australia s entry into the Vietnam War br A five ton version was to follow with three major variants the Truck Cargo Ton with winch F which replaced the Mk in Vietnam service br The F a tipper version that replaced the International Harvester AB teaspoon Tipper in both Vietnam and Borneo theatres of operations br The F wrecker with a lack of ton trucks available because of the Vietnam War the Mk was supplemented with further production with the updated Mk

Crosley br The IH appliance division had originally been developed to manufacture commercial grade items to farmers most of whom had just received electricity by way of the many electrification projects in the U S before and after World War II Among the offerings were milk coolers and walk in freezers for produce and meat Later on IH courted the farmer s wife with kitchen refrigerators available in the latest designer styles The IH spokeswoman for these products was Irma Harding a factory trademark These products were introduced in and sold for less than years The refrigeration division was sold to Whirlpool Corporation in Since the duration of production was short IH appliances are rare today br On the American sitcom Friends the refrigerator in Monica s apartment is a
