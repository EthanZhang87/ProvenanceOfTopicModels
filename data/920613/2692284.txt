construct a dummy filled with cough syrup Chowder stole from a pharmacy owned by his father They offer the dummy to the house to eat hoping to put it to sleep so they can find its heart its furnace

vocal effects of birds br br Monster House was initially set up at DreamWorks Animation SKG based on a pitch by newcomer Gil Kenan Having just finished film school recently Kenan had been having meetings with film producers for a while but hadn t found any success with a screenplay based on the Pac Man video game series going unproduced After Kenan received Dan Harmon s and Rob Schrab s screenplay for ImageMovers Kenan had a meeting with the head of story Bennett Schneir where he was able to pitch his vision for the film Schneir worked for Robert Zemeckis as the head of development at ImageMovers and Kenan had a meeting with Zemeckis quickly thereafter apparently due to the filmmakers wanting to get a director for the project as fast as they could Upon impressing Zemeckis with his pitch Kenan then had a meeting with Steven Spielberg where he pitched the film to Spielberg in a presentation with some sketches and drawings he had drawn before meeting Zemeckis By the studio put the film in turnaround after which Sony Pictures Entertainment picked up the project and began production on August of that year br The original screenplay of Monster House was in Kenan s words absolutely brilliant and laugh out loud funny Due to his experience as a storyteller Kenan decided to preserve all the characters and the tone from Harmon s and Schrab s story but added the idea that the titular house was possessed by a soul leading to the creation of Constance Nebbercracker and the house s backstory To help him revise the script and introduce Constance and Horace Nebbercracker into the plot Kenan brought Pamela Pettler after reading her script for Corpse Bride They worked on the script at her house and to meet the established deadline they finished a draft quickly and sent it to Amy Pascal at Sony s Columbia Pictures As work on the screenplay was underway in a few months of preparation Kenan had assembled a team of storyboard artists led by Simeon Wilkins in Studio City Los Angeles to put up rudimentary boards with scratch dialogue and temporal score with Khang Lee and Chris Appelhans collaborating on paintings for the film br The film was shot using motion capture in which the actors performed the characters movement and lines while linked to sensors a process pioneered by Zemeckis for his film The Polar Express Zemeckis was in the process of starting filming on The Polar Express when he met Kenan who visited the set to see how that film was filmed and discussed with Kenan how they would exactly shoot Monster House deciding that they should prioritize the story before the filming technology though Kenan always felt that the story should use animation to create a world with a living house as he opined that making the house a viable threat and character would better work in an animated setting br The casting for Monster House was a laborious process especially for the lead trio who were portrayed by Mitchel Musso Sam Lerner and Spencer Locke Kenan agreed with head of animation Troy Saliba that actors were needed to portray the roles in a believable way Many of the film s artists interpreted the roles on set and enhanced the lead actors through posed animation that drove the exaggerations of their performances to make them feel subtle and real br Ed Verreaux served as the production designer of Monster House To design the neighbourhood where the story takes place Verreaux realized that the film s setting needed to resemble that of s films like E T the Extra Terrestrial During his discussions with Harmon and Schrab Kenan was told that the film s setting was inspired by that of Wisconsin and Minneapolis Verreaux and Kenan went together on a scouting trip to design the film s locations which involved a visit to Universal Studios backlot during which they were granted access to the suburban street of The Burbs the neighborhood of the show Desperate Housewives and the house of Psycho br Monster House was the first animated feature film using the Arnold rendering software co developed at Sony Pictures Imageworks and the first feature film entirely rendered with unbiased brute force path tracing br Years after the film was released Harmon received a letter from a woman whose year old daughter was having nightmares due to the film Harmon wrote back explaining that the story went the way it did because he had not finished the script when the studio took it and hired other writers to change it in ways he did not approve of He further denounced it by stating that Kenan was a hack and called Spielberg a moron although he later clarified he was just venting and did not really mean the latter br br As with The Polar Express a stereoscopic D version of the film was created and had a limited special release in digital D stereo along with the flat version While The Polar Express was produced for the D IMAX mm giant film format Monster House was released in approximately theaters equipped for new REAL D Cinema digital D stereoscopic projection The process was not based on film but was purely digital Since the original source material was built in virtual D it created a very rich stereoscopic environment For the

a visually dazzling thrill ride that scales greater heights through its winning characters and poignantly etched emotions A scary sharp funny movie this is the best kids flick of the year so far Jane Boursaw of Common Sense Media also gave it stars out of saying This is one of those movies where all the planets align a top notch crew director Gil Kenan executive producers Steven Spielberg and

film a positive review saying that The movie treats children with respect Monster s pre teens are sarcastic think they re smarter than their parents and are going crazy over the opposite sex Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle wrote It s engineered to scare your pants off split your sides and squeeze your tear ducts into submission Michael Medved called it ingenious and slick clever and funny while also cautioning parents about letting small children see it due to its scary and intense nature adding that a PG rating would have been more appropriate than its PG rating A O Scott of The New York Times commented One of the spooky archetypes of childhood imagination the dark mysterious house across the street is literally brought to life in Monster House a marvelously creepy animated feature directed by Gil Kenan br However the film was not without its detractors Frank Lovece of Film Journal International praised director Gil Kenan as a talent to watch but berated the internal logic that keeps changing D J s parents are away and the house doesn t turn monstrous in front of his teenage babysitter Zee But it does turn monstrous in front of her boyfriend Bones It doesn t turn monstrous in front of the town s two cops until in another scene it does In a dismissive review Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote Alert Harry Potter fans will notice the script shamelessly lifts the prime personality traits of J K Rowling s three most important young characters for its lead trio Tall dark haired serious minded DJ is Harry semi dufus Chowder is Ron and their new cohort smarty pants prep school redhead Jenny Spencer Locke is Hermione it is a theme park ride with shocks and jolts provided with reliable regularity Across minutes however the experience is desensitizing and dispiriting and far too insistent br br Monster House opened theatrically on July alongside Clerks II Lady in the Water and My Super Ex Girlfriend and grossed million in its opening weekend ranking
