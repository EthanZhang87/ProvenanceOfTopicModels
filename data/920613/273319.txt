wrote that Otis was a businessman capable of manipulating the entire apparatus of politics and public opinion for his own enrichment Otis s editorial policy was based on civic boosterism extolling the virtues of Los Angeles and promoting its growth Toward those ends the paper supported efforts to expand the city s water supply by acquiring the rights to the water supply of the distant Owens Valley

legitimacy and recognition for his family s paper often forgotten in the power centers of the Northeastern United States due to its geographic and cultural distance He sought to remake the paper in the model of the nation s most respected newspapers such as The New York Times and The Washington Post Believing that the newsroom was the heartbeat of the business Otis Chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting In the paper joined with The Washington Post to form the Los Angeles Times Washington Post News Service to

stance br During the s the paper won four Pulitzer Prizes more than its previous nine decades combined br In Times reporter Michael Hiltzik wrote that br br The first generations bought or founded their local paper for profits and also social and political influence which often brought more profits Their children enjoyed both profits and influence but as the families grew larger the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power and everyone else got a share of the money Eventually the coupon clipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in
