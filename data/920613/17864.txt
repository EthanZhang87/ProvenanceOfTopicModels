The Luddites were members of a th century movement of English textile workers who opposed the use of certain types of automated machinery due to concerns regarding decreased pay for textile workers and a perceived reduction of output quality and often destroyed the machines in organised raids Members of the group referred to themselves as Luddites self described followers of Ned Ludd a mythical weaver whose name was used as a pseudonym in threatening letters to mill owners and government officials br The Luddite movement began in Nottingham England and spread to the North West and Yorkshire between and Mill and factory owners took to shooting protesters and eventually the movement was suppressed by legal and military force which included execution and penal transportation of accused and convicted Luddites br Over time the term has been used to refer to those opposed to industrialisation automation computerisation or new technologies or even progress in general br br br Etymology br The name Luddite occurs in the movement s writings as early as The movement utilised the eponym of Ned Ludd an apocryphal apprentice who allegedly smashed two stocking frames in after being criticized and instructed to change his method The name often appears as captain General or King Ludd Different versions of the legends place his residence in Anstey near Leicester or Sherwood Forest like Robin Hood br br br Historical precedents br The machine breaking of the Luddites followed from previous outbreaks of sabotage in the English textile industry especially in the hosiery and woolen trades Organized action by stockingers had occurred at various times since In Lancashire new cotton spinning technologies were met with violent resistance in and These new inventions produced textiles faster and cheaper because they could be operated by less skilled low wage labourers These struggles sometimes resulted in government suppression via Parliamentary acts such as the Protection of Stocking Frames etc Act br Periodic uprisings relating to asset prices also occurred in other contexts in the century before Luddism Irregular rises in food prices provoked the Keelmen to riot in the port of Tyne in and tin miners to steal from granaries at Falmouth in There was a rebellion in Northumberland and Durham in and an assault on Quaker corn dealers in br Malcolm L Thomas argued in his history The Luddites that machine breaking was one of the very few tactics that workers could use to increase pressure on employers undermine lower paid competing workers and create solidarity among workers These attacks on machines did not imply any necessary hostility to machinery as such machinery was just a conveniently exposed target against which an attack could be made Historian Eric Hobsbawm has called their machine wrecking collective bargaining by riot which had been a tactic used in Britain since the Restoration because manufactories were scattered throughout the country and that made it impractical to hold large scale strikes An agricultural variant of Luddism occurred during the widespread Swing Riots of in southern and eastern England centring on breaking threshing machines br br br Peak activity br See also Barth lemy Thimonnier whose sewing machines were destroyed by tailors br The Luddite movement emerged during the harsh economic climate of the Napoleonic Wars which saw a rise in difficult working conditions in the new textile factories Luddites objected primarily to the rising popularity of automated textile equipment threatening the jobs and livelihoods of skilled workers as this technology allowed them to be replaced by cheaper and less skilled workers The movement began in Arnold Nottingham on March and spread rapidly throughout England over the following two years The British economy suffered greatly in to especially in terms of high unemployment and inflation The causes included the high cost of the wars with Napoleon Napoleon s Continental System of economic warfare and escalating conflict with the United States The crisis led to widespread protest and violence but the middle classes and upper classes strongly supported the government which used the army to suppress all working class unrest especially the Luddite movement br The Luddites met at night on the moors surrounding industrial towns to practice military like drills and manoeuvres Their main areas of operation began in Nottinghamshire in November followed by the West Riding of Yorkshire in early and then Lancashire by March They wrecked specific types of machinery that posed a threat to the particular industrial interests in each region In the Midlands these were the wide knitting frames used to make cheap and inferior lace articles In the North West weavers sought to eliminate the steam powered looms threatening wages in the cotton trade In Yorkshire workers opposed the use of shearing frames and gig mills to finish woolen cloth br Many Luddite groups were highly organized and pursued machine breaking as one of several tools for achieving specific political ends In addition to the raids Luddites coordinated public demonstrations and the mailing of letters to local industrialists and government officials These letters explained their reasons for destroying the machinery and threatened further action if the use of obnoxious machines continued The writings of Midlands Luddites often justified their demands through the legitimacy of the Company of Framework Knitters a recognized public body that already openly negotiated with masters through named representatives In North West England textile workers lacked these long standing trade institutions and their letters composed an attempt to achieve recognition as a united body of tradespeople As such they were more likely to include petitions for governmental reforms such as increased minimum wages and the cessation of child labor Northwestern Luddites were also more likely to use radical language linking their movement to that of American and French revolutionaries In Yorkshire the letter writing campaign shifted to more violent threats against local authorities viewed as complicit in the use of offensive machinery to exert greater commercial control over the labor market br In Yorkshire the croppers who were highly skilled and highly paid faced mass unemployment due to the introduction of cropping machines by Enoch Taylor of Marsden This sparked the Luddite movement among the croppers of Yorkshire who used a power hammer dubbed Enoch to break the frames of the cropping machines They called it Enoch to mock Enoch Taylor and when they broke the frames they purportedly shouted Enoch made them and Enoch shall break them br Luddites clashed with government troops at Burton s Mill in Middleton and at Westhoughton Mill both in Lancashire The Luddites and their supporters anonymously sent death threats to and possibly attacked magistrates and food merchants Activists smashed Heathcote s lace making machine in Loughborough in He and other industrialists had secret chambers constructed in their buildings that could be used as hiding places during an attack br In Jeremiah Brandreth an unemployed Nottingham stockinger and probable ex Luddite led the Pentrich Rising While this was a general uprising unrelated to machinery it can be viewed as the last major Luddite act br br br Government response br The British government ultimately dispatched troops to suppress Luddite activity which historian Eric Hobsbawm said was a larger number than the army which the Duke of Wellington led during the Peninsular War Four Luddites led by a man named George Mellor ambushed and assassinated mill owner William Horsfall of Ottiwells Mill in Marsden West Yorkshire at Crosland Moor in Huddersfield Horsfall had remarked that he would Ride up to his saddle in Luddite blood Mellor fired the fatal shot to Horsfall s groin and all four men were arrested One of the men Benjamin Walker turned informant and the other three were hanged Lord Byron denounced what he considered to be the plight of the working class the government s inane policies and ruthless repression in the House of Lords on February I have been in some of the most oppressed provinces of Turkey but never under the most despotic of infidel governments did I behold such squalid wretchedness as I have seen since my return in the very heart of a Christian country br Government officials sought to suppress the Luddite movement with a mass trial at York in January following the attack on Cartwrights Mill at Rawfolds near Cleckheaton The government charged over men including Mellor and his companions with various crimes in connection with Luddite activities While some of those charged were actual Luddites many had no connection to the movement Although the proceedings were legitimate jury trials many were abandoned due to lack of evidence and men were acquitted These trials were certainly intended to act as show trials to deter other Luddites from continuing their activities The harsh sentences of those found guilty which included execution and penal transportation quickly ended the movement Parliament made machine breaking i e industrial sabotage a capital crime with the Frame Breaking Act of Lord Byron opposed this legislation becoming one of the few prominent defenders of the Luddites after the treatment of the defendants at the York trials br br br Legacy br The Luddites specifically the croppers those who operated cropping machinery are memorialized in the Yorkshire area folk song The Cropper Lads which has been recorded by artists such as Lou Killen and Maddy Prior The croppers were very highly skilled and highly paid before the introduction of cropping machinery and thus had more to lose and more reason to rebel against the factory owners use of machinery Another traditional song which celebrates the Luddites is the song The Triumph of General Ludd which was recorded by Chumbawamba for their album English Rebel Songs br In the th century occupations that arose from the growth of trade and shipping in ports also as domestic manufacturers were notorious for precarious employment prospects Underemployment was chronic during this period and it was common practice to retain a larger workforce than was typically necessary for insurance against labour shortages in boom times br Moreover the organization of manufacture by merchant capitalists in the textile industry was inherently unstable While the financiers capital was still largely invested in raw materials it was easy to increase commitment when trade was good and almost as easy to cut back when times were bad Merchant capitalists lacked the incentive of later factory owners whose capital was invested in buildings and plants to maintain a steady rate of production and return on fixed capital The combination of seasonal variations in wage rates and violent short term fluctuations springing from harvests and war produced periodic outbreaks of violence br br br Modern usage br Nowadays the term Luddite often is used to describe someone who is opposed or resistant to new technologies br In during a British Parliamentary debate a Labour spokesman said that organised workers were by no means wedded to a Luddite Philosophy By the term neo Luddism had emerged to describe opposition to many forms of technology According to a manifesto drawn up by the Second Luddite Congress April Barnesville Ohio neo Luddism is a leaderless movement of passive resistance to consumerism and the increasingly bizarre and frightening technologies of the Computer Age br The term Luddite fallacy is used by economists about the fear that technological unemployment inevitably generates structural unemployment and is consequently macroeconomically injurious If a technological innovation reduces necessary labour inputs in a given sector then the industry wide cost of production falls which lowers the competitive price and increases the equilibrium supply point that theoretically will require an increase in aggregate labour inputs During the th century and the first decade of the st century the dominant view among economists has been that belief in long term technological unemployment was indeed a fallacy More recently there has been increased support for the view that the benefits of automation are not equally distributed br br br See also br Postdevelopment theory br Ted Kaczynski br Ruddington Framework Knitters Museum features a Luddite gallery br
