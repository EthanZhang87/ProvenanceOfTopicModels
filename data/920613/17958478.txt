as cheap mockbusters of comparable more successful films from studios such as Walt Disney Animation Studios Pixar Animation Studios DreamWorks Animation th Century Animation and Blue Sky Studios The company was founded in as a Brazilian subsidiary of American distributor Spot Films to distribute animation with the intention of distribution in its home market of Brazil then seemingly split up and became V deo Brinquedo in later on in they expanded to North America with the falling costs of DVD duplication and packaging and easier access to language translation services Most of V deo Brinquedo s films are still available on DVD and streaming services though it is unclear who the current owners of the studio s output are br br For the first nine years V deo Brinquedo distributed Portuguese dubbed home video releases of shows such as Sonic X and The Little Lulu Show in the Brazilian market br One of the studio s early distributions was an obscure religious themed cartoon called Kingdom Under the Sea Portuguese Reino submarino which only sold a few copies until the release of the Pixar film Finding Nemo Kingdom Under the Sea and Finding Nemo had several similarities such as the presence of a clownfish and a story centered on parent child relationship From the huge number of sales the company had on the cartoon Brinquedo wanted to start not only distributing cartoons but also create their own br Brinquedo s first animations were traditional and in D based on public domain fairy tales and classics such as Pinocchio and the Three Little Pigs but with scripts that modernized the characters They later expanded to D animation their first title being The Little Cars Portuguese Os Carrinhos loosely based on the Pixar animated film Cars Originally aimed at children between two and three years old the film sold over a million copies in its first month in Brazil as well as selling over copies per week in the United States at stores like Walmart br The original idea of the company was to jump on trends raised by the major studios and start production of animation with two to three years in advance With the company borrowing ideas established in Hollywood company director Mauricio Milani stated we tried to imagine what it will be in advance The films are often only just over minutes in length the minimum required to qualify as a feature film and awards qualification Their films English dubbed casts such as The Little Panda Fighter also featured notable voice actors from Kids Entertainment and several Sonic the Hedgehog video games in the s br Originally released with a Brazilian Portuguese soundtrack many of V deo Brinquedo s titles were co produced with Rexmore Company in Brazil and distributed in North America by Branscome International MorningStar Entertainment with English and Spanish soundtracks Brightspark Productions in the United Kingdom and Janson Media on Amazon Prime Video br In the United States the company exploited its low costs to distribute its discs through video rental outlets along with rental kiosks such as Redbox Usually it timed its releases to a major movie release either in theaters or their home video debut often acting as a last resort choice for harried parents or children who saw Brinquedo s look alike covers and confused them with Hollywood film releases or the latter were sold out leaving a parent to rent it to avoid disappointment from their children br br Besides producing its own animated movies V deo Brinquedo has also distributed DVDs of foreign cartoons like Sonic X The Adventures of Super Mario Bros Little Lulu Batfink and a number of lesser known fairy tale films made by Video Treasures now Anchor Bay Entertainment However one of its most controversial distributions is Mega Powers which bears a close resemblance to the series Power Rangers and Super Sentai but was not produced by V deo Brinquedo themselves The series is a production of Intervalo Produ es br br V deo Brinquedo s animated films have been heavily criticized for how they copy other mainstream animated films as well as for their very poor animation voice acting and questionable writing alongside scenes which merely exist as filler so the films runtime can qualify as feature length Erik Henriksen a reporter from The Portland Mercury criticized V deo Brinquedo as being the laziest cheapest movie studio of all time due to similarities between its releases and the films of other animation studios such as Pixar br Marco Aur lio Can nico of Folha de S Paulo who criticized the Little Cars series as a copy of the Pixar film Cars and likewise Ratatoing and Ratatouille discussed whether lawsuits from Pixar would appear The Brazilian Ministry of Culture posted Marco Aur lio Can nico s article on its website Virgin Media also stated even by the ocean floor scraping standards of V deo Brinquedo it s a shameless knock off br The company also seems to depict racist tropes in their movies such as in their infamous film What s Up Balloon to the Rescue where stereotypes of Chinese and French culture are seen br Disney s legal department was contacted by a reporter through a spokesperson about a potential lawsuit but did not comment br br Two of V deo Brinquedo s productions were parodied in an episode of The Amazing World of Gumball called The Treasure in which Gumball picks up a mockbuster DVD called How to Ratatwang Your Panda a poorly rendered CGI film where a panda farts in front of several rats The film parodies both The Little Panda Fighter and Ratatoing which themselves are cheap imitations of Kung Fu Panda and Ratatouille br br Mockbuster br The Asylum another studio notable for mockbusters br Jetlag Productions br br Official website in Portuguese br
