Production history br br br Casting br Dory was initially supposed to be a male character during the pre production of the film Andrew Stanton admitted that he struggled with a writing block upon the character until he overheard his wife watching Ellen Stanton was impressed with Ellen DeGeneres ability to speak many different subjects within a few minutes leading to the casting of DeGeneres Upon the production of Finding Nemo Ellen DeGeneres brought concerns upon the producers of the film due to the comedian potentially lacking the ability to cue dramatic lines and performances Upon the first take of Dory s speech for Marlin to not leave her Ellen s first trial takes was deemed so emotionally rich that the producers would keep said take in the film DeGeneres would credit Stanton for producing the character with her personality in mind particularly for her motto Just keep swimming which is a philosophy that DeGeneres considers core to her own character particularly when her sitcom

as her comedic moments proved very popular with audiences Dory has also been praised for her sympathetic dramatic moments particularly when she attempts to sympathize with a depressed Marlin before he leaves her after failing to rescue Nemo before his supposed death br Many disability organizations have documented on Dory s short term memory loss particularly on how disabled individuals and their peers are represented The Disability Visibility Project and others have praised Dory for her disability being portrayed as integral to the character as opposed to a weakness that must be overcome as evident in how characters respond to Dory Marlin s disapproval of Dory s child like personality and tendency to forget has been ascribed to disabled people being an inconvenience to their peers and despite this Marlin and Dory stick to their main objective of finding Nemo despite their conflicting personalities Dory s concern of her disability objecting herself is put down by her parents telling her that it was her actions and character that define who she is as a person Although Dory has anterograde amnesia organizations such as Autism Awareness and Duke Chronicle have likened her personality and characteristics to people exhibiting traits of autism or ADHD Examples include Dory being unaware of basic social cues being akin to autism her fixation on specific tasks such as translating a mask s writing being akin to ADD The Society for Disability Studies described Dory s disability as being a core element of her character as a progressive representation in mainstream animation but also noted her peers describing her abilities as a person among her disability as a traditional portrayal that a character is overcoming a disability br For her performance as Dory Ellen DeGeneres won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress and was nominated for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress br In DeGeneres would get a nomination for best voice performance from the Washington D C Area Film Critics Association Awards br br br
