father and usurps the throne After growing up in exile the rightful king returns to challenge the usurper and end his tyrannical rule over the kingdom br Initially The Lion King was supposed to be a non musical leaning towards a style similar to that of a documentary George Scribner who had made his feature directorial debut with Oliver Company was hired to direct with Allers joining him soon after following his work as a story artist or head of story on Oliver Company The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin Allers brought in Brenda Chapman and Chris Sanders whom he had worked with on Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin to serve as head of story and production designer respectively br Woolverton who had just wrapped up work as screenwriter for Beauty and the Beast wrote the initial draft of the screenplay for this film but following her departure from the project to write the libretto for the Broadway adaptation of Beauty and the Beast Mecchi and Roberts were brought on board to finish and revise the script Six months into production Scribner left the project due to creative differences with Allers producer Hahn and Chapman about changing it into a musical and Minkoff was hired to replace him in April Additionally Beauty and the Beast directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise were hired to perform some additional rewrites to the script and story Throughout production Allers Scribner Minkoff Hahn Chapman Sanders and several other animators visited Kenya to observe wildlife and get inspiration for the characters and setting br The Lion King was released

a television film titled The Lion Guard Return of the Roar in and a photorealistic remake in which also became the highest grossing animated film at the time of its release In the film was selected

shown briefly talking to Simba s mother Sarabi br br br Production br br br Development br The origin of the concept for The Lion King is widely disputed According to Charlie Fink then Walt Disney Feature Animation s vice president for creative affairs he approached Jeffrey Katzenberg Roy E Disney and Peter Schneider with a Bambi in Africa idea with lions Katzenberg balked at the idea at first but nevertheless encouraged Fink and his writers to develop a mythos to explain how lions serviced other animals by eating them Another anecdote states that the idea was conceived during a conversation between Katzenberg Roy E Disney and Schneider on a flight to Europe during a promotional tour During the conversation the topic of a story set in Africa came up and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death and ideas from personal life experiences such as some of his trials in his career in politics saying about the film It is a little bit about myself br On October Thomas Disch the author of The Brave Little Toaster had met with Fink and Roy E Disney to discuss the idea and within the next month he had written a nine paged treatment entitled King of the Kalahari Throughout several Disney staff writers including Jenny Tripp Tim Disney Valerie West and Miguel Tejada Flores had written treatments for the project Tripp s treatment dated on March introduced the name Simba for the main character who gets separated from his pride and is adopted by Kwashi a baboon and Mabu a mongoose He is later raised in a community of baboons Simba battles an evil jackal named Ndogo and reunites with his pride Later that same year Fink recruited his friend J T Allen a writer to develop new story treatments Fink and Allen had earlier made several trips to a Los Angeles zoo to observe the animal behavior that was to be featured in the script Allen completed his script which was titled The Lion King on January However Fink Katzenberg and Roy E Disney felt Allen s script could benefit from a more experienced screenwriter and turned to Ronald Bass who had recently won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Rain Man At the time Bass was preoccupied to rewrite the script himself but agreed to supervise the revisions The new script credited to both Allen and Bass was retitled King of the Beasts and completed on May br Sometime later Linda Woolverton who was also writing Beauty and the Beast spent a year writing several drafts of the script which was titled King of the Beasts and then King of the Jungle The original version of the film was vastly different from the final product The plot centered on a battle between lions and baboons with Scar being the leader of the baboons Rafiki being a cheetah and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba s childhood friends Simba would not only leave the kingdom but become a lazy slovenly horrible character due to manipulations from Scar so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age By producer Thomas Schumacher who had just completed The Rescuers Down Under decided to attach himself to the project because lions are cool Schumacher likened the King of the Jungle script to an animated National Geographic special br George Scribner who had directed Oliver Company was the initial director of the film being later joined by Roger Allers who was the lead story man on Beauty and the Beast Allers worked with Scribner and Woolverton on the project but temporarily left the project to help rewrite Aladdin Eight months later Allers returned to the project and brought Brenda Chapman and Chris Sanders with him In October several of the lead crew members including Allers Scribner Chapman Sanders and Lisa Keene visited Hell s Gate National Park in Kenya in order to study and gain an appreciation of the environment for the film After six months of story development work Scribner decided to leave the project upon clashing with Allers and the producers over their decision to turn the film into a musical since Scribner s intention was of making a documentary like film more focused on natural aspects By April Rob Minkoff had replaced Scribner as the new co director br Don Hahn joined the production as the film s producer because Schumacher was promoted to Vice President of Development for Walt Disney Feature Animation Hahn found the script unfocused and lacking a clear theme and after establishing the main theme as leaving childhood and facing up to the realities of the world asked for a final retool Allers Minkoff Chapman and Hahn then rewrote the story across two weeks of meetings with directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale who had finished directing Beauty and the Beast One of the definite ideas that stemmed from the meetings was to have Mufasa return as a ghost Allers also changed the character Rafiki from a more serious court advisor into a wacky shaman The title was also changed from King of the Jungle to The Lion King as the setting was not the jungle but the savannah It was also decided to make Mufasa and Scar brothers as the writers felt it was much more interesting if the threat came from someone within the family Allers and Minkoff pitched the revised story to Katzenberg and Michael Eisner to which Eisner felt the story could be more Shakespearean he suggested modeling the story on King Lear Maureen Donley an associate producer countered stating that the story resembled Hamlet Continuing on the idea Allers recalled Katzenberg asking them to put in as much Hamlet as you can However they felt it was too forced and looked to other heroic archetypes such as the stories of Joseph and Moses from the Bible br Not counting most of the segments from Fantasia Saludos Amigos The Three Caballeros Make Mine Music and Melody Time and The Rescuers Down Under a sequel to The Rescuers The Lion King was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story rather than be based on pre existing works and characters The filmmakers have stated that the story of The Lion King was inspired by the lives of Joseph and Moses from the Bible and Shakespeare s Hamlet though the story has also drawn some comparisons to Shakespeare s lesser known plays Henry IV Part and Part br By this point Woolverton had left the production to work on the Broadway adaptation of Beauty and the Beast To replace her Allers and Minkoff met with numerous screenwriters including Billy Bob Thornton and Joss Whedon to discuss writing the new screenplay During the summer of Irene Mecchi was hired as the new screenwriter and months later she was joined by Jonathan Roberts Mecchi and Roberts took charge of the revision process fixing unresolved emotional issues in the script and adding comedic situations for Pumbaa Timon and the hyenas br Lyricist Tim Rice worked closely with the screenwriting team flying to California at least once a month as his songs for the film needed to work in the narrative continuity Rice s lyrics which were reworked up to the production s end were pinned to the storyboards during development Rewrites were frequent with animator Andreas Deja saying that completed scenes would be delivered only for the response to be that parts needed to be reanimated because of dialogue changes Due to the rewrites The Lion King missed its initial release window for Thanksgiving with The Nightmare Before Christmas assuming its release slot Hahn stated the film was delayed to a summer release with much consternation because people said you can t release animation in the summertime br br br Casting br The voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the characters for instance James Earl Jones was cast because the directors found his voice powerful and similar to a lion s roar Jones remarked that during the years of production Mufasa became more and more of a dopey dad instead of a grand king br Nathan Lane auditioned for Zazu and Ernie Sabella for one of the hyenas Upon meeting at the recording studio Lane and Sabella who were starring together in a Broadway production of Guys and Dolls at the time were asked to record together as hyenas The directors laughed at their performance and decided to instead cast them as Timon and Pumbaa For the hyenas the original intention was to reunite Cheech Chong but while Cheech Marin agreed to voice Banzai Tommy Chong was unavailable His role was changed into a female hyena Shenzi voiced by Whoopi Goldberg who insisted on being in the film The English double act Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer auditioned for roles as a pair of chipmunks according to Mortimer the producers were enthusiastic but he and Reeves were uncomfortable with their corporate attitude and abandoned the film Rowan Atkinson was initially uninterested in the studio s offer to voice Zazu later explaining that voice work is something I generally had never done and never liked I m a visual artist if I m anything and it seemed to be a pointless thing to do His friend and fellow Mr Bean writer actor Robin Driscoll convinced him to accept the role and Atkinson retrospectively expressed that The Lion King became a really very special film br Matthew Broderick was cast as adult Simba early during production Broderick only recorded with another actor once over the three years he worked on the film and only learned that Moira Kelly voiced Nala at the film s premiere English actors Tim Curry Malcolm McDowell Alan Rickman Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were considered for the role of Scar which eventually went to fellow Englishman Jeremy Irons Irons initially turned down the part as he felt uncomfortable going to a comedic role after his dramatic portrayal of Claus von B low in Reversal of Fortune His performance in that film inspired the writers to incorporate more of his acting as von B low in the script adding one of that character s lines You have no idea and prompted animator Andreas Deja to watch Reversal of Fortune and Damage in order to incorporate Irons facial traits and tics br br br Animation br br The development of The Lion King coincided with that of Pocahontas which most of the animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two The story artists also did not have much faith in the project with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job because the story wasn t very good and Burny Mattinson telling his colleague Joe Ranft I don t know who is going to want to watch that one Most of the leading animators either were doing their first major work supervising a character or had much interest in animating an animal Thirteen of these supervising animators both in California and in Florida were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film s main characters The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba Ruben A Aquino on adult Simba Andreas Deja on Scar Aaron Blaise on young Nala Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala and Tony Fucile on Mufasa Nearly twenty minutes of the film including the I Just Can t Wait to Be King sequence was animated at the Disney MGM Studios facility More than artists animators and technicians contributed to The Lion King Weeks before the film s release the Northridge earthquake shut down the studio and required the animators to complete via remote work br The character animators studied real life animals for reference as was done for Bambi Jim Fowler renowned wildlife expert visited the studios on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings authenticity The animators also studied animal movements at the Miami MetroZoo under guidance from wildlife expert Ron Magill The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries which employ telephoto lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher who following Scribner s request for realism tried to depict effects such as lens flare and the works of painters Charles Marion Russell Frederic Remington and Maxfield Parrish Art director Andy Gaskill and the filmmakers sought to give the film a sense of grand sweep and epic scale similar to Lawrence of Arabia Gaskill explained We wanted audiences to sense the vastness of the savannah and to feel the dust and the breeze swaying through the grass In other words to get a real sense of nature and to feel as if they were there It s very difficult to capture something as subtle as a sunrise or rain falling on a pond but those are the kinds of images that we tried to get The filmmakers also watched the films of John Ford and other filmmakers which also influenced the design of the film br Because the characters were not anthropomorphized all the animators had to learn to draw four legged animals and the story and character development was done through the use of longer shots following the characters br Computers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways For the wildebeest stampede sequence several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a D computer program multiplied into hundreds cel shaded to look like drawn animation and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real unpredictable movement of a herd Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the two and a half minute stampede The Computer Animation Production System CAPS helped simulate camera movements such as tracking shots and was employed in coloring lighting and particle effects br br br Music br br Lyricist Tim Rice who was working with composer Alan Menken on songs for Aladdin was invited to write songs for The Lion King and accepted on the condition of bringing in a composing partner As Menken was unavailable the producers accepted Rice s suggestion of Elton John after Rice s invitation of ABBA fell through due to Benny Andersson s commitments to the stage musical Kristina fr n Duvem la John expressed an interest in writing ultra pop songs that kids would like then adults can go and see those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them mentioning a possible influence of The Jungle Book where he felt the music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults br Rice and John wrote five original songs for The Lion King Circle of Life I Just Can t Wait to Be King Be Prepared Hakuna Matata and Can You Feel the Love Tonight with John s performance of Can You Feel the Love Tonight playing over the end credits The IMAX and DVD releases added another song The Morning Report based on a song discarded during development that eventually featured in the live musical version of The Lion King The score was composed by Hans Zimmer who was hired based on his earlier work on two films in African settings A World Apart and The Power of One and supplemented the score with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by Lebo M Zimmer s partners Mark Mancina and Jay Rifkin helped with arrangements and song production br The Lion King original motion picture soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on April It was the fourth best selling album of the year on the Billboard and the top selling soundtrack It is the only soundtrack to an animated film to be certified Diamond platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America Zimmer s complete instrumental score for the film was never originally given a full release until the soundtrack s commemorative twentieth anniversary re release in The Lion King also inspired the release Rhythm of the Pride Lands with eight songs by Zimmer Mancina and Lebo M br The use of the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa led to disputes between Disney and the family of South African Solomon Linda who composed the song originally titled Mbube in In July Linda s family filed a lawsuit seeking million in royalties from Disney In February Linda s heirs reached a settlement with Abilene Music who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money br br br Marketing br For The Lion King s first film trailer Disney opted to feature a single scene the entire opening sequence with the song Circle of Life Buena Vista Pictures Distribution president Dick Cook said the decision was made for such an approach because we were all so taken by the beauty and majesty of this piece that we felt like it was probably one of the best four minutes of film that we ve seen and Don Hahn added that Circle of Life worked as a trailer as it came off so strong and so good and ended with such a bang The trailer was released in November accompanying The Three Musketeers and Sister Act Back in the Habit in theaters by then only a third of The Lion King had been completed Audience reaction was enthusiastic causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview Prior to the film s release Disney did test screenings br Upon release The Lion King was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign which included tie ins with Burger King Mattel Kodak Nestl and Payless ShoeSource and various merchandise accounting licensed products In Disney earned approximately billion with products based on the film with million for Lion King toys during Christmas alone br br br Release br br br Theatrical br The Lion King had a limited release in the United States on June playing in only two theaters El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles and Radio City Music Hall in New York City and featuring live shows with ticket prices up to br The wide release followed on June in screens The digital surround sound of the film led many of those theaters to implement Dolby Laboratories newest sound systems br br br Localization br When first released in The Lion King numbered versions overall in as many languages and dialects worldwide including a special Zulu version made specifically for the film in South Africa where a Disney USA team went to find the Zulu voice actors This is not just the only Zulu dubbing ever made by Disney but also the only one made in any African language other than Arabic The Lion King marks also the first time a special dubbing is released in honor of a Disney movie background but not the last in the film Moana received a special Tahitian language version followed in by a M ori version in by a Hawaiian version and in the film Frozen II was dubbed into Northern Sami even though Frozen was not By language adaptations of the film had been produced The special Zulu dubbing was made available on the streaming platform Disney in October together with the M ori dubbing of Moana

holiday of Matariki Much of the Matewa Media production team including producer Chelsea Winstanley director Tweedie Waititi and co musical director Rob Ruha had previously worked on the M ori language version of Moana The Lion King Reo M ori is the first time a language adaptation has translated Elton John s Can You Feel the Love Tonight for the ending credits br br br Re releases br br br IMAX and large format br The film was re issued on December for IMAX and large format theaters Don Hahn explained that eight years after The Lion King had its original release there was a whole new generation of kids who haven t really seen it particularly on the big screen Given the film had already been digitally archived during production the restoration process was easier while also providing many scenes with enhancements that covered up original deficiencies An enhanced sound mix was also provided to as Hahn explained make the audience feel like they re in the middle of the movie On its first

Nemo Monsters Inc and The Little Mermaid during and However none of the re releases of the first three films achieved the enormous success of The Lion King D and the theatrical re release of The Little Mermaid was ultimately cancelled In Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo wrote that the reason why the D version of The Lion King succeeded was because the notion of a D re release was still fresh and exciting and The Lion King D felt timely given the movie s imminent Blu ray release Audiences have been hit with three D re releases in the year since meaning the novelty value has definitely worn off

saying Shakespearean in tone epic in scope it seems more appropriate for grown ups than for kids If truth be told even for adults it is downright strange br Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised the film writing that it has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie br Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers praised the film and felt that it was a hugely entertaining blend of music fun and eye popping thrills though it doesn t lack for heart James Berardinelli from Reelviews net praised the film saying With each new animated release Disney seems to be expanding its already broad horizons a little more The Lion King is the most mature in more than one sense of these films and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children Happily for those of us who generally stay far away from cartoons they have succeeded br Some reviewers still had problems with the film s narrative Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt the film is less of a piece than its revered predecessors and the first to have a core story noticeably less involving than its scintillating peripheral characters TV Guide wrote that while The Lion King was technically proficient and entertaining it offers a less memorable song score than did the previous hits and a hasty unsatisfying dramatic resolution The New Yorker s Terrence Rafferty considered that despite the good animation the story felt like manipulat ing our responses at will as Between traumas the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers and silly

special effects not with an E instead of the F and were intended as an innocent signature created by the effects animation team br Hyena biologists protested against the animal s portrayal though the complaints may have been somewhat tongue in cheek One hyena researcher who had organized the animators visit to the University of California Berkeley Field Station for the Study of Behavior Ecology and Reproduction where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas listed boycott The Lion King in an article listing ways to help preserve hyenas in the wild and later joke d that The Lion King set

Tezuka Productions which created Kimba the White Lion said in that quite a few staff of our company saw a preview of The Lion King discussed this subject and came to the conclusion that you cannot avoid having these similarities as long as you use animals as characters and try to draw images out of them Yoshihiro Shimizu of Tezuka Productions has refuted rumors that the studio was paid hush money by Disney and stated that they have no interest in suing Disney explaining that we think it s a totally different story Shimizu further explained that they rejected urges from some American lawyers to sue because we re a small weak company Disney s lawyers are among the top twenty in the world Tezuka s family and Tezuka Productions never pursued litigation br Fred Ladd who was involved early on with importing Kimba and other Japanese anime into America for NBC expressed incredulity that Disney s people could remain ignorant Ladd stated there was at least one animator remembered by his colleagues as being an avid Kimba fan and being quite vociferous about Disney s conduct during production Animators Tom Sito and Mark Kausler have both stated that they had watched Kimba as children in the s However Sito maintains there was absolutely no inspiration from Kimba during the production of The Lion King and Kausler emphasized Disney s own Bambi as being their model during
