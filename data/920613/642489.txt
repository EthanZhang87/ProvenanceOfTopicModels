The Porsche is the fifth generation of the model sports car manufactured by the German automaker Porsche from until It was replaced by the in but the high performance Turbo S GT and GT variants remained in production until The had little in common with its predecessor with the first all new chassis platform since the original and a new water cooled engine Technically it was a major change a complete break from the original car other than the overall layout br The s development was shared with the roadster only Porsche Boxster whose nameplate was making its debut as Porsche s entry level offering The was released shortly before the for sales Commonalities between the and included the front suspension various interior components and the engine all of which were enlarged for the However the multi link rear suspension was derived from the preceding This was done mainly to save development costs as Porsche was facing financial troubles at that time This move resulted in cost savings of approximately in the development of the car br At its debut the featured the most significant change from the classic series a water cooled engine replacing the previously air cooled engine Progressively stringent emissions and noise regulations environmental concerns a higher expectation for refinement and the need for a high performance valve per cylinder engine made the switch necessary Other major changes include a completely new platform having a sleeker body with a more raked windshield and a re designed interior along with new fried egg shaped headlamps so called due to the amber coloured turn signals instead of previous bug eye headlamps br br br Design and history br br During the s Porsche was facing financial troubles and rumours of a proposed takeover were being spread The signature air cooled flat of the was reaching the limits of its potential as made evident by the Stricter emissions regulations worldwide further forced Porsche to think of a replacement of the air cooled unit In order to improve manufacturing processes Porsche took the aid of leading Japanese car manufacturer Toyota whose consultants would assist in the overhaul of the Zuffenhausen manufacturing facility introducing mass production techniques which would allow Porsche to carry out production processes more efficiently Porsche had realised that in order to keep the in production it would need radical changes This led to the development of the The sharing of development between the new and the entry level Boxster model allowed Porsche to save development costs This move also resulted in interchangeable parts between the two models bringing down maintenance costs br The Porsche was a new design developed by Pinky Lai under Porsche design chief Harm Lagaay from to it was the first that was completely redesigned and carried over little from its predecessor as Porsche wanted the design team to design a for the next millennium Featuring an all new body interior and the first water cooled engine the replaced the from which only the front suspension rear multi link suspension and a speed manual transmission were retained in revised form The had a drag coefficient of Cd resulting from hours spent in the wind tunnel The is mm in longer and mm in wider than its predecessor It is also stiffer courtesy of a chassis formed from high strength steel Additionally it is kg lb lighter despite having additional radiators and coolant br br The was initially available in a coup or a cabriolet Convertible bodystyle with rear wheel drive and later with four wheel drive utilising a litre flat engine generating a maximum power output of kW PS hp The had the same front end as the entry level Boxster After requests from the Carrera owners about their premium cars looking like a lower priced car that looked just like theirs did Porsche redesigned the headlamps of the Carrera in similar to the high performance Turbo s headlamps The design for the initial fried egg shaped headlamps could be traced back to the GT race car br In Porsche introduced the Turbo equipped with a four wheel drive system and a litre twin turbocharged and intercooled flat six engine generating a maximum power output of kW PS hp making the car capable of accelerating from km h mph in seconds An X option which included larger turbochargers and intercoolers along with revised engine control software became available from the factory in increasing power output to kW PS hp In Porsche introduced the Turbo S which had the X option included as standard equipment with the formerly optional Carbon fibre reinforced Silicon Carbide C SiC composite ceramic brakes PCCB also included as standard br In power output on the base Carrera model was increased to kW PS hp marked the final year of production for the base Carrera Coup in narrow body format br br In the standard Carrera models underwent the above mentioned facelift In addition engine capacity of the M engine was also increased to litres across the range yielding gains of kW PS hp for the naturally aspirated models also marked the start of the production of the based Targa model with a sliding glass green house roof system as introduced on its predecessor It also features a rear glass hatch which gave the driver access to the storage compartment Also in the Carrera S model was first introduced The C S as it is called among the enthusiasts shares the wide body look of the Turbo as well as the brakes and suspension br br br Turbo br br The Turbo debuted at the Frankfurt Auto show in September and went on sale in the US in summer of as a model The Turbo is powered by a water cooled twin turbocharged and intercooled litre flat engine derived from the Le Mans winning GT race car The engine is rated at kW PS hp at rpm and lb ft N m of torque It features an all wheel drive system and was available with either a speed manual or a speed Tiptronic transmission It has revised styling and a wider stance than the naturally aspirated Carrera models along with new bi xenon headlamps and a fixed rear wing The Turbo also came with VarioCam Plus and stability management and on the US models an electronically adjustable rear spoiler was included which would rise at a speed of mph km h and lower at mph km h The bodywork was also revised to allow airflow to radiators up front and to accommodate inch wheels and tyres br In the X package was offered as an option on the Turbo that included larger K turbochargers and intercoolers a revised ECU and quad pipe exhaust which raised power output to kW PS hp Other features introduced in were a glove box center mounted cup holders an optional Bose stereo and rain sensing wipers br In Porsche North America restated their horsepower numbers due to SAE changes The Turbo was still listed at hp however the X option was now listed at hp br br The Turbo Cabriolet was introduced for the model year which was the first mass produced Turbo Cabriolet model since the Turbo Cabriolet br br In Porsche introduced the Turbo S model available as either a coup or cabriolet The Turbo S was essentially a Turbo with the X option but also included PCCB disc CD changer and aluminum faced instruments br br br GT variants br br The platform was used as the basis for two lightweight GT variants called the GT and the GT The GT was based on the standard Carrera but was stripped of a great deal of equipment for weight savings featuring stiffer adjustable suspension and upgraded brakes The GT used the bodyshell of the four wheel drive Carrera which incorporated additional front end stiffening The GT was produced in two versions The first commonly referred to as the Mk I GT was introduced in in all markets except North America It featured a naturally aspirated litre flat six engine generating a maximum power output of kW PS hp This engine was shared with the Turbo and was a derivative of the engine developed for the GT race car The Mk II GT variant was based on the second generation of the and featured updated aerodynamics and a more powerful version of the L engine from the MK I now rated at kW PS hp The Mk II was the first GT marketed in the North America An Mk II GT was tested in and accelerated from km h mph in seconds and produced g on the skidpad the second highest number ever recorded by a street legal vehicle at the time br The turbocharged counterpart to the GT the GT was rear wheel drive as well to save weight and to avoid power losses through the transmission This is primarily due to the fact that the GT was built to compete in GT class racing which restricted the use of an all wheel drive system The GT received an added group of aerodynamic body parts and a re tuned version of the Turbo s litre twin turbocharged engine featuring larger turbochargers and intercoolers a revised intake and exhaust system and re programmed engine control software The result was kW PS hp at rpm and N m lbf ft at to rpm enough to launch the car from km h mph in seconds and to a top speed of km h mph Bigger wheels and tyres along with lightweight ceramic brakes were standard The GT s fixed rear wing made of CFRP for the post cars appears to be a concession to racing rules that usually outlaw adjustable aerodynamic components The GT had no rear seat and no air conditioning and came with a factory installed roll cage Both the GT and GT were available only with a speed manual transmission br The Turbo GT and GT models use the Aluminum crankcase of the air cooled with its true dry sump oiling system The six separate individual Nikasil lined cylinders in this engine are covered with two separately installed water jackets each covering a bank of cylinders on each side of the engine thus adding water cooling to a crankcase originally designed for air cooled cylinders the standard Carrera engine has the cylinders and water jackets cast together with the crankcase br br br Special editions br Porsche offered a special edition of the for the year The car named the Millennium edition was based on the Carrera coup Only cars were made It came with polished turbo look wheels br This special edition was finished in Violet Chromaflair paint with natural leather interior and dark burr maple trim The car was available with a Tiptronic or six speed manual gearbox A number plate on the center console and a unique badge on the engine lid and lettering on the door sills make this special edition easy to identify from other base Carrera models br br Porsche celebrated the s year history in using the slogan Jahre Years of the The company also introduced the th Anniversary Edition for model year This model has the Turbo s front end and was available only in GT Silver metallic paint Other unique features included X power kit turbo radiators limited slip differential sport suspension polished spoke alloy wheels unique to this model GT side skirts natural gray leather interior with matching luggage set sports seats there was a power comfort seat option polished exhaust tips heated seats option in Latin America litronic bi xenon headlights special dynamic sealed panels and a special Jahre logo on the engine cover The power was increased to kW PS hp Only units were made to commemorate the year in which the was first introduced br br br Mechanical issues br The Porsche model produced between and is known for some mechanical issues including problems with the rear main seal RMS cylinder cracking slipped sleeves and bore scoring and last but not least the intermediate shaft IMS bearing The rear main seal issue in some models was due to improper machining requiring engine replacement to correct for chronic RMS leaks However Porsche did redesign the rear main seal and the most current PTFE seal addresses most RMS issues Some early models were sleeved from the factory to correct for manufacturing issues however some of these sleeves can drop referred to as a slipped sleeve failure Cracked or scored cylinders are also common with the s and liter engines that can result in intermix of the engine oil and coolant or in the case of bore scoring excessive piston noise oil consumption and smoking can occur The most well known issue is that of the intermediate shaft bearing which was the subject of The Eisen class action lawsuit IMS failure rates of up to were disclosed during the discovery process These mechanical issues do not apply to GT Turbo and GT models br br br Statistics br Specifications for the MkI EU spec models br br Specifications for
