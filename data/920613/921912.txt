The Chrysler Town Country is a minivan that was manufactured and marketed by Chrysler from to the model years The third Chrysler minivan introduced in North America the Town Country adopted its nameplate from the flagship Chrysler station wagon line adopting its exterior woodgrain trim as a design feature for several generations br Marketed as the flagship of the Chrysler minivan line five generations of the Town Country were slotted above the extended wheelbase Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager For Chrysler retired the nameplate with sixth generation Chrysler division minivans becoming the Chrysler Pacifica After the model year Chrysler marked the sale of its millionth minivan under all three nameplates Produced almost continuously for years with the exception of World War II and the Town Country nameplate is the longest produced Chrysler its longevity is second only to the Chevrolet Suburban in worldwide automotive history br Chrysler assembled the first three generations of the model line in its Saint Louis Assembly facility Fenton Missouri The fourth and fifth generation Town Country were produced by Chrysler Canada by Windsor Assembly Windsor Ontario br br The Chrysler Town Country minivan was introduced as a minivan in the spring of as an early model Originally slated for a model year release the nameplate had been placed on hiatus for the first time since as Chrysler discontinued station wagon production after the model year Having sold the line as one of its flagship vehicles similar to the New Yorker and Imperial until the end of the s Chrysler sought to continue the name for a minivan as the vehicles replaced full size station wagons across multiple premium brands Though its s namesake was a station wagon counterpart of the Chrysler LeBaron sedan a Town Country minivan was benchmarked as the equivalent of the largest Chrysler sedans including the New Yorker Landau and Fifth Avenue br The Chrysler Town Country used the Chrysler S platform sharing its bodyshell with the Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager Alongside its role of securing higher profit sales another objective behind the development of the model line introduced roughly months before the release of its successor was to repurpose pre manufactured long wheelbase bodies already slated to be sold by Dodge and Plymouth To minimize any potential tooling costs of a distinct nameplate the Town Country was distinguished from its counterparts with relatively few changes br Initially offered solely in white black was added as an optional color in June all versions were produced with a tan interior Retaining its traditional exterior simulated wood trim from LE trim Voyagers Caravans the model line was styled with a largely monochrome exterior with body color bumpers and side mirrors While the grille was designed specifically for the Town Country adopting the Chrysler lettering from the export Voyager the inch wheels were shared with the Voyager LX painted white with the lower body cladding shared with the Caravan ES slightly extended to compensate for the longer wheelbase Shared with the New Yorker and Fifth Avenue the Town Country received a crystal Chrysler Pentastar hood ornament br The interior was trimmed with leather seats and leather door panels adopting a more contemporary design than Chrysler sedans along with

Chrysler K Cars discontinued for but shared powertrain commonality with its AC AY platform derivatives Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue Imperial and Dodge Dynasty br In contrast to the Caravan and Voyager the Town Country was sold in a single trim level with few distinct options no short wheelbase version was offered In addition to its waterfall grille and crystal Pentastar similar to the New Yorker the Town Country shared its headlights and taillight clusters with the Voyager In line with the previous generation the exterior was styled with monochrome paint including matching side mirrors

a system of seats to simplify installation removal and re positioning marketed as Easy Out Roller Seats When installed the seats are latched to floor mounted strikers When unlatched eight rollers lift each seat allowing it to be rolled fore and aft Tracks have locator depressions for rollers thus enabling simple installation Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks release the floor latches single handedly without tools and raise the seats onto the rollers in a single motion Additionally seatbacks were designed to fold forward Seat roller tracks are permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions are aligned facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames allowing them to be lighter br When configured as two and three person benches available through Generation IV the Easy Out Roller Seats could be unwieldy Beginning in second and third row seats became available in a quad configuration bucket or captain chairs in the second row and a third row three person split bench with each section weighing under lbs The Easy out system remained in use through Generation V where certain models

seating that folded completely into under floor compartments marketed as Stow n Go seating and exclusively available on long wheelbase models br In a development program costing million engineers used

parking brake cables rear climate control lines and the rear suspension However the new seating system precluded incorporation of an AWD system effectively ending that option for the Chrysler minivans

swivel mechanisms are assembled by Camslide a division of Intier The swivel mechanism was designed by and is produced by Toyo Seat USA Corp br The system is noted for its high strength The entire load of the seat in the event of a crash is transferred through the swivel mechanism which is almost twice as strong as the minimum government requirement br The swivel mechanism includes bumpers that stabilize the seat while in the lock position When rotated the seat comes off these bumpers to allow easy rotation br The seat is not meant to be left in an unlocked position or swiveled with the occupant in it although this will not damage the swivel mechanism br Swivel n Go was dropped from the line of Chrysler and Dodge minivans due to a lack of consumer interest br br Chrysler Town Country and Dodge Grand Caravan minivans with Stow n Go Swivel n Go seats are built in Windsor Ontario br Two plants have had the task of building the Town Country with Saint Louis Assembly building it from

Grand Caravan nameplates from until late br From to Chrysler Voyager Grand Voyager cars were assembled in Austria and sold out in Europe and in many other global markets Since the European Version is

flexible fuel plug in minivans began in April The first Town and Country were delivered in Auburn Hills Michigan and Charlotte North Carolina The US million demonstration project is partially financed by a US million grant from the U S Department of Energy DOE The plug in hybrid minivans are equipped with an E compatible L Pentastar engine mated to a front wheel drive with two mode hybrid transmission The plug in hybrid is powered by a liquid cooled KWh lithium ion battery that delivers a total output of horsepower The total vehicle range is mi km br A plug in hybrid version of the next generation Chrysler minivan launched in the U S in late br br Fire incident br br In September Chrysler temporarily suspended the demonstration program All Dodge Ram Plug in Hybrids and Chrysler Town Country plug in hybrids deployed by the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their kWh battery packs overheated The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use different lithium ion chemistry before the vehicles go back on service Chrysler explained that no one was injured from any of the incidents and the vehicles were not occupied at the time nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident but they were withdrawn as a precaution The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the U S Department of Energy that includes the first ever factory produced vehicles capable of reverse power flow The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage reduce power usage when electric rates are high or even sell electricity back to their utility company The company reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated million miles million km before the vehicles were recalled Chrysler also reported that the plug in pickups delivered peak average fuel economy of mpg US L km mpg imp while the plug in hybrid minivans delivered mpg US L km mpg imp br br Generations Chrysler Dodge and Plymouth Minivans Edmunds Archived from the original on August Retrieved January br https web archive org web http
