Manchester as Miss Mouse who sings Let Me Be Good To You br br br Production br The idea of doing an animated film about Sherlock Holmes with animals was first discussed during the production of The Rescuers Veteran layout artist Joe Hale is credited with suggesting to adapt the children s book series Basil of Baker Street by Eve Titus but the project fell into development limbo because of the similarities to The Rescuers In Ron Clements proposed adapting the children s book series into an animated feature and along with story artist Pete Young it was pitched to Disney President Ron Miller who approved the project Earlier in his career Clements created a minute Sherlock Holmes animated short recorded on Super film Because the animators were displeased with the direction The Black Cauldron was heading Basil of Baker Street was approved as an alternative project br Burny Mattinson and John Musker were assigned as the original directors while Dave Michener was also added as co director Miller became the producer for the film The first idea for the victim was for Olivia then an older and potential love interest whom Dawson falls for but Miller suggested the character be a little girl someone they the audience can feel sorry for One of the dropped characters was a stool pigeon who always hung around Buckingham Palace and tipped Basil off about the skullduggery The writers dropped the characters deciding for Basil to figure it out for himself br With the departure of Miller in the board of directors appointed Michael Eisner who had resigned from Paramount Pictures to become the new CEO Eisner recruited former production head Jeffrey Katzenberg to become studio chairman over Disney s film division Following a story reel screening of Basil Eisner and Katzenberg complained about the slow pacing of the story and ordered for rewrites before animation would commence Although the intended release was set for Christmas Eisner slashed the projected production budget at million in half where it was green lit at million and moved the release date up to July giving the production team one year to complete the film To replace Miller who had been producer Feature Animation chairman Roy E Disney assigned Mattinson to serve as director producer but finding both tasks much too laborious Mattinson decided to remain as producer Musker and Michener remained as directors but with the shortened production schedule Clements became an additional director br Following the box office under performance of the Paramount Amblin film Young Sherlock Holmes Eisner decided to rename Basil of Baker Street into The Great Mouse Detective feeling the name Basil was too English The re titling of the film proved to be unpopular with the filmmakers so much that animator Ed Gombert wrote a satirical interoffice memo allegedly by studio executive Peter Schneider which gave preceding Disney films generic titles such as Seven Little Men Help a Girl The Wonderful Elephant Who Could Really Fly The Little Deer Who Grew Up The Girl with the See through Shoes Two Dogs Fall in Love Puppies Taken Away and A Boy a Bear and a Big Black Cat These generic titles would later become a category on Jeopardy br br br Casting br Following a succession of American and British actors who read for the part of Basil Royal Shakespeare actor Barrie Ingham won the role within six minutes of his audition Val Bettin was co director Ron Clements s first choice for Dawson For Olivia Susanne Pollatschek was selected over hundreds of other applicants while Alan Young who had voiced Scrooge McDuck for Mickey s Christmas Carol was selected to voice her father Hiriam because of his authentic Scottish brogue br When the filmmakers watched the comedy film Champagne for Caesar to study Ronald Colman s performance as a possible model for Basil they immediately decided to cast Vincent Price who also starred in the film as Ratigan A veteran actor for fifty two years Price was willing to do an audition commenting If anybody but Disney had asked me I would have been offended Following a voice test veteran voice artist Candy Candido recorded his dialogue for Fidget in one hour To heighten the pitch the tape recording of his voice was sped up Candido s natural voice was kept for one character shouting Get off you eight legged bum br br br Animation br br Basil was first modeled on Bing Crosby but the animators eventually took inspiration from Leslie Howard Initially Ratigan had been designed as thin weasely and ratlike Following the screening of Champagne for Caesar Glen Keane noted that following the casting of Price his expressive voice and attitude inspired us to further redesign the character Additionally during one story meeting Glen Keane decided to base the stature of Ratigan on then Disney CEO Ron Miller who was a former football player for the Los Angeles Rams Furthermore Keane lifted his personality as he was thumbing through these photographs of people of London in the s of railroad men and there was this one guy smoking a cigar he had a top hat and there was just something about this guy this Ratigan this rat sucking the cigar completely dressed to the hilt he was sharp and perfect he s a sewer rat dressed like a king and he lives as a king The following supervising animators included Mark Henn for Basil Hendel Butoy for Dawson Rob Minkoff for Olivia Andreas Deja for Queen Moustoria Ruben Aquino for Mrs Judson and Mike Gabriel for Toby and Felicia br The original finale was to take place on the hands of Big Ben with Ratigan eventually falling to his demise However layout artist Mike Peraza approached Musker with the idea of restaging the final confrontation so the characters would break through the face of Big Ben with the grinding clockwork gears providing added menace in which Musker agreed Peraza s inspiration for the scene was a Japanese anime film The Castle of Cagliostro the feature film debut of animator Hayao Miyazaki which is part of the Lupin III franchise The Castle of Cagliostro which Peraza was a fan of featured a climactic scene involving characters amidst giant turning gears in a clock tower Pereza and his team was sent to London for video reference and were granted unprecedented access to the clockworks inside Big Ben Because the bells would chime at every quarter hour the team completed their research in one hour br Back at the Feature Animation building animators Phil Nibbelink and Tad Gielow spent months designing the interior of Big Ben with each gear produced as wire frame graphics on a computer that was printed out and traced onto animation cels onto which the colors and characters were added The two minute climax scene thus used computer generated imagery CGI making it the first Disney film to extensively use computer animation a fact that Disney used to promote the film during marketing br The film was the last work to feature Eric Larson as an animation consultant before his retirement Larson was the last of Disney s Nine Old Men the group that had defined much of Disney s theatrical direction since the s The character of Dr Dawson was modeled on Larson as a tribute br br br Music br br Unusually for a Disney animated feature there was no soundtrack album released alongside the film it was released in alongside the film s reissue under its new title by Var se Sarabande the only Disney cartoon to have an original soundtrack on the label to date and the only one not to be issued under a Walt Disney imprint The album marked the debut of Henry Mancini for score composition of an animated feature aside from the animated opening for The Pink Panther br Initially Mancini composed a song titled Are You the One Who Loves Me to serve as a parody of a Victorian British music hall Already in rough animation the song was recorded by Shani Wallis However Katzenberg and the new management desired a more contemporary song as they would help make the film more marketable Michael Jackson was considered by Eisner to voice a character who would enter the saloon confront Basil and sing a song at the tavern but the suggestion was met with uncomfortable silence for which Eisner withdrew the idea Eisner later proposed for Madonna to perform the song Eventually Melissa Manchester was brought in she wrote and performed Let Me Be Good to You by which the rough animation had to be re timed and often re animated to properly sync with the song Mancini also co wrote two of the film s three original songs The World s Greatest Criminal Mind and Goodbye So Soon both performed by Vincent Price br br br Songs br Original songs performed in the film include br br br Release br During the film s initial theatrical release the film was

Detective which looks more fully animated than anything in some years br London s Time Out magazine wrote As usual with film noir it is the villain who steals the heart and one is rooting for in the breathtaking showdown high up in the cogs and ratchets of Big Ben Nina Darnton of The New York Times applauded that t he heroes are appealing the villains have that special Disney flair humorous blackguards who really enjoy being evil and the script is witty and not overly sentimental Johanna Steinmetz also from The Chicago Tribune graded the film three and a half stars out of four writing This movie is cute cute cute but it s a higher grade of cute than The Rescuers and The Fox and the Hound The key to good Disney animation is character and facial expression and Detective abounds in both Alex Stewart reviewed The Great Mouse Detective for White Dwarf and stated that After their dismal fudge of The Black Cauldron it s good to see the Disney studios taking a step however cautious towards the world of animation as it is today The style is looser and more vigorous and in a climactic fight inside Big Ben effectively amalgamates computer drawn clockwork with hand drawn characters

Detective may not rank with Disney s classics but it s an amiable entertaining picture with some stylishly dark visuals Metacritic gave the film a score of based on reviews indicating generally
