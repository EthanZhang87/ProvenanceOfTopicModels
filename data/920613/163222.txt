president of rival film studio Paramount Pictures from to and had brief stints at the major television networks NBC CBS and ABC br Eisner s year stint at Disney saw the revitalization of the company s poorly performing animation studios with successful films such as The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast Aladdin and The Lion King a period known as the Disney Renaissance Eisner additionally broadened the company s media portfolio by leading the acquisitions of ABC most of ESPN and The Muppets franchise Eisner also led major investments and expansion of the company s theme parks both domestically and globally including the openings of Disney MGM Studios now Disney s Hollywood Studios in Euro Disney now Disneyland Paris in Disney s Animal Kingdom in Disney s California Adventure Park and Tokyo DisneySea in Walt Disney Studios Park in and Hong Kong Disneyland in br Eisner s final years at Disney were tumultuous a string of box office bombs in the early s public feuds with former associates such as Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steve Jobs and dissatisfaction with Eisner s management style culminated in the Save Disney campaign organized by Roy E Disney during which Eisner rapidly lost the confidence of much of Disney s Board of Directors As a result of the pressure from the campaign Eisner announced in March that he would step down as CEO prematurely handing day to day duties to Bob Iger before formally leaving the company in September He went on to create the stop motion animated sitcom Glenn Martin DDS in br br br Early life and education br Eisner was born to an affluent secular Jewish family in Mount Kisco New York His mother Margaret n e Dammann whose family founded the American Safety Razor Company was the president of the Irvington Institute a hospital that treated children with rheumatic fever His father Lester Eisner Jr was a lawyer and regional administrator of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development His great grandfather Sigmund Eisner established a very successful clothing company that was one of the first uniform suppliers to the Boy Scouts of America and his great grandmother Bertha Weiss belonged to an immigrant family that established the town of Red Bank New Jersey Eisner has one sister Margot Freedman br He was raised on Park Avenue in Manhattan He attended the Allen Stevenson School kindergarten through ninth grade followed by The Lawrenceville School in th through his senior year and graduated from Denison University in with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English He is a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity and credits much of his success to his time at Keewaydin Canoe Camp for boys in Vermont br br br ABC and Paramount br After two brief stints at NBC and CBS Barry Diller at ABC hired Eisner as assistant to the national programming director Eisner moved up the ranks eventually becoming a senior vice president in charge of programming and development In Diller who had by then moved on to become chairman of Paramount Pictures recruited Eisner from ABC and made him president and COO of the movie studio During his tenure at Paramount the studio produced films such as Saturday Night Fever Grease the Star Trek film franchise Ordinary People Raiders of the Lost Ark An Officer and a Gentleman Flashdance Terms of Endearment Beverly Hills Cop and Footloose and TV shows such as Happy Days Laverne Shirley Cheers and Family Ties br Diller left Paramount on September and as his prot g Eisner expected to assume Diller s position as studio chief When he was passed over for the job though he left to look for work elsewhere and lobbied for the position of CEO of The Walt Disney Company br br br The Walt Disney Company br Following the deaths of founders Walt Disney in and Roy O Disney in The Walt Disney Company narrowly survived several takeover attempts Its shareholders Sid Bass and Roy E Disney brought in Eisner as CEO and chairman of the board and former Warner Bros chief Frank Wells as president to replace Ron W Miller in and strengthen the company Eisner brought in Jeffrey Katzenberg as Walt Disney Studios chairman br A couple of years after becoming chairman and CEO Eisner became the host of The Wonderful World of Disney making him the public face of the company as well as its top executive Eisner was not a performer by profession and studio management did not believe he could do the hosting job After filming a test video with his wife Jane and a member of his executive team which required multiple takes Eisner came across as stiff and awkward Disney executives were pretty much unanimous that the test was a failure Eisner stubbornly persisted in the face of almost unanimous criticism Eisner hired Michael Kay a director of political commercials for then U S Senator Bill Bradley to help him improve his on camera performance As a result Eisner was well recognized by children at the company s theme parks who often asked him for autographs br During the second half of the s and early s Eisner revitalized Disney Beginning with the films Who Framed Roger Rabbit which was brought to Disney by Jeffrey Katzenberg and The Little Mermaid a Ron Clements idea that Eisner originally panned its flagship animation studio enjoyed a series of commercial and critical successes Disney also broadened its adult offerings in film when it acquired Miramax Films in Under Eisner Disney acquired many other media sources including ABC most of ESPN Fox Family now known as Freeform and The Muppets franchise The ABC purchase in particular reunited Eisner with his former employer br In the early part of the s Eisner and his partners set out to plan The Disney Decade which was to feature new parks around the world existing park expansions new films and new media investments While some of the proposals were completed most were not Those completed included the Euro Disney Resort now Disneyland Paris which was vastly over budget and had low attendance and was acknowledged by Eisner to be his real financial disappointment Disney MGM Studios now Disney s Hollywood Studios Disney s California Adventure Park now Disney California Adventure Disney MGM Studios Paris eventually opened in as Walt Disney Studios Park and various film projects including a Who Framed Roger Rabbit franchise However the lackluster success of Disney s Animal Kingdom in the years after its opening general stagnation in Disney s revenues and various corporate issues and disputes would dampen Eisner s later career br In Katzenberg had lobbied to become Eisner s second in command which would have meant moving Frank Wells from president to vice chairman to which Eisner replied that Wells would feel hurt in that scenario Coincidentally Wells died in a helicopter crash in When Eisner did not appoint Katzenberg to Wells now available post tensions arose between the two that led to Katzenberg s resignation At the time Eisner refused to pay Katzenberg his contractual bonus despite Katzenberg s offer to accept million as a settlement much less than was actually owed Katzenberg was forced to take the issue to court who ruled in his favor The final settlement was million Katzenberg went on to found DreamWorks SKG with partners Steven Spielberg and David Geffen Eisner recalled that Roy E Disney who did not like him at all I forget the reason but Jeffrey probably did not treat him the way that Roy would have wanted to be treated said to me If you make him the president I will start a proxy fight br Eisner then recruited his friend Michael Ovitz one of the founders of Creative Artists Agency to be President with minimal involvement from Disney s board of directors which at the time included Oscar winning actor Sidney Poitier the CEO of Hilton Hotels Corporation Stephen Bollenbach former U S Senator George Mitchell Yale dean Robert A M Stern and Eisner s predecessors Raymond Watson and Card Walker Ovitz lasted only months partly due to outright hostility from Sandy Litvak and Steve Bollenbach and a lack of support by Eisner and left Disney in December via a no fault termination with a severance package of million in cash and million stock options worth roughly million at the time of Ovitz s departure The Ovitz episode engendered a long running derivative suit which finally concluded in June almost years later Chancellor William B Chandler III of the Delaware Court of Chancery despite describing Eisner s behavior as falling far short of what shareholders expect and demand from those entrusted with a fiduciary position found in favor of Eisner and the rest of the Disney board because they had not violated the duty of care owed by a corporation s officers and board to its shareholders br br br Save Disney campaign and retirement br Despite his record of success while serving as President CEO and Chairman of The Walt Disney Company Eisner was also known for his habit of integrating much of his Paramount films with Disney These moves were seen as unfavorable and led to Eisner s isolation from other Disney executives by On November Roy E Disney the son and nephew of co founders Roy O Disney and Walt Disney respectively resigned from his positions as Disney vice chairman and chairman of Walt Disney Feature Animation His reasons for resigning was his feeling that there was too much micromanagement within the studio flops with the ABC television network the company s growing timidity in the theme park business the Walt Disney Company turning into a rapacious soul less company Eisner s refusal to establish a clear succession plan as well as the studio releasing a string of box office movie failures starting in the year such as The Emperor s New Groove and Treasure Planet and the company s well publicized distribution disputes with long time production partner Pixar Animation Studios and its CEO Steve Jobs with whom Disney had produced such animated feature film hits as Toy Story A Bug s Life Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo which were critically acclaimed and financially successful for both partners br On March at Disney s annual shareholders meeting a surprising and unprecedented of Disney s shareholders predominantly rallied by former board members Roy Disney and Stanley Gold withheld their proxies to re elect Eisner to the board This vote followed a stunning rebuke of Eisner and his executive and chairman practices by both the Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis a shareholder advisory service Disney s board then gave the chairmanship position to board member George Mitchell However the board did not immediately remove Eisner as chief executive br On March Eisner announced that he would step down as CEO one year before his contract expired and handed off day to day duties to Bob Iger who had been serving as Disney s President and Chief Operating Officer and had just been selected by the directors as the CEO designate Eisner did not initially promote Iger as a successor until after the board put pressure on Eisner to resign To reporters and contrary to his actual intentions Eisner remarked that I would not have agreed to leave if it hadn t been Bob Because of governance they wanted a big search and everything And by the end of the search it was clear that I was able to convince the board our newly constructed board that Bob was great Within Disney though Eisner was telling Board members that Iger lacked stature On September Eisner resigned both as an executive and as a member of the board of directors and severing all formal ties with the company he waived his contractual rights to perks such as the use of a corporate jet and an office at the company s Burbank headquarters br While Eisner did much to stabilize and promote Disney in his early years as CEO his performance in later years garnered much criticism Beginning with the lavish even reckless spending on Euro Disney and continuing with the poorly planned and executed foray into the Internet and perhaps worst of all the acquisition of the Fox Family cable network each of which is a more than billion mistake Eisner squandered Disney s assets This is even before considering the exit of Jeffery Katzenberg the failure to honour his contract and the hiring and firing of Michael Ovitz personnel and judgment errors which in the cost to Disney and the vitriol and publicity they generated are without parallel in American business history Eisner controlled and manipulated the board by keeping members isolated preferring to communicate one on one selectively doling out information access and benefits and ruthlessly dispatching anyone who dared challenge him br In his book The Ride of a Lifetime Bob Iger quotes Eisner answering criticism for micro managing as saying Micromanaging is underrated br In January Disney s corporate headquarters in Burbank was renamed to Team Disney The Michael D Eisner Building in Eisner s honor br br br Post Disney br On October Eisner was a guest host for the Charlie Rose talk show His guests were John Travolta and his ex boss Barry Diller Impressed with Eisner s performance CNBC President Mark Hoffman hired Eisner in early to host his own talk show Conversations with Michael Eisner The show mostly featured CEOs political leaders artists and actors until its cancellation in Eisner was also an executive producer of the show br In March Eisner s investment firm The Tornante Company launched a studio Vuguru that produces and distributes videos for the Internet portable media devices and cell phones In October Eisner through his Tornante Company investment firm partnered with Madison Dearborn Partners in the acquisition of Topps Company the bubble gum and collectibles firm He produced a mockumentary style show about his takeover of the Topps Company called Back on Topps In January he sold Topps to Fanatics following its loss of the Major League Baseball licensing rights His investment firm has funded the critically acclaimed Netflix series BoJack Horseman br The College of Education at California State University Northridge is named in his honor br In Eisner used his own money to produce a claymation show called
