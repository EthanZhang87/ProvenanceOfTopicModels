Itzhak Perlman Quincy Jones Bette Midler James Earl Jones Penn Teller James Levine and Angela Lansbury in live action scenes directed by Don Hahn br After numerous unsuccessful attempts to develop a Fantasia sequel The Walt Disney Company revived the idea shortly after Michael Eisner became chief executive officer in Development paused until the commercial success of the home video release of Fantasia convinced Eisner that there was enough public interest and funds for a sequel to which he assigned Disney as executive producer The music for six of the film s eight segments is performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by James Levine The film includes The Sorcerer s Apprentice from the original Each new segment was produced by combining traditional animation with computer generated imagery Fantasia is also generally linked to the Disney Renaissance as it commemorates Walt Disney s third animated feature film br Fantasia premiered on December at Carnegie Hall in New York City as part of a concert tour that also visited London Paris Tokyo and Pasadena California The film was then released in IMAX theaters worldwide from January to April marking the first major Hollywood motion picture to be released in IMAX and also the first feature length animated film to be released in the format Its general release in regular theaters followed on June The film received mostly positive reviews from critics who praised several of its sequences while also deeming its overall quality uneven in comparison to its predecessor However budgeted at about million the film only grossed million worldwide making it a box office bomb br br br Program br br Symphony No by Ludwig van Beethoven The film begins with the sound of an orchestra tuning and Deems Taylor s introduction

who fly and frolic through the clouds to emerge into outer space Introduced by Steve Martin who gives a brief history on Fantasia s original purpose after which Itzhak Perlman introduces the segment proper br Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin Set in New York City in the s and designed in the style of Al Hirschfeld s known caricatures of the time the story follows four individuals who wish for a better life Duke is a construction worker who dreams of becoming a jazz drummer Joe is a down on his luck unemployed man who wishes he could get a job Rachel is a little girl who wants to spend time

sorcerer Yen Sid who attempts some of his master s magic tricks before knowing how to control them Introduced by Penn Teller rather than using an archived recording of Deems Taylor introducing the segment as in the original film The scene where Mickey shakes hands with Levine s predecessor Leopold Stokowski is like that in the original film but Mickey is now voiced by Wayne Allwine instead of Walt Disney This outro leads directly to the intro for Pomp and Circumstance with Donald Duck and Daisy Duck voiced by Tony Anselmo and Russi Taylor respectively br Pomp and Circumstance Marches and also known as Land of Hope and Glory by Sir Edward Elgar Based on the story of Noah s Ark from the Book of Genesis Donald Duck is Noah s assistant and Daisy Duck is Donald s girlfriend Donald is given

forest to its normal state Introduced by Angela Lansbury br br br Production br br br Development br br In Walt Disney released Fantasia his third animated feature film consisting of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music Initially he planned to have the film on continual release with new segments replacing older ones so audiences would never see the same film twice The idea was dropped following the film s initial low box office receipts and a mixed response from critics Following preliminary work on new segments the idea was shelved by and was not revisited for the remainder of Disney s life In animators Wolfgang Reitherman and Mel Shaw started preliminary work on Musicana a feature film mixing jazz classical music myths modern art following the old Fantasia format that was to present ethnic tales from around the world with the music of the various countries The project was cancelled in favor of Mickey s Christmas Carol br br The idea of a Fantasia sequel was revived shortly after Michael Eisner became chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company in when Walt s nephew vice chairman Roy E Disney suggested it to him at a lunch The idea had first entered Disney s mind ten years earlier and he recalled Eisner s reaction It was as if a big light bulb went on over his head The idea was enticing but we didn t have the resources to carry it out However Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg showed a lack of interest in the film He had once asked Andr Previn to work on a Fantasia film but Previn declined after he learned it was to feature songs by the Beatles rather than classical music Eisner approached Leonard Bernstein with the same idea but while he seemed enthusiastic Bernstein died before production began It took a further seven years before the film was reconsidered after the reissue of Fantasia grossed million domestically and the announcement of its limited availability on home video in prompted million pre orders Disney saw its commercial success as a sign that there was enough public interest in the Fantasia franchise to make a sequel Eisner finally gave the green light to the film in and had Disney serve as executive producer on the basis that its production was funded by the proceeds from the video sales Disney assigned Donald W Ernst as producer and Hendel Butoy as supervisory director having liked his work on The Rescuers Down Under br During the search for a suitable conductor Disney and Walt Disney Feature Animation president Thomas Schumacher invited Metropolitan Opera conductor James Levine and manager Peter Gelb to a meeting in September Disney recalled I asked James what his thought was on a three minute version of Beethoven s fifth symphony He paused and went I think the right three minutes would be beautiful In November Disney Schumacher Levine Gelb and Butoy met in Vienna to discuss a collection of story reels developed one of them being Pines of Rome which Levine took an immediate liking to Butoy described Levine s enthusiasm toward the film as like a kid in a candy store Because Katzenberg continued to express some hostility towards the film Disney held development meetings without him and reported directly to Eisner instead something that author James B Stewart wrote would have been unthinkable on any other future animation project br Production began under the working title of Fantasia Continued with a release in The title was changed to Fantasia followed by Fantasia to coincide with its theatrical release in Disney formed its initial running order with half of the Fantasia program and only three or four new numbers with the aim of releasing a semi new movie Realizing the idea would not work he kept three Fantasia segments The Sorcerer s Apprentice The Nutcracker Suite and Dance of the Hours in the program for quite a while Night on Bald Mountain was the most difficult segment for him to remove from his original running order because it was one of his favorites He had placed it in the middle of the film without Ave Maria but felt it did not work and scrapped the idea Later on Dance of the Hours was dropped and The Nutcracker Suite was replaced by Rhapsody in Blue during the last few months of production following the response from numerous test screenings Disney kept The Sorcerer s Apprentice in the final program as a homage to Fantasia The segment underwent digital restoration by Cinesite in Los Angeles Disney considered using Clair de Lune a piece originally made for Fantasia that followed two Great white herons flying through the Everglades at night but thought it was pretty boring An idea to have a nightmare and a dream struggling for a sleeping child s soul to Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini by Sergei Rachmaninoff was fully storyboarded but fell through br br br Segments br br br Symphony No br Symphony No is an abstract segment created by Pixote Hunt with story development by Kelvin Yasuda In December after rejecting pitches from four other animators Disney and Ernst asked Hunt for his ideas Hunt first thought of the story on a morning walk in Pasadena California one depicting a battle of good against evil and how the conflict resolves itself It took Hunt approximately two years from start to finish to complete the segment Disney and Ernst decided to go with Hunt s idea Hunt avoided producing an entirely abstract work because you can get something abstract on every computer screen with ease Hunt divided the segment into mini scenes noting down points in which he would employ vivid color when the music was bright and fluid and then switch to darker hues when the music felt darker and denser To gain inspiration in how the shapes would move Hunt and his associates visited San Diego Zoo a butterfly farm and observed slow motion footage of bats The segment combines hand drawn backgrounds using pastels and paint that were scanned into the Computer Animation Production System CAPS and computer generated imagery CGI of abstract shapes and effects which were layered on top Hunt explained that scanning each drawing was a one shot deal as the platen that pressed onto it would alter the pastel once it had been scanned At one point during production Hunt and Yasuda completed pastel drawings in eight days The segment was produced using Houdini animation software br br br Pines of Rome br Pines of Rome was the first piece Disney suggested for the film as well as the first to be animated designs appeared in the studio s dailies as early as October Butoy served as director with James Fujii handling the story The opening to the piece gave Disney the idea of something flying Butoy sketched the sequence on yellow Post it notes The story originally involved the whales flying around from the perspective of a group of penguins but the idea was scrapped to make the baby whale a central character The whales were also set to return to Earth but Butoy said it never felt quite right leading to the decision to have them break through a cloud ceiling and enter a different world by the supernova Butoy created a musical intensity chart for the animators to follow which tracked the ups and downs of the music as the music brightens so does the color and vice versa He explained that because CGI was in its infancy during development the first third of the segment was hand drawn using pencil to get a feel of how the whales would move When the drawings were scanned into the CAPS system Butoy found the whales were either moving too fast or had less weight to them The drawings were altered to make the whales slow down and more believable The eyes of the whales were drawn by hand as the desired looks and glances were not fully achievable using CGI Butoy recalled the challenge of having the water appear and move as naturally as possible the team decided to write computer code from scratch as traditional animation would have been too time consuming and would have produced undesired results The code handling the pod of whales was written so the whales would move away if they were to collide and not bump into overlap or go through each other The same technique was used for the stampede scene in The Lion King which was produced at the same time br br br Rhapsody in Blue br br Rhapsody in Blue is the first Fantasia segment with music from the American composer It originated in when director and animator Eric Goldberg approached Al Hirschfeld about the idea of an animated short set to Gershwin s composition in the style of Hirschfeld s illustrations In December the Goldbergs pitched Rhapsody in Blue to Thomas Schumacher and received the green light to produce it and Hirschfeld agreed to serve as artistic consultant and allowed the animators to adapt his works Duke is named after jazz musician Duke Ellington The bottom of his toothpaste tube reads NINA an Easter egg referencing Hirschfeld s daughter Nina whose name Hirschfeld inscribed in several of his drawings since her birth in Another easter egg references artist Emily Jiuliano whose name is shown as E Jiuliano Rachel was designed after the Goldbergs daughter John or Flying John is based on animation historian and author John Culhane and Hirschfeld s caricature of Alexander Woollcott Goldberg took Hirschfeld s original illustration of Gershwin and animated it to make him play part of the rhapsody on the piano The most difficult part of this particular scene to animate was the turning of Gershwin s head as the original drawing depicted one angle of his head The illustration also featured Ira Gershwin alongside his brother George but Ira is not shown in the scene nor anywhere else in the film Featured in the crowd emerging from the hotel are depictions of Brooks Atkinson and Hirschfeld along with his wife Dolly Haas The sequence was so chromatically complex that the rendering process using the CAPS system delayed work on Tarzan br br br Piano Concerto No br Piano Concerto No was directed by Butoy with art director Michael Humphries It originated in the s when Walt Disney wished to adapt a collection of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales into an animated film The artists completed a series of preliminary designs based on the stories including ones for The Steadfast Tin Soldier from by Bianca Majolie that were stored in the studio s animation research library and used for a Disney book that retold the story accompanied with the storyboard sketches When Disney suggested using the Shostakovich piece Butoy flipped through the book and found the story s structure fit to the music When Humphries saw the sketches he designed the segment with works by Caravaggio and Rembrandt in mind to give the segment a timeless feel while keeping the colors as romantic as possible during the scenes when the soldier and ballerina are first getting acquainted Live action footage of a real ballerina was used as a guide for the toy ballerina s movements Butoy found the Jack in a box a difficult character to design and animate with its spring base and how he moved with the box His appearance went through numerous changes partly due to the lack of reference material available to the team br The segment marked the first time the Disney studio created a film s main characters entirely from CGI only backgrounds secondary or tertiary characters had been produced using CGI beforehand Initially Butoy asked Pixar Animation Studios to handle the computer graphics but CGI artist Steve Goldberg convinced him to let Disney s own team produce it The backgrounds were completed by hand Originally the drain sequence included friendly rats who performed comical gags but the team found it did not fit the mood of the rest of the segment The drains became a more scary environment something that Butoy said was what the music was telling us to do Rain animation from Bambi was scanned into the CAPS system and digitally altered to fit into the segment The ending was to feature the original ending with the soldier and ballerina melting in the fire but the music was too upbeat to animate it and was changed An excerpt of the segment was shown at the SIGGRAPH conference br br br The Carnival of the Animals Finale br The Carnival of the Animals Finale was directed and animated by Goldberg his wife Susan was its art director The idea originated from animator Joe Grant one of the two story directors on Fantasia who loved the ostriches in Dance of the Hours When development for Fantasia began Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches play with a yo yo to the last movement of The Carnival of the Animals The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen Goldberg was partly inspired by co director Mike Gabriel who would play with a yo yo as he took a break from working on Pocahontas Gabriel is given a credit for yo yo tricks in the end credits The segment was produced with CGI and watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper Susan chose a distinct colour palette for the segment which she compared to the style of a Hawaiian shirt The Goldbergs and their team visited the zoo in Los Angeles and San Diego to study the anatomy and movement of flamingos br br br The Sorcerer s Apprentice br br br Pomp and Circumstance Land of Hope and Glory br Mostly known as Britain s most loved patriotic song thanks its choral counterpart Land of Hope and Glory the original march was created for royal and solemn events but Eisner suggested his use as a stand alone piece after he attended a graduation and thought its familiarity would be suitable for a Fantasia segment His idea involved a selection of Disney princesses and heroes in a wedding procession carrying their future children who would then be presented in a ceremony The animators preliminary designs depicted a Greco Roman setting one of the staff members described the artwork as an appalling abuse of the characters Eisner agreed to drop the story but insisted that the music be used After numerous ideas were scrapped due to the difficulty in writing a clear plot animator and director Francis Glebas came up with the Noah s Ark idea that he titled Donald s Last Roundup later retitled as Noah s Duck and pitched it thinking it was laden with comic possibilities br br br The Firebird br br To close the film Disney wanted a piece that was emotionally equivalent to the Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria segments that closed Fantasia Disney chose The Firebird as the piece to use after half a dozen others were scrapped including Symphony No by Beethoven and the Hallelujah Chorus from Messiah by Handel Disney thought of the idea of the Earth s destruction and renewal after passing Mount St Helens following its eruption in French twins Paul and Ga tan Brizzi from Disney s Paris studio were hired to direct the segment The Sprite is a Dryad like creature from Greek mythology Her form changes six times she is introduced as a Water Sprite who plants flowers as a Flower Sprite She becomes a Neutral Sprite where her growth trail stops and an Ash Sprite when the forest has been destroyed The segment ends with her as a Rain Wave Sprite followed by the Grass Sprite The segment originally ended with the Sprite in the form of a flowing river that rises up into the sky and transforms into a Sun Sprite but this was abandoned The elk s antlers were produced by CGI and placed on top of its body that was drawn traditionally The segment was produced using Houdini animation software br br br Music br The music to The Sorcerer s Apprentice was already recorded on January for the first film at Culver Studios California with Leopold Stokowski conducting a group of session musicians The recording of Rhapsody in Blue used in the film is an edited version of Ferde Grof s orchestration of the piece performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra with conductor Bruce Broughton The shortened version was made by cutting bars of piano solo in three different places A recording of James Levine conducting both pieces with the Philharmonia appears on the film s soundtrack br The remaining six pieces were recorded at the Medinah Temple in Chicago performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Levine Pines of Rome was re arranged in by Bruce Coughlin who reduced the four movement piece by cutting the second movement and trimming sections of the third and fourth movements The piece was recorded on March The second recording involved Symphony No Carnival of the Animals and Pomp and Circumstance on April Carnival of the Animals Finale uses two pianos played by Gail Niwa and Philip Sabransky Pomp and Circumstance was arranged by Peter Schickele and features the Chicago Symphony Chorus and soprano soloist Kathleen Battle The next recording took place on April for Piano Concerto No with pianist Yefim Bronfman On September The Firebird was the final piece to be recorded its session lasted for three hours The piece was arranged using four sections from Stravinsky s revision of the score br br br Interstitials br Disney felt the need to keep interstitials bridges as used in Fantasia in order to give audiences a chance to cleanse their emotional palate from the previous segment while also providing some information about the next one Don Hahn directed the live action scenes which were designed by Pixote Hunt Hahn came up with the set and backgrounds while eating lunch he proceeded to sketch a rough idea of what he imagined on a napkin He wanted to show images on shapes like big sails of a clipper ship They fly in on the wind and form a sort of Stonehenge concert hall in the middle of a vast empty imaginary plain br Hahn recalled some difficulty in finding someone to host the film so the studio decided to use a group of artists and musicians from various fields of entertainment The interstitials were filmed in various locations the orchestra Jones Lansbury and Bronfman were shot in Los Angeles Perlman and Midler in New York City and others in Boston Massachusetts Each scene was filmed in front of a green screen to allow shots of the orchestra or the set to be placed behind them The shots of Levine the artists and the orchestra were filmed on October The piano Grierson plays in his scene with Jones is the same one on which he played Rhapsody in Blue for the soundtrack br br br Release br br Fantasia was officially announced on February during a Disney presentation at the New Amsterdam Theater in New York City which featured a screening of The Carnival of the Animals The film premiered at Carnegie Hall in New York City on December for three nights as part of a five city concert tour The animation was presented on a screen above the stage while Levine conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra with a video auto cue to time

which contains two tracks telling the stories of Pomp and Circumstance and The Sorcerer s Apprentice with narration by Pat Carroll Included in the set is a page book containing some of the film s artwork br br br Reception br br br Box office br Fantasia first opened in IMAX theatres for a four month run from January to April becoming the first animated feature length film shown in the format The idea to release it in IMAX first originated from Dick Cook during meetings the studio had about the best way to create a sense of event for the film Roy Disney believed its uniqueness from typical feature films gave it a psychological advantage A temporary seat theatre costing almost million was built in four weeks for its Los Angeles run as Disney was unable to reach an agreement to only have the film shown during the four months at the city s sole IMAX theater at the time at the California Science Center Disney enforced the exclusive screening rule on the other IMAX cinemas that showed the film which limited its release Each theater was decorated with a museum like exhibit with educational material and large displays br After opening at theaters worldwide the film grossed over million in cinemas in North America in its opening weekend averaging per theater and from screens in markets It set new records for the highest gross for any IMAX engagement and surpassed the highest weekly total for any previously released IMAX film Its three day worldwide gross surpassed million setting further records at venues worldwide Fantasia grossed a worldwide total of million in days and million at the end of its IMAX run br Following its release in regular theatres in the United States on June the film grossed an additional million in its opening weekend that ranked eleventh at the box office This followed nearly half a year of release in the IMAX format possibly blunting the amount earned in the weekends of wide release Fantasia has earned a total worldwide gross of over million since its release with million of that total from the U S market and the rest through foreign box office sales The film had cost around million and was viewed by Eisner as Roy Disney s folly br br br Critical response br On Rotten Tomatoes Fantasia holds an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of Its consensus reads It provides an entertaining experience for adults and children alike On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews br Entertainment Weekly gave a B rating its reviewer Bruce Fretts called Symphony No maddeningly abstract Piano Concerto No charmingly traditional and thought Rhapsody in Blue fit well to the music but Pomp and Circumstance inexplicably inspires biblical kitsch The review ends with a criticism of the inadequate quality of The Sorcerer s Apprentice on the IMAX screen Todd McCarthy of Variety pointed out that while the original Fantasia felt too long and formal its enjoyable follow up is at minutes simply too breezy and lightweight He summarized the film like a light buffet of tasty morsels rather than a full and satisfying meal br In his December review for the Chicago Sun Times Roger Ebert gave the film a rating of three stars out of four He described some of the animation such as Firebird Suite his favorite segment as powerful though he thought others like the dance of the abstract triangles in Symphony No to be a little pedestrian He admired Rhapsody in Blue and its interlocking stories pointing out its style was reminiscent of the Madeline picture books by Ludwig Bemelmans He thought Pines of Rome presented itself well in the IMAX format and found the Piano Concerto No played wonderfully as a self contained film while he found The Sorcerer s Apprentice to be not as visually sharp as the rest of the film He nonetheless described the film overall as splendid entertainment Film critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that the film often has the feel of a giant corporate promotion whose stars are there simply to hawk the company s wares while noting the film is not especially innovative in its look or subject matter Firebird Suite was his favorite segment which left a lasting impression of the beauty terror and unpredictability of the natural world He found The Sorcerer s Apprentice fit well with the rest of the film and the battle in Symphony No too abbreviated to amount to much He found the segment with the whales failed in that the images quickly become redundant He found Rhapsody in Blue to be the second best in the film with its witty hyper kinetic evocation of the melting pot with sharply defined characters He found the segment with the flamingos cute and the one with the tin soldier to be romantic James Berardinelli found the film to be of uneven quality He felt Symphony No was dull and uninspired the yo yoing flamingos wasteful and the New York City based story of Rhapsody in Blue interesting but out of place in this particular movie He found the story of the tin soldier to successfully mix its music with top notch animation and an emotionally rewarding story He felt the Firebird section was visually ingenious and Pomp and Circumstance the most light hearted episode and the one with the most appeal to children in an otherwise adult oriented film To him The Sorcerer s Apprentice was an enduring classic br David Parkinson of British film magazine Empire rates the film three stars out of five calling it a curate s egg with moments of hilarity and beauty alternating with the pompous and the banal Moments of Symphony No and The Firebird he thought lacked the abstract grace from Toccata and Fugue from the original and Pines of Rome was even less successful due to the computer imagery which affected its quality He claims Rhapsody in Blue is guilty of some dubious racial and sexual caricaturing but hailed the film s IMAX presentation as a breathtaking spectacle He summarized the film as slightly more successful than the original Fantasia more child friendly and a mixed bag of delights Richard Corliss of Time magazine wrote a positive review of the film citing Pines of Rome as a superb uplifting flight of the spirit and Piano Concerto No a gorgeous blend of traditional and computer animation He drew a comparison to The Firebird with the Japanese animated film Princess Mononoke Brian Sibley wrote a mostly negative review in Sight Sound a monthly magazine published by the British Film Institute in June He pointed out that though the film includes moments of comedy and pastoral the themes running through the old Fantasia the struggle between light and dark the war between chaos and order the ultimate triumph of goodness find only a pale equivalent in this new version He compared the film s orchestra set to scenes from A Matter of Life and Death and thought the CGI in Symphony No lacked the technical qualities of Toy Story Sibley argued the film lacked an even quality highlighting Pines of Rome with its breathtaking opening before its magic has been overtaken by chronic boredom when the baby whale reunites with his parents Pomp and Circumstance he thought contained shamefully sloppy animation but is saved by Donald s comical gags but pointed out Rhapsody in Blue with its strong lines and vivid flat colours that are fashionably retro and the classic Disneyesque exquisite beauty and raw natural violence in Firebird Suite as the film s most successful segments as they ironically hark back to older times br br br
