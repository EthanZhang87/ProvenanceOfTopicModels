an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The site s critical consensus reads Doc Hollywood isn t particularly graceful in its attempt to put a s spin on its Capraesque formula

CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that Mr Fox blithe and funny as ever amusingly shrugs off each new surprise the film has to offer adding that while retaining his boyish appeal Mr Fox also seems a shade more substantial this time possibly because he is seen making life or death decisions when not fielding comic lines She did however say that the screenplay by Jeffrey Price Peter S Seaman and Daniel Pyne is occasionally sharp tongued but more often pleasantly knee deep in rustic corn br br Peter Rainer of the Los Angeles Times remarked that I f you have any doubt as to the outcome you haven t been paying attention to the latest self serving movie trend The back to basics anti greed message of Doc Hollywood has been all over the screens this season from TV s Northern Exposure to the movies City Slickers Regarding Henry Life Stinks and The Doctor He added Doc Hollywood draws its energy almost exclusively from clich Caton Jones perhaps because he s Scottish feels free to indulge himself with every piece of small town movie derived Americana he can train his camera on he s an equal opportunity borrower Even Local Hero directed by fellow Scotsman Bill Forsyth gets pillaged br The cornball rowdiness is partially redeemed by the good cast which includes Woody Harrelson as a lunky insurance salesman David Ogden Stiers as the mayor Roberts Blossom as a judge Barnard Hughes as the town s decrepit doctor and Frances Sternhagen as a local busybody Bridget Fonda turns up as a Hollywood struck belle and as usual she s much stronger than her role allows for Fonda has the power and the sass to become a major actress Why did she bother with this dinky cameo br br Michael J Fox as in The Secret of My Success and the Back to the Future films goes in for a lot of scampering here In between scampering he mugs It s probably just as well that Fox doesn t bring much gravity to the role if he were any moonier and heartfelt the film might really be exposed as a crock br Roger Ebert rated the film a three out of four stars stating On the basis of the movie s trailer I was expecting Doc Hollywood to be a comedy And it is a comedy But it surprised me by also being a love story and a pretty good one the kind where the lovers are smart enough to know all the reasons why they shouldn t get together but too much in love to care br br br Box office br Doc Hollywood debuted at number three in the U S box office br br br Comparisons to Cars br The plot of the Disney Pixar film Cars shares many similarities with Doc Hollywood Both films tell the story of an arrogant individual in the case of the later film an anthropomorphized race car learning to appreciate the values of a small town while performing community service there to make up for damage he caused The similarities did not go unnoticed by reviewers one of whom claimed that Cars rips off Doc Hollywood almost note for note br br br
