The Boy and the Heron won Miyazaki his second Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the th Academy Awards becoming the oldest director to do so Miyazaki did not attend the show due to his advanced age br br Miyazaki has often criticized the state of the animation industry stating that some animators lack a foundational understanding of their subjects and do not prioritize realism He is particularly critical of Japanese animation saying that anime is produced by humans who can t stand looking at other humans that s why the industry is full of otaku He has frequently criticized otaku including fanatics of guns and fighter aircraft declaring it a fetish and refusing to identify himself as such He bemoaned the state of Disney animated films in saying they show nothing but contempt for the audience br In Miyazaki criticized Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s policies and the proposed Constitutional amendment that would allow Abe to revise the clause outlawing war as a means to settle international disputes Miyazaki felt Abe wished to leave his name in history as a great man who revised the Constitution and its interpretation describing it as despicable and stating People who don t think enough shouldn t meddle with the constitution In Miyazaki disapproved Abe s denial of Japan s military aggression stating Japan should clearly say that they inflicted enormous damage on China and express deep remorse over it He felt the government should give a proper apology to Korean comfort women who were forced to service the Japanese army during World War II and suggested the

cited as the catalyst for the incident he felt caricatures should be made of politicians not cultures In November Miyazaki stated that he believed many of the people who voted for Brexit and Trump were affected by the increase in unemployment due to companies building cars in Mexico because of low wages and selling them in the US He did not think that Donald Trump would be elected president calling it a terrible thing but said that Trump s political opponent Hillary Clinton was terrible as well br br Miyazaki s works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as feminism environmentalism pacifism love and family His narratives are also notable for not pitting a hero against an unsympathetic antagonist Miyazaki felt Spirited Away s Chihiro manages not because she has destroyed the evil but because she has acquired the ability to survive br Miyazaki s films often emphasize environmentalism and the Earth s fragility Margaret Talbot stated that Miyazaki dislikes modern technology and believes much of modern culture is thin and shallow and fake he anticipates a time with no more high rises Miyazaki felt frustrated growing up in the Sh wa period from to because nature the mountains and rivers was being destroyed in the name of economic progress Peter Schellhase of The Imaginative Conservative identified that several antagonists of Miyazaki s films attempt to dominate nature in pursuit of political domination and are ultimately destructive to both nature and human civilization Miyazaki is critical of exploitation under both communism and capitalism as well as globalization and its effects on modern life believing that a company is common property of the people that work there Ram Prakash Dwivedi identified values of Mahatma Gandhi in the films of Miyazaki br Several of Miyazaki s films feature anti war themes Daisuke Akimoto of Animation Studies categorized Porco Rosso as anti war propaganda and felt the protagonist Porco transforms into a pig partly due to his extreme distaste of militarism Akimoto also argues that The Wind Rises reflects Miyazaki s antiwar pacifism despite the latter stating that the film does not attempt to denounce war Schellhase also identifies Princess Mononoke as a pacifist film due to the protagonist Ashitaka instead of joining the campaign of revenge against humankind as his ethnic history would lead him to do Ashitaka strives for peace David Loy and Linda Goodhew argue that both Nausica of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke do not depict traditional evil but the Buddhist roots of evil greed ill will and delusion according to Buddhism the roots of evil must transform into generosity loving kindness and wisdom in order to overcome suffering and both Nausica and Ashitaka accomplish this When characters in Miyazaki s films are forced to engage in violence it is shown as being a difficult task in Howl s Moving Castle Howl is forced to fight an inescapable battle in defense of those he loves and it almost destroys him though he is ultimately saved by Sophie s love and bravery br Suzuki described Miyazaki as a feminist in reference to his attitude to female workers Miyazaki has described his female characters as brave self sufficient girls that don t think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart stating that they may need a friend or a supporter but never a saviour and that any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man Nausica of the Valley of the Wind was lauded for its positive portrayal of women particularly protagonist Nausica Schellhase noted that the female characters in Miyazaki s films are not objectified or sexualized and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions Schellhase also identified a coming of age element for the heroines in Miyazaki s films as they each discover individual personality and strengths Gabrielle Bellot of The Atlantic wrote that in his films Miyazaki shows a keen understanding of the complexities of what it might mean to be a woman In particular Bellot cites Nausica of the Valley of the Wind praising the film s challenging of gender expectations and the strong and independent nature of Nausica Bellot also noted that Princess Mononoke s San represents the conflict between selfhood and expression br Miyazaki is concerned with the sense of wonder in young people seeking to maintain themes of love and family in his films Michael Toscano of Curator found that Miyazaki fears Japanese children are dimmed by a culture of overconsumption overprotection utilitarian education careerism techno industrialism and a secularism that is swallowing Japan s native animism Schellhase wrote that several of Miyazaki s works feature themes of love and romance but felt emphasis is placed on the way lonely and vulnerable individuals are integrated into relationships of mutual reliance and responsibility which generally benefit everyone around them He also found that many of the protagonists in Miyazaki s films present an idealized image of families whereas others are dysfunctional br br Miyazaki forgoes traditional screenplays in his productions instead developing the film s narrative as he designs the storyboards We never know where the story will go but we just keep working on the film as it develops he said In each of his films Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods drawing each frame by hand computer generated imagery has been employed in several of his later films beginning with Princess Mononoke to enrich the visual look though he ensures that each film can retain the right ratio between working by hand and computer and still be able to call my films D He oversees every frame of his films For character designs Miyazaki draws original drafts used by animation directors to create reference sheets which are then corrected by Miyazaki in his style br Miyazaki has cited several Japanese artists as his influences including Sanpei Shirato Osamu Tezuka Soji Yamakawa and Isao Takahata A number of Western authors have also influenced his works including Fr d ric Back Lewis Carroll Roald Dahl Jean Giraud Paul Grimault Ursula K Le Guin and Yuri Norstein as well as animation studio Aardman Animations specifically the works of Nick Park Specific works that have influenced Miyazaki include Animal Farm The Snow Queen and The King and the Mockingbird The Snow Queen is said to be the true catalyst for Miyazaki s filmography influencing his training and work When animating young children Miyazaki often takes inspiration from his friends children as well as memories of his own childhood br br Miyazaki married fellow animator Akemi ta in October the two had met while colleagues at Toei Animation The couple have two sons Goro born in January and Keisuke born in April Miyazaki felt that becoming a father changed him as he tried to produce work that would please his children Miyazaki initially fulfilled a promise to his wife that they would both continue to work after Goro s birth dropping him off at preschool for the day however upon seeing Goro s exhaustion walking home one day Miyazaki decided that they could not continue and his wife stayed at home to raise their children Miyazaki s dedication to his work harmed his relationship with his children as he was often absent Goro watched his father s works in an attempt to understand him since the two rarely talked Miyazaki said that he tried to be a good father but in the end he wasn t a very good parent During the production of Tales from
