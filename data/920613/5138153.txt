Giselle A singing and dancing princess to be who ends up almost having her dream of meeting her prince a reality Adams was announced to have been cast in the role of Giselle on November Although the studio was looking for a film star in the role director Kevin Lima insisted on casting a lesser known actress Out of the or so actresses who auditioned for the role Adams stood out to Lima because not only did she look like a Disney princess but her commitment to the character her ability to escape into the character s being without ever judging the character was overwhelming Hailing from Andalasia Giselle displays similar traits to early Disney Princesses Lima describes her as about Snow White with some traits borrowed from Cinderella and Princess Aurora from Sleeping Beauty although her spunkiness comes from Ariel from The Little Mermaid She is eternally optimistic and romantic but is also very independent and true to her convictions Over the course of the film she becomes more mature even stopping her habit of singing in a continuous manner but maintains her fondness of singing kindness innocence and optimism br Patrick Dempsey as Robert Philip A cynical Manhattan divorce attorney at Churchill Harline Smith LLP who does not believe in true love happily ever after or fairy tales since his wife left him and their daughter He falls in love with Giselle after her adventure to New York City and her sense of fun gradually rubs off on him over the course of the film Lima cast Dempsey after Disney was satisfied with the casting of Adams but had wanted more well known actors in the film Dempsey whose starring role on TV series Grey s Anatomy had earned him the nickname McDreamy was described by Lima as a modern day Prince Charming to today s audience The role was challenging for Dempsey because he had to play the straight man to Adams and Marsden s more outrageous characters br James Marsden as Prince Edward A dim witted yet brave heroic and good hearted prince who is baffled by the world of New York once he enters it Marsden was announced to have been cast on December At the time Marsden was auditioning the role of Robert had not been cast but he decided to pursue the role of Prince Edward because he was more fun and he responded more to that character Edward is a prince in Andalasia and the stepson of Queen Narissa He is very pure very simple minded and naive but innocently narcissistic br Timothy Spall as Nathaniel A servant of Queen Narissa who gets controlled through his infatuation with the Queen and his own lack of self esteem He initially does Narissa s bidding but ultimately realizes her true nature and rebels against her He has a penchant for disguises br Idina Menzel as Nancy Tremaine A fashion designer and Robert s girlfriend Once Giselle falls in love with Robert she falls for Edward and leaves with him Since the role did not require any singing Menzel said in an interview that it was a compliment to be asked to just be hired on my acting talents alone She is named after Lady Tremaine the stepmother from Cinderella br Rachel Covey as Morgan Philip Robert s year old daughter Despite her father misunderstanding her and telling her otherwise she believes in fairy tales and also believes that magic exists br Susan Sarandon as Queen Narissa Edward s evil stepmother a sorceress and a megalomaniac with a hatred for Giselle simply for being an obstacle for her to keep her power Sarandon had been attracted to the project prior to Lima s involvement as director Since Sarandon s on screen time was relatively short it took only two weeks to film her scenes Narissa s mannerisms characteristics powers and physical features were inspired by such classical Disney villainesses as the Evil Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty br Giselle s chipmunk friend Pip is voiced by Jeff Bennett in Andalasia where he has no trouble expressing himself through speech while Enchanted director Kevin Lima voices Pip in the real world where he must communicate through squeaks and charades Much of Pip s personality were based on Disney sidekicks such as Mushu from Mulan and Timon from The Lion King The Andalasia cast also includes Lima s daughter Emma Rose Lima as the bluebird and the fawn Teala Dunn as a bunny and Fred Tatasciore as the troll Julie Andrews provides the film s narration br Paige O Hara and Judy Kuhn make cameo appearances as soap opera character Angela and a pregnant woman Edward encounters respectively John Rothman and Jodi Benson portray respectively Robert s boss Carl and secretary Sam while Tonya Pinkins and Isiah Whitlock Jr portray Phoebe and Ethan Banks a couple whose divorce Robert is mediating Marlon Saunders and Jon McLaughlin appear as vocalists who sing That s How You Know and So Close respectively br br br Production br br br Development br The initial script of Enchanted written by Bill Kelly was bought by Disney s Touchstone Pictures and Sonnenfeld Josephson Productions for a reported sum of in September The script was written for three years but it was thought to be unsuitable for Walt Disney Pictures because it was a racier R rated movie inspired by the adult risque comedy movies in the s and s such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and American Pie The first draft of the script had Giselle being mistaken for a stripper when she arrives in New York City To the frustration of Kelly the screenplay was rewritten several times first by Rita Hsiao and then by Todd Alcott The film was initially scheduled to be released in with Rob Marshall as director but he withdrew due to creative differences between the producers and him In director Jon Turteltaub was set to direct the film but he left soon after later working with Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer on the National Treasure franchise Adam Shankman became the film s director in while Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle were hired by Disney to rewrite the script once again At the time Disney considered offering the role of Giselle to Kate Hudson or Reese Witherspoon However the project did not take off br On May Variety reported that Kevin Lima had been hired as director and Bill Kelly had returned to the project to write a new version of the script Lima worked with Kelly on the script to combine the main plot of Enchanted with the idea of a loving homage to Disney s heritage He created visual storyboard printouts that covered the story of Enchanted from beginning to end which filled an entire floor of a production building After Lima showed them to Dick Cook the chairman of the Walt Disney Studios he received the green light for the project and a budget of million Lima began designing the world of Andalasia and storyboarding the movie before a cast was chosen to play the characters After the actors were hired he was involved in making the final design of the movie which made sure the animated characters look like their real life counterparts br br br Filming br Enchanted is the first feature length Disney live action traditional animation hybrid since Disney s Who Framed Roger Rabbit in though the traditionally animated characters do not interact in the live action environment in the same method as they did in Roger Rabbit however there are some scenes where live action characters share the screen with two dimensional animated characters for example a live action Nathaniel communicating with a cel drawn Narissa who is in a cooking pot The film uses two aspect ratios it begins in when the Walt Disney Pictures logo and Enchanted storybook are shown and then switches to a smaller aspect ratio for the first animated sequence The film switches back to when it becomes live action and never switches back even for the remainder of the animated sequences When this movie was aired on televised networks the beginning of the movie minus the Walt Disney Pictures logo and opening credits was shown in the pillarboxed aspect ratio the remainder of the movie was shown in the aspect ratio when it becomes live action The fullscreen version uses the format during the entire movie while the open matte version retains the letterboxed format for the first animated sequence then switches to an open matted format for the rest of the movie when it switches to live action Lima oversaw the direction of both the live action and animation sequences which were being produced at the same time Enchanted took almost two years to complete The animation took about a year to finish while the live action scenes which commenced filming on location in New York City during the summer of and were completed during the animation process were shot in days br br br Animation br Out of the film s minutes of running time ten of the approximately minutes of animation are at the beginning of the film Lima tried to cram every single piece of Disney iconic imagery that he could into the first ten minutes which were done in traditional cel animation in contrast to computer generated imagery D animation as a tribute to past Disney fairy tale films such as Sleeping Beauty Cinderella and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs It was the first Disney film theatrically released in America to feature traditional cel animation since Pooh s Heffalump Movie This film although quite different in terms of plot from any previous Disney film also contained obvious homages to other Disney films of the distant past such as Old Yeller The Shaggy Dog Swiss Family Robinson Bon Voyage and Savage Sam As most of Disney s traditional animation artists were laid off after the computer graphics boom of the late s the minutes of animation were not done in house but by the independent Pasadena based company James Baxter Animation founded by former Disney animator Baxter br Although Lima wanted the animation to be nostalgic he wanted Enchanted to have a style of its own Baxter s team decided to use Art Nouveau as a starting point For Giselle the hand drawn animated character had to be a cross between Amy Adams and a classic Disney princess And not a caricature Seeing Giselle as a forest girl an innocent nymph with flowers in her hair and a bit of a hippie the animators wanted her to be flowing with her hair and clothes Delicate For Prince Edward Baxter s team worked the hardest on him to make him look like the actor because princes in these kinds of movies are usually so bland Many prototypes were made for Narissa as Baxter s team wanted her face to look like Susan Sarandon And the costumes had to align closely to the live action design br To maintain continuity between the two media Lima brought in costume designer Mona May during the early stages of the film s production so the costumes would be aligned in both the animated and live action worlds He also shot some live action footage of Amy Adams as Giselle for the animators to use as reference which also allowed the physical movement of the character to match in both worlds Test scenes completed by the animators were shown to the actors allowing them to see how their animated selves would move br br br Live action br br Principal photography began in April and ended in July Because of the sequence setting the live action scenes were filmed in New York City However shooting in New York became problematic as it was in a constant state of new stores scaffolding and renovation br The first scene in New York which features Giselle emerging from a manhole in the middle of Times Square was filmed on location in the center of the square Because of the difficulties in controlling the crowd while filming in Times Square general pedestrians were featured in the scene with hired extras placed in the immediate foreground Similarly a crowd gathered to watch as James Marsden and Timothy Spall filmed their scenes in Times Square However the scene Lima found the most challenging to shoot was the musical number That s How You Know in Central Park The five minute scene took days to finish due to the changing weather which allowed only seven sunny days for the scene to be filmed The filming was also hampered at times by Patrick Dempsey s fans The scene was choreographed by John O Connell who had worked on Moulin Rouge beforehand and included extras and dancers br Many scenes were filmed at Steiner Studios which provided the three large stages that Enchanted needed at the same facility Other outdoor locations included the Brooklyn Bridge and The Paterno an apartment building with a curved heavily embellished ivory colored fa ade located on the corner of Riverside Drive and th Street which is the residence of the film s characters Robert and Morgan br br br Costume design br br All the costumes in the film were designed by Mona May who had previously worked on Clueless The Wedding Singer and The Haunted Mansion To create the costumes May spent one year in pre production working with animators and her costume department of twenty people while she contracted with five outside costume shops in Los Angeles and New York City She became involved in the project during the time when the animators were designing the faces and bodies of the characters as they had to translate the costumes from two dimensional drawings to live action human proportion Her goal was to keep the designs Disneyesque to the core but bring a little bit of fashion in there and humor and make it something new However May admitted this was difficult because they re dealing with iconic Disney characters who have been in the psyche of the viewing audience for so long br For the character of Giselle her journey to becoming a real woman is reflected in her dresses which become less fairy tale like as the film progresses Her wedding dress at the beginning of the film directly contrasts her modern gown at the end of the film The wedding dress served to provide a humongous contrast to the flat drawings and to accentuate the image of a Disney Princess In order to make the waist look small the sleeves are designed to be extremely pouffy and the skirt to be as big as possible which included a metal hoop that holds up twenty layers of petticoats and ruffles Altogether eleven versions of the dress were made for filming each made of yards m of silk satin and other fabric and weighing approximately pounds kg On the experience of wearing the wedding dress Amy Adams described it as grueling since the entire weight was on her hips so occasionally it felt like she was in traction br Unlike Giselle Prince Edward does not adapt to the real world and James Marsden who plays Edward had only one costume designed for him May s aim was to try not to lose Marsden in the craziness of the outfit where he still looks handsome The costume also included padding in the chest buttocks and crotch which gave Marsden the same exaggerated proportions as an animated character and posture his back is straight the sleeves are up and never collapse br May was delighted that Lima went for something more fashion forward with Susan Sarandon s Queen Narissa She decided to make her look like a runway lady wearing something that is still Disney but also high fashion like something John Galliano or Thierry Mugler might design Since Narissa appears in three media hand drawn animation live action and computer animation May had to make sure that the costume would be the same throughout in terms of color shape and texture The costume for Narissa consisted of a leather corset and skirt which looked reptilian as well as a cape Working with the animators May incorporated parts of the dragon s form into the costume the cape was designed to look like wings the layers of the skirt wrap around like a tail and a crown that would turn into horns during Narissa s transformation into a dragon br br br Music br br The film s score was written by accomplished songwriter and composer Alan Menken who has worked on a number of Disney films previously Fellow composer Stephen Schwartz wrote the lyrics for six songs also composed by Menken Menken and Schwartz previously worked together on the songs for Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame br Menken became involved with the film in the early stages of the film s development and invited Schwartz to resume their collaboration They began the songwriting process by searching for the right moments in the story in which a song moment was allowed Schwartz found that it was easier to justify situations in which the characters would burst into songs in Enchanted than in other live action musicals as its concept allowed the characters to sing in a way that was completely integral to the plot of the story The three songs Giselle sings contain references to earlier Disney films The first song played in the film True Love s Kiss was written to be a send up of and an homage to the style of those Disney animated features namely I m Wishing Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes Cinderella during which Disney heroines sing about the joy of being loved It posed a challenge for Menken and Schwartz because of the many preconceptions with that number it had to be reflective of the era of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella Accordingly Amy Adams performed the first song in an operetta style in contrast to the Broadway style of the later songs br Both Happy Working Song and That s How You Know also pay tributes to past Disney songs and movies Happy Working Song pays a lyrical homage to such songs as Whistle While You Work Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs The Work Song Cinderella A Spoonful of Sugar Mary Poppins and Making Christmas The Nightmare Before Christmas and a musical homage to the Sherman Brothers with a self parodic Alan Menken style middle eight That s How You Know is a self parody of Menken s compositions for his Disney features specifically such big production numbers as Under the Sea The Little Mermaid and Be Our Guest Beauty and the Beast To achieve this Schwartz admitted he had to push it a little bit further in terms of choices of words or certain lyrics while maintaining the classic Walt Disney sensibility However Menken noted that the songs he has written for Disney have always been a little tongue in cheek As the film progresses the music uses more contemporary styles which is heard through the adult ballad So Close and the country pop number Ever Ever After sung by Carrie Underwood as a voice over br Out of the six completed songs written and composed by Menken and Schwartz five remained in the finished film The title song Enchanted a duet featuring Idina Menzel and James Marsden was the only song of Menken s and Schwartz s authorship and composition that was deleted from the movie br br br Effects br The majority of the visual effects shots in Enchanted were done by Tippett Studio in Berkeley California who contributed a total of shots These shots involved virtual sets environmental effects and CGI characters that performed alongside real actors namely the animated animals during the Happy Working Song sequence Pip and the Narissa dragon during the live action portions of the film CIS Hollywood was responsible for visual effects shots which primarily dealt with wire removals and composites Reel FX Creative Studios did four visual effects shots involving the pop up book page turn transitions while Weta Digital did two br Out of all the animals that appear in the Happy Working Song sequence the only real animals filmed on set were rats and pigeons The real animals captured on film aided Tippett Studio in creating CGI rats and pigeons which gave dynamic performances such as having pigeons that carried brooms in their beaks and rats that scrubbed with toothbrushes On the other hand all the cockroaches were CGI characters br Pip a chipmunk who can talk in the D world of Andalasia loses his ability to communicate through speech in the real world so he must rely heavily on facial and body gestures This meant the animators had to display Pip s emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from every conceivable angle after which they created a photorealistic chipmunk through the use of D computer graphics software Maya and Furrocious When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima he was surprised that he was a looking at a CG character and not reference footage To enhance facial expressions the modelers gave Pip eyebrows which real chipmunks do not have During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip On some occasions a small stuffed chipmunk with a wire armature on the inside was placed in the scene In other situations a rod with a small marker on the end or a laser pointer would be used to show the actors and cinematographer where Pip is br Unlike Pip the Narissa dragon was allowed to be more of a fantasy character while still looking like a living character and a classic Disney villain The CGI dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon s live action witch When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon a long pole was used to direct the extras eyelines instead of a laser pointer Set pieces were made to move back and forth in addition to having a computer controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head on the camera that were all synchronized In the film s final sequence in which Narissa climbs the Woolworth Building while clutching Robert in her claws a greenscreen rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements The rig was a puppeteering approach that involved a robotic arm being controlled by three different floor effects artists br br br Release br The film was distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures to theaters in the United States It was distributed worldwide by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International to over territories around the world and topped the box office in several countries including the United Kingdom and Italy It is the first movie to be released under the Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures name following the retirement of the previous Buena Vista Pictures Distribution br br br Merchandising br Disney had originally planned to add Giselle to the Disney Princess line up as it was shown at a Toy Fair where the Giselle doll was featured with packaging declaring her with Disney Princess status but decided against it when they realized they would have to pay for lifelong rights to Amy Adams image While Giselle is not being marketed as one of the

on a classic Disney story its comedy and musical numbers as well as the performance of its lead actress Amy Adams Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun Times gave the film three stars out of four describing it as a heart winning musical comedy that skips lightly and sprightly from the lily pads of hope to the manhole covers of actuality and one that has a Disney willingness to allow fantasy into life Film critics of Variety and LA Weekly remarked on the film s ability to cater for all ages LA Weekly described the film as the sort of buoyant all ages entertainment that Hollywood has been laboring to revive in recent years most recently with Hairspray but hasn t managed to get right until now while Todd McCarthy of Variety commented More than Disney s strictly animated product Enchanted in the manner of the vast majority of Hollywood films made until the s is a film aimed at the entire population niches be damned It simply aims to please without pandering without vulgarity without sops to pop culture fads and to pull this off today is no small feat Enchanted was the Broadcast Film Critics Association s choice for Best Family Film of while Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer named it the th best film of br Rolling Stone Premiere USA Today and The Boston Globe all gave the film three out of four while The Baltimore Sun gave the film a B grade They cited that although the story is relatively predictable the way in which the predictability of the film is part of the story the amazingly extravagant musical numbers along with the way in which Disney pokes fun at its traditional line of animated movies outweighs any squabbles about storyline or being unsure of what age bracket the film is made for Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun remarked that the film s piquant idea and enough good jokes to overcome its uneven movie making and uncertain tone while Claudia Puig of USA Today stated that though it s a fairly predictable fish out of water tale actually a princess out of storybook saga the casting is so perfect that it takes what could have been a ho hum idea and renders it magical br Amy Adams herself garnered many favorable reviews Reviewers praised her singing ability and asserted that her performance which was compared by some to her Academy Award nominated performance in Junebug has made Adams a movie star likening it to Mary Poppins effect on Julie Andrews career Similarly film critics Richard Roeper and Michael Phillips who gave the film positive reviews on At the Movies with Ebert Roeper emphasized the effect of Adams performance on the film with remarks like Amy Adams is this movie and Amy Adams shows how to make a comic clich work like magic However both agreed that the final sequence involving the computer generated dragon bogged down the film br Empire stated that the film was targeted at children but agreed with other reviewers that the extremely game cast was the film s best asset It gave the film three out of five TIME gave the film a C stating that the film cannibalizes Walt s vault for jokes and fails to find a happy ending that doesn t feel two dimensional Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film two out of five and commented that the film assumes a beady eyed and deeply humourless sentimentality and that Adams performance was the only decent thing in this overhyped family movie covered in a cellophane shrink wrap of corporate Disney plastic ness br br br Accolades br br br Disney references br According to director Kevin Lima thousands of references are made to past and future works of Disney in Enchanted which serve as both a parody of and a giant love letter to Disney classics It took almost eight years for Walt Disney Studios to greenlight the production of the film because it was always quite nervous about the tone in particular As Lima worked with Bill Kelly the writer to inject Disney references to the plot it became an obsession he derived the name of every character as well as anything that needed a name from past Disney films to bring in more Disney references br While Disney animators have occasionally inserted a Disney character into background shots for example Donald Duck appears in a crowd in The Little Mermaid they have avoided mingling characters from other Disney films for fear of weakening their individual mythologies In Enchanted characters from past Disney films are openly seen such as the appearances of Thumper and Flower from Bambi in the D animation portion of the film Disney references are also made through camera work sets costumes music and dialogue Some of the more familiar examples include the use of poisoned apples from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and True Love s Kiss from Snow White and Sleeping Beauty Dick Cook the chairman of Walt Disney Studios admitted that part of the goal of Enchanted was to create a new franchise through the character of Giselle and to revive the older ones br br br Sequel br br A sequel Disenchanted
