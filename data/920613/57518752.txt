Boun Tong Noi and her ongis follow suit and Namaari reassembles the gem before also being petrified This unleashes a shockwave that spreads throughout Kumandra vanquishing the Druun and conjuring up a

In October Deadline Hollywood reported Disney was developing a fantasy animated film that was being produced by Osnat Shurer from a screenplay by Adele Lim and directed by Paul Briggs and Dean Wellins Most of the filmmakers had been involved in other Disney films including Frozen Zootopia and Moana In August Disney announced the film during its D Expo Walt Disney Animation Studios presentation Cassie Steele had been cast as Raya and Awkwafina was to play Sisu br In August Disney announced the replacement of several cast and crew members Don Hall and Carlos L pez Estrada replaced Briggs and Wellins as directors and the latter two were demoted to co directors Story writer John Ripa later also replaced Wellins as a co director and Wellins was only credited as a contributing writer in the final film Kiel Murray who had co written the screenplays for Pixar s Cars and Cars also contributed to the story for Raya Qui Nguyen joined Lim as co writer and Peter Del Vecho joined Shurer as producer Kelly Marie Tran replaced Steele to conform to character and plot changes Shurer said the cast must embody the same spirit as the character and that Tran was better suited to the role br According to Hall Disney recast the role because Raya was originally conceived as a stoic loner but the team began to infuse her with levity and swagger characteristics similar to those of Guardians of the Galaxy s Star Lord Tran had unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Raya but in January when Tran replaced Steele as Raya she assumed Disney had already rejected her but was now hiring her to replace the lead actor Disney separately hired each cast member and individually recorded their lines keeping the actors identities secret from each other until they accidentally discovered the others involvement in the film before Disney revealed them to the cast Despite the effects of the COVID pandemic on the film industry the cast worked and successfully completed the project from their homes The film s budget was at least million br br Raya and the Last Dragon is inspired by traditional Southeast Asian cultures The production team consulted experts from Southeast Asia Story Trust to ensure an accurate cultural representation in the film and they emphasized the importance of avoiding stereotypical portrayals of Asian characters To conduct background research the production team traveled to Laos Vietnam Cambodia Thailand Singapore Malaysia Indonesia and the Philippines they were inspired by the local sense of acceptance unity and trust which they adopted as themes for the film The production team explored ways to express Kumandra s characteristics they designed its five fractured lands with unique climates and characteristics to reflect the diverse beliefs and culture of their people and each land and its people represent a mandala icon revolving around Kumandra This is inspired by the local religious teaching that everything is centered around a common belief system or cosmology They used unconventional shapes experimented with scale and color and placed objects in unexpected locations to convey Kumandra s expression of fantasy Kumandra s Dragon River is inspired by the Mekong Dynamic colors in each land indicate Raya s location in the film br br According to character art director Shiyoon Kim br br At the core of our film are two characters their arc and their relationship so I tried to imagine the two of them at different moments in their journey I sketched the two as pals who hang out and share secrets growing closer and opening up over time br The production team focused the film on Raya and Sisu and their conflicting characteristics of trust issues and over trusting are the basis for the film s humor and emotion The team initially separately designed the characters drawing several designs of Raya and Sisu but they felt that something was lacking and their designs were incomplete prompting them to design the characters together which helped them better understand how they visually and thematically complemented each other br Raya was conceived as a serious swordswoman who focuses on finding Sisu and Sisu was conceived as a dragon trapped in her human form who refused to help Raya As writing progressed Raya softened and Sisu became more helpful the writers approached Raya as a character who acts flawlessly and Sisu as one who does everything sideways The production team ensured throughout the film Raya s observed quality would be culturally authentic functional for her role as a swordswoman and reflective of her emotional journey Her costume is based on a traditional sabai top and dhoti pants with cultural dragon references and her high collar cape and large hat act as protective layers the team intended to remove as she emotionally evolves in the film The team designed Raya with a feminine nose and strong prominent cheekbones they aimed to make her exceptionally expressive and emotionally diverse but mainly focused on her playful comedic aspects br Sisu and the other dragons are inspired by the naga mythical beings who can manifest as serpents or humans and are associated with water The team explored many silhouettes and attitudes of Sisu that ranged from ethereal and magical to ferocious and skeptical Specific design elements in Sisu s dragon form were retained in her human attire to create a cohesive recognizable character design br The poses of the dragon statues represent the production team s efforts to convey the same sense of grandeur dragons have in Southeast Asian culture The production team drew inspiration from the naga s cultural influence and powerful presence in Southeast Asia seeking to evoke the feeling of them existing in an invisible world beyond their own As a result all of the dragons except Sisu were revered and similarly reflect this effect The designers gave the dragons footsteps colorful refracted ripples of light to emphasize their cultural association with water among other design elements including glowing characteristics fluid grooms and textures scales and translucent fins br Water is a central element in the story it is used used to illustrate Raya s emotional growth Colored bodies of water represent moments in which Raya feels close to those around her while high contrast dark colored ones represent her distrust and insecurity The Druun were approached as embodiments of hopelessness and dread and were given a dynamic cloudy form that is difficult to perceive as a continuous form their concepts include aquatic life water boiling in reverse dough folding in on itself black holes and parasitic behaviors br Dragons also influenced the design of Heart dragons appear in sacred fortresses and palaces and serve as cultural symbols The production team aimed to make Heart s Pond a magical sacred place because it represents an important character moment between Raya and her father incorporating elements of flowers that only bloom at night While researching these flowers they came across an art installation involving lamps that would brighten and dim This inspired them to create Kumandra flowers which light up when the Dragon Gem is near br Tail was intended as the wild west of Kumandra drawing elements from fantasy plateaus and sand waterfalls Talon is inspired by Southeast Asian floating markets and night markets The designers approached Talon as a five level pier which they envisioned starting at the top level as the waterline dropped due to drought new platforms would be constructed underneath Spine s design was influenced by bamboo and focused on natural forms and textures Its design includes a black bamboo frame and a colossal woolly mammoth like tusked roofline with large stone foundations from the surrounding mountain The production team experimented with shadows and lighting to create a sense of mystery and drama for Spine s design br Fang s design reflects its commitment to strict principles design elements include brutalism and strong monolithic rigid geometric shapes The production team explored stretching Fang buildings and using repeated rooflines to evoke the ominous sensation of a large creature peering down In the Fang Palace tall vertical banners and giant gold fang like sculptures hang ominously from high ceilings Their rectangular sharp edges and cold sterile designs were meant to contrast the floral motifs and round organic shapes of Heart br To express Namaari s strength and power the designers experimented with facial expressions and physicality including her aggressive nature and fierce stare They provided Namaari with a hard edged outfit and a predominantly off white color palette to express her tough personality Young Namaari s costume is also designed to contrast her with young Raya Namaari s stark white and gold elements represent Fang s harsh lifestyle contrasting with Raya s draped soft blue designs br br Approximately artists worked on the film they used software applications such as Autodesk Maya Houdini and Nuke The animation team mixed traditional and D animation to create a unique style of warmth imperfection and distinctiveness that resembles shadow puppets used in Chinese storytelling The characters costumes were constructed by folding long pieces of fabric and the structure of the clothing did not heavily rely on seams this departs from the traditional method of tailoring which uses patterns as a guide br The animation team used intricate lighting techniques to create Kumandra s diverse atmospheric environments which range from deserts to tropical forests They used new techniques to depict the diversity of the crowd within each tribe including reusing and remixing interchangeable parts to efficiently create diverse characters They also used a system to manage the assets they were designing which helped them confirm these elements looked correct and consistent throughout the film It also ensured the data could be effectively used in the later stages of production Talon and Tail were particularly complex to animate Talon s complexities stem from its intricate diverse elements and assets that needed to be moved around water Despite Tail s minimalist landscape the perspective needed to be very close to capture the desert floor the manual modeling of cracks and the scattering of rocks and vegetation elements were added complexities br The animators significantly expanded their crowd system which was used to generate groups of characters and objects to suit the film s diverse complex scenes They modified their existing workflows tools and software The animators also experimented with creatively controlled computer generated simulations and procedural algorithmic approaches The in house Skeleton Library that was based on Houdini software also helped to manage the complexity of the diverse elements br Anisotropic distances unequal distances in different directions in Position based Dynamics PBD and Boids simulation techniques were used to create intricate scenes including beetles crawling on top of one another massive schools of fish and the movements of dragons PBD is used to simulate the behavior of objects whereas Boid simulations involve modeling the flocking or herding behavior of creatures Procedural animation layers were applied to simulate the movements of fish and dragons which were automatically generated using algorithms A technique called distance integral invariant was used to detect contacts between the dragons feet and the ground ensuring realistic interaction with the environment br The film s cinematography focuses on emphasizing Raya s character and her distrust of the world The animators created contrasting camera and lighting styles to illustrate trust and distrust applying them sequence to sequence and shot to shot based on her story arc For example the distrustful Raya was captured with a wide angle lens deep focus and a narrow color palette while the trusting Sisu was captured with a telephoto lens shallow focus and a broad color palette To highlight the abrupt transition between Raya being thrown into the blue waters of the Dragon River in Heart to the scene six years later in Tail s desert the cinematographers used light distortion techniques to create a mirage illusion accentuating the dramatic shift in lighting color climate and water in the film br br James Newton Howard composed the score for Raya and the Last Dragon and Jhen Aiko wrote and performed a song entitled Lead the Way which is heard during the end credits The score was released on February The following month Filipino singer KZ Tandingan was hired to perform Gabay Guide Disney s first ever Filipino language song which is a Filipino version of Lead the Way Gabay was released as part of the soundtrack of the film s Filipino dub Allie Benedicto studio marketing head of Disney Philippines said the song demonstrates Disney s commitment to work with local creative talents br br Disney released trailers for Raya and the Last Dragon on January Viewers expressed concerns about the limited Southeast Asian representation in the film s primarily East Asian cast and advocated for a more culturally accurate and diverse representation To promote the film Disney collaborated with brands such as McDonald s LG and Procter Gamble on toys and merchandise They also partnered with Southeast Asian brands like Omsum and Sanzo to acknowledge the Southeast Asia cultures that inspired the film and they supported and promoted local emerging advertisers there When choosing promotional partners they accounted for the film s target audience and the increasing audiences in theaters despite the COVID pandemic br Raya and the Last

Kumandra the cultural influences of the film from the Southeast Asia Story Trust outtakes from the film facts and Easter eggs Ripa s experience of working on the storyboard and deleted scenes br br Scholars mainly analyzed themes related to trust and feminism Raya s inability to trust stems from her childhood when her friend Namaari deceived Raya to obtain the Dragon Gem leading her to distrust and distance herself from others Benja s unwavering trust in others despite betrayal leads to a traumatic incident that intensifies Raya s distrust During her journey Raya encounters repeated betrayals that reinforce her vigilance and trust problems although she learns to overcome her past and bravely forgives with much assistance from Sisu Sri Wulan compared Raya s childhood experiences to those of children who learn to distrust their perceptions when they are confronted by double messages from their families He noted Raya s over protective vigilant isolating behavior and her tendency to assume and anticipate recurring betrayals Tawakkal et al said Raya s childhood experience symbolizes social problems including division and conflict arising from prejudice hatred greed and thirst for power and advocated for the importance of introspection and mutual understanding br Wardah and Kusuma said Raya and the Last Dragon reflects the evolving themes feminism gender equality and diverse female empowerment that are prevalent in earlier Disney princess films Unlike those films which romanticize love and emphasize physical beauty Raya and the Last Dragon portrays a strong female warrior protagonist who struggles to reunite her country Raya and the other female characters are depicted as rational courageous and independent of patriarchal dominance and they emphasize the importance of leadership and friendship over romance br Others critiqued the film s Southeast Asian inspiration elements Sutantos said the film s mix of cultural elements from various Southeast Asian countries misrepresents the philosophical meaning behind each element According to Nirwana Raya s qualities including bravery honesty loyalty and an appreciation of cultural diversity are highly valued in Indonesian culture These also include the ability to collaborate to reach a common goal and the portrayal of spiritual activities that align with the values commonly practiced throughout Southeast Asia Rosella et al said the film s portrayal of multiculturalism is conveyed through the depiction of Southeast Asian cuisines and practices This unity and togetherness between tribes shows the diversity of Southeast Asia cultures As is customary in these cultures Raya and the Last Dragon also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a harmonious relationship with nature Kumandra is a metaphor for environmental harmony and is portrayed as an ideal and heavenly place where everything coexists in harmony Benja strives to restore this environmental harmony after the tribes are divided by greed hatred and the Dragon Gems As such Wulan et al said the film advocates for environmental unity and sustainability br br Raya and the Last Dragon grossed million in the United States and
