its lighting During the on site filming at the Louvre the Mona Lisa s chamber was used as a storage room Westminster Abbey denied the use of its premises as did the church of Saint Sulpice The Westminster Abbey scenes were instead filmed at Lincoln and Winchester cathedrals which both belong to the Church of England Westminster Abbey is a Royal Peculiar a church or chapel under the direct jurisdiction of the monarch while Saint Sulpice is a Roman Catholic institution br Due to the denial of a location permit for Saint Sulpice the entire scene had to be re created virtually by post production company Rainmaker U K and though the set had been partially built the coordinates were centimeters out from what the compositors had expected and so the entire process was extremely difficult to complete br Lincoln Cathedral reportedly received in exchange for the right to film there filming took place August mainly within the cloisters of the cathedral The cathedral s bell which strikes the hour was silent for the first time since World War II during that time Although it remained a closed set protesters led by a year old woman named Sister Mary Michael demonstrated against the filming Sister Mary Michael spent hours praying on her knees outside the cathedral in protest against what she saw as the blasphemous use of a holy place to film a book containing heresy br

had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction as some religious groups wanted Some high ranking Vatican cabinet members had called for a boycott of the film McKellen responded I ve often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying This is fiction I mean walking on water It takes an act of faith And I have faith in this film not that it s true not that it s factual but that it s a jolly good story And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction and discuss the thing when they ve seen it br br The film was
