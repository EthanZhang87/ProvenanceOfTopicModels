horns of a ram the wings and hindlegs of an eagle and the tail of an iguana br br Lee Unkrich first pitched an idea for the film in when Toy Story which he also directed was released Initially the film was to be about an American child learning about his Mexican heritage while dealing with the death of his mother Eventually the team decided that this was the wrong approach and reformed the film to focus on a Mexican child instead Of the original version Unkrich noted that it reflected the fact that none of us at the time were from Mexico The fact that the film depicted a real culture caused anxiety for Unkrich who felt an enormous responsibility on his shoulders to do it right br The Pixar team made several trips to Mexico to help define the characters and story of Coco Unkrich said I d seen it portrayed in folk art There was something about the juxtaposition of skeletons with bright festive colors that captured my imagination It has led me down a winding path of discovery And the more I learn about el D a de los Muertos the more it affects me deeply The team found it difficult working with skeletal creatures as they lacked any muscular system and as such had to be animated differently from their human counterparts Coco also took inspiration from Hayao Miyazaki s anime films Spirited Away and Howl s Moving Castle as well as the action film John Wick br In Disney requested to trademark the phrase D a de los Muertos for merchandising applications This was met with criticism from the Mexican American community in the United States Lalo Alcaraz a Mexican American cartoonist drew a film poster titled Muerto Mouse depicting a skeletal Godzilla sized Mickey Mouse with the byline It s coming to trademark your cultura More than people signed a petition on Change org stating that the trademark was cultural appropriation and exploitation at its worst A week later Disney canceled the attempt with the official statement saying that the trademark filing was intended to protect any title for our film and related activities It has since been determined that the title of the film will change and therefore we are withdrawing our trademark filing In Pixar hired Alcaraz to consult on the film joining playwright Octavio Solis and former CEO of the Mexican Heritage Corp Marcela Davison Aviles to form a cultural consultant group br br Unkrich found writing the script the toughest nut to crack Earlier versions of the film had different universe rules regarding how Miguel originally called Marco would get back from the land of the dead in one case he physically had to run across the bridge In one version of the story his family is cursed with singing when trying to speak which was included as a technique to add music to a story where music is banned br br Coco is the first motion picture with a nine figure budget to feature an all Latino cast with a cost of million Gonzalez first auditioned for the role of Miguel when he was nine and was finalized in the role two years later Speaking of his character Gonzalez said Miguel and I both know the importance of following our dream and we know the importance of following our tradition so that s something that I connected with Miguel a lot During the film s pre production Miguel was originally set to be voiced by a child named Emilio Fuentes who was removed from the role after his voice deepened due to puberty throughout the film s production br In the Coco team made an official announcement about the cast which revealed that Gael Garc a Bernal Benjamin Bratt Ren e Victor and Anthony Gonzalez would voice the characters Bratt who voiced De la Cruz was moved when he realized that Disney Pixar wanted to make a film on Latin culture Disney officials closely monitored Bernal s movements and expressions while he voiced the characters and used their input for animating H ctor br Bratt voiced Ernesto de la Cruz a character who he described as the Mexican Frank Sinatra a larger than life persona On the advice of the filmmakers Bratt watched videos of equivalent Mexican actors including Jorge Negrete and Pedro Infante Bratt found the character similar to his father in physical appearance swagger and confidence and worked in the film as a tribute to him The character Mama Imelda s voice was provided by Alanna Ubach Ubach said that the film is giving respect to one quality that all Latin families across the universe do have in common and that is giving respect and prioritizing the importance of family Mama Imelda s voice was influenced by Ubach s t a Flora who was a profound influence in her life Ubach said her t a was the family s matriarch and dedicated the film to her br A cameo appearance was made by Marvel s Agents of S H I E L D actress Natalia Cordova Buckley as Mexican artist Frida Kahlo Unkrich stated that Cordova Buckley s role in Coco pays homage to Ms Kahlo her work and the people of Mexico who love her Unkrich also stated that it was a struggle to find a role in the film for John Ratzenberger who is not Latino but had voiced a character in every Pixar feature film As Unkrich did not want to break Pixar s tradition Ratzenberger was given a minor role with one word br br On April Unkrich announced that they had begun work on the animation The film s writer Adrian Molina was promoted to co director in late Unkrich said that Pixar wanted to have as much contrast between the Land of the Living and the Land of the Dead and that many techniques were used to differentiate the worlds Color was one Given the holiday and the iconography Pixar knew the Land of the Dead had to be a visually vibrant and colorful place so they deliberately designed Santa Cecilia to be more muted said Unkrich br According to Harley Jessup the film s production designer Santa Cecilia is based on real Mexican villages as the production team stayed grounded in reality in the Land of the Living Chris Bernardi the film s set supervisor said that the town was made small so Miguel could feel confined Bert Berry the film s art director said that aged building materials were used to depict Santa Cecilia as an older charming city According to Unkrich Miguel s guitar playing is authentic as they videotaped musicians playing each song or melody and strapped GoPros on their guitars to use as a reference For the scene in which Miguel plays music in his secret hideout the filmmakers used very elegant lyrical camera moves and gentle drifts and slow arcing moves around Miguel as he plays his guitar with very shallow depth of field to enhance the beauty of the soft focus foreground candles br Christian Hoffman the film s character supervisor said that all of the details in Mama Coco s face were not modeled Instead his team used special software to design separate layers of detail which were then added to her face with a shader The character s model was made with higher resolution to get all the wrinkles right according to Hoffman Pixar used some Xolo dogs as a reference for the character Dante while a tentacle from Finding Dory s Hank was used for his tongue br Jessup called the marigold petal bridge that connects both worlds elegant and magical Michael K O Brien the film s effects supervisor called it a huge technical challenge for the animation team but referred to it as something so visually exciting with petals dripping from it it was a massive artistic undertaking the production team wanted it to glow to feel alive The scenes in which Miguel takes a few petals off of the bridge and in which Hector sinks into the bridge were given more effects and special art direction br For the Land of the Dead Unkrich did not want to have just a free for all wacky world wanting instead to add logic and be ever expanding because new residents would arrive regularly Jessup said that the animation team wanted the Land of the Dead to be a vibrant explosion of color when Miguel arrived Jessup also said that Lee Unkrich described a vertical world of towers contrasting with the flatness of Santa Cecilia The lights and reflections are dazzling and there s a crazy transportation system that connects it all The costume colors are much more vibrant than in the Land of the Living where the animation team tried to stay grounded in reality They really went all out in the Land of the Dead to make it a reflection of the holiday According to David Ryu the film s supervising technical director the animation team figured out a way to introduce a single light but give it a million points for the scenes on the outside in the Land of the Dead The renderer sees it as one light but we see a million lights br According to art director Daniel Arraiga the animators had to figure out how to give the skeletons personality without skin muscles noses or even lips and that they played with shapes and did a lot of paintings They sculpted and studied skulls from every angle to figure out where they could add appeal and charm Global technology supervisor J D Northrup was hired early in the film s production to avoid potential issues in the film s animation process Northrup said Each of the skeletons pieces had to be independent so the complexity of the rig and the stress that it puts on the pipeline were something like we ve never seen before Northrup was also tasked with simplifying the skeleton s elements to render the skeleton crowds To create the skeletons several additional controls were used as they needed to move in ways that humans don t according to character modeling and articulation lead Michael Honse Honse said that the bones were a particular problem stating that there was a lot of back and forth with animation to get it right but found really cool ways to move the skeletons br br The first teaser of Coco was released on March The teaser trailer introduced the basic concept of the film while highlighting its focus on music Scott Mendelson of Forbes praised the trailer as a terrific old school Pixar sell mostly consisting of a single sequence and offering just the barest hint of what s to come The film s themes and imagery drew comparison to another animated film that centered around el D a de los Muertos The Book of Life A two minute short film titled Dante s Lunch A Short Tail was released online on March It introduces the film s supporting character a Xoloitzcuintle named Dante The short was created early in the animation process by Unkrich and his team to have a better sense of the character br The first official trailer was released on June followed by a second trailer on September The film was marketed extensively in Mexico including traditional wall painted advertising usually used for local events and never for films Cin polis a movie
