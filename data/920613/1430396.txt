cast br br br Production br br br Development br The film is based on a th century Jewish folktale which Joe Ranft introduced to Burton while they were finishing The Nightmare Before Christmas The film began production in November while Burton was completing Big Fish He continued with production on his next live action feature Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which was produced simultaneously with the film Co director Mike Johnson spoke about how they took a more organic approach to directing the film saying In a co directing situation one director usually handles one sequence while the other handles another Our approach was more organic Tim knew where he wanted the film to go as far as the emotional tone and story points to hit My job was to work with the crew on a daily basis and get the footage as close as possible to how I thought he wanted it br br br Filming br br The film was originally supposed to have been shot on film though a last minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology In during pre production on Henry Selick s feature Monkeybone the film s cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop motion characters with pre filmed live actors After finishing Monkeybone Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally In early the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot Two weeks before filming was to begin Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria The production then became digital After testing a dozen different models Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera the Canon EOS D Mark II an off the shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses mm mm Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera saying One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super film negative so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular mm cine lenses and get the same effect the same depth of field and angle of coverage I knew that we were going to be fighting to make this look like a real movie because we weren t shooting on film so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics br Animation took place at Mills Studios in East London A dozen animators puppeteers were put to work when production began but that number had tripled by the end of production The initial group spent time developing each puppet s unique characteristics The puppets themselves built by Mackinnon and Saunders were typically about inches tall and animated on sets built three to four feet off the ground with trap doors that allowed animators access to the sets surfaces to manipulate the puppets The three primary characters Victor Victoria and Corpse Bride were fitted with heads the size of golf balls that contained special gearing to allow the animators to manipulate individual parts of the puppets faces The animators work was spread over to individual setups stages each having its own Canon digital camera A total of cameras were used on the film Each camera was outfitted with a grabber system that enabled the animators to capture frames and download them into a computer to assemble a short reel of the shot being produced to check their work br The film s images were stored on a GB image card that was capable of holding approximately frames of animation Eight roving camera teams each team including a lighting cameraman an assistant a lighting electrician and a set dresser to deal with any art department issues worked with the animators to set up shots Each camera team had a lighting station workstation comprising an Apple G computer and a monitor to assist in checking lighting and framing to view TIFF file versions of the camera s images Once a shot was approved the computer was removed and the animators were left to shoot the scene using their still camera and grabber computer camera system to check their work The film s story department head Jeffrey Lynch explained that the scenes were developed initially from storyboards created by a team saying We shot as close to a film ratio one take per shot as we could because there was no time for reshoots We did most of our experimentation in the storyboard process as many ways as needed to get the scene how we wanted it There was no coverage as there would be for a live action film br Co director Johnson would go over each scene with the animators sometimes acting out the scene if necessary The animators would create a dope sheet in which a shot was broken down frame by frame to account for key hits The animators would then shoot tests of the scene often shooting on s or s meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation Johnson explained The next day when they d finish their test rehearsal we d cut it in and see how it played in the reel and fine tune from there We might do some lighting tweaks performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it Then we d close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot The animators would sometimes make use of the voice and or video recordings of the actors a practice also common in cel animation Once photographed the frames were manipulated by a team of data wranglers Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files converted to Cineon files and processed through a color cube Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained The color cube is a D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock in this case one of my favorites With this film emulation we could actually rate our cameras at ASA then take our light meters and spot meters and with great confidence shoot as if we were using Sure enough the footage would come back and look just like it The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting composition and color could be previewed br br br Visual effects br br Visual effects were delivered by London s Moving Picture Company MPC and were applied to the or so shots in the film though most of the effects simply painted out puppet supports and similar set equipment Some visual effects elements groups of birds and butterflies were created completely in CGI though others were composited as visual effects from real life elements Pete Kozachik explained that the trick for shooting the characters by themselves was obtaining visually interesting shots that would dependably support the director s storytelling saying The challenge is keeping the action clear and simple with lighting and composition There s a discipline to clear storytelling with these puppets You want to be abstract but one can easily go overboard with these critters because they aren t as familiar to the audience as real humans The characters don t necessarily translate the same as if you re shooting a real person You have to consciously balance arty atmosphere and graphic clarity so as to not confuse the audience about what it is they re looking at br In a interview with About com Burton spoke about the differences between directing Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas saying The difference on that was that one I had designed completely It was a very completed package in my mind I felt like it was there I felt more comfortable with it With this it was a bit more organic It was based on an old folk tale We kept kind of changing it but you know I had a great co director with Mike Johnson I feel like we complemented each other quite well It was just a different movie a different process He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor saying It was weird because we were doing both at the same time He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so it might have been a little schizophrenic for him But he s great It s the first animated movie he s done and he s always into a challenge We just treat it like fun and a creative process Again that s the joy of working with him He s kind of up for anything He just always adds something to it The amazing thing is all the actors never worked together They were never in a room together so they were all doing their voices except for Albert Finney and Joanna Lumley did a few scenes together everybody else was separate They were all kind of working in a vacuum which was interesting That s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully that their performances really meshed together So he was very canny as they all were about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other br br br Music br br The soundtrack was produced by Danny Elfman

Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review calling it A wondrous flight of fancy a stop motion animated treat brimming with imaginative characters evocative sets sly humor inspired songs and a genuine whimsy that seldom finds its way into today s movies br Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review saying The variety of its cadaverous style is never less than inspired never has the human skull s natural grin been redeployed so exhaustively for yuks Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B saying As an achievement in macabre visual wizardry Tim Burton s Corpse Bride has to be reckoned some sort of marvel br Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars saying Cinema s reinvigorated fixation with the living dead suggests that we are in the grip of an impossible longing or perhaps it s just another movie cycle running its course Whatever the case there is something heartening about Mr Burton s love for bones and rot here if only because it suggests despite some recent evidence that he is not yet ready to abandon his own dark kingdom Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four saying What makes Corpse Bride sing ultimately is the breadth of imagination that it demonstrates creating a cluttered textured and mysteriously beautiful world that we re loathe to leave at the end br Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film three out of four stars saying Ghoulishness and innocence walk hand in hand in Tim Burton s Corpse Bride a movie that digs into Hollywood s past to resurrect the antique art of stop motion animation and create a fabulous bauble of a movie Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News gave the film three and a half stars out of four saying Stop motion animation may be the hardest and most tedious job in Hollywood but the makers of Tim Burton s Corpse Bride deserve a couple of years in Tahiti celebrating their effort br Lisa Rose of the Newark Star Ledger gave the film three out of five stars saying Corpse Bride offers unclassifiable enchantment James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars saying As animated films go this is easily the best of a weak year Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars saying If his The Nightmare Before Christmas from a dozen years back was a treat for the eyes and mind Tim Burton s Corpse Bride goes double or nothing by being a delight for the ears and also the heart Joe Williams of the St Louis Post Dispatch gave the film a B saying Beneath the bone pile of allusions Corpse Bride is a darkly enchanting fable in its own right br Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer gave the film a negative review saying Corpse Bride turns out to be a ponderous mixture of puppetry and animation that is far too technologically complex and laborious for this hopelessly Luddite reviewer Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars calling it A sweet and visually lovely tale of love lost Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film four out of five stars saying The sweetness the visual flourishes and inspired pieces of casting carry the Corpse Bride if not all the way down the primrose path then at least across the threshold Robert K Elder of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three and a half stars out of four saying If Nightmare Before Christmas was a jazzy pop number Corpse Bride is a waltz an elegant deadly funny bit of macabre matrimony br Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film two out of five stars saying The film does have a fairy tale aspect but like many of its characters it is more dead and buried than fully alive Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four saying Corpse Bride is an unexpectedly touching celebration of love told in a quirky and inventive style Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of five saying In the guise of a family film Burton evokes a darkly erotic obsession that recalls Edgar Allan Poe and Hitchcock s Vertigo It would be a test for any filmmaker and Burton aces it br Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four saying Tim Burton s Corpse Bride is easily the best stop motion animated necrophiliac musical romantic comedy of all time It is also just simply wonderful a morbid merry tale of true love that dazzles the eyes and delights the soul Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four saying Corpse Bride will win your heart if it doesn t rip it out of your chest first Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press gave the film three out of four stars saying There s a happy Halloween in store even for children who

Corpse Bride suffers from the same problem that has plagued Burton s recent live action films for all its formidable razzle dazzle it doesn t engage the heart Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the
