announced that Apple had acquired Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart s Wolfwalkers from a script by Will Collins The film is an original concept that was created by Moore and Stewart and its animation uses a unique D style alternating between a woodblock aesthetic and loose expressive line work br br br Music br Moore s frequent collaborators Bruno Coulais and folk group K la provided the film s original score Norwegian singer songwriter Aurora contributed to the soundtrack with a re recorded version of her single Running with the Wolves br br br Animation and design br The animation of Wolfwalkers was primarily drawn by hand using TVPaint with digital brushes to imitate physical pencil lines Some crowds and background elements were animated with Moho Backgrounds were drawn and painted on paper br The film s visual design uses contrasting styles to represent the conflict between the forest and the town of Kilkenny The town and its inhabitants are drawn in a style inspired by th century woodcuts using thick lines and angular geometric shapes This represents the cage like nature of the town and the Lord Protector s rules In contrast the forest animals and wolfwalker characters are drawn with sketchy and expressive linework with curving shapes to convey the freedom and liveliness of the forest Robyn s design starts out with the woodblock appearance of the town but as she comes to identify more with the wolfwalkers her design transitions to the sketchy pencil lines of the forest The art style of the forest characters also includes intentional pencil construction lines which would normally be removed by a clean up department The directors were inspired by the rough expressive animation of The Tale of the Princess Kaguya and the Xeroxed animation of One Hundred and One Dalmatians which preserved the pencilled art of the animators Tomm Moore said he had the idea that it would be great to make a virtue of the fact that it s hand drawn and to really make it look like a Glen Keane line test or something like really really rough and scratchy br Certain first person shots in the film called wolfvision depict Robyn s point of view as she moves through the environment as a wolf Many of the wolfvision scenes required a dynamic camera that mimicked the natural movement of Robyn s head as she ran To achieve this Eimhin McNamara the wolfvision supervisor developed a technique that combined D technology with traditional hand drawn art McNamara s team constructed a D forest environment with the virtual reality painting software Quill with further refinement and stylisation done in Blender This allowed him to previsualise the scene and adjust the camera as needed Each frame of the CG animation was then printed out in magenta which the artists drew over with pencil and charcoal to match the film s hand drawn look The frames were then scanned and the underlying magenta was digitally removed McNamara said that this technique is just about getting an organic thing on screen that looks like people made it br br br Release br The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September br It was released theatrically on October by
