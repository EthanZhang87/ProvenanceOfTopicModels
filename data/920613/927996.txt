The Ferrari F Type F is a sports car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari from until as a successor to the Ferrari The car is an update to the with exterior and performance changes It was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show The F was succeeded by the which was unveiled on July An estimated F s were produced between and br br Designed by Pininfarina in collaboration with Frank Stephenson Director of Ferrari Maserati Concept Design and Development the body styling of the F was revised from its predecessor the to improve its aerodynamic efficiency Although the drag coefficient remained the same the downforce was greatly enhanced Despite sharing the same basic Alcoa Aluminium chassis roofline doors and glass the car looked significantly different from the A great extent of Ferrari heritage was included in the exterior design At the rear the Enzo s tail lights and engine cover vents were added The car s name was etched on the Testarossa styled driver s side mirror The large oval openings in the front bumper are reminiscent of Ferrari racing models from the s specifically the shark nose Formula One car br br The F features a cc L V engine of the Ferrari Maserati F family This new power plant was a significant change for Ferrari as all previous Ferrari V s were descendants of the Dino racing program of the s This fifty year development cycle came to an end with the entirely new engine used in the F the architecture of which replaced the Dino derived V in most other Ferrari cars The engine s output specifications are PS kW hp at rpm and N m lb ft of torque at rpm of which is available below rpm Despite a increase in displacement engine weight grew by only kg lb along with a decrease in diameter for easier packaging The connecting rods pistons and crankshaft were all entirely new while the valve cylinder head valves and intake trumpets were directly retained from Formula engines for ideal volumetric efficiency The F has a top speed in excess of km h mph and can accelerate from to km h mph in seconds seconds quicker than the old model br br The brakes on the F were developed in close cooperation with Brembo and Bosch resulting in a new cast iron alloy for the discs The new alloy includes molybdenum which has a better heat dissipation performance The F was also available with the optional Carbon fibre reinforced Silicon Carbide C SiC ceramic composite brake package Ferrari claimed the carbon ceramic brakes will not fade even after laps at their test track br br The F featured the E Diff a computer controlled limited slip active differential which can vary the distribution of torque based on inputs such as steering angle and lateral acceleration br Other notable features include the first application of Ferrari s manettino steering wheel mounted control knob Drivers can select from five different settings which modify the vehicle s ESC system Skyhook electronic suspension transmission behavior throttle response and E Diff The feature is similar to Land Rover s Terrain Response system br The F automated manual transmission was built by Graziano Trasmissioni br The Ferrari F was available with exclusive Goodyear Eagle F GSD EMT tires which have a V shaped tread design run flat capability and OneTRED technology br In the US the company requested an exemption from the airbag design requirements which was eventually granted allowing the car to continue to be sold in the US br br The F Spider is the convertible version of the F It was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show making it Ferrari s st road going convertible br The car was designed by Pininfarina with aerodynamic simulation programs used for Formula cars br The conversion from a closed top to an open air convertible is a two stage folding action the roof panel automatically folds away inside a space above the engine bay The interior and performance of the Spider are identical to that of the coup with an increase in the weight and decrease in the top speed by km h mph br br Serving as the successor to the Challenge Stradale the Scuderia scuderia meaning stable but also used in the context of motor racing teams including Ferrari s own was unveiled by Michael Schumacher at the Frankfurt Auto Show Aimed to compete with cars like the Porsche GT and the Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera superleggera meaning super light weight it is lighter by kg lb and more powerful PS kW hp at rpm and N m lb ft of torque at rpm than the standard F Increased power comes from a revised intake exhaust and an ion sensing knock detection system that allows for a higher compression ratio in the engine Thus the weight to power ratio is reduced from kg hp to kg hp br In addition to the weight saving measures the Scuderia s single clutch automated manual gained improved Superfast software known as Superfast for faster millisecond shift times A new traction control system combined the F Trac traction from the GTB and stability control with the E Diff electronic differential The Ferrari Scuderia accelerates from km h mph in seconds with a top speed of km h mph br br To commemorate Ferrari s th victory in the Formula Constructor s World Championship in Ferrari unveiled the Scuderia Spider M at World Finals in Mugello It is a convertible version of the Scuderia br The engine is rated at PS kW hp at rpm and N m lb ft of torque at rpm The car has a dry weight of kg lb kg lb lighter than the F Spider and a kerb weight of kg lb The chassis was stiffened to cope with the extra performance available and the car featured many carbon fibre parts and weight saving measures as standard such as lightened front and rear bumpers Unique spoke forged wheels were specifically produced for the M and helped to considerably reduce unsprung weight with larger front brakes and calipers added for extra stopping power also featured on Scuderia It accelerates from km h mph in seconds with a top speed of km h mph br cars were produced beginning early and all were pre sold to select clients br br A version of the F Spider that runs on ethanol called the F Spider Bio Fuel was on display at the Detroit Auto Show It had the same litre V engine as the standard car producing hp kW with a increase in torque and with less carbon dioxide emissions than the standard F Spider br br The F based Ferrari SP Special Project Number was the first one off special produced by the Ferrari Portfolio Coachbuilding Programme also known as the Special Projects Programme SP The body was designed by former Pininfarina designer Leonardo Fioravanti at the behest of Junichiro Hiramatsu a Japanese businessman who was the former president of the Ferrari Club of Japan and an avid collector he had admired Fioravanti s F prototype br br The F Challenge is the track version of the F designed for the Ferrari Challenge The engine remained untouched but the vehicle s weight was reduced resulting in a top speed of km h mph The production model was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January br br Built since by Ferrari Corse Clienti department in collaboration with Michelotto the F GTC is a racing car designed to compete in international GT class competition such as in the American Le Mans Series Le Mans Series and FIA GT Championship F GTCs also compete at the Hours of Le Mans The GTC was the fastest and most developed racing version of the F br In FIA GT championship in order to render the car performances more uniform the cars are forced to run with a specific minimum weight and with an engine restrictor that depends on the engine displacement Hence Ferrari destroked the L V engine to L in order to compete in the L class in GT class racing which is allowed to race with a minimum weight of kg lb In this race configuration the engine produces somewhat less power at kW PS hp If they were to use the litre engine the minimum weight of the F would increase by kg lb and the litre engine thus yields a better power to weight ratio br The F GTCs won their class championships in the ALMS and FIA GT as well as scoring class wins at the and Hours of Sebring at the and Hours of Le Mans and at the and Petit Le Mans br br Originally based on the F Challenge the F GT is a specialised racing car developed in by JMB Racing for the FIA GT European Championship and other national GT championships such as British GT and FFSA GT It is mechanically similar to the F Challenge but has better developed aerodynamics and more power br The car uses the same L V engine tuned to produce kW PS hp making the GT more powerful than its GT counterpart However due to the GT regulations stating that the car must have a power to weight ratio of around kg hp the car weighs kg lb in race trim driver and fuel excluded which is roughly kg lb more than the GT spec car Despite the higher power it is significantly slower than the GT version for example in the Spa Hours endurance race in which both models were entered the GT spec vehicles best qualification time was around seconds slower per lap than that set by the GT spec vehicle br br Developed by Kessel Racing for the season the GT Scuderia is the successor of the previous F GT br br In February Ferrari recalled about F Spiders in the U S due to the risk that heat from the engine could cause the convertible top s hydraulic hoses to fracture and leak flammable fluid onto the engine resulting in a fire br br Holmes Mark Ultimate Convertibles Roofless Beauty London Kandour pp ISBN br br Ferrari website br Ferrari F on Edmunds com
