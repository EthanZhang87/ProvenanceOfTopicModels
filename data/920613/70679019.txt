br Chart performance br br br Cars Original Score br br br Development br The film s score was composed by Pixar s frequent collaborator Randy Newman who previously composed the first film s score Tom MacDougall Disney s executive vice president of music said that Newman has a real connection to the Cars world and that His ability to capture the feelings on this film its characters locations and the Americana theme throughout is extraordinary the music is so naturally fluid and inspired It really feels like Randy is coming home with this score Newman quoted tracks from the first film in moments where Fee wanted to evoke an earlier time br For the score of Cars both Fee and Reher wanted Newman to score as they wanted to get back to the roots of the franchise While approaching Newman Fee wanted him not to score for the visuals but for the emotional tone as well br Newman spent more than two to three years writing the film s score with the recording began in late March at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City California For the score Newman had arranged a piece orchestra his largest ever till date which Newman said To make any mark in a picture where cars are racing of the time you have to make some noise The score was split into three chunks According to Fee in an interview with Variety Propelling the action is only one aspect of the assignment Setting the tone and underlining the story s emotions are equally important Randy can do Americana like no one else But he has this magic ability to be incredibly emotional He can play comedy and then two beats later have you reaching for a tissue You have an epic experience because of what Randy writes br Newman reprised one of the themes from Cars in the final minutes of the film while rest of the themes were newly composed consisting of classical music He stated that It s a fairly mature premise about someone getting older and worried It s a little less broad as in the story Lightning McQueen no longer the world champion racecar he once was is trying to make a comeback The recording of the score concluded on June two days before the film s release br br br Reception br Laughing Place s review summarised Randy Newman purists will delight that this release is all Randy from start to finish James Southall of Movie Wave wrote Randy Newman s Pixar scores are so consistent in style and indeed quality it s highly improbable that your reaction to Cars will be much different from your reaction to the rest of them it s so distinctive so far removed from what everyone else does for these things that despite its great consistency it still feels fresh It s not for everyone but you know what you re going to get with one of these and that s exactly what Newman has delivered Jonathan Broxton of Movie Music UK wrote While it is unlikely to ever be considered a top tier Pixar score Cars nevertheless has much more impressive musical content than one might have anticipated The sense of fun and joy that Randy Newman brings to the project is infectious the scope of the orchestral arrangements is impressive and the action music is especially noteworthy in fact it comes close to rivaling his career best in that regard Best of all it s just so refreshing to hear such bold unashamed emotionally direct orchestral scoring coming out of a major film studio in br br br Track listing br br br Charts br br br
