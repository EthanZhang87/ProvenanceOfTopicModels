language br Seth Green described doing the motion capture as physically demanding work A lot of running jumping falling hitting spinning I wore a harness for like percent of the movie It was

its first day and its opening weekend earnings added up to Overall the film debuted in fifth place behind Battle Los Angeles Rango Red Riding Hood and The Adjustment Bureau This is the nd worst opening ever for a film playing in theaters Adjusted for inflation considering the total net loss of money not the profit to loss ratio it is the fourth largest box office failure in history In the Los Angeles Times listed the film as one of the most expensive box office disasters of all time On March Brooks Barnes of The New York Times commented that it was rare for a Disney branded film to do so badly with the reason for its poor performance being the unoriginal premise the animation style which failed to cross the uncanny valley threshold and negative word of mouth on social networks along with releasing it on the same week as Battle Los Angeles which had more hype with the general movie goers Barnes concluded Critics and audiences alike with audiences voicing their opinions on Twitter blogs and other social media complained that the Zemeckis technique can result in character facial expressions that look unnatural Another common criticism was that Mr Zemeckis focuses so much on technological wizardry that he neglects storytelling br br The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a approval rating with an average rating of based on reviews The website s consensus reads The cast is solid and it s visually well crafted but Mars Needs Moms suffers from a lack of imagination and heart On Metacritic the film had a score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br The Sydney Morning Herald labeled the motion capture animation superior to Avatar and while noting the story had pure Disney cheese Wells thankfully know s precisely when to inject action and humour when the mush o meter approaches the red br Some critics favorably compared the set design to Tron Legacy including Tim Grierson of Screen Daily who opined that the motion capture improved significantly since the days of The Polar Express He also spotlighted the film s attempt at a tonal divide as it has both comic sequences typical for a kids film and themes about sacrifice However he criticized the chaotic story and two irksome protagonists Milo whose voice actor overdoes the character s whiny anxiousness to the point that it s hard to root for him and Gribble a predictably wisecracking sidekick Us Weekly also panned the characters Milo makes a whiny hero and Dan Fogler as his buddy on Mars fails to amuse Plus why is Milo s stay at home mom a saint and the working alien moms evil br The Hollywood Reporter praised Mars Needs Moms s motion capture visuals but analogized its story as too much like a Disneyland ride and also called it odd how a movie meant to glorify moms is so riddled with anti feminist concepts Time Out New York called it not that much different from other children s science fiction movies After the novelty of these backgrounds and comin at ya bits wears off Mars Needs Moms has to rely on Fogler s obnoxious Jack Black Jr shtick a weak subplot involving a s obsessed Martian graffiti artist Harnois and rote video game y action sequences to carry it along and that simply won t cut it br Entertainment Weekly positively described the film as a children s movie version of Avatar Enhanced by nimble ad libbing from the comedy trained cast the screenplay is delightful by turns funny and emotional as befits a Disney family fable in which through wacky adversity Mom and kid reaffirm their love for each other while Dad is nowhere in sight He s not dead just away on business And with its splendid use of computer generated motion capture animation and D effects the movie is also visually magnificent modestly so Mike Hale of the New York Times also gave the film a negative review saying Mars once again looks to Earth to supplement its female population because it seems the women who run Mars think Earth mothers are skilled at child rearing br Lael Loewenstein of Variety magazine gave the film a mixed review and called it A modestly enjoyable performance capture creation bearing the unmistakable imprint of producer Robert Zemeckis In addition to acclaiming the visuals br SFX also opined gave some praises towards the writing there are some good laughs it s pacy enough to whizz us on by the sometimes repetitive narrative and although it s hard to see little boys admitting that they really do love their mummies as much as the film wants them to Mars Needs Moms does provoke a few lumps in older throats for all you may decry its mawkish Stateside sensibilities br Nick Schager of The Village Voice was very harsh panning the rubbery unreal and unsettling character animation which he called a jarring dissonance with the science fiction setting and the stealing of common tropes in other well known science fiction films He also noted a major plot hole specifically Supervisor s stealing of mothers disciplinary skills for use on technological devices The plot thus hinges on a fundamental illogicality since the chief differentiating characteristic between mothers and machines isn t discipline but compassion William Thomas of Empire gave the film a two out of five stars saying An uninvolving mo cap adventure that s well below par Marvin the Martian would be unhappy to share his planet with this bunch br Some reviewers questioned the film s moral about well behaved kids having their very good mothers taken by aliens br br Mars Needs Moms received a nomination for a Movieguide Award for Best Film for Family Audiences while John Powell s work on it Rio and Kung Fu Panda
