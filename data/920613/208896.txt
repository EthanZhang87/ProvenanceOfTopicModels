Lightyear voiced by Patrick Warburton Famed Space Ranger known for heroism and bravery and leader of Team Lightyear Buzz often suggests that his archenemy Emperor Zurg is behind every evil plot and is often proven correct Like his Toy Story incarnation Buzz is idealistic and a stickler for procedure but will tell a cover story if he needs to However he has few people skills and at times displays a lack of integrity He attended PS that s as a primary school He wrote at least half of the regulations in the Star Command Manual He also owns a house on Capital Planet though as they all look alike and his duties often keep him away he is confused over just which one is his To compare this animation and the Toy Story films the button between the red and blue ones is green in the Toy Story films and yellow in this animation with the releasing of strings when pressed He seems to have a little crush on Dr Ozma Furbanna and vice versa br Princess Mira Nova voiced by Nicole Sullivan is a rookie ranger and heir to the Tangean throne She utilizes her people s ability to phase through walls called ghosting and read minds Buzz has a tendency to refer to her as Princess when he s angry with her She acts as Buzz s co pilot and second in command She has the most common sense of the team Mira also has an estranged relationship with her father King Nova who disapproves of her choice of being a Space Ranger though deep down she still cares about him She has red hair and turquoise skin br Booster Sinclair Munchapper voiced by Stephen Furst is a huge frog dinosaur like former janitor from the agricultural planet of Jo ad a play on the name of the Joad family from John Steinbeck s The Grapes of Wrath He has a big appetite and incredible strength but is sweet and occasionally naive He is in awe of Buzz Lightyear and has encyclopedic knowledge of his prior adventures br XR Xperimental Ranger voiced alternatively by Larry Miller and Neil Flynn is a short robot that was originally emotionless and programmed to learn from Buzz but was blown apart by Agent Z during his first mission The LGMs rebuilt him but the temporary loss of the Uni Mind to Emperor Zurg left them off their game They rebuilt XR with his slicker more emotional personality and a variety of attachments XR stands for Experimental Ranger The LGMs have stated that this is the official meaning of the name though other characters on the show hold the erroneous belief that the X stands for Expendable He gets blown apart on nearly every mission he goes on but is easily rebuilt He considers Commander Nebula his father due to him unintentionally signing the paperwork authorizing his creation and is always seeking his approval br br br Other personnel br Commander Nebula voiced by Adam Carolla is the Space Rangers commander and Buzz s superior whose left leg was replaced by a pegleg like plasma cannon Rather short tempered and constantly speaks with a loud voice He has a robotic desk that forces him to do his paperwork He hates to do so though and therefore signs forms without looking at them By doing so he inadvertently authorized the creation of XR which was included on a vacation request form filled by the LGMs br LGMs or Little Green Men both voiced by Patrick Warburton are small three eyed aliens originally appeared as squeeze toy aliens in the Toy Story movies They are the intensely loyal backbone of Star Command keeping the station running while inventing maintaining all of the equipment When one of their own is kidnapped the other LGMs will instinctively try to rescue him by any means necessary LGMs are typically in awe of Buzz While they generally like the other Rangers they may not be able to tell one from another Several of their race are also shown to work for Santa Claus acting as his toy builders br Ty Parsec voiced by Steve Hytner is the infamous old comrade of Buzz Lightyear who is fed up with Buzz always coming to his rescue The Space Ranger was accidentally transformed into the robotic Wirewolf equivalent of a werewolf on the planet of Canis Lunis after being bitten by the villain NOS A while exposed to radioactive moonrock Appeared in two episodes with a cameo appearance in the episode War Peace and War He is ultimately cured and reinstated as a Space Ranger br Rocket Crocket voiced by Phil LaMarr Member of Star Command and leader of Team Rocket He has been Buzz s rival since their academy days br Fop Doppler voiced by Rob Paulsen is a Tangean like Mira he joined as a challenge to win her hand in marriage but it was called off after he expressed his enjoyment of being a ranger right after helping foil Lord Angstrom s attempt to overthrow King Nova br Petra Hammerhold voiced by Nikki Cox is Senator Hammerhold s daughter She joined Star Command when her father forced her to do so largely to keep her from her boyfriend Plasma Boy She was initially resentful of this but was moved by Buzz s heroism during a crisis br Plasma Boy voiced by Michael Showalter is Petra s boyfriend who has a Plasma Monster form Booster competed against him for Petra s affection When Mira and XR fired a laser at his Plasma Monster form he destabilized enough to the brink of explosion He was prevented from explosion when Booster used his suit and Ion Stabilization Matrix on him He s now a member of Star Command br voiced by Joy Behar Usually the name of Buzz Lightyear s ship it gained A I from one of the encounters with the Valkyran Raiders and a new energy projector device inserted on the ship by the LGMs doesn t like what Buzz says about her and usually controls the ship herself XR developed a crush on her When the Valkyran Raiders were thwarted s consciousness was placed into a robot body and she now helps the LGMs br br br Villains br Evil Emperor Zurg voiced by Wayne Knight The main antagonist of the series and Buzz s archenemy Rules an empire on Planet Z and wants to rule the entire universe while destroying Star Command Zurg often takes any opportunity to eliminate Buzz Most of his subjects are robots His feet double as rockets and he can transform his arms into a variety of weapons Despite often breaking the seriousness of otherwise purely evil statements Zurg is widely considered the most evil person in the galaxy especially by the other villains He seems to have some neuroses about being touched In some episodes is shown being sinister The episode War and Peace and War was notably the only episode where Zurg teamed up with Buzz Lightyear to defeat the Heed a common enemy that was trying to take over their galaxy In Stranger Invasion he claimed to be Buzz s father a parody upon The Empire Strikes Back and a nearly identical scene in Toy Story but quickly took it back using the statement as a Made You Look in order to stun and deceive Buzz and gain the upper hand br The Grubs both voiced by Frank Welker are Zurg s equivalents to the LGMs of Star Command though far less competent They perform mechanical and technical duties The Grubs work for Zurg against their will and also desire freedom but many of them are simply too afraid to try to defect br Brain Pods Various Voices for each one are Cybernetic brains in mobile jars who serve Zurg as scientists and researchers Although they take pride in their creations they secretly harbor a desire to escape from Zurg s control Two of which are shown succeeding in doing so on screen br The Hornets are Zurg s robotic foot soldiers extremely expendable lousy shots and always get vaporized in mass numbers by Lightyear s team Hornets come in different models but the most frequently seen are yellow and of average height br Warp Darkmatter voiced by Diedrich Bader was once Buzz s partner and best friend but he had been secretly working for Zurg since his academy days as a double agent and also betrayed Star Command He eventually began working for him full time as Agent Z His right arm is robotic with various weapon attachments and was grafted to his body after becoming Agent Z Warp often takes on assignments for Zurg and is paid quite handsomely He owns a whole moon and a summer asteroid in the Hampton s Ring Though Buzz has vowed to bring him in for treason he retains some hope that there is still some good in him br Evil Buzz Lightyear voiced by Patrick Warburton is the evil counterpart of Buzz from an alternate universe where he is an evil emperor instead of Zurg due to the fact that Zurg in the alternate universe apparently didn t have what it took to be the ultimate evil Zurg now works as a server at Cosmo s Diner and has destroyed Star Command along with various other planets and the Galactic Alliance The Evil Buzz looks exactly like Buzz Lightyear except having facial hair and wearing armor similar to Emperor Zurg but with pants and without a cape and the letter L in the center of his chest instead of the letter Z He appears to be more dangerous and evil than Emperor Zurg but despite being intimidated Emperor Zurg teams up with the Evil Buzz to eliminate Buzz Lightyear and Star Command in the original universe but was thwarted by Buzz with the help of the alternate counterparts of Booster Mira XR and Nebula Evil Buzz escapes and later teams up and falls in love with Gravitina br Gravitina voiced by Kerri Kenney Silver is a large headed female villain with mental control over gravity One of Zurg s allies and once hired to destroy Star Command She s in love with Buzz and later his evil counterpart br NOS A voiced by Craig Ferguson is a robotic vampire created by Zurg He is capable of

a reformed XL His name is a pun on the term Nosferatu br Torque voiced by Brad Garrett are minor alien villain who committed crimes of terrorism smuggling arson and unpaid parking tickets After being freed from a prison transport by Zurg s Hornets the Grubs implanted a cell separation device upon his chest Torque then possesses the ability to create duplicate versions of himself They are unstable however as a single laser blast is enough to destroy them In The Taking of PC he tried to turn Booster evil and later Buzz with a memory altering device built by the Warden of PC The same device also made Torque temporarily at least a heroic good guy Torque rides a motorcycle shaped spacecraft and his duplication abilities seem to be a reference to the character Lobo who was also voiced by Brad Garrett in his DCAU appearances br XL voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait is XR s predecessor and technically older brother who was shut down due to his villainous attitude When he was reactivated by Zurg XL rebuilt himself into a larger more powerful robot with cutting edge and stolen robot parts His head is red whereas XR s is yellow He infiltrates Star Command numerous times because its command codes are in his head Like XR he considers Commander Nebula his father though he resents him for shutting him down He later redeems himself and is converted into an office managing robot capable of photocopying collating and other office related functions but is never seen for the rest of the series afterwards His name is a pun referring to his size extra large br Wirewolf voiced by Steve Hytner is a Space Ranger Ty Parsec see above who patrolled the planet Canis Lunis until an attack from NOS A While Ty was in combat with the energy vampire NOS A flew himself and Ty up into the beam which gave power to the planet from the moon s radioactive energy and bit into Ty s skin After NOS A fled Ty started to mutate into some sort of electronic canine later given the title of Wirewolf Having discovered that this transformation only happens in the light of the Canis Lunis moon Buzz told Booster to destroy the moon Once the moon was destroyed Team Lightyear believed that the Wirewolf was
