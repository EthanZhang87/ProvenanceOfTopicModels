finally creating the storyline from scratch br Production designer David James stated that the film is a return to what made us nerds in the first place getting classic movie monsters and relaunching them in a contemporary setting Director Conrad Vernon added that he found it would be a great idea to take hideous monsters and give them personalities and satirize the archetypes Each of the five monsters has traits traceable to sci fi horror B movies from the s s and s although none is a mere copy of an older character Susan who grows to be feet inches tall into Ginormica was inspired by Attack of the Foot Woman Dr Cockroach represents The Fly and The Curse of Frankenstein while B O B is an amalgam of slithering and slimy characters that were featured in the films including The Blob and The Crawling Eye Insectosaurus a foot tall monster is a nod to the Kaiju film Mothra According to Vernon the Missing Link has no direct inspiration He just represents anything prehistoric that comes back to life and terrorizes people For the San Francisco sequence the producers researched many films and photographs for an accurate depiction of the city and filmed animator Line Andersen who had a similar body type to Ginormica tall thin and athletic looking walking alongside a scale model of San Francisco to capture better how a person not comfortable with being too big with an
