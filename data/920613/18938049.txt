DVD Video is a consumer video format used to store digital video on DVDs DVD Video was the dominant consumer home video format in Asia North America Europe and Australia in the s until it was supplanted by the high definition Blu ray Disc before eventually both were replaced by streaming services such as Netflix and Disney Discs using the DVD Video specification require a DVD drive and an MPEG decoder e g a DVD player or a computer DVD drive with a software DVD player Commercial DVD movies are encoded using a combination of MPEG compressed video and audio of varying formats often multi channel formats as described below Typically the data rate for DVD movies ranges from to Mbit s and the bit rate is usually adaptive DVD Video was first available in Japan on November with major releases beginning December followed by a release on March in the United States to line up with the th Academy Awards that same day br The DVD Video specification was created by DVD Forum and can be obtained from DVD Format Logo Licensing Corporation for a fee of The specification is not publicly available and every subscriber must sign a non disclosure agreement Certain information in the DVD Book is proprietary and confidential br br br Video data br To record digital video DVD Video uses either H MPEG Part compression at up to Mbit s kbit s or MPEG Part compression at up to Mbit s kbit s DVD Video supports video with a bit depth of bits per color encoded as YCbCr with chroma subsampling br The following formats are allowed for H MPEG Part video br br At a display rate of frames per second interlaced or progressive scan commonly used in regions with Hz image scanning frequency compatible with analog line PAL SECAM br pixels D resolution fullscreen or widescreen aspect ratio br pixels CIF resolution br pixels China Video Disc resolution br pixels CIF resolution br At a display rate of frames per second interlaced or progressive scan commonly used in regions with Hz image scanning frequency compatible with analog line NTSC br pixels D resolution or br pixels SIF resolution br pixels China Video Disc resolution br pixels SIF resolution br The following formats are allowed for MPEG video br br pixels at frame s progressive CIF VCD resolution br pixels at frame s progressive SIF VCD resolution br The MPEG Part format does not support interlaced video The H MPEG Part format supports both interlaced and progressive scan content and can handle different frame rates from the ones mentioned above by using pulldown This is most commonly used to encode frame s content for playback at frame s Pulldown can be implemented directly while the disc is mastered by actually encoding the data on the disc at frames s however this practice is uncommon for most commercial film releases which provide content optimized for display on progressive scan television sets br Alternatively the content can be encoded on the disc itself at one of several alternative frame rates and use flags that identify scanning type field order and field repeating pattern Such flags can be added in video stream by the H MPEG Part encoder A DVD player uses these flags to convert progressive content into interlaced video in real time during playback producing a signal suitable for interlaced TV sets These flags also allow reproducing progressive content at their original non interlaced format when used with compatible DVD players and progressive scan television sets br br br Audio data br The audio data on a DVD movie can be Dolby Digital AC DTS PCM or MPEG Audio Layer II MP format In countries using the PAL system standard DVD Video releases must contain at least one audio track using the PCM MP or AC format and all standard PAL players must support all three of these formats A similar standard exists in countries using the NTSC system though with no requirement mandating the use of or support for the MP format DTS audio is optional for all players as DTS was not part of the initial draft standard and was added later thus many early players are unable to play DTS audio tracks Only PCM and DTS support kHz sampling rate Because PCM being uncompressed requires a lot of bandwidth and DTS is not universally supported by players AC is the most common digital audio format for DVDs and kHz is rare on a DVD The official allowed formats for the audio tracks on a DVD Video are br br PCM kHz or kHz sampling rate bit or bit Linear PCM to channels up to kbit s N B bit kHz channel PCM is allowed by the DVD Video specification but is not well supported by authoring applications or players br AC kHz sampling rate to channels up to kbit s br DTS kHz or kHz sampling rate channel layouts bitrates for and and kbit s bitrates for x and and kbit s br MP kHz sampling rate to channels up to kbit s br DVDs can contain more than one channel of audio to go together with the video content supporting a maximum of eight simultaneous audio tracks per video This is most commonly used for different audio formats DTS AC etc as well as for commentary and audio tracks in different languages br br br Data rate br DVD Video discs have a raw bitrate of Mbit s with a Mbit s overhead leaving a payload bitrate of Mbit s Of this up to Mbit s can be used for subtitles a maximum of Mbit s can be split amongst audio and video and a maximum of Mbit s can be used for video alone In the case of multiple angles the data is stored interleaved and so there is a bitrate penalty leading to a max bitrate of Mbit s per angle to compensate for additional seek time This limit is not cumulative so each additional angle can still have up to Mbit s of bitrate available br Professionally encoded videos average a bitrate of Mbit s with a maximum of Mbit s in high action scenes Encoding at less than the max bitrate like this is typically done to allow greater compatibility among players and to help prevent buffer underruns in the case of dirty or scratched discs br In October aiming to improve picture quality over standard editions Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment offered Superbit a premium line of DVD Video titles having average bitrates closer to Mbit s Audio quality was also improved by the mandatory inclusion of both Dolby Digital and DTS surround audio tracks Multiple languages angles and extra audio tracks were eliminated to free up more space for the main title and thereby to ensure the highest data rate possible In January the Superbit line was discontinued br br br Other features br Some DVD hardware or software players may play discs whose MPEG files do not conform to the above standards commonly this is used to support discs authored with formats such as VCD and SVCD While VCD and CVD video is supported by the DVD standard neither SVCD video nor VCD CVD or SVCD audio is compatible with the DVD standard br Some hardware players will also play DVD ROMs or CD ROMs containing raw MPEG video files these are unauthored and lack the file and header structure that defines DVD Video Standard DVD Video files contain extra information such as the number of video tracks chapters and links to extra features that DVD players use to navigate the disc br The maximum chapters allowed per title is and the maximum titles allowed per DVD is br br br File system br Almost all DVD Video discs use the UDF bridge format which is a combination of the DVD MicroUDF a subset of UDF and ISO file systems br The UDF bridge format provides backwards compatibility for operating systems that support only ISO Most DVD players read the UDF filesystem from a DVD Video disc and ignore the ISO filesystem br br br Directory and file structure br A DVD volume for the DVD Video format has the following structure of directories and files br br AUDIO TS directory empty or not present on DVD Video discs contains files only on DVD Audio discs it is also known as an Audio Title Sets directory included on DVD Video discs for compatibility reasons br VIDEO TS directory stores all data for the DVD Video it is also known as a Video Title Sets directory This directory is required to be present on a DVD compliant disc br Video Manager VMG files br VIDEO TS IFO file the Video Manager VMG information file stores control and playback information for the entire DVD e g the First Play PGC Program Chain locations of all Video Title Sets VTS table of titles number of volumes domains for multiple languages and regional and parental control settings information about subtitles audio tracks etc This file is required to be present on a DVD compliant disc br VIDEO TS BUP file the backup copy of the VIDEO TS IFO file It is part of Video Manager br VIDEO TS VOB file the first play Video Object of the DVD Video disc usually a copyright notice or a menu It is part of Video Manager This file is not required to be present on a DVD compliant disc br Video Title Set VTS files br VTS IFO file stores control and playback information for the Video Title Set e g information about chapters subtitles and audio tracks A VTS zz IFO file where zz is from to is required to be present on each VTS br VTS BUP file a backup copy of the VTS IFO file This file is required to be present on a DVD compliant disc It is part of the Video Title Set br VTS VOB file Video Title Set Video Object contains the menu for this title This file is not required to be present on a DVD compliant disc br VTS VOB file Video Title Set Video Object contains the video for this title At least one file VTS zz VOB is required in the Video Title Set and each VTS zz x DVD Video can contain up to titles with a maximum of VOB files each The last possible VOB file is VTS VOB br etc br IFO files store control and playback information e g information about chapters subtitles and audio tracks They do not store any video or audio data or subtitles br BUP files are only backups of the IFO files br br br Domains br Data structures recorded on a DVD compliant disc are components of one of the four data groups called domains br br First play FP First Play PGC located in the VIDEO TS IFO file br Video Manager VMG contains VIDEO TS IFO VIDEO TS BUP and VIDEO TS VOB br Video Title Set VTS contains VTS zz x IFO VTS zz x BUP and VTS zz x VOB files where x is from to br Video Title Set Menu VTSM uses VTS zz VOB files br br br Container br br Video audio subtitle and navigation streams are multiplexed and stored on a DVD Video disc in the VOB container format Video Object VOB is based on the MPEG program stream format but with additional limitations and specifications in the private streams The MPEG program stream has provisions for non standard data as AC DTS LPCM or subtitles used in VOB files in the form of so called private streams VOB files are a very strict subset of the MPEG program stream standard While all VOB files are MPEG program streams not all MPEG program streams comply with the definition for a VOB file br DVD recorders can use DVD VR or DVD VR format instead of DVD Video DVD VR format store multiplexed audiovisual content in VRO containers VRO file is an equivalent to a collection of DVD Video VOB files Fragmented VRO files are not widely supported by hardware or software players and video editing software DVD VR standard defines a logical format for DVD Video compliant recording on optical discs and is commonly used on DVD R RW media br br br Subtitles br DVD Video may also include up to subtitle or subpicture tracks Subtitles are usually offered as a visual aid for deaf and hearing impaired viewers displaying translated dialogue into other languages or displaying karaoke lyrics They are sometimes used to present additional information about the video being played Subtitles are stored as bitmap images and therefore can contain any arbitrary text or simple image They are restricted to a color palette but are usually implemented with a limit of colors levels of transparency are also supported to allow blending but this is also not always implemented The subtitle tracks are contained within the VOB file of the DVD br DVD Video may also contain closed captioning material which can only be viewed on a television set with a decoder br br br Chapters and angles br DVD Video may contain chapters for easy navigation and continuation of a partially watched film If space permits it is also possible to include several versions of certain scenes called angles Today the multi angle feature is mostly used for internationalization For example it can be used to supply different language versions of images containing written text when subtitles would not do e g the Queen s spell book in Snow White and the scrolling text in the openings of the Star Wars films Multiple angles have found a niche in markets such as yoga erotica animation e g for storyboards and live performances br br br Extra features br A significant selling point of DVD Video is that the storage capacity allows for a wide variety of extra or bonus features in addition to the feature film These extra features can include br br audio commentary br documentary features commonly about the making of the main title br interviews br deleted footage br outtakes br photo galleries br storyboards br isolated music scores br trivia text commentary br simple games br film shorts br TV spots br radio spots br theatrical trailers which were used to promote the main title and br teaser trailers advertising related movies or DVDs br Extra features often provide entertainment or add depth and understanding to the film Games bloopers and galleries provide entertainment Deleted scenes and alternative endings allow the audience to view additional content which was not included in a theatrical release Directors cuts allow the audience to see how the director envisioned the main title without the constraints which are placed on a theatrical release br Other extras that can be included on DVDs are motion menus still pictures up to selectable subtitles seamless branching for multiple storylines up to camera angles and DVD ROM data files that can be accessed on a computer br Extra features require additional storage space which often means encoding the main title with lower than possible data rate to fit both the main title and the extras on one disc Lower data rate may decrease visual and sound quality which manifests itself in various compression artifacts To maintain quality the main title and the extras may be released on several discs or the extras may be omitted completely like in the Superbit line of DVDs br br br Restrictions br DVD Video has four complementary systems designed to restrict the DVD user in various ways Macrovision Content Scramble System CSS region codes and disabled user operations UOPs There are also anti ripping techniques intended to foil ripping software br br br Content Scramble System br br Many DVD Video titles use Content Scramble System CSS encryption which is intended to discourage people from copying the disc Usually users need to install software provided on the DVD or downloaded from the Internet such as MPlayer TotalMedia Theatre PowerDVD VLC or WinDVD to be able to view the disc in a computer system br CSS does not make it difficult any more to copy the digital content now that a decoder DeCSS has been released nor is it possible to distinguish between legal and illegal copies of a work but CSS does restrict the playback software that may be used br CSS has caused major problems for the inclusion of DVD players in any open source operating systems since open source player implementations are not officially given access to the decryption keys or license to the patents involved in CSS Proprietary software players were also difficult to find on some platforms However a successful effort has been made to write a decoder by reverse engineering resulting in DeCSS This has led to long running legal battles and the arrest of some of those involved in creating or distributing the DeCSS code through the use of the controversial U S Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA on the grounds that such software could also be used to facilitate unauthorized copying of the data on the discs The Videolan team however went on to make the libdvdcss library Unlike DeCSS libdvdcss can access a CSS encrypted DVD without the need of a cracked key thus enabling playback of such discs on opensource players without legal restraints although DVD rippers using this library may still be subject to restrictions br The DMCA currently affects only the United States however many other countries are signatories to the similar WIPO Treaty In some countries it is not illegal to use de scrambling software to bypass the DVD restrictions A number of software programs have since appeared on the Web to view DVDs on a number of different platforms br Other measures such as anti ripping as well as U S and non U S copyright law may be used to prevent making unauthorized copies of DVDs CSS decrypting software or ripping software such as DVD Decrypter AnyDVD MacTheRipper and DVD Shrink allows a disc to be copied to hard disk unscrambled Some DeCSS applications also remove Macrovision region codes and disabled user operations UOPs br br br Anti ripping br After DeCSS ripping software became available companies developed techniques to introduce errors in DVD Video discs that do not normally affect playback and navigation of a disc but can cause problems in software that attempts to copy the entire disc These approaches which are not part of the official DVD Video specification include Sony ARccOS Protection Macrovision RipGuard X protect ProtectDisc SecureBurn Anaho Fortium and others All of these methods have been circumvented as might have been expected since all standard DVD players naturally circumvent them to play and navigate the discs normally Riplock is a feature that reduces drive noise during playback but inadvertently reduces ripping speed br br br Disabled user operations br br DVD Video allows the disc to specify whether or not the user may perform any operation such as selecting a menu skipping chapters forwarding or rewinding essentially any function on the remote control This is known as User Operation Prohibitions or Prohibited User Operations UOPs or PUOs Most DVD players respect these commands e g by preventing skipping or fast forwarding through a copyright message or an advertisement at the beginning of a disc However grey market players ignore UOPs and some DVD re authoring software packages allow the user to produce a copy without these restrictions The legality of these activities varies by jurisdiction and is the subject of debate See fair use br br br Region codes br br Each DVD Video disc contains one or more region codes denoting the area s of the world in which distribution and playback are intended The commercial DVD player specification dictates that a player must only play discs that contain its region code In theory this allows the motion picture studios to control the various aspects of a release including content date and price on a region by region basis or ensure the success of staggered or delayed cinema releases from country to country For example the British movie Days Later was released on DVD in Europe several months prior to the film s release in North American movie theaters Regional coding kept the European DVD unplayable for most North American consumers thereby ensuring that ticket sales would be relatively unaffected br In practice many DVD players allow playback of any disc or can be modified to do so Entirely independent of encryption region coding pertains to regional lockout which originated in the video game industry br From a worldwide perspective regional coding may be seen as a failure A huge percentage of players outside of North America can be easily modified and are even sold pre modified by e commerce websites to ignore the regional codes on a disc This coupled with the fact that almost all televisions in Europe and Australasia are capable of displaying NTSC video at the very least in black and white means that consumers in these regions have a huge choice of discs Contrary to popular belief this practice is not illegal and in some countries that strongly support free trade it is encouraged br A normal DVD player can only play region coded discs designated for the player s own particular region However a code free or region free DVD player is capable of playing DVDs from any of the six regions around the world br The CSS license prohibits manufacturing of DVD players that are not set to a single region by default While the same license prohibits manufacturers from including prominent interfaces to change the region setting it does not clearly prevent them from including hidden menus that enable the player s region to be changed as such many high end models in the U S include password protected or otherwise hidden methods to enable multi region playback Conversely in the UK and Ireland many cheap DVD players are multi region while more expensive systems including the majority of home cinema systems are preset to play only region discs br In China DVDs for television series are usually released in MPEG video with MP audio By forgoing Dolby standards manufacturers cut costs considerably encoding in lower bit rates also allows a TV series to be squeezed onto fewer discs There is no region coding in such cases br There are also two additional region codes region which is reserved and region which is used exclusively for passenger transport such as airlines and cruise ships br br br Programming interface br A virtual machine implemented by the DVD player runs bytecode contained on the DVD This is used to control playback and display special effects on the menus The instruction set is called the Virtual Machine VM DVD command set There are general parameter registers GPRM to hold temporary values and system parameters SPRM As a result of a moderately flexible programming interface DVD players can be used to play games such as the DVD re release of Dragon s Lair along with more sophisticated and advanced games such as Scene It all of which can be run on standard DVD players br br br Players and recorders br br Modern DVD recorders often support additional disc and file formats including DVD R RW CD R RW MP WMA SVCD JPEG PNG SVG KAR and MPEG DivX Xvid Some also include USB ports or flash memory readers Player prices range from as low as US to as high as US br DVD drives for computers usually come with one of two kinds of Regional Playback Control RPC either RPC or RPC This is used to enforce the publisher s restrictions on what regions of the world the DVD can be played See Regional lockout and DVD region codes While open source software DVD players allow everything commercial ones both standalone models and software players come further encumbered with restrictions forbidding the viewer from skipping or in some cases fast forwarding certain content such as copyright warnings or advertisements See User operation prohibition br When DVD drives first became commercially available in they often came with special encoder decoder cards which were designed to pass through either the integrated video on the computer motherboard or the video card The cards were necessary since most computers did not have sufficient processing power to handle the decoding on the discs As CPU speeds and video card memory drastically increased in the late s in addition to software alternatives such as PowerDVD becoming readily available the decoder cards quickly became obsolete however before the introduction of GPU video encoding technology such as Intel Quick Sync Video a proprietary MPEG MPEG encoder card may be used br Video game systems with DVD Video playback functionality include Panasonic Q a variation of the GameCube sold exclusively in Japan PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation PlayStation Wii with an unsupported hack Xbox additional remote required Xbox Xbox One and Xbox Series X br br br Competitors and successors br In April Sonic Solutions and Ravisent announced hDVD a high definition extension to DVD However hDVD failed to gain much popularity br On November the Chinese news agency Xinhua reported the final standard of the Chinese government sponsored Enhanced Versatile Disc EVD which is another extension of standard DVD Shortly thereafter the development of the format was halted by a licensing dispute between Chinese companies and On Technologies but on December Chinese electronic firms unveiled prototype EVD players and announced their intention for the format to completely replace DVDs in China by However due to a lack of sales support for EVD was dropped by the Xinhua Bookstore in Wuhan which was a major supporter of the format br br br Blu ray Disc and HD DVD br br Two competing high definition HD optical disc formats HD DVD and Blu ray were introduced in The HD DVD format promoted by Toshiba was backed by the DVD Forum which voted to make it the official successor to DVD Opposing HD DVD was the Blu ray format led by the Blu ray Disc Association which shares many members with the DVD forum br With HD DVD launched in March and Blu ray launched in June of the same year a format war started Industry analysts likened the situation to the VHS Betamax format war of the s At the time of their launch consumer awareness of either high definition format was severely limited with the result that most consumers avoided both formats already content with DVD In February Toshiba capitulated citing low demand for HD DVD and the faster growth of Blu ray and the inclusion of the format in the video game system PlayStation PS among other reasons Toshiba ended production of their HD DVD players and discontinued promotion of the format while the HD DVD movie release schedule concluded by June br After HD DVD was discontinued Blu ray became the de facto high definition optical disc format However sales figures suggest that DVD is in no immediate danger of disappearing All standard DVDs will play on existing Blu ray players making the switch to Blu ray much easier than the switch from VHS to DVD Moreover some labels are cutting back on Blu ray Disc releases in favor of DVD Video claiming that low sales do not justify the more expensive Blu ray Disc format In addition a growing number of hardware vendors are enhancing their Blu ray players with Internet connectivity for subscription based video downloads br Ultra HD Blu ray is the latest version available supporting K resolution content br br br CBHD br br China Blue High definition Disc CBHD was introduced in September This format is based on HD DVD While the Blu ray format is marketed internationally CBHDs are exclusively marketed in China br br br See also br
