trio seizes the plane and uses it to fly towards the fictitious Moroccan port of Bagghar However the seaplane crashes in a desert due to low fuel and a thunderstorm br While trekking through the

replaced Thomas Brodie Sangster who dropped out when filming was delayed in October Jackson suggested Bell to take on the role after previously casting him as Jimmy in his King Kong remake br Andy Serkis as Captain Archibald Haddock and Sir Francis Haddock Spielberg suggested Serkis given he played Gollum in Jackson s The Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong in the remake which were both roles requiring motion capture and also because he considers Serkis a great and funny actor Serkis joked he was concerned Jackson wanted him to play Tintin s dog Snowy who was animated traditionally i e without motion capture Serkis remarked upon reading the comics again for the role that they had a surreal Pythonesque quality The actor researched seamen and gave Haddock a Scottish accent as he felt the character had a rawness an emotional availability a more Celtic kind of feel br Daniel Craig as Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine the main antagonist and descendant of Red Rackham and Red Rackham the pirate who attacked the Unicorn the ship captained by Sir Francis Haddock Spielberg described Sakharine as a champagne villain cruel when he has to be but with a certain elegance to him Jackson and Spielberg decided to promote Sakharine from a relatively minor character to the villain and while considering an interesting actor to portray him Spielberg came up with Craig with whom he had worked on Munich Craig joked he followed the English tradition of playing bad guys br Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as Thomson and Thompson respectively bumbling police detectives who are almost identical

being shot by Sakharine s thugs on Tintin s doorstep br Kim Stengel as Bianca Castafiore a comical opera singer While Castafiore was absent from the three stories Jackson said she was added for her status as an iconic character and because she would be a fun element of the plot Ren e Fleming provides the singing voice for Castafiore br Sonje Fortag as Mrs Finch Tintin s landlady br Cary Elwes and Phillip Rhys as French seaplane pilots working for Sakharine Elwes came across Spielberg in the cereal aisle of a grocery store shortly after Spielberg visited Robert Zemeckis on the A Christmas Carol set and persuaded Spielberg to cast him on the film due to being a huge Tintin fan Spielberg appreciated Elwes devotion to the franchise and cast him as one of the pilots because they were the last of the parts to be cast which Elwes gratefully accepted regardless of its size because being part of the film meant so much for him br Nathan Meister as a Market artist who bears a resemblance to Herg br Mark Ivanir as Afgar Outpost Soldier Secretary br Sebastian Roch as Pedro st Mate br Ron Bottitta as a Unicorn Lookout br Sana Etoile as a Press Reporter br br In Herg wrote to Walt Disney hoping to pitch The Adventures of Tintin into a potential animated feature in an effort to introduce the series to American audiences The proposal fell through as Disney was busy working on Cinderella around that time though Herg did receive a Mickey Mouse trophy and a picture showing Tintin and Mickey shaking hands decades later br Steven Spielberg became an avid fan of The Adventures of Tintin in after a review compared Raiders of the Lost Ark to the comics Meanwhile Herg who disliked the previous live action film versions and the Herg s Adventures of Tintin animated series became a fan of Spielberg Michael Farr author of Tintin The Complete Companion recalled Herg thought Spielberg was the only person who could ever do Tintin justice Herg had been looking to use the medium of film to make Tintin more current as he felt that the animated films Tintin and the Temple of the Sun and Tintin and the Lake of Sharks had failed to capture the essence of the books Spielberg and his production partner Kathleen Kennedy of Amblin Entertainment were scheduled to meet with Herg in while filming Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom in London Herg died that week but his widow Fanny Remi decided to give them the rights A three year long option to film the comics was finalized in with Universal Pictures as distributor br Spielberg commissioned E T the Extra Terrestrial writer Melissa Mathison to script a film about Tintin battling ivory hunters in Africa Spielberg saw Tintin as an Indiana Jones for kids and wanted Jack Nicholson to play Haddock Unsatisfied with the script Spielberg continued production on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade the rights returned to the Herg Foundation Claude Berri and Roman Polanski became interested in filming the property while Warner Bros Pictures negotiated for the rights but they could not guarantee the creative integrity that the Foundation found in Spielberg In Spielberg revealed his interest in depicting Tintin with computer animation In November his studio DreamWorks Pictures reestablished the option to film the series Spielberg originally said he would only produce the film In French magazine Capital reported Spielberg was intending a trilogy based on The Secret of the Unicorn Red Rackham s Treasure The Seven Crystal Balls Prisoners of the Sun and The Blue Lotus Tintin in Tibet which are separate stories but both feature Chang Chong Chen By then Spielberg had reverted to his idea of a live action adaptation and called Peter Jackson to ask if Weta Digital would create a computer generated Snowy br br Jackson a longtime fan of the comics had used motion capture in The Lord of the Rings and King Kong he suggested that a live action adaptation would not do justice to the comic books and that motion capture was instead the best way of representing Herg s world of Tintin A week of filming took place in November in Playa Vista Los Angeles California on the stage where James Cameron shot Avatar Andy Serkis had been cast while Jackson stood in for Tintin During the shoot Cameron and Robert Zemeckis who directed and produced motion captured animated films were present The footage was transmitted to Weta Digital who produced a twenty minute test reel that demonstrated a photorealistic depiction of the characters Spielberg said he would not mind filming it digitally because he saw it as an animated film and reiterated his live action work would always be filmed traditionally Lead designer Chris Guise visited Brussels to see the inspiration for Herg s sceneries br An official announcement about the collaboration was made in May although both filmmakers had to wait to film it Spielberg was preparing Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull while Jackson was planning The Lovely Bones Spielberg had considered two books to become the main story The Crab with the Golden Claws and The Secret of the Unicorn with the main plot eventually following the latter and its immediate sequel Red Rackham s Treasure Jackson felt the former s story wasn t really robust enough to sustain a feature film but the filmmakers still included elements from the comic such as the Karaboudjan and the first meeting of Tintin and Haddock Spielberg invited Edgar Wright to write the script for the film but Wright was busy and instead recommended other names including Steven Moffat In October Moffat joined as the screenwriter for two of the Tintin films Moffat said he was love bombed by Spielberg into accepting the offer to write the films with the director promising to shield him from studio interference with his writing Moffat finished a draft but was unable to finish another due to the Writers Guild of America strike He then became executive producer of Doctor Who leading Spielberg and Jackson the latter being a fan of the show to allow him to leave and fulfill his duty to the series Wright then returned and agreed to take over the script while Joe Cornish a fan of Tintin with whom Wright was working at the time also worked with him After two drafts of the script Wright left in order to begin filming Scott Pilgrim vs the World with Cornish staying on to finish the script under the guidance of Spielberg and Jackson br More filming took place in March However in August that year a month before principal photography would have begun Universal Pictures turned down their option to co produce the film due to the poor box office performances of other recent motion captured animated films such as Monster House and Beowulf as well as Spielberg and Jackson s request for a combined of the gross Paramount Pictures DreamWorks distributor had hoped to partner with Universal on the project having spent million on pre production Spielberg gave a ten minute presentation of footage hoping they would approve filming to begin in October Paramount along with their subsidiary Nickelodeon Movies offered to produce as long as the directors found a studio that was willing to co produce the film Spielberg and Jackson agreed and negotiated with Sony s Columbia Pictures to co finance and distribute the first film internationally by the end of October Sony only agreed to finance two films though Jackson said a third film may still happen br br Principal photography began in Los Angeles on January the release date was pushed from to Spielberg finished his film after days of shooting in March Jackson was present for the first week of filming and supervised the rest of the shoot via a bespoke videoconferencing program Simon Pegg said Jackson s voice would be coming over the Tannoy like God During filming various directors including Guillermo del Toro Stephen Daldry and David Fincher visited Spielberg wanted to treat the film like live action moving his camera around He revealed Every movie I made up until Tintin I always kept one eye closed when I ve been framing a shot because he wanted to see the movie in D the way viewers would On Tintin I have both of my eyes open Jackson took the hands on approach to directing Weta Digital during post production which Spielberg supervised through video conferencing Spielberg said there will be no cell phones no TV sets no modern cars Just timeless Europe His frequent collaborator and cinematographer Janusz Kami ski served as lighting consultant for Weta and Jackson said the film would look film noirish very atmospheric Spielberg finished six weeks of additional motion capture filming in mid July Post production was finished in September From the very beginning to the very end the film took a total of seven years in production br To improve the quality of the indoor lighting nuances Weta Digital and NVIDIA developed a piece of ray tracing software called PantaRay which requires to times more computation than traditional shadow map based solutions For the performance of Snowy various models served as a reference for actors on set manipulated by property master Brad Elliott According to animators Snowy was the hardest character to animate and develop due to the type of coat he has as well as being white Later a dog s motion was captured digitally so the animators had inspiration for realistic movements His vocal effects were taken from various breeds of dogs br br John Williams composed the musical score for The Adventures of Tintin It was the first time Williams had composed the score of a film since s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as well as his first score for an animated film Most of the score was written while the animation was still in the early stages with Williams seeking to employ the old Disney technique of doing music first and have the animators trying to follow what the music is doing Eventually several cues had to be revised during the editing of the film The composer decided to employ various musical styles with s s European jazz for the opening credits and pirate music for the battle at sea The score was released on October by Sony Classical Records br br The film mainly draws its story from The Secret of the Unicorn and The Crab with the Golden Claws and to a much lesser degree from Red Rackham s Treasure There are major differences from the source material most notably with regard to the antagonists In the book Ivan Sakharine is a minor character neither a villain nor the descendant of Red Rackham As Sakharine was made the main antagonist in the film the book s main villains the Bird brothers are absent from the adaptation save for a small cameo in the initial sequence at the market As a result of this change many events transpire that bear no relation to events in the books involving Sakharine s character As in other adaptations Snowy s voice is not used br br The film s first press screening was held in Belgium on October The world premi re was held in Brussels Belgium on October attended by Princess Astrid and her younger daughters Princess Luisa Maria and Princess Laetitia Maria with the Paris premi re later

the form of Tintin Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film four stars out of four and said that Spielberg s first venture into animation was his most delightful dose of pure entertainment since Raiders of the Lost Ark Amy Biancolli of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote Such are the timeless joys of the books and now the movie this sparkling absurdity and knack for buckling swash under the worst of circumstances The boy may have the world s strangest cowlick but he sure can roll with the punches Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four calling it an ambitious and lively caper miles smarter than your average D family film He praised the setting of the film stating its similarity to the original Tintin comic strips and was also pleased with the D technology used in the film saying that Spielberg employed it as an enhancement to D instead of an attention grabbing gimmick br Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film three and a half stars out of four and wrote The movie comes at you in a whoosh like a volcano of creative ideas in full eruption Presented as the first part of a trilogy produced by Spielberg and Peter Jackson The Adventures of Tintin hits home for the kid in all of us who wants to bust out and run free Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times said Think of The Adventures of Tintin as a song of innocence and experience able to combine a sweet sense of childlike wonder and pureness of heart with the most worldly and sophisticated of modern technology More than anything it s just a whole lot of fun br Richard Corliss of Time wrote Motion capture which transforms actors into cartoon characters in a vividly animated landscape is the technique Spielberg has been waiting for the Christmas gift that he s dreamed of since his movie childhood Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter was also very positive about the film describing it as a good ol fashioned adventure flick that hearkens back to the filmmaker s action packed tongue in cheek swashbucklers of the s Steven Spielberg s The Adventures of Tintin The Secret of the Unicorn is a visually dazzling adaptation Comparing it with another film Mintzer said Tintin has an altogether more successful mocap experience than earlier efforts like The Polar Express br Belgian newspaper Le Soir s film critics Daniel Couvreur and Nicolas Crousse called the film a great popular adventure movie stating the film s enthusiasm and childhood spirit are unreservedly infectious Le Figaro praised the film considering it to be crammed with action humor and suspense Leslie Felperin of Variety wrote Clearly rejuvenated by his collaboration with producer Peter Jackson and blessed with a smart script and the best craftsmanship money can buy Spielberg has fashioned a whiz bang thrill ride that s largely faithful to the wholesome spirit of his source but still appealing to younger Tintin challenged auds br La Libre Belgique was however a little less enthusiastic its film critic Alain Lorf vre called the film a technical success with a Tintin vivid as it should be and a somewhat excessive Haddock The Guardian s Xan Brooks gave the film two stars out of five stating While the big set pieces are often exuberantly handled the human details are sorely wanting How curious that Herg achieved more expression with his use of ink spot eyes and humble line drawings than a bank of computers and an army of animators were able to achieve Blog Critics writer Ross Miller said Author Herg s wonderfully bold and diverse array of characters are a mixed bag when it comes to how they ve been translated to the big screen and that while the mystery might be perfectly serviceable for film the execution of it at times feels languid and stodgy like it s stumbling along from one eye catching setpiece to the next However he summed it up as an enjoyable watch with some spectacular set pieces lavish visuals and some fine motion capture performances br Tom McCarthy the author of a study of the Tintin books described Hollywood s treatment in this film of its characters and stories as truly execrable stating that it ignores the books key idea of inauthenticity The themes of fakeness and phoniness and counterfeit that drive many of the original plots are replaced in the film with messages that feel as though we have wandered into a seminar on monetisation through self empowerment It s like making a biopic of Nietzsche that depicts him as a born again Christian or of Gandhi as a trigger happy Rambo blasting his way through the Raj br Steve Rose from The Guardian wrote about one of the film s major criticisms that The Adventures of Tintin much like The Polar Express crossed into the uncanny valley thereby rendering Tintin too human and not human at all Manohla Dargis one of the chief critics of The New York Times called the movie a marvel of gee wizardry and a night s entertainment that can feel like a lifetime The simplicity of the comic strip she wrote is a crucial part of the success of Tintin who is an avatar for armchair adventurers Dargis noted that Tintin s appearance in the film resembled Herg s creation yet was eerily different as if like Pinocchio his transformation into human form had been prematurely interrupted Another major fault in the film Dargis opines is how it is overworked she writes that there is hardly a moment of downtime a chance to catch your breath or contemplate the tension between the animated Expressionism and the photo realist flourishes Nevertheless she singles out some of the interludes of cinematic delight approving of the visual imagination employed within the movie s numerous exciting scenes br The film was named in New York magazine s David Edelstein s Top List for It was also included in HitFix s top films of br br The Adventures of Tintin grossed in North America and in other territories for a worldwide total of br In the United States it is one

entitled The Adventures of Tintin The Secret of the Unicorn developed by game developer Ubisoft was released to coincide with the release date of the film Gameloft released a game for mobile devices to coincide with the film s European launch br br Originally the second Tintin film was to be based on Herg s The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun However screenwriter Anthony Horowitz later stated that those books would be the second sequel and another story would become the first sequel br Peter Jackson announced that he would direct the sequel once he had finished The Hobbit trilogy Two years before The Secret of the Unicorn Jackson mentioned that his favorite Tintin stories were The Seven Crystal Balls Prisoners of the Sun The Black Island and The Calculus Affair but he had not yet decided which stories would form the basis of the second film He added it would be great to use Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon for a third or fourth film in the series br By the time The Secret of the Unicorn was released Spielberg said the book that would form the sequel had been chosen and that the Thomson and Thompson detectives would have a much bigger role The sequel would be produced by Spielberg and directed by Jackson Kathleen Kennedy said the script might be completed by February or March and motion captured in summer so that the film would be on track to be released by Christmas or mid br In the months following the release of The Secret of the Unicorn Spielberg revealed that a story outline for the sequel had been completed and that it was based on two books Horowitz tweeted that Professor Calculus would be introduced in the sequel During a press tour in Belgium for The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey Jackson said he intended to shoot performance capture in aiming for a release date in br In March Spielberg said Don t hold me to it but we re hoping the film will come out around Christmas time in We know which books we re making we can t share that now but we re combining two books which were always intended to be combined by Herg He refused to confirm the names of the books but said The Blue Lotus would probably be the third Tintin film In December when Jackson was asked if the Tintin sequel would be his next project after The Hobbit trilogy he said that it would be made at some point soon but he added that he wanted to direct two New Zealand films before that br In June Jamie Bell stated that the sequel was titled Tintin and the Temple of the Sun and that he hoped shooting would begin in early for a possible release by the end of

as executive producer Bell and Serkis were reported to be reprising their roles in both films Spielberg later announced that Jackson was still attached to directing the sequel and that it would enter work once Jackson completed another Amblin Partners DreamWorks production br In March Spielberg reiterated the above saying that Peter Jackson has to do the second part Normally if all goes well he will soon start working on the script As it takes two years of animation work on the film for you I would not expect to see it for about three years But Peter will stick to it Tintin is not dead In interviews later the same year Jackson affirmed his intent to make another Tintin film but said that a script was yet to be written br In an April interview with Forbes Jamie Bell expressed interest in reprising his role saying He Peter Jackson s always doing something so if they said let s get the band back together we d go do it It s going to be weird if I play Tintin at but still the technology allows it so that s fine In April Andy Serkis stated that Jackson was working on the sequel br br The Adventures of Tintin br The Adventures of Tintin TV series br Tintin and Golden Fleece
