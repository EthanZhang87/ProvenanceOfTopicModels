Global Capital has come under extensive criticism from workers at the newspaper and outside the organization The hedge fund has made relentless cost cuts since taking ownership in despite the reported profitability of the Post principally by laying off the newspaper s staff Margaret Sullivan of The Washington Post called Alden Global Capital one of the most ruthless of the corporate strip miners seemingly intent on destroying local journalism Under Digital Media First the number of journalists in the newsroom was reduced by almost two thirds by April to around people This represents a drastic fall from the over journalists which The Denver Post employed before when it was purchased by Alden Media Group At one point before the joint operating agreement between The Denver Post and The Rocky Mountain News boasted a strong staff of journalists before the bankruptcy of the Rocky Mountain News that year br The announcement of more layoffs in March which reduced the paper s newsroom from to around people prompted a denunciation of its owners from the editorial board of The Denver Post The editorial decried Alden Global Capital as vulture capitalists who were strip mining the newspaper it concluded that Denver deserves a newspaper owner who supports its newsroom If Alden isn t willing to do good journalism here it should sell the Post to owners who will The editorial board pointed out that the cuts were hamstringing the ability of the Post to provide quality coverage of the fast growing Denver region and compared the size of its newsroom unfavorably to those of other newspapers in cities of comparable or smaller size to Denver Alden s harvesting strategy is what prompted Greg Moore editor of The Denver Post from to to step down br The open revolt of the Denver Post against its owners garnered support and praise from other newspapers and journalists including Mitchell Landsberg of the Los Angeles Times and Joe Nocera of Bloomberg View br In a documentary News Matters was released that follows the bold attempt by Colorado journalists to save the year old Denver Post while the hedge fund owner Alden Global Capital slowly drains profits from the paper and dismissing journalists br br br Controversies br In February The Denver Post began publishing a section entitled Energy and Environment funded by Coloradans for Responsible Energy Development CRED a pro natural gas group The stories in the section are written by outsiders not by DP reporters A banner across the top of the section reads This Section is Sponsored by CRED Nevertheless critics express concern that the section risks confusing readers about the distinction between advertising and reporting br In January Jon Caldara of the Denver based Independence Institute a weekly columnist for The Denver Post was fired after publishing two conservative articles on sex and gender In a column arguing for greater openness in public affairs excoriating the Colorado legislature for avoiding the legally required referendum on a new state tax by repackaging it as a fee and then prohibiting hospitals from listing the fee on patients bills On the same theme he criticized the state s educational authorities for imposing a speech code forbidding speech considered stigmatizing In case you hadn t noticed he wrote just about everything is stigmatizing to the easily triggered perpetually offended Continuing on his theme of transparency he also complained that the schools were not doing enough to make parents aware of the contents of their sex ed curricula While Caldara believes his insistence on the existence of only two sexes was the last straw for his column he emphasizes the reason for my firing is over a difference in style He was officially fired for failing to use respectful language
