Florida had opened with to employees with its original purpose to produce cartoon shorts and featurettes However by late following several animation duties on Beauty and the Beast Aladdin and The Lion King Disney executives were convinced to allow the Feature Animation Florida studios to produce their first independent film Around that same time Disney Feature Animation developed an interest in Asian themed legends beginning with the optioning of several books by children s book author Robert D San Souci who had a consulting relationship with Disney executive Jay Dyer Also around that time a short straight to video film titled China Doll about an oppressed and miserable Chinese girl who is whisked away by a British Prince Charming to happiness in the West was in development Thomas Schumacher asked San Souci if he had any additional stories in response to which San Souci turned in a manuscript of a book based on the Chinese poem The Song of Fa Mu Lan Ultimately Disney decided to combine the two separate projects br Following the opening of the Feature Animation Florida studios Barry Cook who had served as a special effects animator since had directed the Roger Rabbit cartoon Trail Mix Up produced at the satellite studio At a lunch invitation with Thomas Schumacher Cook was offered two projects in development a Scottish folk tale with a dragon or Mulan Knowledgeable about the existence of dragons in Chinese mythology Cook suggested adding a dragon to Mulan in which a week later Schumacher urged Cook to drop the Scottish project and accept Mulan as his next project Following this Cook was immediately assigned as the initial director of the project and cited influences from Charlie Chaplin and David Lean during production While working as an animator on the gargoyles for The Hunchback of Notre Dame Tony Bancroft was offered to co direct the film following a recommendation from Rob Minkoff co director of The Lion King to Schumacher in which he accepted He joined the creative team by early br br In the production team sent a select group of artistic supervisors to China for three weeks to take photographs and drawings of local landmarks for inspiration and to soak up local culture Key members of the creative team at the time Pam Coats Barry Cook Ric Sluiter Robert Walker and Mark Henn were invited to travel to China as a research trip to study the landscape people and history of the original legend From June to July the research trip flew to Beijing China which is where Coats became inspired by the placement of flags on the Great Wall They also toured Datong Luoyang Xi an Jiayuguan Dunhuang and Guilin br br br Writing br In its earliest stages the story was originally conceived as a Tootsie inspired romantic comedy film where Mulan who was a misfit tomboy who loves her father is betrothed to Shang whom she has not met On her betrothal day her father Fa Zhou carves her destiny on a stone tablet in the family temple which she shatters in anger running away to forge her own destiny In November Chris Sanders who had just finished storyboard work on The Lion King was hoping to work on The Hunchback of Notre Dame until Schumacher appointed him to work on Mulan instead Acting as Head of Story Sanders grew frustrated with the romantic comedy aspect of the story and urged producer Pam Coats to be more faithful to the original legend by having Mulan leave home because of the love for her father This convinced the filmmakers to decide to change Mulan s character in order to make her more appealing and selfless br Sequence Six in which Mulan takes her father s conscription order cuts her long hair and dons her father s armor served as a pivotal moment in the evolution of Mulan s character Director Barry Cook explained that the sequence initially started as a song storyboarded by Barry Johnson and redrawn by character designer Chen Yi Chang Following the story changes to have Mulan leave to save her father the song was dropped Storyboard artist and co head of story Dean DeBlois was tasked to revise the sequence and decided to board the sequence with minimal dialogue Assisted with an existing musical selection from another film score courtesy of Sanders the sequence reel was screened for Peter Schneider and Thomas Schumacher both of whom were impressed DeBlois stated Sequence Six was the first sequence that got put into production and it helped to establish our silent approach Additionally General Li was not originally going to be related to Shang at all but by changing the story the filmmakers were able to mirror the stories of both Shang s and Mulan s love for their fathers As a Christian Bancroft declined to explore Buddhism within the film br Because there was no dragon in the original legend Mulan did not have animal companions it was Roy E Disney who suggested the character of Mushu Veteran story artist Joe Grant created the cricket character Cri Kee though animator Barry Temple admitted the directors didn t want him in the movie the story department didn t want him in the movie The only people who truly wanted him in the movie were Michael Eisner and Joe Grant and myself because I was assigned the character I would sit in meetings and they d say Well where s the cricket during all this Somebody else would say Oh to hell with the cricket They felt Cri Kee was a character who wasn t necessary to tell the story which is true Throughout development on the film Grant would slip sketches of Cri Kee under the directors door br br br Casting br Before production began the production team sought out Chinese Japanese Filipino or Korean vocal talents Tia Carrere was an early candidate to voice the title character However Lea Salonga who had been the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Aladdin was initially cast to provide both Mulan s speaking and singing voices but the directors did not find her attempt at a deeper speaking voice when Mulan impersonated Ping convincing so Ming Na Wen was brought in to speak the role Salonga returned to provide the singing voice Wen herself landed the role after the filmmakers listened to her narration at the beginning of The Joy Luck Club Coats reflected on her decision stating When we heard Ming Na doing that voice over we knew we had our Mulan She has a very likable and lovely voice and those are the qualities we were looking for br For the role of Mushu Disney was aiming for top Hollywood talent in the vein of Robin Williams performance as the Genie in Aladdin The filmmakers initially approached Joe Pesci and Richard Dreyfuss until Michael Eisner considered Eddie Murphy After accepting the role Murphy initially balked when he was asked to record at the Disney studios but then asked to record the voice in his basement at his Bubble Hill mansion in Englewood New Jersey br For the speaking voice of Captain Li Shang BD Wong was hired although his singing voice for the song I ll Make a Man Out of You was performed by Donny Osmond who had previously auditioned to be the speaking voice of the title character in Hercules Osmond s casting originated from a suggestion from the casting director and throughout recording Osmond studied Wong s dialogue tapes and aimed to match his inflections and personality Osmond commented that his sons decided that he had finally made it in show business when he was in a Disney film Likewise for the role of Grandmother Fa June Foray provided the speaking voice and Marni Nixon supplied the singing voice br Mimi Chan was chosen by Mark Henn as the model and martial arts video reference for Mulan Character drawing sessions and live action video reference shooting was done over the course of three years Chan s cousin George Kee was chosen to play the part of Captain Shang Li Together they choreographed fight sequences for the film s song I ll Make a Man Out of You and the film s end finale br br br Animation and design br br To achieve a harmonious visual look producer designer Hans Bacher and art director Ric Sluiter along with Robert Walker and Head of Backgrounds Robert Stanton collaborated to establish a proper chronological location for the film in Chinese history Since there was no general consensus on the time of Mulan s existence they based the visual design on the Ming and Qing dynasties An important element of Bacher s design was to turn the art style closer to Chinese painting with watercolor and simpler design as opposed to the details of The Lion King and The Hunchback of Notre Dame Bacher further studied more than thirty five film directors ranging from the silent era German Expressionism British and American epics of the s and s and the Spaghetti Westerns for inspiration for composition lighting and staging that would establish settings that enhanced the characters Additional inspiration was found in the earlier Disney animated films such as Bambi Pinocchio and Dumbo to establish a sense of staging br In October the Walt Disney Company announced a major expansion of its Florida animation operations constructing a square foot four story animation building and the addition of animators to the workforce br To create Hun soldiers during the Huns attack sequence the production team developed crowd simulation software called Attila This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously A variant of the program called Dynasty was used in the final battle sequence to create a crowd of in the Forbidden City Pixar s photorealistic open API RenderMan was used to render the crowd Another software developed for this movie was Faux Plane which was used to add depth to flat two dimensional painting Although developed late in production progress Faux Plane was used in five shots including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City During the scene in which the citizens of China are bowing to Mulan the crowd is a panoramic film of real people bowing It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene br br br Music br br The songs featured in the film were written by composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel Stephen Schwartz was originally commissioned to write the songs for the film Following the research trip to China in June Schwartz was contacted by former Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg to compose songs for The Prince of Egypt which he agreed Peter Schneider then president of Walt Disney Feature Animation threatened to have Schwartz s name removed from any publicity materials for Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame Michael Eisner phoned Schwartz and urged him to back out of his commitment to DreamWorks but he refused and left the project After Schwartz s departure his three songs Written in Stone Destiny and China Doll were dropped amid story and character changes by Shortly after Disney music executive Chris Montan heard Matthew Wilder s demo for a stage musical adaptation of Anne Rice s Cry to Heaven and selected Wilder to replace Schwartz In July David Zippel joined to write the lyrics The film featured five songs composed by Wilder and Zippel with a sixth originally planned for Mushu but dropped following Eddie Murphy s involvement with the character br Although Danny Elfman and Thomas Newman were considered to score the film English composer Rachel Portman was selected as the film composer However Portman became pregnant during production and decided to back out Following Portman s departure Randy Edelman whose Dragonheart theme was used in the trailer and Kitar were considered until Jerry Goldsmith became available and signed on after dropping out of a project The film s soundtrack is credited for starting the career of pop singer Christina Aguilera whose first song to be released in the U S was her rendition of Reflection the first single from the Mulan soundtrack The song and Aguilera s vocals were so well received that it landed her a recording contract with RCA Records In she would go on to release her self titled debut album on which Reflection was also included The pop version of Reflection has a Polish version Lustro performed by Edyta G rniak and two Spanish versions for Spain performed by Mal and Hispanic America performed by Lucero Other international versions include a Brazilian Portuguese version by Sandy Junior Imagem a Korean version performed by Lena Park and a Mandarin version by Coco Lee br The music featured during the haircut scene titled Mulan s Decision is different in the soundtrack album The soundtrack album uses an orchestrated score while the movie uses heavy synthesizer music The synthesizer version is available on the limited edition CD Salonga who often sings movie music in her concerts has done a Disney medley which climaxes with an expanded version of Reflection not the same as those in Aguilera s version Salonga also provided the singing voice for Mulan in the film s sequel Mulan II br br br Release br br br Marketing br The film s teaser trailer was released in November attached to the theatrical releases of The Little Mermaid and Flubber Teaser spots were shown during CBS s coverage of the Winter Olympics br Because of the disappointing box office performances of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules Disney restricted its marketing campaign for Mulan spending million on promotional advertisements compared to more than million for Hercules the year before Rather than holding a lavish media event premiere like those of the past few years such as premiering Pocahontas in Central Park and bringing the Main Street Electrical Parade to Fifth Avenue for Hercules Disney opted to premiere the film on June at the Hollywood Bowl

goes about halfway toward setting new boundaries for Disney s and the industry s animated features but doesn t go far enough Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film a B writing Vividly animated with a bursting palette that evokes both the wintry grandeur and decorative splendor of ancient China Mulan is artful and satisfying in a slightly remote way br Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune described the film as a big disappointment when compared with the studio s other recent films about a female hero searching for independence He was further critical of Mulan s characterization in comparison to Ariel and Belle and claimed the design of the film does not take advantage of the inspiration provided by classic Chinese artists and the songs are not memorable Similarly Janet Maslin of The New York Times criticized the lack of detail in the background art and described it as the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney animated films Reviewing the film for the Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan wrote Mulan has its accomplishments but unlike the best of Disney s output it comes off as more manufactured than magical While he praised the title character he highlighted that the by now standard hip patter prepare for jokes about cross dressing is so tepid that not even five credited writers can revive it and the songs by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel with Lea Salonga and Donny Osmond singing for the leads lack the spark that Zippel s lyrics brought to the underappreciated Hercules Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine criticized the film as soulless in its portrayal of East Asian society br This movie was also the subject of comment from feminist critics Mimi Nguyen says the film pokes fun at the ultimately repressive gender roles that seek to make Mulan a

br Accolades br br In the film was one of nominees listed on the ballot for the American Film Institute s top greatest American animated movies br br br Reception in China br Disney was keen to promote Mulan to the Chinese hoping to replicate their success with the film The Lion King which was one of the country s highest grossing Western films at that time Disney also hoped it might smooth over relations with the Chinese government which had soured after the release of Kundun a Disney funded biography of the Dalai Lama that the Chinese government considered politically provocative China had threatened to curtail business negotiations with Disney over that film and as the government only accepted ten foreign films to be shown in China each year Mulan s chances of being accepted were low Finally after a year s delay the Chinese government did allow the film a limited Chinese release but only after the Chinese New Year so as to ensure that local films dominated the more lucrative holiday market Box office income was low due to both the unfavorable release date and rampant piracy Chinese people also complained about Mulan s depiction as too foreign looking and the story as too
