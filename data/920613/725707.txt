The Plymouth Barracuda is a two door pony car that was manufactured by Chrysler Corporation from through model years br The first generation Barracuda was based on the Chrysler A body and was offered from until A two door hardtop no B pillar fastback design it shared a great majority of parts and bodywork with the Plymouth Valiant except for the distinctive wraparound rear glass br The second generation Barracuda though still Valiant based was heavily redesigned Built from through it was available as a two door in fastback notchback and convertible versions br The third generation offered from until was based on the Chrysler E body exclusive to it and the slightly larger Dodge Challenger A completely new design the two door Barracuda was available in hardtop and convertible body styles br br br First generation br br br br During the development of the Barracuda one of the worst kept secrets was Ford s plan to introduce a new sporty compact car based on the inexpensive Falcon chassis and running gear which was eventually released as the Mustang in mid model year the extent of the other changes was not known Chrysler stylist Irv Ritchie sketched a fastback version of the compact Valiant Budgets were limited due to research and development of the Chrysler Turbine Car but the company s executives wanted to have an entry in this emerging and potentially lucrative sporty compact car market segment beginning by siphoning off some of the Chevrolet s Corvair Monza s sales Plymouth s executives had wanted to name the new model Panda an idea unpopular with its designers In the end John Samsen s suggestion of Barracuda prevailed br Based on Chrysler s A body the Barracuda debuted in fastback form on April The new model used the Valiant s in mm wheelbase and the Valiant hood headlamp bezels windshield vent windows quarter panels doors A pillar and bumpers the trunk and some of the glass was new Using the same hybrid design approach as Ford did turning its Falcon into the Mustang significantly reduced Plymouth s development and tooling cost and time for the new model The greatest effort was put into creating its distinguishing sq ft m rear window a collaboration between Pittsburgh Plate Glass PPG and Chrysler designers that created the largest ever installed on a standard production car to that time br Powertrains were identical to the Valiant s including two versions of Chrysler s slant six cylinder engine The standard equipment engine had a displacement of cu in L and an output of bhp kW the cu in L option raised the power output to bhp kW br The highest power option for was Chrysler s all new cu in L LA V A compact and relatively light engine equipped with a two barrel carburetor it produced bhp kW The Barracuda sold for a base price of US today br The model year was the first for the Barracuda and also the last year for push button control of the optional Torqueflite automatic transmission This year also marked the first use of the smaller TorqueFlite A transmission behind a V br In the marketplace the Barracuda was obviously a fastback version of the Valiant that had a frugal family transportation image The sales brochure for the first Barracudas pitched it as a car for people of all ages and interests The more sporty Mustang was marketed with abundant advertising to young professionals and with its youthful image proved widely successful following its mid introduction This became known as the pony car niche of modestly appointed compact sized sedans and convertibles which came with standard cylinder engines and basic interiors but could be outfitted with powerful V s and custom appointments and luxury features The success of the Mustang has long obscured the fact that the Barracuda actually predated Ford s introduction by two weeks The abbreviated sales season for the Barracuda totaled units compared to the Mustangs sold during the same time br br br br br In the slant became the base engine for the U S market though the cu in L remained the base engine in Canada br New options were introduced for the Barracuda as the competition among pony cars intensified The engine was made available as an upgraded Commando version with a four barrel carburetor compression and a more aggressive camshaft still with solid tappets These and other upgrades increased the engine s output to bhp kW br A new Formula S package included the Commando V engine suspension upgrades larger wheels and tires special emblems and a tachometer Disc brakes and factory installed air conditioning became available after the start of the model year br br br br br For the model year the Barracuda received new taillamps new front sheet metal and a new instrument panel The latter had room for oil pressure and tachometer gauges on models so equipped The front sheet metal which except for the grille was shared with the Valiant gave a more rectilinear contour to the fenders Deluxe models featured fender top turn signal indicators with a stylized fin motif The bumpers were larger and the grille featured a strong grid theme A center console was optional for the first time br Although the first Barracudas were heavily based on the contemporary Valiants Plymouth wanted them perceived as distinct models Consequently the Valiant chrome script that appeared on the model s trunk lid was phased out at the end of the model year in the U S market and the large stylized V trim above the deck lid was changed to a unique Barracuda fish logo for though in markets such as Canada and South Africa where Valiant was a marque in its own right the car remained badged as Valiant Barracuda until the A body Barracuda was discontinued br br br Second generation br br br br br The second generation Barracuda was redesigned with model specific sheet metal yet still shared many components with the Valiant It rode on a in mm wheelbase A body and was available as a convertible and a notchback coupe in addition to the fastback design br The new Barracuda was chiefly the work of John E Herlitz and John Samsen with Coke bottle side contours and heavily revised front and rear ends Design changes included wider wheel openings curved side glass and S curved roof pillars on the hardtop br The roofline on the fastback coupe was more streamlined more steeply raked and with a much smaller flush rear window in place of the distinctive massive wraparound in the original model Also the overall use of chrome trim was more restrained br During this time the first U S Federal auto safety standards were phased in and Chrysler s response a requirement for side marker lights distinguishes each model year of the second generation Barracuda br br no sidemarker lamps or reflectors and backup lights on the rear valance by the license plate br round side marker lamps without reflectors mostly white tail lamps with backup lights in the tail lamp housing br little changes on the front grille rectangular side marker reflectors without lamps and the backup lamps were moved back to the rear valance by the license plate br As the pony car class became established and competition increased Plymouth began to revise the Barracuda s engine options br br In while the cu in L slant was still the base engine the V options ranged from the two and four barrel versions of the cu in L to a seldom ordered cu in L B big block rated at bhp kW the latter available only with the Formula S package br br br br In the was replaced by the cu in L LA engine as the smallest V available and the new cu in L LA four barrel was released The Super Commando engine was upgraded with the intake manifold camshaft and cylinder heads from the Road Runner and Super Bee but the more restrictive exhaust manifolds specific to the A body cars limited its output to bhp kW br Also in Chrysler made approximately fifty fastback Barracudas equipped with the cu in L Hemi for Super Stock drag racing These cars were assembled by Hurst Performance and featured items such as lightweight Chemcor side glass fiberglass front fenders hood scoop lightweight seats sound deadener and other street features such as rear seats omitted An included sticker indicated that the car was not for use on public roads it could run the quarter mile in the mid tens in br For the South African export market a bhp kW high performance version of the slant called Charger Power was offered with compression two barrel carburetor more aggressive camshaft and low restriction exhaust system A handful of Savage GTs were also built from the second generation Barracuda br br br br In Plymouth placed an increased emphasis on performance A new option was the Mod Top a vinyl roof covering with a floral motif available in and Plymouth sold it as a package with seat and door panel inserts done in the same pattern br The version of the engine was upgraded to increase power output to bhp kW and a new trim package called Cuda was released The Cuda based on the Formula S option was available with either the and new for the Super Commando V br br br Third generation br br br br br The redesign for the Barracuda removed all its previous commonality with the Valiant The original fastback design was deleted from the line and the Barracuda now consisted of coupe and convertible models The all new model styled by John E Herlitz was built on a shorter wider version of Chrysler s existing B platform called the E body Though sharing its platform with the newly launched Dodge Challenger no exterior sheet metal interchanged between the sibling cars The Challenger at inches m had a wheelbase that was inches cm longer and a body inches cm longer than the Barracuda s br The E body Barracuda was now able to shake the stigma of economy car Three versions were offered for and the base Barracuda BH the luxury oriented Gran Coupe BP and the sport model Cuda BS br Beginning mid year and ending with the model there also was the Barracuda Coupe A a low end model with the cu in L Slant Six as a base engine lower grade interior and like other Coupe series Chrysler offered that year had fixed quarter glass instead of roll down rear passenger windows The high performance models were marketed as Cuda deriving from the option The E body s engine bay was larger than that of the previous A body facilitating the release of Chrysler s cu in L Hemi for the regular retail market br br For and the Barracuda and Barracuda Gran Coupe had two slant I engines available a new cu in L version and the previous as well as four different V s the CID the cu in L the with a two barrel carburetor and single exhaust and the with a four barrel carburetor and dual exhaust hp kW SAE gross br The Cuda had the hp kW SAE gross same as Dodge s Magnum as the standard engine Options included the cu in L hp kW AAR Six Barrel with triple barrel carburetors a cu in L four barrel hp kW Super Commando the Six Barrel with triple barrel carburetors with a gross rating of hp kW and the hp kW cu in L Hemi The and Hemi equipped cars received upgraded suspension components and structural reinforcements to help transfer the power to the road br br Other Barracuda options included decal sets hood modifications and some unusual high impact colors such as Lime Light Bahama Yellow Tor Red Lemon Twist Curious Yellow Vitamin C In Violet Sassy Grass and Moulin Rouge br Swede Savage and Dan Gurney raced identical factory sponsored AAR All American Racers Cudas in the Trans Am Series The cars qualified for three pole positions but did not win any Trans Am races the highest finish was second at Road America Four Hemi Cudas were also successfully raced by Chrysler France from until The works team director Henr Chemin piloted the first car and then sold it on to friend and privateer J F Mas who went on to race it for another two years This Hemi Cuda won four French Group class championships three on track and one in hill climbing br The Barracuda was changed slightly for with a new grille and taillights seat and trim differences This would be the only year that the Barracuda would have four headlights which the Challenger had for all five years of their concurrent run and also the only year of the fender gills on the Cuda model Only Cuda models received a hockey stick stripe with an engine call out within it where as Cudas were the only year that had the full side Billboard decal with the engine call out inside of the billboard decal br The Barracuda engine options would remain the same as that of the model except that the Bbl was gone and the four barrel carbureted V engine was no longer on the options list but could be had via special order and perhaps a dozen cars were built with it installed otherwise the powered Barracudas had a six barrel carburetor setup instead br In the big block power options offered to the customer were br br hp kW SAE Gross in the V br hp kW SAE Gross in the V br hp kW SAE Gross in the

barrel six barrel and Hemi engines The elastomeric rubber colored bumpers were available either as a front only option option code A or as a front and rear combination option code A The heavy duty and heavy Dana with a in mm ring gear was standard equipment with manual transmissions and six barrel and Hemi engines and was optional on those with the automatic transmission Barracudas with floor shifted transmissions received a new column key release where as models had a backdrive linkage for key removal br br br br br With a new grille and single headlights very similar to the model and four circular taillights for the Barracuda would remain basically unchanged through with new bodyside stripes and minor changes to the bumpers to conform with federal impact standards being the only significant variations In the shape of the pedals was changed from a trapezoid shape with a fine horizontal pattern that was original to the shape of the where as and later had larger rectangle shaped clutch and brake pedals with thicker horizontal grooves that would remain similar to most all Chrysler products through the s There was also a corresponding gas pedal that matched the aforemtioned brake and clutch style variations With this change of pedal shape the brake and clutch supporting members were forged differently and the pads were not interchangeable was also the last year for the basket weave pattern in the seats where as the next two years seats had a different cost saving coachman grain pattern vinyl with different bucket seat backs Big block engines Hemi heavy duty suspensions Dana rear axle large wide tires mounted on in in mm mm wheels were no longer offered Additionally the convertible model was dropped though a few late build convertibles were built with grills and back end panels and provided to Paramount Studios for TV and movie work being seen on Mannix The Brady Bunch and other shows Convenience and comfort items such as power seats power windows and upgraded interior leather seats and plush carpeting options were dropped though heavy duty air conditioning and a sunroof could still be ordered For only three engine choices were offered a six the base engine for both Cuda and Barracuda and a revised detuned to meet emission standards In addition all three were tuned to run on low no lead gas and were power rated on the NET installed method Three transmissions were offered a speed manual the Torqueflite automatic and the Hurst shifter equipped four speed For federally mandated safety bumpers were added front and rear and the six was dropped with the and V s being the only engine choices For late production cars and for a slightly more powerful V E bodyhp replaced the Since optional was a four speed manual transmission equipped with a Hurst shifter mated to a performance ratio to rear axle for the and engines though as many as three cars in both and were built with the engine and Hurst speed thru special orders or factory errors br As with other American vehicles of the time there was a progressive decrease in the Barracuda s performance To meet increasingly stringent safety and exhaust emission regulations big block engine options were discontinued The remaining engines were detuned year by year to reduce exhaust emissions which also reduced their power output There was also an increase in weight as bumpers became larger and starting in E body doors were equipped with heavy steel side impact protection beams Higher fuel prices following the oil crisis and performance car insurance surcharges deterred many buyers as the interest in high performance cars waned Sales of pony cars were on the decline Sales had dropped dramatically after and while showed a sales uptick Barracuda production ended April

in to accommodate regular gasoline was the last year for the Hemi br Chrysler had plans to continue the Dodge Challenger T A for even publishing advertisements for a Dodge Challenger T A However no Dodge Challenger T A was made Similarly no Plymouth AAR Cuda was made br br br Discontinuation br The Barracuda was discontinued after a victim of the energy crisis br A Barracuda had been planned before the end of the model cycle Plymouth engineers sculpted two separate concepts out of clay both featuring a Superbird inspired aerodynamic body and eventually reached a consensus upon which an operational concept car could be built Due to a rapidly changing automotive market due to the energy crisis the concepts were scrapped and the Barracuda was not put into production for br br br Revival attempts br In Motor Trend magazine reported a rumor that Chrysler was considering reviving the Barracuda in A new Barracuda would ve been badged as a Chrysler due to the Plymouth brand having been phased out in However the Barracuda has not been reintroduced alongside the third generation Dodge Challenger Rumors of the Barracuda making a comeback were brought up again by Motor Trend in when reports leaked that the Barracuda would come back in under the SRT Marque replacing the Challenger instead of being built alongside it It was also stated the car would not be of a retro design Ultimately the SRT division was re consolidated under the Dodge banner and the Challenger remained in production without a Barracuda replacement br After years of silence an all new Barracuda now under the Dodge brand was shown to FCA dealers along with other future vehicles on August Based on stretched underpinnings of the rear drive Alfa Romeo Giulia it was rumored to be powered by a turbocharged V and arrive within the model year As of a new Barracuda model has not materialized br br br Collectibility br The Barracuda particularly the E Body cars is a collectible car today with high performance versions and convertibles commanding the highest prices The small number of Barracudas remaining in existence is the result of low buyer interest and low production sales when the vehicles were new The remaining cars of any condition are rare and the outstanding examples fetch high appraisal values today Original Hemi super stock Barracudas and similarly configured Dodge Darts are now prized collector vehicles with factory unaltered cars commanding high prices br The Hemi Cuda convertible is now considered one of the most valuable collectible muscle cars Only thirteen were built seven of which were sold domestically The most recent public sale was at the June Mecum auction in Seattle where a blue on blue speed sold for US million plus buyers premium Several replica cars were created to look like Hemi Cudas and driven by the title character in the late s police procedural Nash Bridges None of these replica cars had a Hemi V under the hood br br br br br br External
