The Chrysler Town Country is an automobile which was manufactured by Chrysler from to and from to with production interrupted during World War II Primarily produced as a luxury station wagon the Town Country was also available in woodie four door sedan two door hardtop and convertible body styles from to to and from to The model year was the last for the station wagon until the model year when Chrysler reintroduced the Town Country nameplate as the rebadged variant Chrysler Town Country minivan br Chrysler s Town Country wagon was reintroduced with all steel construction in in both Windsor and New Yorker variants through the end of Windsor model production for the model year and then in Newport and New Yorker models through In it became a stand alone model with trim and features which bridged the gap between the two sedan lines It was distinguished by luxury features including a carpeted rear cargo area with split folding second row bench seats trimmed with chrome covered strips of steel and from forward simulated woodgrain paneling on the body sides and tailgate a feature also associated with somewhat competitive top shelf station wagons such as the AMC Ambassador Buick Estate Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser Ford Country Squire and the Mercury Colony Park and in AMC introduced the Jeep Grand Wagoneer with similar passenger accommodation and a simulated woodgrain appearance built on a dedicated chassis The Town and Country however stood in a luxury class by itself until the last of the full sized versions of From it was sized down and absorbed into the LeBaron series with a lesser version lacking the more luxurious features and the woodgrain bodyside decals available for a few years in the early s br Chrysler reintroduced the Town Country nameplate in as a luxury rebadged variant of the Dodge Grand Caravan Plymouth Grand Voyager minivan for the model year and continued to sell this incarnation of the Chrysler Town Country until the end of the model year when Chrysler reintroduced the Pacifica nameplate for their minivan in for the model year br A simulated woodgrain appearance reappeared on other Chrysler products such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ and the Chrysler PT Cruiser br br br br br br br During the model year the Chrysler Town Country four door eight passenger station wagon made its debut as Chrysler s entry to offer wooden doors and body panels or woodie with an all steel roof Using wood in vehicle production was not a new approach as most cars built from the s through s regularly used wood for body support flooring or structural uses It used the roof of the concurrent Chrysler Imperial door passenger limousine which led to a rear loading configuration with wooden double doors also called Barrel Back doors that opened out from the center beneath the fixed backlight rear window The wooden body framing was made from white ash and the panels were Honduran mahogany veneer and the use of wood carried over to the interior trunk lid and the interior door panels as well not just an exterior appearance The wood panels were provided by Perkins Wood Products and the Chrysler owners manual suggested that the wood panels be varnished every six months br The nameplate Town Country was coined due to another nameplate Chrysler offered for another six passenger sedan sold called the Town Sedan on the Windsor Saratoga and New Yorker product lines from to br It was introduced with the straight six engine as an alternative to the Buick Estate Oldsmobile Series and Packard One Ten woodie station wagons and was installed in the Series C Chrysler Windsor offering six or nine passenger accommodation with a six cylinder engine or the Series C Chrysler Saratoga with the straight eight engine and nine passenger accommodation of which only one was specially requested for and was offered as a response to the eight cylinder Buick Super and the Packard One Twenty woodie station wagons Prices listed for the six cylinder Series C Windsor wagon were US in dollars Production totals record that vehicles that were installed with the six cylinder engine documented six passenger wagons were made and nine passenger wagons found buyers br br br The model year Town Country had an abbreviated production run due to the U S entry into World War II Less than one thousand units had been produced since the vehicle s introduction a year earlier The wagon that was installed with the straight eight was moved to the New Yorker model line from the previous Saratoga with only one New Yorker Town Country wagon specially manufactured while the straight six remained with the Windsor product line and total wagons made in six and nine passenger configurations br br br br br br After World War II the Town Country nameplate returned though the door passenger station wagon did not Only the Town Country door sedan and the Town Country door convertible were offered however the Town Country sales brochure also described and illustrated a roadster a door sedan called the Brougham and a door hardtop called the Custom Club Coupe None of those three additional body styles progressed beyond the prototype stage with one Brougham and seven Custom Club Coupes built it would be another three model years before General Motors would offer the first mass produced door hardtops while the Town Country range would not see a production door hardtop until one model year after that The wooden body framing was made from white ash and the panels were mahogany veneer but were now bonded to steel body panels The average retail price was listed at US in dollars and production totals were documented at br br br During the model year the Town Country door sedan and the door convertible each carried over with just a few improvements over the previous model year br br br During the model year while the Town Country door sedan was in its last model year of production ever after only a three model year production run since the model year the Town Country door convertible carried over with just very few improvements over the previous model year This was also the year the genuine Honduran mahogany wood panels were replaced by DI NOC vinyl panels A similar appearance sedan was also introduced in called the Packard Station Sedan which appeared like a sedan but had a two piece tailgate constructed entirely of wood br br br The Town Country door convertible which carried over with so very few improvements over the previous model year was in its last model year of production which was the only Chrysler Town Country offering during the model year after a four model year production run since the model year during the next model year Chrysler would produce the last true woodie offering ever as the Town Country Newport door hardtop The cars for were first Chrysler s new postwar designs with a longer wheelbase in based upon the New Yorker model br br br The Town Country door hardtop was Chrysler s last true woodie offering during its one model year production run while the panels were now simulated This was also the year a new optional feature was available windshield washers which are now a standard feature on all cars worldwide br br The Crosley Hot Shot is often given credit for the first production disc brakes but the Chrysler Imperial Crown actually had them first as standard equipment at the start of the model year The Chrysler wheel disc brake system was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company Ausco of St Joseph Michigan under patents of inventor H L Lambert and was first tested on a Plymouth Unlike the caliper disc the Ausco Lambert utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast iron brake drum which doubled as the brake housing br The Ausco Lambert disc brake was complex and because of the expense the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Imperial Crown through and the Town and Country Newport in They were optional however on other Chryslers priced around in dollars at a time when an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for in dollars br br br br br After the woodie coupes sedans and convertibles were discontinued the Town Country nameplate was used on an all steel bodied full size rear wheel drive station wagon coinciding with the debut of the company s first V engine which was originally called FireDome but later unofficially called HEMI This wagon introduced several firsts including roll down rear windows for tailgates for and rear facing third row seats for and shared the chassis engine transmission and interior luxury features including a simulated leather and broadcloth upholstery with the Chrysler Imperial The previous generations use of wood panneling bonded to the exterior steel body panels was discontinued due to durability and appearance upkeep issues while it was still available on the DeSoto Firedome and Dodge Coronet Production totals for the Windsor Town Country were Saratoga Town Country and New Yorker Town Country with the New Yorker station wagon listed at US in dollars The Town Country was luxurious and expensive and sold in limited numbers averaging each year for both the Windsor and New Yorker versions while the Windsor Deluxe sedan typically sold and the New Yorker Deluxe sedan each year averaging US in dollars for the Windsor sedan and US in dollars for the New Yorker sedan br The Town Country wagons were offered in the Windsor Saratoga and New Yorker series and featured standard equipment split folding second row seats with a hardwood covered cargo area with chrome covered steel load strips to aid in loading cargo an appearance that remained for several decades For Chrysler introduced the speed PowerFlite automatic which was a dashboard installed Finger Tip lever replacing the steering column installed gear selector then in the speed TorqueFlite automatic with mechanically operated pushbuttons to the left of the steering wheel was standard equipment until The New Yorker version was discontinued for but reappeared for when the Saratoga series was dropped br For power windows a heater and windshield defroster windshield washer jets power steering and power assist brakes were first installed on all Chryslers as optional equipment and there were different exterior color combinations to choose from Two speed windshield wipers also were installed as standard equipment as well as directional turn signals and full floor carpeting For Air Temp air conditioning was offered as an option along with Solex tinted windshield saw an all new appearance for Chrysler products called The Million Dollar Look from Virgil Exner with a longer lower and wider stance that saw successful sales including the Town Country while production totals were still modest for the luxury segment The Super Scenic wraparound windshield greatly improved outward visibility and a power adjustable front bench seat was now optional along with wire spoke wheels br Production totals for continued to be modest for both the Windsor Town Country and the New Yorker Town Country averaging for the Windsor and for the New Yorker with a retail price of US in dollars for the Windsor and US in dollars for the New Yorker The Windsor version remained through then was moved to the new Newport series for The new Forward Look was a sales success for Chrysler but not for the Town Country By the Windsor Town Country manufactured just and the New Yorker made with still an expensive price tag of US in dollars for the Windsor and US in dollars for the New Yorker br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br For model years through the New Yorker Town and Country remained on the inch wheelbase while first the Windsor then the Newport Town and Country models rode a wheelbase of inches These were the roomiest factory bodied automobile based station wagons on the market at the time Chrysler also introduced hardtop styling as standard on Chrysler branded models for the first time These were the first large wagons and among the largest automobiles with unibody construction The New Yorker Town Country nine passenger station wagon was US in dollars and were recorded to have been manufactured Starting in Chryslers were optionally equipped with Captive Aire tires that remained inflated regardless of a tire puncture for in dollars Beginning in All Chrysler products introduced a new torsion bar front suspension called Torsion Aire which replaced the previous coil spring front suspension br The dash had been designed with Chrysler s push button controls for the TorqueFlite automatic in mind with the AstraDome instrument cluster covering the part of the steering column a column shifter would come out from under then standard practice so manual cars used a floor shifter Due to the installation of the AstraDome instrument cluster extending outward towards the steering wheel the traditional installation of the turn signal lever was relocated to the dashboard underneath the TorqueFlite pushbutton gear selectors and was installed as a sliding lever that would return to center as the steering wheel returned to the center position br Because the program to create all new Chryslers for was abruptly canceled in both of the Town Country wagons for the model year Newport and New Yorker were instead created by mating their front ends updated for to the body of a Plymouth door station wagon The Plymouth wagon was chosen because it was Chrysler Corporation s only finless full sized station wagon The Plymouth s existing taillights were replaced by wrap around units br For all Chrysler models including New Yorker standardized on the shorter Newport inch wheelbase Both New Yorker and Newport trim level Town and Country wagons continued as four door hardtops through making Chrysler the last American station wagons offered in this short lived configuration Powertrains and standard equipment remained familiar A hp BBL cu in V with pushbutton Torqueflite AT plus power steering and power brakes remained standard on the New Yorker T C The Newport T C shared that model s standard hp BBL cu in V with speed synchromesh transmission and floor shifter Both continued to offer and passenger variants plus a long list of optional equipment The New Yorker remained unique among large American wagons offering the option of bucket front seats with center cushion and folding armrest br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br All of Chrysler s full sized cars except the Imperial received major makeovers for the model year They were the work of Chief of Design Elwood Engel who was hired away from Ford Motor Company a few years earlier The unitized body and chassis with longitudinal front torsion bars and rear leaf springs carried over from the prior generation The wood sided appearance which was last used in returned but was simulated The New Yorker Town Country nine passenger station wagon was US in dollars and were recorded to have been manufactured br br Automatic transmission equipped cars dropped the dashboard pushbutton shift control and converted to the new industry standard PRNDL sequence shift lever either column or floor mounted Dodge and Chrysler models shared passenger compartment structures thus interior dimensions were essentially identical The Town and Country wagons shared the in mm wheelbase and design with Plymouth and Dodge wagons while other Chrysler body styles rode on a in mm longer wheelbase However the wagons had the same overall length as sedans at just under in mm All Chrysler brand models and body styles featured rear wheel opening skirts including the Town Country br Thin pillars and tall glass shared with door sedans made for generous space and outward visibility Straight roof rails on the long roof rack had adjustable cross bars All Newport models including wagons had a larger standard engine for The inch stroke LB engine was bored to inches yielding cubic inches With a BBL carburetor and single exhaust the regular fuel produced HP A premium fuel engine with BBL and dual exhausts producing HP was an available option New Yorker wagons continued to feature the cu in BBL V Torqueflite automatic transmission plus power steering and power brakes as standard equipment Both trim levels were available in or passenger versions However this was the last year that wagons would be available in either New Yorker or Newport trim levels br For Town Country would become a model designation for the one and only wagon in the Chrysler lineup Exterior trim was similar to the Newport series with unique taillights The vinyl bench seat interior shared features with both the Newport and New Yorker series with the front seat center armrest standard and simulated woodgrain on the dashboard resulting in a level of standard trim intermediate between the two sedan series Individual buckets with center armrest and passenger recliner from the New Yorker option list remained available for one more model year Chrysler s BBL regular fuel V became the standard engine with the BBL dual exhaust premium fuel V available as an option as on Newport Unlike Newport power steering power brakes and Torqueflite automatic transmission were standard equipment New in all Chryslers for the inch stroke RB engine was bored to inch yielding cubic inches With a compression ratio premium fuel a barrel carb and dual exhausts the cubic inch V produced HP and was the top power option for the Town Country Also available for the first time on all large Chryslers were front disc brakes which required inch wheels with unique wheel covers With optional front discs T C wagons wore size x extra load range tires With standard drum brakes the tire size was x br In exterior sheet metal for all large Chryslers was new with a concave side cove as a key design element Interiors were updated with a new instrument panel perfectly symmetrical in shape and featuring an inverted fan style speedometer Chassis dimensions and the greenhouses for door sedans and wagons carried over unchanged A single Town Country model in two or three seat versions was offered The exterior trim matched the Newport series Interior trim again split the difference between Newport and New Yorker featuring a standard all vinyl notchback bench seat with folding center armrest and the New Yorker s simulated woodgrain applique on the dashboard A new seating option was Chrysler s in split bench seat shared with the Newport Custom sedan Standard and optional powertrains remained the same Sales literature for showed front disc brakes as standard equipment on Town Country along with the requisite inch wheels x extra load tires and restyled disc brake wheel covers However many had inch wheels and Newport wheel covers because they had drum brakes These wagons were equipped with x tires br br For all new US cars were equipped with front and rear side marker lights Chrysler bumpers grille hood deck lid rear fascia and lamps all changed significantly although side sheet metal wagon tailgate and rear lamps remained the same Functionally there were few changes Better breathing cylinder heads boosted output of the standard cu in BBL V to HP Front disc brakes returned to the options list while front drum brakes and size x tires were standard Inside standard notchback and optional front seats continued sharing seat and door trim patterns with the Newport Custom series The big change in Town Country appearance came in the form of simulated walnut grain paneling filling the coved portion of the body sides and surrounded by a stainless steel molding The wood paneling was standard on all Town Country wagons with a delete option offered br The original Town Country genuine wood was available on coupes and convertibles as well as wagons the simulated wood panels were offered as an option on Newport door hardtop and convertible for and model years The appearance was also offered on the Mercury Park Lane hardtop coupe and convertible that was called yacht deck paneling and was also not as popular br br br br br For a major restyle brought a dramatic new look to all full sized Chrysler Corporation cars Called fuselage design it featured a pronounced side curvature from the rocker panels all the way to the roof rails Plymouth and Dodge models excluding wagons shared passenger compartment structures and greenhouses riding on inch and inch wheelbases respectively Similarly Chrysler and Imperial models excluding T C wagon shared slightly longer passenger compartments and greenhouses riding on inch and inch wheelbases respectively all of the Imperial s longer wheelbase was in the front clip As in the prior generation all Chrysler full sized wagons shared a common greenhouse on a unitized body and chassis with longitudinal front torsion bars rear leaf springs and the Dodge s inch wheelbase As before the wagon s shorter wheelbase was offset by the additional rear overhang Town Country wagons were nearly identical to other Chrysler body styles in overall length at just under inches The Town Country was US in dollars and were recorded to have been manufactured br Fuselage era Chryslers all featured a full width loop style chrome front bumper Quad headlamps and grille were recessed inside the loop with differing grille inserts for each series Turn signal and parking lamps were recessed into the bumper below the headlamps Body sides were simple and smooth with a subtle character line originating at the front bumper descending slightly for the length of the car and ending at the wrap around rear bumper On Town Country wagons this character line was also the location of the lower molding surrounding the standard wood grain side paneling simulated cherry for The fuselage profile extended the length of a full sized long roof made for a rather striking looking wagon At the trailing edge of the long roof body sides D pillars and a unique rooftop airfoil formed one continuous arch over the tailgate opening The airfoil directed airflow from the roof down and over the tail gate window intended to keep the glass clear of dirt accumulation br The Town Country s grille insert and wheel covers for this new generation were from the New Yorker while front seating choices and interior trim were again drawn from the Newport Custom The new instrument panel featured a symmetrical padded loop echoing the design theme of the front end The inverted fan style speedometer from and continued balanced on the passenger side by a large glove box door A unique Chrysler feature was floodlighting of the instruments and controls instead of more typical backlighting br For all full size Chrysler Corporation vehicles returned to standard inch wheels This accommodated the growing share of cars equipped with front disc brakes which were updated to a new simpler and less costly single piston sliding caliper design from the earlier piston fixed caliper type Once again Chrysler sales literature listed power front disc brakes as standard equipment on Town Country Some were built with front drum brakes instead Regardless of brake type all T Cs included standard size x tires on inch x inch heavy duty rims Powertrain choices for the Town Country remained unchanged br Chrysler played catch up on some wagon specific features in The tailgate became a two way door gate able to swing sideways or drop downward a feature Ford had pioneered in The rear axle track was widened nearly three inches to inches mm enabling a full inches mm wide load floor between the wheel wells a feature GM had also pioneered in Chrysler sought to leapfrog those competitors with a few station wagon exclusive features of its own including passenger assist handles integrated into the rear opening trim molding and a tailgate window washer that was contained entirely inside the tailgate br After so many changes in the prior year it is no surprise that there were few changes for Most US makes including Chrysler adopted bias belted tires They were a short lived hybrid that combined familiar soft riding bias body plies with tread stabilizing belts used in European style radial tires One well known brand name at the time was Goodyear s Polyglas All Chryslers featured standard bias belted tires with Town Country wagons wearing size J J identified the second largest size available in load capacity indicated a cross section height to width or aspect ratio of and being the nominal rim diameter in inches as before br A minor styling change found only on the Town Country for and was the addition of a dogleg or kink in the lower body side character line on the rearward half of each rear door Simulating a styling feature which had been seen on all Chryslers and which would return in this dogleg was simply a new shape for the woodgrain side trim and involved no special sheet metal It served to distinguish Chrysler wagons from Dodge and Plymouth models using the same body Front disc brakes moved back to the options list one last time br The late s proved to be a financially challenging time for Chrysler Corporation as tightening emissions standards and safety requirements spread resources thin Consequently the biennial mid cycle face lift originally intended to be the new model year corporate large car lineup was postponed one year Thus all Chryslers including the Town Country looked virtually unchanged from the prior year One interior change planned that did make it into the cars was the instrument panel surround Its upper bolster became a bit more massive while the lower bolster was reduced in size eliminating the lower ledge and the glove box door received a color keyed overlay Standard tires for the wagons were enlarged to L x a size shared with the Imperial and unique to Chrysler Corp Torsion Quiet Ride comprising a set of tuned rubber isolators for the front suspension sub frame and rear leaf spring mounts was added to wagons It had been introduced as a new feature for all other Chrysler models and body styles in Front disc brakes became standard equipment on the Town Country br Additional changes were related to Federal Emission Standards and the requirement that cars run on unleaded regular grade gasoline Compression ratios on all engines were reduced to For just this year engine power and torque specifications were advertised using both the familiar SAE gross rating method for the last time and SAE net rating method which remains the standard today Net ratings are more representative of engine output as installed since they measure output when the engine is fully dressed with production intake and exhaust plumbing cooling system and accessory loads in place Revised ratings for Town Country engines were cu in BBL V net hp with net lb ft cu In BBL V net hp with net lb ft cu In BBL net hp with net lb ft Dual exhaust systems were no longer used br br For the mid cycle restyle originally intended for the prior year made its appearance The overall design of Chrysler models remained very similar The uni body platform and all key dimensions remained unchanged The fuselage theme evolved toward an even simpler body side still with a subtle rearward sloping character line but with a squared off shoulder at the window sill The front bumper retained its loop form adding a center divider splitting the grille into halves Greenhouses for all four door models remained unchanged while two door coupe rooflines grew more formal and convertibles were dropped After many years of declining sales the series was eliminated replaced by a New Yorker Brougham series with plusher interior choices and more standard equipment slotted between the Imperial and New Yorker br For the Town Country borrowed most of its exterior trim from the New Yorker Die cast grille inserts were shared with New Yorker and rear wheel openings once again wore fender skirts Brushed bright metal moldings about two inches wide ran the length of the car from the front bumper to rear and served as the lower border for the standard simulated wood grain side panels Standard wheel covers were shared with the Newport and were identical to the wheel covers then shared with the New Yorker Inside the front seating choices and door trim were again shared with the Newport Custom Seatbacks for the standard notch back front seat featured a high back design with integrated headrests Chrysler s two way door gate became a three way able to open as door with the glass up br Unfortunately as the Town Country and every other car in the s grew heavier available powertrain choices became fewer and weaker Compression ratios were further reduced to An increase in bore from inches in the to inches produced a new LB series engine displacement of cu in With a BBL carburetor it just matched the net horsepower and lb ft N m net torque ratings of the prior year s The only remaining optional engine was the cu in BBL V producing net horsepower and lb ft N m net torque Even so the updated Town Country with its more imposing grille and nicely integrated fender skirts set sales records with six passenger and nine passenger wagons produced for the model year br was the fifth and final year of what had been planned as a four year platform cycle A federal mandate to equip MY cars with bumpers that could absorb up to mph km h impacts with no functional damage was a challenge since the large cars Chrysler had designed to comply with this standard were delayed until MY The stopgap solution was to replace the fuselage era signature loop front bumpers with a generic looking grille and conventional looking bumpers wearing large black rubber impact absorbers front and rear The absorbers added more than in mm to the overall length of the cars Apart from mph km h bumpers other changes for the Town Country were few The in front seat had proven sufficiently popular that it became standard equipment as did the higher torque cu in V engine which featured standard electronic ignition for the first time br br br br br For the model year Chrysler introduced its new large car lineup originally planned a year earlier The timing could hardly have been worse The Arab oil embargo of late had Americans waiting in line for gasoline coast to coast sometimes for hours Big cars quickly became a glut on the market despite the fact that Chrysler s new models were some of the best large cars Chrysler had produced in years The new styling was a clear departure from the fuselage generation and appeared to share the proportions and design cues of GM s large car redesign The body sides had a more pronounced tumble home A pillars were thin and beltlines were lower yielding significantly more glass area Energy absorbing bumpers were integrated into the designs front and rear The Town Country nine passenger station wagon was US in dollars and were recorded to have been manufactured br br For this generation full sized Plymouths and Dodges excluding wagons shared more than just body shells They also shared a common inch wheelbase instrument panels and most exterior body stampings Likewise Chrysler and Imperial models shared slightly longer body shells on a common inch wheelbase plus instrument panels and exterior body stampings And once again Chrysler Corporation wagons would share a common greenhouse across divisions although this time all wagons would roll on the longer Chrysler wheelbase All remained large enough to swallow the ubiquitous x sheet of plywood flat on its floor with the three way door gate closed no evidence of any attempt to follow GM s clamshell style rear closure fortunately The roof was slightly elevated aft of the C pillar and a body colored air deflector at the trailing edge remained a standard feature although it was no longer integrated into the body structure Fully skirted rear wheel openings and simulated woodgrain side and doorgate panel appliqu s remained standard equipment on all Town and Country wagons br A significant safety improvement was achieved with the relocation of the fuel tank from the left rear quarter where it was placed since the s to under the floor just behind the rear axle Underfloor storage space was reduced on seat wagons but revisions in the rd seat folding mechanism minimized any compromises in seating utility Space freed up in the left rear quarter panel became a lockable storage compartment br Although the overall size of Chryslers was barely larger than the fuselage generation that preceded it the overall weight continued to increase Additional emission controls safety features and growing standard equipment lists were having the same effect on every automaker The seat T C now weighed just under pounds about pounds heavier than the fuselage generation T C With air conditioning and a typical complement of power assists the average T C weighed about pounds Standard tires were L x bias belted on x inch rims Steel belted radials were optional br For changes were few and most were shared across the entire US industry including Chrysler Those lower rolling resistance radial ply tires became standard equipment in size LR x for the Town and Country Every Chrysler was equipped with an exhaust system catalytic converter for the first time requiring unleaded gasoline to run properly The cu in BBL V engine returned as a fuel economy alternative to the still standard engine And as a minor appearance upgrade for all Chrysler models Lower instrument panels steering columns and steering wheels became color coordinated rather than the previous black finish br was a year of product line consolidation for Chrysler The Imperial marque was discontinued No longer a separate model but a highly trimmed Chrysler the Imperial could not compete effectively with Cadillac Lincoln or premium European brands The Imperial s unique trim the waterfall grille concealed headlamps extended rear fenders vertical tail lamps and lose pillow upholstery seating became the New Yorker Brougham Similarly what had been New Yorker interior and exterior trim became the Newport Custom The Town and Country continued unchanged inside and out It remained as large and well equipped as ever but the market s interest in giant luxury station wagons was waning br would be the last year of Chrysler Town and Country as a traditional American full sized premium station wagon Both GM and Ford would downsize and continue traditional big wagons thru the s for Ford and into the s for GM But at Chrysler the beloved Town and Country moniker would take on new roles in new market segments br br br br br From through the Town Country badge designated the simulated wood trimmed wagon model of the mid sized Chrysler LeBaron series built on the Chrysler M platform which included Plymouth Gran Fury Dodge Diplomat and Chrysler LeBaron Although trimmed more elegantly inside and out there were not many substantial differences in the chassis and powertrain between Chrysler s downsized intermediate line up and its compact rear wheel drive Dodge Aspen Plymouth Volare models introduced in Wheelbases tread width and interior dimensions were identical leaving only front rear overhangs and overall length to differentiate mid sized from the compact br br br br br For model years through the Town Country name was featured on the wagon version of the K body based front wheel drive LeBaron featuring simulated woodgrain exterior trim A limited production convertible version was manufactured for model years to and also featured simulated woodgrain paneling and was meant to reflect the classic look of original s and early s convertibles The convertibles came standard with Mark Cross leather interior br Chrysler s K body platform models including the LeBaron based Town Countries were eventually phased out by the late s The Town Country name was briefly absent from the start of the model year but returned for on a new luxury Chrysler Town Country minivan Like most Town Country models of the past the new minivan also featured woodgrain exterior trim br br br br br Initially planned for the model year the Chrysler Town Country returned in the spring of as an early model year introduction only this time around it became part of the new Chrysler Town Country luxury minivan line up which was based on the Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager minivan cousins each of which were added to Chrysler s corporate minivan line up during the start of the model year as long wheelbase extended length versions of their standard wheelbase standard length Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager minivan cousins which had been introduced for the first time ever during the start of the model year line up After its return early in the start of the model year line up the Chrysler Town Country minivan has been redesigned for the and model years with each following generation adding new technology and with numerous industry firsts br br br br br br External links br br The
