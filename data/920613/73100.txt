Frederick Bean Tex Avery February August was an American animator cartoonist director and voice actor He was known for directing and producing animated cartoons during the golden age of American animation His most significant work was for the Warner Bros and Metro Goldwyn Mayer studios where he was crucial in the creation and evolution of famous animated characters such as Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck Porky Pig Elmer Fudd Droopy Screwy Squirrel The Wolf Red Hot Riding Hood and George and Junior br He gained influence for his technical innovation directorial style and brand of humor Avery s attitude toward animation was opposite that of Walt Disney and other conventional family cartoons at the time Avery s cartoons were known for their sarcastic ironic absurdist irreverent and sometimes sexual tone in nature They focused on sight gags surrealist humor rapid pacing racial stereotypes and violent humor with wacky characters who broke the fourth wall br br br Early life and education br br Avery was born to Mary Augusta Jessie n e Bean and George Walton Avery in Taylor Texas His father was born in Alabama and his mother was born in Chickasaw County Mississippi br Avery graduated in from North Dallas High School A popular catchphrase at his school was What s up doc which he later used for Bugs Bunny in the s Interested in becoming a newspaper cartoonist he took a three month summer course at the Chicago Art Institute but left after a month br br br Animation career br On January Avery arrived in Los Angeles He spent the following months working in menial jobs According to animation historian Michael Barrier these jobs included working in a warehouse working on the docks at night loading fruits and vegetables and painting cars He began his animation career when hired by the Winkler studio named after producer Margaret J Winkler and later known as Screen Gems He was an inker inking cels for animated short films in the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit series the character had been created by Walt Disney Avery then moved to a new studio Universal Cartoon Studios later known as Walter Lantz Productions He was again employed as an inker but moved rapidly up the studio s hierarchy By Avery had been promoted to the position of animator br Avery continued working at the Walter Lantz Studio into the early s He worked on most of the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons from to He is shown as animator on the original title card credits on the Oswald cartoons He later claimed to have directed two cartoons during this time br br br Accident to eye br During some office horseplay at the Lantz studio a thumbtack or paper clip flew into Avery s left eye and caused him to lose sight in that eye Some speculate it was his lack of depth perception that gave him his unique look at animation and bizarre directorial style but it did not stop his creative career The incident is described in some detail by Barrier based in part on old interviews with Avery Part of the typical crude horseplay at the Universal studio was using a rubber band or a paper spitball to target the back of a colleague s head An animator called Charles Hastings decided to take the game one step further by using a wire paper clip instead Avery heard one of his colleagues telling him to look out He reacted by turning around Instead of the back of his head the paper clip hit Avery in his left eye He instantly lost the use of his eye br br br From inker to storyboards br As an animator Avery worked under director Bill Nolan Nolan reportedly delegated work to Avery whenever Avery had to animate a sequence Nolan s instructions for a scene involving Oswald being chased by bees were reportedly simple He would describe in which direction Oswald was running right to left and for how many feet The rest of the details were left up to Avery Avery started handing out work to other animators working under Nolan br Avery wanted still greater control over the creative process and served as a de facto director for a couple of films Based on Avery s recollections here is a description of how this happened He was submitting sight gags for use in the short films Some of them were used in the actual films and some funny ones were left out He wanted to somehow get all his gags in the finished film So he asked Nolan to let him create the entire storyboard for a film Nolan instructed Avery to not only draw the storyboard but to work on the timing and the layout on his own Avery completed two films using this process An older Avery recalled that both films were terrible though they got accepted for release br Avery was reportedly displeased with his salary and had started giving up on his work After about six weeks of substandard work his superiors let him go In April Avery lost his job at the Universal studio br br br Termite Terrace br Later in Avery applied for a job at Leon Schlesinger Productions the company later known as Warner Bros Cartoons Avery reportedly managed to convince producer Leon Schlesinger that he was an experienced director a false claim In Avery s own words br br Hey I m a director Hell I was no more a director than nothing but with my loud mouth I talked him into it br By when Avery was hired the Schlesinger studio had only two full time regular film directors Friz Freleng and Jack King Avery became the third regular director The staff of the Schlesinger studio had become too large to be housed in a single building at the Warner Bros backlot in Sunset Boulevard The new Avery unit of the studio was granted their own building a five room bungalow The unit staff dubbed their quarters Termite Terrace due to its significant termite population Termite Terrace later became the nickname for the entire Schlesinger Warners studio primarily because Avery and his unit were the ones who defined what became known as the Warner Bros cartoon br Avery was granted exclusive use of four animators Bob Clampett Chuck Jones Sid Sutherland and Virgil Ross The first animated short film produced by this unit was Gold Diggers of the third Looney Tunes film starring Beans Beans was also featured in the film s title card signifying that he was the intended protagonist The film had a Western setting and cast Beans as a gold miner Also featured in the film was a redesigned Porky Pig making his second appearance The Avery unit was assigned to work primarily on the black and white Looney Tunes instead of the Technicolor Merrie Melodies but was allowed to make color Merrie Melodies beginning with Page Miss Glory from br br Avery stopped using Beans following Gold Diggers of but continued using Porky as a star character According to Michael Barrier Beans was more of a straight man However Porky had to be redesigned again The early Porky was decidedly piglike in appearance In Michael Barrier s description Porky was very fat had small eyes a large snout and pronounced jowls He was like a porcine version of Roscoe Arbuckle Starting with Porky the Rainmaker his fourth animated short starring Porky Avery introduced a cuter version of Porky The new design gave Porky more prominent eyes and a smaller snout The jowls were replaced by chubby cheeks Porky s body now had a rounder shape its defining trait was not fatness but softness Barrier notes that the new design by Avery departed from the Disneyish realism in the previous drawing style Porky became a less realistic pig and looked more like a cartoon character br According to Martha Sigall Avery was one of the few directors to visit the ink and paint department she avers that he liked to see how his cartoons were developing He would answer questions and be always in good humor When some of the artists humorously criticized the wild action in his animated shorts Avery would take time to explain his rationale He recalled that while working at Warner Bros the animators had a great deal of liberty and were subject to very little censorship br br br Creation of Looney Tunes stars br Avery with the assistance of Clampett Jones and the new associate director Frank Tashlin laid the foundation for a style of animation that rivaled The Walt Disney Studio as the leader in animated short films and created a group of cartoon characters that are still known today Avery in particular was deeply involved He crafted gags for the shorts and sometimes provided voices for them including his trademark belly laugh and held such control over the timing of the shorts that he would add or cut frames out of the final negative if he felt a gag s timing was not quite right br Porky s Duck Hunt introduced the character of Daffy Duck who possessed a new form of lunacy and zaniness that had not been seen before in animated cartoons Daffy was an almost completely crazy darn fool duck who frequently bounced around the film frame in double speed screaming Hoo hoo in a high pitched sped up voice provided by the voice artist Mel Blanc who with this cartoon also took over providing the voice of Porky Pig Avery directed two more Daffy Duck cartoons Daffy Duck Egghead and Daffy Duck in Hollywood Egghead was a character inspired by comedian Joe Penner and first appeared in Avery s Egghead Rides Again br Little Red Walking Hood first introduced the early character of Elmer Fudd as a character mostly taking part of some running gag Elmer in this early form had green clothes a brown bowler hat and a pink nose He was also named Elmer on the lobby cards for The Isle of Pingo Pongo his second appearance Cinderella Meets Fella his third appearance and was fully called Elmer Fudd on screen in A Feud There Was also his fourth appearance Elmer even appears on early merchandise and in the early Looney Tunes books in and and was later promoted as Egghead s Brother on the Vitaphone Release Sheet for Cinderella Meets Fella due to the fact that Elmer was also voiced by Danny Webb in his Joe Penner voice that was also use for Egghead br Ben Hardaway Cal Dalton and Chuck Jones directed a series of shorts which featured a Daffy Duck like rabbit created by Ben Bugs Hardaway As is the case with most directors each puts his own personal stamp on the characters stories and overall feel of a short So each of these cartoons treated the rabbit differently The next to try out the rabbit known around Termite Terrace as Bugs bunny named after Hardaway was Avery Since the recycling of storylines among the directors was commonplace A Wild Hare was a double throwback Avery had directed the short Porky s Duck Hunt featuring Porky Pig which also introduced Daffy Duck br Hardaway remade it as Porky s Hare Hunt introducing the rabbit So Avery went back to the hunter and prey framework incorporating Jones s Elmer s Candid Camera gag for gag and altering the new design of Elmer Fudd polishing the timing and expanding the Groucho Marx smart aleck attitude already present in Porky s Hare Hunt he made Bugs a kind of slick Brooklyn esque rabbit who was always in control of the situation Avery has stated that it was very common to refer to folks in Texas as doc much like pal dude or bud In A Wild Hare Bugs adopts this colloquialism when he casually walks up to Elmer who is hunting wabbits and while carefully inspecting a rabbit hole shotgun in hand the first words out of Bugs s mouth is a coolly calm What s up doc Audiences reacted riotously to the juxtaposition of Bugs s nonchalance and the potentially dangerous situation What s up doc instantly became the rabbit s catchphrase Originally Avery wanted Bugs Bunny to be called Jack E Rabbit because he hunted for jack rabbits when he was a kid Numerous suggestions for names came up but publicist Rose Horsely liked the name that was on Thorson s model sheet saying that it was cute and they ll play it two ways Avery argued on his stance for the name Jack E Rabbit saying that Mine s a rabbit A tall lanky mean rabbit He isn t a fuzzy little bunny He also said the name Bugs Bunny sounded like a Disney character Nevertheless Schlesinger settled on Bugs Bunny br Avery ended up directing only four Bugs Bunny cartoons A Wild Hare Tortoise Beats Hare The Heckling Hare and All This and Rabbit Stew During this period he also directed a number of one shot shorts including travelogue parody The Isle of Pingo Pongo which is the second cartoon to feature an early character that evolved into Elmer Fudd fractured fairy tales The Bear s Tale Hollywood caricature films Hollywood Steps Out and cartoons featuring Bugs Bunny clones The Crackpot Quail br Avery s tenure at the Schlesinger studio ended in late when he and the producer quarreled over the ending to The Heckling Hare In Avery s original version Bugs and the hunting dog were to fall off a cliff three times making it an early example of the wild take According to a DVD commentary for the cartoon the historian and animator Greg Ford explained that the problem Schlesinger had with the ending was that just before falling off the third time Bugs and the dog were to turn to the screen with Bugs saying Hold on to your hats folks here we go again a punchline to a potentially risqu joke of the day However Barrier uncovered a typewritten dialogue transcript of the cartoon that mentions the three falls at the end but the Hold on to your hats line is absent with the rest of the dialogue in the cartoon transcribed accurately meaning that Avery either misremembered or embellished the story and Schlesinger made the cut not because of any risque content but because he did not think that it was funny that Avery was killing Bugs three times and the ending simply dragged on for too long The Hollywood Reporter reported on the quarrel on July Avery was slapped with a four week unpaid suspension br br br Speaking of Animals br While at Schlesinger Avery created a concept of animating lip movement to live action footage of animals Schlesinger was not interested in Avery s idea so Avery approached Jerry Fairbanks a friend of his who produced the Unusual Occupations series of short subjects for Paramount Pictures Fairbanks liked the idea and the Speaking of Animals series of shorts was launched When Avery left the Schlesinger studio in mid he went straight to Paramount to work on the first three shorts in the series before joining Metro Goldwyn Mayer The series continued without him lasting seven years br br br Avery at MGM br br On September the Reporter announced that Avery had signed a five year contract with Metro Goldwyn Mayer where he was to form his own animation unit and direct shorts in Technicolor By Avery was in the employ of MGM working in their cartoon division under the supervision of Fred Quimby Avery felt that Schlesinger had stifled him When asked if he missed the Looney Tunes characters he responded Sometimes but I don t miss anything else MGM is a heck of a better place to work in every way and the people here are just as great br At MGM Avery s creativity reached its peak His cartoons became known for their sheer lunacy breakneck pace and a penchant for playing with the medium of animation and film in general that few other directors dared to approach MGM also offered him larger budgets and a higher quality production level than the Warners studio plus his unit was filled with talented ex Disney artists such as Preston Blair and Ed Love These changes were evident in Avery s first short released by MGM Blitz Wolf an Adolf Hitler parody of the Three Little Pigs story which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject Cartoons in Avery s cartoons at MGM somewhat felt like Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons done during that same period at Warner Bros albeit the Warners series gained more popularity than Avery s MGM cartoons br Avery s best known MGM character debuted in Dumb Hounded Droopy originally Happy Hound was a small calm slow moving and slow talking dog who always won out in the end whatever difficulties he faced He also created a series of risqu cartoons beginning with Red Hot Riding Hood also featuring a sexy female star who never had a set name but has been unofficially referred to as Red by fans Her visual design and voice varied somewhat between shorts Other Avery characters at MGM included Screwy Squirrel and the Of Mice and Men inspired duo of George and Junior br Other MGM cartoons directed by Avery include Bad Luck Blackie Cellbound Magical Maestro Lucky Ducky Ventriloquist Cat and King Size Canary Avery began his stint at MGM working with lush colors and realistic backgrounds but he slowly abandoned this style for a more frenetic less realistic approach The newer more stylized look reflected the influence of the up and coming UPA studio the need to cut costs as budgets grew higher and Avery s own desire to leave reality behind and make cartoons that were not tied to the real world of live action During this period he made a series of films which explored the technology of the future The House of Tomorrow The Car of Tomorrow The Farm of Tomorrow and TV of Tomorrow spoofing common live action promotional shorts of the time He also introduced a slow talking wolf character who was the prototype for MGM associates Hanna Barbera s Huckleberry Hound character right down to the voice by Daws Butler br Avery took a year s sabbatical from MGM beginning in to recover from overwork during which time Dick Lundy recently arrived from the Walter Lantz studio took over his unit and made one Droopy cartoon as well as a string of shorts featuring Barney Bear Avery returned to MGM in October and began working again Avery s last two original cartoons for MGM were Deputy Droopy and Cellbound completed in and released in They were co directed by the Avery unit animator Michael Lah Lah began directing a handful of CinemaScope Droopy shorts on his own On March Avery s unit was terminated and he was fired from MGM Fred Quimby spoke of bringing back the unit however in December of that year Walter Lantz announced that Avery would be working for him br br br Return to Walter Lantz Productions br Avery directed four cartoons for Walter Lantz Productions in Crazy Mixed Up Pup Sh h h h h h I m Cold and The Legend of Rockabye Point in which he defined the character of Chilly Willy the penguin He brought his signature wild gags and fast pacing to the Lantz studio and the Lantz cartoons received new energy and recognition The Legend of Rockabye Point and Crazy Mixed Up Pup were nominated for Academy Awards br Avery had agreed to a salary and a percentage of the profits He didn t realize that his share came out of the net profits I made about four cartoons for Lantz then I started thinking about the contract I took it to an attorney and he said Oh brother You ll never get a dime out of this You re getting charged for everything but the paving out in front of the studio I was getting my percentage off the bottom instead of off the top By the time all the charges went in why my goodness there was nothing left So I gave up there Avery left behind three new Chilly Willy storyboards which were later made into cartoons by director Alex Lovy br br br Cascade Studios br Avery turned to animated television commercials at Cascade Studios including those for Raid s through s in which cartoon insects confronted by the bug killer screamed RAID and died flamboyantly and Frito Lay s controversial mascot the Frito Bandito Avery also produced ads for Kool Aid fruit drinks starring the Looney Tunes characters he had once helped create during his Termite Terrace days and funny enough the Cascade executives did not even know that he created the characters br During the s and s Avery became increasingly reserved and depressed due to the suicide of his son and the break up of his marriage although he continued to draw respect from his peers After Cascade he briefly animated commercials for his own company Tex Avery Cartoons from June to July Avery then went back to Cascade and closed the cartoon department in He had an offer from Friz Freleng to write for DePatie Freleng Enterprises but was not interested br br br Hanna Barbera Productions br From until his death his final employer was Hanna Barbera Productions where he wrote gags for Saturday morning cartoons such as the Droopy esque Kwicky Koala According to an interview by John Dunn in his diary Avery did not like the late animation industry at the time feeling that it lacked quality br br br Innovation br Gary Morris described Avery s innovative approach Above all Avery steered the Warner Bros house style away from Disney esque sentimentality and made cartoons that appealed equally to adults who appreciated Avery s speed sarcasm and irony and to kids who liked the nonstop action Disney s cute and cuddly creatures under Avery s guidance were transformed into unflappable wits like Bugs Bunny endearing buffoons like Porky Pig or dazzling crazies like Daffy Duck Even the classic fairy tale a market that Disney had cornered was appropriated by Avery who made innocent heroines like Red Riding Hood into sexy jazz babes more than a match for any Wolf Avery also endeared himself to intellectuals by constantly breaking through the artifice of the cartoon having characters leap out of the end credits loudly object to the plot of the cartoon they were starring in or speak directly to the audience br br br Directing style br Avery had developed a distinct signature style at Warner Bros Studio which had breakneck pacing outlandish over the top acting from his characters and seemingly non stop jokes and gags Avery s style of directing encouraged animators to stretch the boundaries of the medium to do things in a cartoon that could not be done in the world of a live action film An often quoted line about Avery s cartoons was In a cartoon you can do anything He also performed a great deal of voice work in his cartoons usually throwaway bits He also occasionally filled in for Bill Thompson as Droopy br br br Personal life and death br Two days after being fired from Universal in Spring Avery married his girlfriend Patricia She was also employed at Universal Studios as an inker The newlyweds spent a long honeymoon in Oregon but had to return to Los Angeles when they ran out of money br On Tuesday August Avery died of lung cancer at St Joseph s Hospital in Burbank California at the age of At the time of his death he was developing a character named Cave Mouse for a new Flintstones series According to Chuck Jones when watching a baseball game with another animator Avery s last words were I don t know where animators go when they die but I guess there must be a lot of them They could probably use a good director though He is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Hollywood Hills br br br Influence and legacy br Avery s influence can be seen in modern cartoons such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit The Ren Stimpy Show Animaniacs The Mask and SpongeBob SquarePants An Avery esque cowboy character bore his name in the otherwise unrelated series The Wacky World of Tex Avery Avery s work has been featured on shows such as The Tex Avery Show and Cartoon Alley br In the mid s Dark Horse Comics released a trio of three issue miniseries that were openly labelled tributes to Avery s MGM cartoons Wolf Red Droopy and Screwy Squirrel in which other characters make appearances in the comics such as George and Junior Spike and the one shot characters Tex Avery unlike most Warner Bros directors kept many original title frames of his cartoons several were otherwise lost due to Blue Ribbon Reissues Rare prints and art containing original titles and unedited animation from Avery s MGM and Warner Bros cartoons are now usually sold on eBay or in the collections of animators and cartoon enthusiasts In France issued three postage stamps honoring Tex Avery for his th birthday depicting Droopy the redheaded showgirl and the wolf br All of his MGM shorts were released in a North American MGM UA laserdisc set called The Compleat Tex Avery While two cartoons in the set were edited
