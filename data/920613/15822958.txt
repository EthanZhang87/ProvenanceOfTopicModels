Sega s Dreamcast and Microsoft s Xbox It is the best selling video game console of all time having sold over million units worldwide nearly triple the combined sales of its competing consoles br Announced in Sony began developing the console after the immense success of its predecessor The highlight of the system was its Emotion Engine processor co developed by Sony and Toshiba which was said to be more powerful than personal computers The PS offered backward compatibility for its predecessor s DualShock controller as well as its games br The PlayStation received widespread critical acclaim upon release A total of over game titles were released worldwide with over billion copies sold In Sony released a smaller lighter revision of the console known as the PS Slim Even after the release of its successor the PlayStation it remained popular well into the seventh generation It continued to be produced until the beginning of when Sony finally announced that it had been discontinued after over twelve years of production one of the longest lifespans of any video game console New games for the console continued to be released until even shortly after the end of its life and support from Sony br br br History br br br Background br Released in the original PlayStation proved to be a phenomenal worldwide success and signalled Sony s rise to power in the video game industry Its launch elicited critical acclaim and strong sales it eventually became the first computer entertainment platform to ship over million units The PlayStation enjoyed particular success outside Japan in part due to Sony s refined development kits large scale advertising campaigns and strong third party developer support By the late s Sony had dethroned established rivals Sega and Nintendo in the global video game market Sega spurred on by its declining market share and significant financial losses launched the Dreamcast in as a last ditch attempt to stay in the industry br br br Development br Though Sony has kept details of the PlayStation s development secret Ken Kutaragi the chief designer of the original PlayStation reportedly began working on a second console around the time of the original PlayStation s launch in late At some point during development employees from Argonaut Games under contract for semiconductor manufacturer LSI Corporation were instructed to design a rendering chip for Sony s upcoming console Jez San founder of Argonaut recalled that his team had no direct contact with Sony during the development process Unbeknownst to him Sony was designing their own chip in house and had instructed other companies to design rendering chips merely to diversify their options br By early the press was reporting that a new PlayStation was being developed and would have backward compatibility with the original PlayStation a built in DVD player and Internet connectivity However Sony continued to officially deny that a successor was being developed Chris Deering then president of SCEE recalled that there was a degree of trepidation among Sony leaders to produce a console which would recapture or exceed the success of its predecessor br Sony announced the PlayStation on March Sega s Dreamcast enjoyed a successful US launch on September of that year fuelled by a large marketing campaign it sold over units within two weeks br br Sony unveiled the PlayStation at the Tokyo Game Show on September Sony showed fully playable demos of upcoming PlayStation games including Gran Turismo later released as Gran Turismo A Spec and Tekken Tag Tournament which showed the console s graphic abilities and power br br br Launch br The PS was launched in March in Japan October in North America and November in Europe Sales of the console games and accessories pulled in million on the first day beating the million made on the first day of the Dreamcast Directly after its release it was difficult to find PS units on retailer shelves due to manufacturing delays Another option was purchasing the console online through auction websites such as eBay where people paid over a thousand dollars for the console The PS initially sold well partly on the basis of the strength of the PlayStation brand and the console s backward compatibility selling its entire inventory of million units in Japan by March less than a month after launch Backward compatibility had been widely seen as a desirable feature for consumers since the debut of the first successor video game console but prior to the PlayStation only one console had featured true backward compatibility i e without the use of add ons the Atari due to the added hardware costs and industry concerns that backward compatibility could cause the console to appear to be a merely a new model of its predecessor or lead developers to prefer making games for the predecessor system br The slogan used was Live in your world Play in ours Stylized as LIVE IN YUR WRLD PLY IN URS br Later Sony added new development kits for game developers and more PS units for consumers The PS s built in functionality also expanded its audience beyond the gamer as its debut pricing was less than many standalone DVD players on the market This made the console a low cost entry into the home theater market br Marketing for the PlayStation reverted to the same tactic used in the early days of the original PlayStation use year olds as the target audience since younger audiences aspire to be teenagers and older audiences enjoy video games at the same level they did when they were br The success of the PS at the end of caused Sega problems both financially and competitively and Sega announced the discontinuation of the Dreamcast in March just months after its successful Western launch Despite the Dreamcast still receiving support through the PS remained the only sixth generation console for over months before it faced competition from new rivals Nintendo s GameCube and Microsoft s Xbox Many analysts predicted a close three way matchup among the three consoles The Xbox had the most powerful hardware while the GameCube was the least expensive console and Nintendo changed its policy to encourage third party developers While the PlayStation theoretically had the weakest hardware of the three it had a head start due to its installed base plus strong developer commitment as well as a built in DVD player the Xbox required an adapter while the GameCube lacked support entirely While the PlayStation s initial games lineup was considered mediocre this changed during the holiday season with the release of several blockbuster games that maintained the PS s sales momentum and held off its newer rivals Sony also countered the Xbox by securing timed PlayStation exclusives for highly anticipated games such as the Grand Theft Auto series and Metal Gear Solid Sons of Liberty br Sony cut the price of the console in May from US to in North America making it the same price as the GameCube and less than the Xbox It also planned to cut the price in Japan around that time It cut the price twice in Japan in In Sony cut the cost of the console in anticipation of the release of the PlayStation br Unlike Sega s Dreamcast Sony originally placed little emphasis on online gaming during its first few years although that changed upon the launch of the online capable Xbox Coinciding with the release of Xbox Live Sony released the PlayStation Network Adaptor in late with several online first party titles released alongside it such as SOCOM U S Navy SEALs to demonstrate its active support for Internet play Sony also advertised heavily and its online model had the support of Electronic Arts EA EA did not offer online Xbox titles until Although Sony and Nintendo both started late and although both followed a decentralized model of online gaming where the responsibility is up to the developer to provide the servers Sony s moves made online gaming a major selling point of the PS br In September Sony revealed a newer slimmer model of the PlayStation In preparation for the launch of the new models SCPH xx x Sony stopped making the older models SCPH x xx to let the distribution channel empty its stock of the units After an apparent manufacturing issue Sony reportedly underestimated demand caused some initial slowdown in producing the new unit caused in part by shortages between the time Sony cleared out the old units and the new units were ready The issue was compounded in Britain when a Russian oil tanker became stuck in the Suez Canal blocking a ship from China carrying PS s bound for the UK During one week in November British sales totalled units compared to units a few weeks prior There were shortages in more than shops in North America on the day before Christmas br br br Later years and discontinuation br In Sony introduced a TV with a built in PlayStation br The PlayStation continued to be produced until when Sony finally announced that it had been discontinued after over twelve years of production one of the longest lifespans of any video game console New games for the console continued to be made until the end of including Final Fantasy XI Seekers of Adoulin for Japan and FIFA for North America The last game to be released on the PlayStation is Pro Evolution Soccer which was released in the United Kingdom on November Repair services for the system in Japan ended on September br br br Hardware br br br Technical specifications br br The PlayStation s main central processing unit CPU is the bit R based Emotion Engine custom designed by Sony and Toshiba The Emotion Engine consists of eight separate units each performing a specific task integrated onto the same die These units include a central CPU core two Vector Processing Units VPU a channel DMA unit a memory controller and an Image Processing Unit IPU There are three interfaces an input output interface to the I O processor running at a clock speed of MHz a graphics interface to the graphics synthesiser and a memory interface to the system memory The Emotion Engine CPU has a clock rate of MHz MHz on newer versions and MIPS with a floating point performance of GFLOPS The system s I O processor was based on the PlayStation s CPU and was designed to provide full backward compatibility with the PlayStation The system has MB of RDRAM br The GPU is likewise custom designed for the console named the Graphics Synthesizer It has a fillrate of gigapixels per second capable of rendering up to million polygons per second The GPU also runs with a clock frequency of MHz which is half the clock speed of the Emotion Engine MB of DRAM is capable of transmitting a display output of x pixels on both PAL and NTSC televisions The PlayStation has a maximum colour depth of million true colours When accounting for features such as lighting texture mapping artificial intelligence and game physics the console has a real world performance of million polygons per second The PlayStation also features two USB ports and one IEEE Firewire port for SCPH to x models only A hard disk drive can be installed in an expansion bay on the back of the console and is required to play certain games notably the popular Final Fantasy XI The system has MB of Video RAM in the form of eDRAM br Software for the PlayStation was distributed primarily on DVD ROMs with some titles being published on blue tinted CD ROM format In addition the console can play audio CDs and DVD films and is backward compatible with almost all original PlayStation games The PlayStation also supports PlayStation memory cards and controllers although original PlayStation memory cards will only work with original PlayStation games and the controllers may not support all functions such as analogue buttons for PlayStation games br The standard PlayStation memory card has an megabyte MB capacity and features MagicGate encryption There are a variety of non Sony manufactured memory cards available for the PlayStation allowing for a memory capacity larger than the standard MB br The PlayStation can natively output video resolutions on SDTV and HDTV from i to p and some games such as Gran Turismo and Tourist Trophy are known to support up scaled i resolution The PlayStation supports the following standards composite video i S Video i RGB i p VGA for progressive scan games and PS Linux only YPBPR component video which display most original PlayStation games in their native p mode which most HDTV sets do not support and D Terminal Cables are available for all of these signal types these cables also output analogue stereo audio Additionally an RF modulator is available for the system to connect to older TVs br br br Models br br The PlayStation has undergone many revisions some only of internal construction and others involving substantial external changes br The PS is primarily differentiated between models featuring the original fat case design and slimline models which were introduced at the end of In the Sony Bravia KDL PX was made available to consumers It was a HD Ready television which incorporated a built in PlayStation br The standard color of the PS is matte black Several variations in color were produced in different quantities and regions including ceramic white light yellow metallic blue aqua metallic silver navy star blue opaque blue astral blue opaque black midnight black pearl white sakura purple satin gold satin silver snow white super red transparent blue ocean blue and also Limited Edition color Pink which was distributed in some regions such as Oceania and parts of Asia br In September Sony unveiled its third major hardware revision Available in late October it was smaller thinner and quieter than the original versions and included a built in Ethernet port in some markets it also had an integrated modem Due to its thinner profile it did not contain the expansion bay and therefore did not support the internal hard disk drive It also lacked an internal power supply until a later revision excluding the Japanese version similar to the GameCube and had a modified Multitap expansion The removal of the expansion bay was criticized as a limitation due to the existence of titles such as Final Fantasy XI which required the HDD use br Sony also manufactured a consumer device called the PSX that can be used as a digital video recorder and DVD burner in addition to playing PS games The device was released in Japan on December and was the first Sony product to include the XrossMediaBar interface It did not sell well in the Japanese market and was not released anywhere else br br br Online support br br PlayStation users had the option to play select games over the Internet using dial up or a broadband Internet connection The PlayStation Network Adaptor was required for the original models while the slim models included built in networking ports Instead of having a unified subscription based online service like Xbox Live as competitor Microsoft later chose for its Xbox console online multiplayer functionality on the PlayStation was the responsibility of the game publisher and ran on third party servers Many games that supported online play exclusively supported broadband Internet access br br br Controllers br br The PlayStation s DualShock controller retains most of the same functionality as its predecessor However it includes analogue pressure sensitivity to over individual levels of depth on the face shoulder and D pad buttons replacing the digital buttons of the original Like its predecessor the DualShock controller has force feedback or vibration functionality It is lighter and includes two more levels of vibration br Specialized controllers include light guns GunCon fishing rod and reel controllers a Dragon Quest VIII slime controller a Final Fantasy X Tiny Bee dual pistol controller an Onimusha katana controller and a Resident Evil chainsaw controller br br br Peripherals br br Optional hardware includes additional DualShock or DualShock controllers a PS DVD remote control an internal or external hard disk drive HDD a network adapter horizontal and vertical stands PlayStation or PS memory cards the multitap for PlayStation or PS a USB motion camera EyeToy a USB keyboard and mouse and a headset br The original PS multitap SCPH cannot be plugged into the newer slim models The multitap connects to the memory card slot and the controller slot and the memory card slot on the slimline is shallower New slim design multitaps SCPH were manufactured for these models however third party adapters also permit original multitaps to be used br Early versions of the PS could be networked via an i LINK port though this had little game support and was dropped Some third party manufacturers have created devices that allow disabled people to access the PS through ordinary switches etc br Some third party companies such as Joytech have produced LCD monitor and speaker attachments for the PS which attach to the back of the console These allow users to play games without access to a television as long as there is access to mains electricity or a similar power source These screens can fold down onto the PS in a similar fashion to laptop screens br There are many accessories for musical games such as dance pads for Dance Dance Revolution In the Groove and Pump It Up titles and High School Musical Senior Year Dance Konami microphones for use with the Karaoke Revolution games dual microphones sold with and used exclusively for SingStar games various guitar controllers for the Guitar Freaks series and Guitar Hero series the drum set controller sold in a box set or by itself with a guitar controller and a USB microphone for use with Rock Band and Guitar Hero series World Tour and newer and a taiko drum controller for Taiko Drum Master br Unlike the PlayStation which requires the use of an official Sony PlayStation Mouse to play mouse compatible games the few PS games with mouse support work with a standard USB mouse as well as a USB trackball In addition some of these games also support the usage of a USB keyboard for text input game control instead of a DualShock or DualShock gamepad in tandem with a USB mouse or both br br br Game library br br PlayStation software is distributed on CD ROM and DVD ROM the two formats are differentiated by their discs bottoms with CD ROMs being blue and DVD ROMs being silver The PlayStation offered some particularly high profile exclusive games Most main entries in the Grand Theft Auto Final Fantasy and Metal Gear Solid series were released exclusively for the console Several prolific series got their start on the PlayStation including God of War Ratchet Clank Jak and Daxter Devil May Cry Kingdom Hearts and Sly Cooper Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was the best selling game on the console br Game releases peaked in but declined with the release of the PlayStation in The last new games for the console were Final Fantasy XI Seekers of Adoulin in Asia FIFA in North America and Pro Evolution Soccer in Europe As of June a total of software titles had been released worldwide including games released in multiple regions as separate titles br br br Reception br Initial reviews of the PlayStation from highly acclaimed the console with reviewers commending its hardware and graphics capabilities its ability to play DVDs and the system s backward compatibility with games and hardware for the original PlayStation Early points of criticism included the lack of online support at the time its inclusion of only two controller ports and the system s price at launch compared to the Dreamcast in PC Magazine in called the console outstanding praising its noteworthy components such as the Emotion Engine CPU MB of RAM support for IEEE branded as i LINK by Sony and FireWire by Apple and the console s two USB ports while criticizing its expensive games and its support for only two controllers without the multitap accessory br Later reviews especially after the launch of the competing GameCube and Xbox systems continued to praise the PlayStation s large game library and DVD playback while routinely criticizing the PlayStation s lesser graphics performance compared to the newer systems and its rudimentary online service compared to Xbox Live In CNET rated the console out of calling it a safe bet despite not being the newest or most powerful noting that the console yields in game graphics with more jagged edges CNET also criticized the DVD playback functionality claiming that the console s video quality was passable and that the playback controls were rudimentary recommending users to purchase a remote control The console s two controller ports and the high cost of its memory cards were also a point of criticism br The slim model of the PlayStation received positive reviews for its incredibly small size and built in networking but received criticism for easily overheating due to the exclusion of the original model s built in fan The requirement for a separate power adapter was criticized while the top loading disc drive was noted as being less likely to break compared to the tray loading drive of the original model br br br Sales br Demand for the PlayStation remained strong throughout much of its lifespan selling over million units in Japan by March Over million units were sold worldwide by March In the PlayStation became the fastest game console to reach million units shipped accomplishing the feat within years and months from its launch this was surpassed years later when the Nintendo DS reached million shipments in years and months from its launch By July the system had sold million units worldwide with million of those units sold in PAL regions br By March over million PlayStation units were sold worldwide and in the same year Sony officially stopped supplying updated sales numbers of the system On March Jim Ryan CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment stated on the Official PlayStation Podcast that the PlayStation had sold million units worldwide but this statement has not been confirmed or officially
