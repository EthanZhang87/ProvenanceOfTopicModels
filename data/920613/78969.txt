Pixar Animation Studios known simply as Pixar is an American animation studio based in Emeryville California known for its critically and commercially successful computer animated feature films Since Pixar has been a subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios a division of Disney Entertainment a segment of the Walt Disney Company br Pixar started in as part of the Lucasfilm computer division It was known as the Graphics Group before its spin off as a corporation in with funding from Apple co founder Steve Jobs who became its majority shareholder Disney announced its acquisition of Pixar in January and completed it in May Pixar is best known for its feature films technologically powered by RenderMan the company s own implementation of the industry standard RenderMan Interface Specification image rendering API The studio s mascot is Luxo Jr a desk lamp from the studio s short film of the same name br Pixar has produced feature films starting with Toy Story which is the first fully computer animated feature film its most recent film was Inside Out The studio has also produced many short films As of July its feature films have earned over billion at the worldwide box office with an average gross of million per film Toy Story Finding Dory Incredibles Toy Story and Inside Out all grossed over billion and are among the highest grossing films of all time Moreover of Pixar s films are in the highest grossing animated films of all time br Pixar has earned Academy Awards Golden Globe Awards and Grammy Awards along with numerous other awards and acknowledgments Since its inauguration in eleven Pixar films have won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature including Finding Nemo The Incredibles Ratatouille WALL E Up the aforementioned Toy Story and Toy Story Brave Inside Out Coco and Soul Toy Story and Up were also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture br In February Pixar executives John Lasseter Brad Bird Pete Docter Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich were presented with the Golden Lion award for Lifetime Achievement by the Venice Film Festival The physical award was ceremoniously handed to Lucasfilm s founder George Lucas br br Pixar got its start in when New York Institute of Technology s NYIT founder Alexander Schure who was also the owner of a traditional animation studio established the Computer Graphics Lab CGL and recruited computer scientists who shared his ambitions about creating the world s first computer animated film Edwin Catmull and Malcolm Blanchard were the first to be hired and were soon joined by Alvy Ray Smith and David DiFrancesco some months later which were the four original members of the Computer Graphics Lab located in a converted two story garage acquired from the former Vanderbilt Whitney estate Schure invested significant funds into the computer graphics lab approximately million providing the resources the group needed but contributing to NYIT s financial difficulties Eventually the group realized they needed to work in a real film studio to reach their goal Francis Ford Coppola then invited Smith to his house for a three day media conference where Coppola and George Lucas shared their visions for the future of digital moviemaking br When Lucas approached them and offered them a job at his studio six employees moved to Lucasfilm During the following months they gradually resigned from CGL found temporary jobs for about a year to avoid making Schure suspicious and joined the Graphics Group at Lucasfilm The Graphics Group which was one third of the Computer Division of Lucasfilm was launched in with the hiring of Catmull from NYIT where he was in charge of the Computer Graphics Lab He was then reunited with Smith who also made the journey from NYIT to Lucasfilm and was made the director of the Graphics Group At NYIT the researchers pioneered many of the CG foundation techniques in particular the invention of the alpha channel by Catmull and Smith Over the next several years the CGL would produce a few frames of an experimental film called The Works After moving to Lucasfilm the team worked on creating the precursor to RenderMan called REYES for renders everything you ever saw and developed several critical technologies for CG including particle effects and various animation tools br John Lasseter was hired to the Lucasfilm team for a week in late with the title interface designer he animated the short film The Adventures of Andr Wally B In the next few years a designer suggested naming a new digital compositing computer the Picture Maker Smith suggested that the laser based device have a catchier name and came up with Pixer which after a meeting was changed to Pixar According to Michael Rubin the author of Droidmaker George Lucas and the Digital Revolution Smith and three other employees came up with the name during a restaurant visit in but when interviewing them he got four different versions about the origin of the name br In the Pixar team began working on special effects film sequences with Industrial Light Magic After years of research and key milestones such as the Genesis Effect in Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan and the Stained Glass Knight in Young Sherlock Holmes the group which then numbered individuals was spun out as a corporation in February by Catmull and Smith Among the remaining employees were Malcolm Blanchard David DiFrancesco Ralph Guggenheim and Bill Reeves who had been part of the team since the days of NYIT Tom Duff also an NYIT member would later join Pixar after its formation With Lucas s divorce which coincided with the sudden dropoff in revenues from Star Wars licenses following the release of Return of the Jedi they knew he would most likely sell the whole Graphics Group Worried that the employees would be lost to them if that happened which would prevent the creation of the first computer animated movie they concluded that the best way to keep the team together was to turn the group into an independent company But Moore s Law also suggested that sufficient computing power for the first film was still some years away and they needed to focus on a proper product until then Eventually they decided they should be a hardware company in the meantime with their Pixar Image Computer as the core product a system primarily sold to governmental scientific and medical markets They also used SGI computers br In Nolan Bushnell founded a new computer guided animation studio called Kadabrascope as a subsidiary of his Chuck E Cheese s Pizza Time Theatres company PTT which was founded in Only one major project was made out of the new studio an animated Christmas special for NBC starring Chuck E Cheese and other PTT mascots known as Chuck E Cheese The Christmas That Almost Wasn t The animation movement would be made using tweening instead of traditional cel animation After the video game crash of Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat Sente Technologies another division was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores was sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope was sold to Lucasfilm The Kadabrascope assets were combined with the Computer Division of Lucasfilm Coincidentally one of Steve Jobs s first jobs was under Bushnell in as a technician at his other company Atari which Bushnell sold to Warner Communications in to focus on PTT PTT would later go bankrupt in and be acquired by ShowBiz Pizza Place br br In the newly independent Pixar was headed by President Edwin Catmull and Executive Vice President Alvy Ray Smith Lucas s search for investors led to an offer from Steve Jobs which Lucas initially found too low He eventually accepted after determining it impossible to find other investors At that point Smith and Catmull had been declined by venture capitalists and ten large corporations including a deal with General Motors which fell through three days before signing the contracts Jobs who had been edged out of Apple in was now founder and CEO of the new computer company NeXT On February he paid million of his own money to George Lucas for technology rights and invested million cash as capital into the company joining the board of directors as chairman br In while still at Lucasfilm they had made a deal with the Japanese publisher Shogakukan to make a computer animated movie called Monkey based on the Monkey King The project continued sometime after they became a separate company in but it became clear that the technology was not sufficiently advanced The computers were not powerful enough and the budget would be too high As a result they focused on the computer hardware business for years until a computer animated feature became feasible according to Moore s law br At the time Walt Disney Studios made the decision to develop more efficient ways of producing animation They reached out to Graphics Group at Lucasfilm and to Digital Productions Because of the Graphics Group s deeper understanding of animation and Smith s experience with paint programs at NYIT it convinced Disney they were the right choice In May Pixar signed a contract with Disney who eventually bought and used the Pixar Image Computer and custom software written by Pixar as part of its Computer Animation Production System CAPS project to migrate the laborious ink and paint part of the D animation process to a more automated method The company s first feature film to be released using this new animation method was The Rescuers Down Under br In a bid to drive sales of the system and increase the company s capital Jobs suggested releasing the product to the mainstream market Pixar employee John Lasseter who had long been working on not for profit short demonstration animations such as Luxo Jr to show off the device s capabilities premiered his creations to great fanfare at SIGGRAPH the computer graphics industry s largest convention br However the Image Computer had inadequate sales which threatened to end the company as financial losses grew Jobs increased investment in exchange for an increased stake reducing the proportion of management and employee ownership until eventually his total investment of million gave him control of the entire company In Lasseter s growing animation department which was originally composed of just four people Lasseter Bill Reeves Eben Ostby and Sam Leffler was turned into a division that produced computer animated commercials for outside companies In April Pixar sold its hardware division including all proprietary hardware technology and imaging software to Vicom Systems and transferred of Pixar s approximately employees In the same year Pixar moved from San Rafael to Richmond California Pixar released some of its software tools on the open market for Macintosh and Windows systems RenderMan is one of the leading D packages of the early s and Typestry is a special purpose D text renderer that competed with RayDream br During this period of time Pixar continued its successful relationship with Walt Disney Feature Animation a studio whose corporate parent would ultimately become its most important partner As began however the layoff of employees in the company s computer hardware department including the company s president Chuck Kolstad reduced the total number of employees to just approximately its original number On March Steve Jobs bought the company from its employees and became the full owner He contemplated folding it into NeXT but the NeXT s co founders refused A few months later Pixar made a historic million deal with Disney to produce three computer animated feature films the first of which was Toy Story the product of the technological limitations that challenged CGI By then the software programmers who were doing RenderMan and IceMan and Lasseter s animation department which made television commercials and four Luxo Jr shorts for Sesame Street the same year were all that remained of Pixar br Despite the income from these projects the company still continued to lose money and Steve Jobs as chairman of the board and now owner often considered selling it As late as Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies such as Hallmark Cards Microsoft co founder Paul Allen and Oracle CEO and co founder Larry Ellison After learning from New York critics that Toy Story would probably be a hit and confirming that Disney would distribute it for the Christmas season he decided to give Pixar another chance Also for the first time he took an active leadership role in the company and made himself CEO Toy Story grossed more than million worldwide and when Pixar held its initial public offering on November it exceeded Netscape s as the biggest IPO of the year In its first half hour of trading Pixar stock shot from to delaying trading because of unmatched buy orders Shares climbed to US and closed the day at br The company continued to make the television commercials during the production of Toy Story which came to an end on July when Pixar announced they would shut down its television commercial unit which counted employees to focus on longer projects and interactive entertainment br During the s and s Pixar gradually developed the Pixar Braintrust the studio s primary creative development process in which all of its directors writers and lead storyboard artists regularly examine each other s projects and give very candid notes the industry term for constructive criticism The Braintrust operates under a philosophy of a filmmaker driven studio in which creatives help each other move their films forward through a process somewhat like peer review as opposed to the traditional Hollywood approach of an executive driven studio in which directors are micromanaged through mandatory notes from development executives outranking the producers According to Catmull it evolved out of the working relationship between Lasseter Andrew Stanton Pete Docter Lee Unkrich and Joe Ranft on Toy Story br As a result of the success of Toy Story Pixar built a new studio at the Emeryville campus which was designed by PWP Landscape Architecture and opened in November br br Pixar and Disney had disagreements over the production of Toy Story Originally intended as a direct to video release and thus not part of Pixar s three picture deal the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three picture agreement but Disney refused Though profitable for both Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable Pixar was responsible for creation and production while Disney handled marketing and distribution Profits and production costs were split equally but Disney exclusively owned all story character and sequel rights and also collected a to percent distribution fee br The two companies attempted to reach a new agreement for ten months and failed on January July April January July and January The proposed distribution deal meant Pixar would control production and own the resulting story character and sequel rights while Disney would own the right of first refusal to distribute any sequels Pixar also wanted to finance its own films and collect percent profit paying Disney the to percent distribution fee In addition as part of any distribution agreement with Disney Pixar demanded control over films already in production under the old agreement including The Incredibles and Cars Disney considered these conditions unacceptable but Pixar would not concede br Disagreements between Steve Jobs and Disney chairman and CEO Michael Eisner caused the negotiations to cease in with Disney forming Circle Seven Animation and Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney Despite this announcement and several talks with Warner Bros Sony Pictures and th Century Fox Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors although a Warner Bros spokesperson told CNN We would love to be in business with Pixar They are a great company After a lengthy hiatus negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney Jobs announced in late that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney dictated November time frame but during the more lucrative early summer months This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for its major releases during the Christmas shopping season An added benefit of delaying Cars from November to June was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar Disney contract to see how things would play out between the two companies br Pending the Disney acquisition of Pixar the two companies created a distribution deal for the intended release of Ratatouille to ensure that if the acquisition failed this one film would be released through Disney s distribution channels In contrast to the earlier Pixar deal Ratatouille was meant to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received a distribution fee The completion of Disney s Pixar acquisition however nullified this distribution arrangement br br After extended negotiations Disney ultimately agreed on January to buy Pixar for approximately billion in an all stock deal Following Pixar shareholder approval the acquisition was completed on May The transaction catapulted Jobs who owned of total share interest in Pixar to Disney s largest individual shareholder with valued at billion and a new seat on its board of directors Jobs new Disney holdings exceeded holdings belonging to Eisner the previous top shareholder who still held and Disney Director Emeritus Roy E Disney who held almost of the corporation s shares Pixar shareholders received shares of Disney common stock for each share of Pixar common stock redeemed br As part of the deal John Lasseter by then Executive Vice President became Chief Creative Officer reporting directly to president and CEO Bob Iger and consulting with Disney Director Roy E Disney of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios including its division Disneytoon Studios as well as the Principal Creative Adviser at Walt Disney Imagineering which designs and builds the company s theme parks Catmull retained his position as President of Pixar while also becoming President of Walt Disney Animation Studios reporting to Iger and Dick Cook chairman of the Walt Disney Studios Jobs s position as Pixar s chairman and chief executive officer was abolished and instead he took a place on the Disney board of directors br After the deal closed in May Lasseter revealed that Iger had felt that Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade at the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland in September Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters in the parade none were characters that Disney had created within the last ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar Upon returning to Burbank Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade then presented that information to the board of directors at his first board meeting after being promoted from COO to CEO and the board in turn authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer for the rights to ABC shows for the fifth generation iPod Classic and in turn Iger convinced them of the sincerity of his feeling that Disney needed to re focus on animation br br Lasseter and Catmull s oversight of both the Disney Feature Animation and Pixar studios did not mean that the two studios were merging however In fact additional conditions were laid out as part of the deal to ensure that Pixar remained a separate entity a concern that analysts had expressed about the Disney deal Some of those conditions were that Pixar HR policies would remain intact including the lack of employment contracts Also the Pixar name was guaranteed to continue and the studio would remain in its current Emeryville California location with the Pixar sign Finally branding of films made post merger would be Disney Pixar beginning with Cars br Jim Morris producer of WALL E became general manager of Pixar In this new position Morris took charge of the day to day running of the studio facilities and products br After a few years Lasseter and Catmull were able to successfully transfer the basic principles of the Pixar Braintrust to Disney Animation although meetings of the Disney Story Trust are reportedly more polite than those of the Pixar Braintrust Catmull later explained that after the merger to maintain the studios separate identities and cultures notwithstanding the fact of common ownership and common senior management he and Lasseter drew a hard line that each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and would not be allowed to borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other The rule ensures that each studio maintains local ownership of projects and can be proud of its own work Thus for example when Pixar had issues with Ratatouille and Disney Animation had issues with Bolt nobody bailed them out and each studio was required to solve the problem on its own despite knowing that there were personnel at the other studio who theoretically could have helped br br On April Pixar opened Pixar Canada in the downtown area of Vancouver British Columbia Canada The roughly square meters studio produced seven short films based on Toy Story and Cars characters In October the studio was closed down to refocus Pixar s efforts at its main headquarters br In November Morris was promoted to president of Pixar while his counterpart at Disney Animation general manager Andrew Millstein was also promoted to president of that studio Both continued to report to Catmull who retained the title of president of both Disney Animation and Pixar br On November Lasseter announced that he was taking a six month leave of absence after acknowledging what he called missteps in his behavior with employees in a memo to staff According to The Hollywood Reporter and The Washington Post Lasseter had a history of alleged sexual misconduct towards employees On June it was announced that Lasseter would leave Disney Animation and Pixar at the end of the year but would take on a consulting role until then Pete Docter was announced as Lasseter s replacement as chief creative officer of Pixar on June br br On June Incredibles was released setting a record for widest opening weekend worldwide and domestic for an animated film The film would eventually gross billion worldwide On October it was announced that Catmull would be retiring He stayed in an adviser role until July On January it was announced that Lee Unkrich would be leaving Pixar after years On June Toy Story was released surpassing the widest opening worldwide weekend record that Incredibles set The film would make over billion and win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature During the D Expo Pixar announced that their next film Soul would release in Ahead of the launch of Disney Pixar debuted SparkShorts experimental shorts done by Pixar staff br br Pixar released Onward on March However due to the start of the COVID pandemic the film underperformed at the box office and was released onto rental digital services on March and later on Disney on April Due to the pandemic Soul was moved to November and ultimately released on December on Disney at no additional cost to subscribers and later became the first animated streaming film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Pixar s next two features Luca and Turning Red were also released free on Disney in June and March respectively In several Pixar employees anonymously criticized Disney s decision to release their films direct to Disney br Lightyear Pixar s first movie to return to theaters was released in June However the film became a box office failure with Deadline Hollywood calculating the film lost the studio million when factoring together all expenses and revenues In September Jonas Rivera was promoted to Executive VP of Film Production at Pixar overseeing all film and streaming production In December Disney CEO Bob Iger noted that they would rely more on the Pixar brand In June Disney laid off employees including Angus MacLane director of Lightyear and Galyn Susman the film s producer br During that same month Elemental was released During the film s opening weekend Docter stated that Pixar trained audiences that these films will be available for you on Disney Despite opening below projections Elemental ultimately made a box office comeback by early August crossing million at the worldwide box office Disney s EVP of Theatrical Distribution Tony Chambers stated After a disappointing opening weekend we re really pleased that audiences have discovered what a great movie it is That same month Jim Morris said at the box office we re looking at now the film should do better than break even theatrically And then we have revenue from streaming theme parks and consumer products This will certainly be a profitable film for the Disney company In December it was announced that Soul Turning Red and Luca would be released in theaters in the United States in the first quarter of br In January it was reported that Pixar s staff would face imminent layoffs by percent reducing the studio s workforce to less than employees However the layoffs were then delayed and did not occur reportedly because of production schedules In May the studio proceeded with slightly smaller layoffs employees or approximately percent of the studio s workforce of over employees The layoffs occurred as the studio began to rely less on direct to streaming series and more on feature films intended primarily for theatrical exhibition br On June of the same year Inside Out was released and became financially successful The film had a domestic opening of million the third highest for an animated film and the biggest global opening for an animated movie with million Since then the film broke multiple box office records It had the highest second weekend gross for an animated film with million being the first to reach the digit second opening weekend It reached billion at the global box office in days and went to out gross Incredibles to become the highest grossing Pixar film globally br br When Steve Jobs chief executive officer of Apple Inc and Pixar and John Lasseter then executive vice president of Pixar decided to move their studios from a leased space in Point Richmond California to larger quarters of their own they chose a acre site in Emeryville California formerly occupied by Del Monte Foods Inc The first of several buildings the high tech structure designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson has special foundations and electricity generators to ensure continued film production even through major earthquakes The character of the building is intended to abstractly recall Emeryville s industrial past The two story steel and masonry building is a collaborative space with many pathways br The digital revolution in filmmaking was driven by applied mathematics including computational physics and geometry In this led Pixar senior scientist Tony DeRose to offer to host the second Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at the Emeryville campus br br Some of Pixar s first animators were former cel animators including John Lasseter and others came from computer animation or were fresh college graduates A large number of animators that make up its animation department had been hired around the releases of A Bug s Life Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo The success of Toy Story made Pixar the first major computer animation studio to successfully produce theatrical feature films The majority of the animation industry was and still is located in Los Angeles and Pixar is located miles km north in the San Francisco Bay Area Traditional hand drawn animation was still the dominant medium for feature animated films br With the scarcity of Los Angeles based animators willing to move their families so far north to give up traditional animation and try computer animation Pixar s new hires at this time either came directly from college or had worked outside feature animation For those who had traditional animation skills the Pixar animation software Marionette was designed so that traditional animators would require a minimum amount of training before becoming productive br In a interview with PBS talk show host Tavis Smiley Lasseter said that Pixar s films follow the same theme of self improvement as the company itself has with the help of friends or family a character ventures out into the real world and learns to appreciate his friends and family At the core Lasseter said it s gotta be about the growth of the main character and how he changes br Actor John Ratzenberger who had previously starred in the television series Cheers has voiced a character in every Pixar feature film from Toy Story through Onward A non speaking background character in Soul bears his likeness Pixar paid tribute to Ratzenberger in the end credits of Cars by parodying scenes from three of its earlier films Toy Story Monsters Inc and A Bug s Life replacing all of the characters with motor vehicle versions of them and giving each film an automotive based title After the third scene Mack his character in Cars realizes that the same actor has been voicing characters in every film br Due to the traditions that have occurred within the films and shorts such as anthropomorphic creatures and objects and easter egg crossovers between films and shorts that have been spotted by Pixar fans a blog post titled The Pixar Theory was published in by Jon Negroni and popularized by the YouTube channel Super Carlin Brothers proposing that all of the characters within the Pixar universe were related surrounding Boo from Monsters Inc and the Witch from Brave br Additionally Pixar is known for their films having expensive budgets ranging from million Some of these films include Ratatouille Toy Story Toy Story Incredibles The Good Dinosaur the aforementioned Onward and Soul Turning Red Lightyear both and Elemental In a interview Pixar s president Jim Morris stated that one of the reasons why their films have expensive budgets is because they are produced entirely in the U S with all of the artists under one roof while almost all of their competitors keep costs down by doing work offshore br br As of September six Pixar films have received or will receive sequels or prequels These films are Toy Story Cars Monsters Inc Finding Nemo The Incredibles and Inside Out br Toy Story was originally commissioned by Disney as a minute direct to video film Expressing doubts about the strength of the material John Lasseter convinced the Pixar team to start from scratch and make the sequel their third full length feature film br Following the release of Toy Story in Pixar and Disney had a gentlemen s agreement that Disney would not make any sequels without Pixar s involvement though retaining a right to do so After the two companies were unable to agree on a new deal Disney announced in they would plan to move forward on sequels with or without Pixar and put Toy Story into pre production at Disney s then new CGI division Circle Seven Animation However when Lasseter was placed in charge of all Disney and Pixar animation following Disney s acquisition of Pixar in he put all sequels on hold and Toy Story was canceled In May it was announced that Toy Story was back in pre production with a new plot and under Pixar s control The film was released on June as Pixar s eleventh feature film br Shortly after announcing the resurrection of Toy Story Lasseter stated If we have a great story we ll do a sequel Cars Pixar s first non Toy Story sequel was officially announced in April and released on June as their twelfth Monsters University a prequel to Monsters Inc was announced in April and initially set for release in November the release date was pushed to June due to Pixar s past success with summer releases according to a Disney executive br In June Tom Hanks who voiced Woody in the Toy Story series implied that
