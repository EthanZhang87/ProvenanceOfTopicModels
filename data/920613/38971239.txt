Moore said that there were already ideas for a sequel and in March Moore said that he and Disney had ideas about a sequel that would bring the characters up to date and explore online gaming and console gaming Moore stated that many of the crew and voice cast were open to the sequel believing that they have barely scratched the surface of the video game world they envisioned He also stated that he planned to include Tron in the sequel which appears briefly in the film where Ralph and Vanellope race at the beginning In the first film s composer Henry Jackman said that a story for the sequel was being written br In March Moore stated that a sequel was still being planned In June Walt Disney Animation Studios announced that the sequel would be released on March with Moore and Phil Johnston attached and that its story would be one where Ralph leaves the arcade and wrecks the Internet br In March the sequel s title was officially announced as Ralph Breaks the Internet Wreck It Ralph with Moore returning as director joined by the first film s co writer Johnston and Clark Spencer also returning as producer In July Disney removed Wreck It Ralph from the film s title br br Two working versions of the script had been scrapped before settling on the one used for the film according to head writer Josie Trinidad In one version Vanellope had become self absorbed by the Internet gaining popularity and becoming a celebrity among the users Ralph had been thrown in jail where he met the search engine Knowsmore and they had partnered together to escape prison and help bring Vanellope back to her normal self A second version had Ralph becoming an Internet famous celebrity and would have been challenged by an anti virus program named BEV that served as a super cop and would have been the story s villain Trinidad said neither of these versions captured what they felt was the centerpiece of the sequel being how Ralph and Vanellope reacted to the new world of the Internet and realizing they have separate paths going forward br Producer Clark Spencer said that the film is about change Two best friends are about to realize that the world won t always be the same The internet is the perfect setting really because it s all about change things change by the second Director of story Jim Reardon said that it was intimidating to set the film on the Internet stating that They looked at how they could make the internet relatable on a human level like how Game Central Station aka the power strip mirrored a train station in the first movie Reardon however said that Disney didn t want to make the movie about the internet instead focus on Ralph and Vanellope s friendship and to treat the Internet as the place where the movie takes place Josie Trinidad claimed that the filmmakers didn t want to just give the audience more of that friendship people had to see that relationship grow br The designs of scenes within the Internet were based on tours made of One Wilshire in Los Angeles as it is one of the world s largest telecommunications centers The filmmakers did not approach any of the companies outside of Disney that are represented on the Internet and strove to include net branding from all across the world They also had to explore various Internet memes making sure to avoid those that lacked long term presence on the Internet While the film addresses many positive elements of the Internet the filmmakers did not want to shy away from covering some of the more unpleasant aspects about it in part fueled by the success of tackling racism indirectly within Zootopia They wanted to follow the same approach as they had with Judy Hopps in Zootopia where she experienced learned and overcame the racism aspects and have Ralph similarly learn and become a better person without having to actually solve the issue of hostility on the Internet br The scene where Vanellope is introduced to the Disney Princesses came from screenwriter Pamela Ribon In Ribon was still working on Moana when Disney began internally pitching ideas for the sequel to Wreck It Ralph Ribon recognized that like the title character of Moana Vanellope fits the definition of a Disney Princess When work formally began on the sequel after the completion of Zootopia Ribon pitched the idea of Disney poking fun at itself by having Vanellope meet the other Disney Princesses in the green room of OhMyDisney com the Disney fan driven website Further inspiration came from a BuzzFeed online quiz that asked which Disney Princess the user was Moore thought it would be interesting if Ralph had encountered that quiz and ended up in an argument with Vanellope over the result The script was written by Ribon which she wanted to include the various tropes of the Princesses with them making in the final cut for the film Moore and Johnston were satisfied with the script br br In July John C Reilly said he had signed on to reprise his role of Ralph in a projected sequel In March Jane Lynch Jack McBrayer and Sarah Silverman were reported as being set to reprise their roles In December Alan Tudyk confirmed his return in the sequel as a different character named KnowsMore after previously voicing King Candy in the first film During production Moore invited film composer Michael Giacchino to reprise his role as the Stormtrooper FN from Star Wars The Force Awakens in the film In August actress Gal Gadot joined the cast as Shank The production team on the film was able to secure all the Disney Princesses original voice actresses except for Adriana Caselotti as Snow White Ilene Woods as Cinderella and Mary Costa as Aurora due to the formers having both died in and respectively while the latter retired from acting in Jennifer Hale and Kate Higgins the current voice actresses for Cinderella and Aurora were hired for the film Pamela Ribon the film s co screenwriter performed Snow White s voice for temporary tracks but the team considered it a good substitute allowing Ribon to voice her in the final film br br The film contains over unique sets and assets and includes the highest number of characters in any Disney Animation film with individual characters with variants One of the Disney animators who helped out to bring the Disney Princesses into CGI animation was Mark Henn who was also the original supervising animator of princesses Ariel Belle Jasmine Mulan and Tiana Henn also served as the supervising animator for the film s background hand drawn animated characters Animators had to work out various techniques to take the different styles of animation into a single approach and figure out the proportions of the characters using official figurines Unlike their original film counterparts the Disney Princesses in the film were rendered in a more cartoony style with bigger eyes and ears br In the initial trailer for the film the African American princess character Tiana appeared to have a lighter skin tone a narrower nose and more European features than she did in the film The Princess and the Frog This led to some backlashes on social media as these drew her appearance away from that expected of African Americans As a result Disney contacted Tiana s voice actress Anika Noni Rose and the advocacy group Color of Change to redesign Tiana for Ralph Breaks the Internet to make sure she resembles more closely to her appearance the updated character model was revealed in the second trailer The same treatment was given to Pocahontas the titular character of the film as many viewers had pointed out that she was also given a much lighter skin tone br A scene featured in the film s original teaser released in March involving Ralph and Vanellope invading a children s game and feeding pancakes to a bunny to the point that it is implied to explode was heavily discussed prior to the film s release however the scene was eventually cut from the film and instead placed halfway through the credits with the addition of a meta conversation where one of the characters alludes to having just watched a movie where a scene from the trailer was missing The post credits scene involves what starts as a teaser for Frozen II but cuts to Ralph rickrolling the audience by starting to sing Rick Astley s Never Gonna Give You Up While producers Spencer and Moore had an idea of Ralph doing a Wreck Roll early on in the film s development they never incorporated it into the story As it was one of the last scenes added the producers had gotten Reilly who was on vacation with his family at the time to come into a New York City studio to record for the day so that the animators could work from that br br On September Imagine Dragons released the lead single from the soundtrack titled Zero which plays during the end credits of the film On October the music video of Zero was posted on Imagine Dragons YouTube channel The film features an original song called A Place Called Slaughter Race performed by Sarah Silverman and Gal Gadot written by Tom MacDougall and the film s co director Phil Johnston and composed by Alan Menken the song s pop version In This Place was performed by Julia Michaels The film also features songs from various Disney Princess films as well as Demi Lovato s cover of Let it Go played in the beginning of the Oh My Disney scene Ralph also rickrolls the tune
