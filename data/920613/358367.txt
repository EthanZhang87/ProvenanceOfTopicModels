rights to the short story Pete s Dragon and the U S A Forever After that was written by Seton I Miller and S S Field in which Miller was hired to write the script Impressed with his performance in Old Yeller Walt Disney had child actor Kevin Corcoran in mind to star in the project as a feature length film However Disney considered the project to be more appropriate for his Disneyland anthology program by which it was slated to be filmed as a two part episode in the following year In February Variety reported that filming was scheduled to begin in October By the following spring veteran screenwriter Noel Langley had completed his draft of the script However Disney was still unsure of how to approach the project and the project was placed in turnaround br In writers Bill Raynor and Myles Wilder were hired to write the script and completed their outline in October They submitted their outline to the studio for review but the project continued to languish in development In producer Jerome Courtland re discovered the project and hired writer Malcolm Marmorstein to write the script For his script Marmorstein revised the story from being in contemporary time into a period setting and had the dragon changed from being wholly imaginary into a real one In earlier drafts Elliott was mostly invisible aside from one animated sequence in which Dr Terminus would chop up the dragon for his get rich scheme However veteran Disney artist Ken Anderson felt the audience would lose patience with the idea and lobbied for Elliott to be seen more in his visible form during the film In retrospect Marmorstein conceded that We tried a completely invisible dragon but it was no fun It was lacking It s a visual medium and you re making a film for kids He also named the dragon Elliott after actor Elliott Gould who was a friend from his theater days and named the town Passamaquoddy after the real Native American tribe in Maine br In October the songwriting duo of Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn were assigned to compose the musical score The production was directed by British filmmaker Don Chaffey who had made two smaller films for Disney in the early s between directing larger fantasy adventures Jason and the Argonauts One Million Years B C for others br br br Locations br The lighthouse for the film was built on Point Buchon Trail in Montana De Oro State Park located south of Los Osos California substituting for Maine It was equipped with such a large beacon that Disney had to get special permission from the Coast Guard to operate it since doing so during filming would have confused passing ships Pacific Gas and Electric opened the Point Buchon Trail and allows hikers access to where filming took place N W br br br Animation br The film is the first involving animation in which none of the Nine Old Men Disney s original team of animators were involved One technique used in the movie involved compositing with a yellowscreen that was originally used in Mary Poppins and similar to today s greenscreen compositing whereby up to three scenes might be overlaid together for example a live foreground a live background and an animated middle ground containing Elliott Ken Anderson who created Elliott explained that he thought it would be appropriate to make him a little paunchy and not always particularly graceful at flying Don Hahn who was an assistant director to Don Bluth on Pete s Dragon gained some experience working with a combination of live action and animation before later going on to work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit br br br Release br Pete s Dragon premiered on November at the Radio City Music Hall in which the film ran minutes For its general release it was edited down to minutes It was later re released on March shortened from minutes to minutes The film s movie poster was painted by artist Paul Wenzel br br br Soundtrack br A soundtrack recording Disneyland was released that told much of the story and added a narrator but unlike many other Disney book and records used the actual dialogue recorded for the film which the book presented in script format The inclusion of story led to the omission of several songs including The Happiest Home in These Hills There s Room for Everyone and Bill of Sale while Brazzle Dazzle Day is included only in instrumental br br br Home media br The film was released on VHS in early It was re released on VHS on October as a part of Masterpiece Collection It was originally slated to be released in the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection line up on December but it was pushed back to January The DVD includes bonus features such as two animated shorts Lighthouse Keeping and Man Monsters and Mysteries two vintage excerpts from the Disney Family Album episode on Ken

documentary feature a deleted storyboard sequence original demo recordings of the songs and several bonus features transferred from the Gold Classic Collection release It was released on the th anniversary edition Blu ray on October br br br Reception br br br Critical reaction br Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the film declaring it the most energetic and enjoyable Disney movie in a long while She noted Sean Marshall doesn t sing well but Helen Reddy does so she often accompanies his vocals Miss Reddy is serviceable but undistinguished as an actress she has a tendency to behave as if she were a very bright light bulb in a very small lamp but she so often finds herself in the company of Messrs Rooney Dale or Buttons that her scenes work well However she was critical of the film s length and the excessive alcohol consumption br Kathleen Carroll of the New York Daily News gave the film three stars out of four criticizing the score and the live action footage but praising the animation of the dragon and the performances writing Sean Marshall as Pete looks and acts natural on camera which makes him a refreshing change from those sweet little cherubs usually cast in Disney movies Miss Reddy plays her role with crisp efficiency and fortunately receives strong support for the rest of the cast particularly Dale so slick and funny as the conniving medicine man he nearly upstages the cuddly dragon br Variety wrote the film was an enchanting and humane fable which introduces a most lovable animal star albeit an animated one They praised the combination of live action and animation as never before more effectively realized and commented that the film suffered whenever Elliott is off screen br John Skow of Time wrote the film was likeable fantasy but dismissed the musical numbers as a good opportunity to line up for more popcorn br Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote At hours minutes it is a trying span for small sitters The animated excitements keep stopping for songs by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn but they are not showstoppers in the grand sense Bland perfunctory and too numerous is more like it br Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that we get the same tired Disney formula a gooey faced kid in a phony sound stage world populated by old actors required to perform ancient vaudeville routines Compared to the great Disney animation classics Pete s Dragon is just TV fare on the wide screen br Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that the film was apparently meant to be a big rousing musical comedy fantasy but it s staged and photographed without musical comedy energy flair or coordination Perhaps children can be counted on to enjoy Elliott s mugging and the slapstick interludes that occasionally interrupt the tedium but parents will see this one more as a chore br Critic Leonard Maltin observed that Disney made several attempts to recreate the appeal and success of Mary Poppins and that Pete s Dragon did not come close on that score However he added that it might please children and that the animated title character is so endearing that it almost compensates for the live actors tiresome mugging br Thomas J Harris in his book Children s Live Action Musical Films A Critical Survey and Filmography heavily criticized the story as well as the compositing of the animated Elliott he also found the Mary Poppinsish ending to be thoroughly unmotivated because Pete s life before meeting Elliott is never fleshed out br In Elliott was ranked fifth on a top list of movie dragons by Karl Heitmueller for MTV Movie News br On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The site s consensus states Boring and slow this is a lesser Disney work though the animation isn t without its charms Metacritic gave film a score of based on reviews indicating mixed or average reviews br br br Box office br During its initial release the film grossed million in distributor rentals from the United States and Canada which was ranked sixteenth on Variety s box office hits list of However the returns were considered disappointing for Disney who were hoping for a Mary Poppins sized blockbuster The film has a lifetime domestic gross ranging from to million br br br Awards and honors br br br Remake br br In March Disney announced a remake of the film written by David Lowery and Toby Halbrooks the director writer and co producer respectively of the Sundance hit Ain t Them Bodies Saints The film is a live action movie instead of an animated movie It re imagines a venerable Disney family and is presented as a straightforward drama as opposed to a musical Principal photography commenced in January in New Zealand with Lowery directing and subsequently released on August br br br br br br Bibliography br Koenig David Mouse Under Glass Secrets of Disney Animation
