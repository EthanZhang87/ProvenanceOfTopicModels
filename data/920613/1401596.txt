The Hours of Le Mans French Heures du Mans is an endurance focused sports car race held annually near the town of Le Mans France It is widely considered to be one of the world s most prestigious races and is one of the races along with the Monaco Grand Prix and Indianapolis that form the Triple Crown of Motorsport and is also one of the races alongside the Hours of Daytona and Hours of Sebring that make up the informal Triple Crown of endurance racing Run since it is the oldest active endurance racing event in the world br Unlike fixed distance races whose winner is determined by minimum time the Hours of Le Mans is won by the car that covers the greatest distance in hours The cars on this track are able to achieve speeds of km h mph and reached km h mph on the Mulsanne Straight in instigating the addition of more chicanes to the track to reduce speed reached Racing teams must balance the demands of speed with the cars ability to run for hours without mechanical failure The race is organized by the Automobile Club de l Ouest ACO It is held on the Circuit de la Sarthe composed of closed public roads and dedicated sections of a racing track br The Hours of Le Mans was frequently part of the World Sportscar Championship from until that series final season in In it was a part of the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup Since the race has been a part of the FIA World Endurance Championship In the World Endurance Championship s super season of May to June the Hours of Le Mans was both the second and the last round of the season br br br Purpose br br Launched when Grand Prix motor racing was the dominant form of motorsport throughout Europe Le Mans was designed to present a different test Instead of focusing on the ability of a car company to build the fastest machines the Hours of Le Mans would concentrate on the ability of manufacturers to build sporty yet reliable cars This encouraged innovation in producing reliable and fuel efficient vehicles because endurance racing requires cars that last and spend as little time in the pits as possible br At the same time the layout of the track required cars with better aerodynamics and stability at high speeds While this was shared with Grand Prix racing few tracks in Europe had straights of a length comparable to the Mulsanne Additionally because the road is public and thus not as meticulously maintained as permanent racing circuits racing puts more strain on the parts increasing the importance of reliability br The oil crisis in the early s led organizers to adopt a fuel economy formula known as Group C that limited the amount of fuel each car was allowed Although it was later abandoned fuel economy remains important as new fuel sources reduce the time spent during pit stops Such technological innovations have had a trickle down effect and can be incorporated into consumer cars This has also led to faster and more exotic supercars as manufacturers seek to develop faster road cars in order to develop them into even faster GT cars br Additionally hybrid systems flywheel super capacitor battery coupled with both petrol and diesel have been championed in the LMP category as rules have been changed to their benefit and to further push efficiency br br br Race br br The race is held in mid June meaning the shortest night and very hot conditions for drivers particularly in closed vehicles with poor ventilation Rainy weather is common The race begins in mid afternoon and finishes the following day at the same hour the race started the previous day br Modern competitors often cover well over km The record is s km mi six times the length of the Indianapolis or about times longer than a Formula One Grand Prix Drivers and racing teams strive for speed and avoiding mechanical damage as well as managing the cars consumables primarily fuel tires and braking materials It also tests endurance with drivers frequently racing for over two hours before a relief driver can take over during a pit stop while eating and resting Current regulations mandate that three drivers share each competing vehicle br Competing teams race in groups called classes or cars of similar specification while competing simultaneously for outright placing amongst all classes Originally the race showcased cars as they were sold to the general public then called Sports Cars in contrast with the specialised racing cars used in Grand Prix motor racing Over time the competing vehicles evolved away from their publicly available road car roots Today the race comprises two classes prototypes and Grand Touring cars similar to sports cars sold to the public These are further broken down into two sub classes constructors prototypes privateer prototypes and two subclasses of GT cars br br Competing teams have had a wide variety of organizations ranging from competition departments of road car manufacturers eager to prove the supremacy of their products to professional motor racing teams representing their commercial backers some of which are also car manufacturers who want to win without paying for their own teams to amateur teams racing as much to compete in the famous race as to claim victory for their commercial partners br br The race was the part of the World Sportscar Championship in every season from its inception in except the and seasons However Le Mans has always had a stronger reputation than the World Championship and is a round of the FIA World Endurance Championship The race is also known as a leg of the informal Triple Crown of Motorsport which links Formula One IndyCar and sports car racing to represent a career achievement for drivers Additionally it is seen as a leg of the Triple Crown of endurance racing which links the three largest sports car races together with Hours of Sebring and Hours of Daytona forming the other legs Since the American Le Mans Series now the IMSA Weathertech Sports Car Championship has held an endurance race along with the hours of Sebring every year called Petit Le Mans as a hour American version In the Weathertech Sports Car Championship a merger of the races at Sebring Petit Le Mans in Braselton Georgia the Hours of Watkins Glen in Watkins Glen New York and the Rolex Sports Car Series Hours of Daytona held all four major American endurance classics in preparation for teams to race at Le Mans br br br Cars br br The race has approximately competitors Each car was required to have at least two seats However recently cars only need to have space to accommodate a second seat in the cockpit rather than the seat itself Two doors are allowed open cockpit cars do not require doors Since all cars in the premier LMP category must have a roof due to safety concerns with open cockpit cars only permitted in the slightly slower LMP category Since all prototype cars LMP or LMP must have closed cockpits br Although all cars compete at the same time as of there are separate classes A prize is awarded to the winner of each class and the overall winner The number of classes has varied over the years but there are now three HYPERCAR LMP and LMGT br Successor to the Le Mans Prototype LMP is the custom built HYPERCAR LMH or LMDh class It is the top class and debuted in The new technical regulations are intended to prevent cost escalations while enabling greater variety in technical approaches and car aesthetics br This is followed by the LMP class where teams are obliged to run one of four approved chassis ORECA Ligier Dallara or Multimatic Riley mated with a standard litre Gibson V engine LMP teams are subject to no such restrictions Their extra power lower weight and more complex aerodynamics result in much quicker lap times LMP cars also may use hybrid technology br The next class is LMGT which are similar to production based sports cars br br br Garage br Concept cars intended to test new automotive technologies may participate in the race under the Garage banner Such entries are classified in the race results though are not expected to be competitive as their sole focus is to demonstrate experimental features br The program debuted in with the DeltaWing an unusual rocket shaped car fielded by All American Racers and supported by Nissan The DeltaWing concept showed promise delivering nearly LMP level performance while only consuming of the fuel but retired after a collision with an LMP car six hours into the race br In Garage was given to the Swiss designed hydrogen fueled GreenGT H which was to be the first car without an internal combustion engine to compete at Le Mans However the car was pronounced unfit to take part in the race by the team a few days before the race In the H went on to complete a single demonstration lap at Le Mans br The Nissan ZEOD RC a hybrid electric car based on the DeltaWing s design took the Garage slot in Despite an early retirement from the race after only minutes due to a gearbox issue the ZEOD RC achieved its goals of hitting a top speed of km mi and completing the first ever lap of Le Mans using exclusively electric power at racing speed br In the Garage program took a break as all applications that year were deemed unfit by the ACO br Frederic Sausset a quadruple amputee drove a modified Morgan LMP in the race br Financial problems forced Welter Racing to cancel its Garage run with the Green U Panoz Racing GT EV a biomethane fuel prototype featuring a cylinder liter engine fueled by biomethane stored in cryogenic tanks Welter Racing went on to develop the car with hopes of entering the car in and but ultimately did not compete due to complex issues with the car in and due to Don Panoz s death suspending the program in The slot was also eyed by UK based constructor Perrinn with the Project an LMP based electric powered car with an autonomous driving mode however this did not come to pass and Garage was left empty in both and due to the ACO deeming none of the applications sufficiently mature br saw Frederic Sausset attempting to return to Garage under the SRT banner by fielding a specially modified Oreca LMP car with a lineup of three disabled drivers however the attempt was cancelled due to the COVID pandemic The SRT program was delayed to which saw Garage successfully making a return for the first time in five years Two of the drivers paralyzed from the waist down became the first disabled teammates to compete in the history of the race br In Garage was once again empty br For a modified NASCAR Cup Series Next Gen Chevrolet Camaro ZL stock car fielded by Hendrick Motorsports was the Garage entry with seven times Cup champion Jimmie Johnson Formula One world champion and NASCAR driver Jenson Button and Le Mans overall and LMP winner Mike Rockenfeller driving the car The car marked NASCAR s th anniversary which coincided with the race s centenary br Chad Knaus Johnson s crew chief during each of his Cup Series championships was project manager while the car bore in honor of Jeff Gordon br br br Drivers br br Initially there were no rules on the number of car drivers or how long they could drive Although almost all teams used two drivers in the early decades some Le Mans drivers such as Pierre Levegh and Eddie Hall attempted to run the race solo hoping to save time by not having to change drivers This practice was later banned Until the s there were teams in which only two drivers competed but by the end of the decade the rules were changed to stipulate that at least three drivers must drive each car br By the s due to the speeds of the cars and the strain it puts on drivers additional rules to reduce driver fatigue mandated that drivers could not drive for over minutes over hours and that no one driver could run for over hours total With careful management of driver stints this makes it possible to complete the race with only two drivers as Jeroen Bleekemolen and Cooper MacNeil did in although the vast majority of teams still continue to use three drivers br In the driving time rules were further changed If necessary officials may require a drive time limit of minutes of consecutive time behind the wheel and a minimum minute rest break The rule applies only if the air temperature is at least C F br br br Traditions and unique rules br br Although it has been a part of the World Sportscar Championship for most of its existence the race has had different regulations for safety and competition reasons partly due to its length For many decades cars had to run at least an hour into the race before they could refill fluids for the car such as oil or coolant except for fuel This was an attempt by the ACO to help increase efficiency and reliability Those who could not last the first hour without replacing lost fluids risked disqualification br Another rule unique to Le Mans is that cars must be switched off while refueling in the pits Not only is this safer and less of a fire hazard but it is also another test of reliability as cars with the guaranteed ability to restart many times under race conditions are harder to make Another element of this rule is that mechanics are not allowed to work on the car while it is being refuelled other than helping a driver in or out of the car which has led teams to adapt innovative ways to decrease the time of these lengthy pit stops Drivers can get out of the car and be replaced by another driver during refuelling Those rules are also applied in the FIA World Endurance Championship br There are various long standing traditions at Le Mans including the waving of the French tricolor to start the race This is usually followed by a fly over featuring jets trailing blue white and red smoke A similar flag tradition is track marshals waving safety flags during the race s final lap congratulating the winners and other finishers br Le Mans was the venue for the first televised instance of a winning driver celebrating by spraying champagne instead of drinking it When Dan Gurney won the race with co driver A J Foyt the two drivers mounted the victory podium and Gurney was handed a magnum of champagne Looking down he saw Ford CEO Henry Ford II team owner Carroll Shelby and their wives as well as several journalists who had predicted disaster for the high profile duo Gurney shook the bottle and sprayed everyone nearby Gurney autographed and gave the bottle of champagne to Life photographer Flip Schulke who used it as a lamp for years before returning it to Gurney br br br Schedule br br The first race was held on May and has since been run annually in June with exceptions in when the race was held in July when it was held in September due to nationwide political turmoil in May when it was moved to September due to the COVID outbreak and when it was moved to August The race has been cancelled ten times in a labour strike during the Great Depression and between and World War II br The race usually takes place on the second weekend of June with qualifying and practice taking place on the Wednesday and Thursday before the race following a car inspection on Monday and Tuesday Currently these sessions are held in the evening with two separate two hour sessions held each night Friday serves as a day of rest and a parade of all the drivers through Le Mans is held br Test days held at the end of April or beginning of May served as a pre qualification weeding out the slowest cars However in the exorbitant cost of transporting cars to and from Le Mans led organizers to move the test day to the first weekend of June Pre qualification was eliminated in meaning that all competitors invited to the test would be allowed into the race br Since the Le Mans Legend races have also been part of the schedule usually running exhibition races during qualifying days a few hours prior to the sessions for the Le Mans entrants br From its inception until the race started at local time on Saturday and consequently from to and come hereafter it started at local time with the race returning to its original start time of in and respectively br The only exceptions were as follows br br br Classification br Initially the car that covered the greatest distance from its starting position was the winner This is known to have caught out the Ford team in With a dominant lead the two cars slowed to allow for a photo opportunity at the finish line with Ken Miles slightly ahead of Bruce McLaren However since McLaren s car had started much farther back on the grid than Miles s McLaren s car had covered the greatest distance over the hours With the margin of victory determined to be eight metres McLaren and his co driver Chris Amon were declared the winners The decision cost Miles and Denny Hulme a victory Miles had already won the other two endurance races at Sebring and Daytona With a win at Le Mans he would have become the first man to win all three and the first to win them all in the same year br The greatest distance rule was modified with the introduction of a rolling start in Now the car that completes the greatest distance as of the final lap s completion where greatest distance is measured by the start finish line for all competitors wins When two cars finish the same number of laps their finishing order is determined by the faster overall completion time This rule was used in the Hours of Le Mans to determine the race winner The top two finishers completed laps with only seconds difference between them br Although greatest distance run determines the provisional order of finishers additional requirements must be met for a car to be classified br br A car must complete the last lap of the race and complete the entire circuit faster than a prescribed maximum lap time Ambiguity in this classification requirement has led to dramatic scenes where damaged cars have waited in the pits or on the edge of the track close to the finish line restarted their engines and crawled across the line to be listed amongst classified finishers The practice of intentionally waiting for the final lap in this manner has been prohibited by rule in recent years br Cars must complete percent of the distance covered by the overall winner to be classified Even if it finishes the last lap of the race a car failing to complete this number of laps is not deemed worthy of classification because of poor reliability or speed br All classification requirements hold except in exceptional circumstances as determined by the race stewards br br br Le Mans start br br The race traditionally began with what became known as the Le Mans start in which cars were lined up along the length of the pits Until cars lined up by engine capacity Beginning in qualifying times determined the lineup The starting drivers stood on the opposite side of the front stretch When the French flag dropped to signify the start the drivers ran across the track entered and started their cars without assistance and drove away This became a safety issue in the late s when some drivers ignored their safety harnesses then a recent invention This led to drivers running the first few laps either improperly harnessed due to attempting to do it while driving or sometimes not even harnessed at all leading to several deaths when cars were involved in accidents due to the bunched field at the start br This starting method inspired Porsche to locate the ignition key switch to the left of the steering wheel In a left hand drive car this allowed the driver to use his left hand to start the engine and his right hand to put the transmission into gear which in turn shaves off a few tenths of a second br br Stirling Moss developed another method for speeding up the start His car was waiting with first gear already engaged He switched the starter on when he jumped in without depressing the clutch The starter motor immediately jerked the car forward but the engine did not start due to low RPM After a few seconds of motion he pushed the clutch down allowing the engine to speed up and start while the car was moving br Feeling this type of start was unsafe in the race Jacky Ickx opposed it by walking across the track while his competitors ran Although he was nearly hit by a faster competitor s car while walking Ickx took the time to fasten his safety belts before pulling away Privateer John Woolfe died in an accident on the first lap of that race Ickx won br The traditional Le Mans start was changed for Cars were still lined up along the pit wall but the drivers were already inside and strapped in At the dropping of the French tricolor the drivers started their engines and drove away br Since a rolling start sometimes known as an Indianapolis start begins the race While the cars do still start out lined up against the pit wall when the green flag is waved the cars pull away one by one to begin a formation lap behind the safety car when that car returns to pits the starter waves the French flag to start the race br br br Circuit br br The circuit on which the Hours of Le Mans is run is named the Circuit de la Sarthe after the department that Le Mans is within It consists of both permanent track and public roads temporarily closed for the race Since the track has been extensively modified mostly for safety reasons and now is km mi in length Although it initially entered the town of Le Mans the track was cut short to better protect spectators This led to the creation of the Dunlop Curve and Tertre Rouge corners before rejoining the old circuit on the Mulsanne Straight Another major change was on the Mulsanne itself in when the FIA decreed that it would no longer sanction any circuit that had a straight longer than km mi To comply with this two chicanes were added to the kilometre long mi straight dividing it into three pieces about km each The addition of the chicanes was further influenced by the fact that the speed of WM P Peugeot driven by French driver Roger Dorchy had been timed at km h mph during the race This was the record speed before the addition of the chicanes br Due to the shorter length of the straights the speed record at Le Mans now after the introduction of the chicanes is km h mph Typically race cars achieve top speed of just under km h mph at the current track with chicanes br The public sections of the track differ from the permanent circuit especially in comparison with the Bugatti Circuit which is inside the Circuit de la Sarthe Due to heavy traffic the public roads are not as smooth or well kept They also offer less grip because of the lack of soft tyre rubber laid down from racing cars though this only affects the first few laps of the race The roads are closed only within a few hours of the practice sessions and the race before being opened again almost as soon as the race is finished Workers have to assemble and dismantle safety barriers every year for the public sections br br br History br br br br br The Hours of Le Mans was first run on and May through public roads around Le Mans Originally planned to be a three year event awarded the Rudge Whitworth Triennial Cup with a winner being declared by the car which could go the farthest distance over three consecutive hour races this idea was abandoned in Overall winners were declared for every year depending on who covered the farthest distance by the time hours were up The early races were dominated by French British and Italian drivers teams and cars with Bugatti Bentley and Alfa Romeo being the top brands Innovations in car design began appearing at the track in the late s with Bugatti and Alfa Romeo running highly aerodynamic bodywork to run down the Mulsanne Straight at faster speeds The race was cancelled in due to general strikes in France and the outbreak of World War II in resulted in a ten year hiatus br br br br br Following the reconstruction of circuit facilities the race was resumed in with renewed interest from major automobile manufacturers was also Ferrari s first victory the MM of Luigi Chinetti and Peter Mitchell Thomson After the formation of the World Sportscar Championship in of which Le Mans was a part Ferrari Aston Martin Mercedes Benz Jaguar and many others began sending multiple cars backed by their respective factories to compete for overall wins against their competitors This competitiveness sometimes resulted in tragedy as in the Le Mans disaster during the race in which Pierre Levegh s car crashed into a crowd of spectators killing more than people The incident led to the widespread introduction of safety measures not only at the circuit but elsewhere in the motorsport world The entire pit complex was razed and rebuilt further back following the accident allowing the pit straight to be widened However there was still no barrier between the track and the pit lane Safety standards improved but the cars got faster The move from open cockpit roadsters to closed cockpit coup s resulted in speeds of over km h mph on the Mulsanne Ford entered the picture with the GT finally ending Ferrari s dominance with four straight wins before the s ended and the cars and the race changed substantially br br br br br For the new decade the race took a turn towards more extreme speeds and automotive designs These extreme speeds led to the replacement of the typical standing Le Mans start with a rolling Indianapolis start Although production based cars still raced they were now in the lower classes while purpose built sportscars became the norm The Porsche and were dominant throughout the decade but a resurgence by French manufacturers Matra Simca and Renault saw the first victories for the nation since the race This decade is also remembered for strong performances from many privateer constructors with two scoring the only victories for a privateer in the decade John Wyer s Mirage won in while Jean Rondeau s self titled chassis took br br br br br The rest of the s was known for the dominance by Porsche under the new Group C race car formula that encouraged fuel efficiency Originally running the effective it was later replaced by the Both chassis were affordable enough for privateers to purchase them en masse leading to the two model types winning six years in a row Jaguar and Mercedes Benz returned to sports car racing with Jaguar being the first to break Porsche s dominance with victories in and with the XJR and Jaguar XJR respectively Mercedes Benz won in with what was seen as the latest incarnation of the elegant Silver Arrows the Sauber C while an influx of Japanese manufacturer interest saw prototypes from Nissan and Toyota In qualifying for the race a WM Peugeot built for speed not meant to and it did not endure hours set the never surpassed speed trap record of km h mph in the Ligne Droite des Hunaudi res famous for its km mi long straight Mazda would be the first Japanese manufacturer to succeed with their unique rotary powered B winning in br br In and Peugeot dominated the race with its Peugeot as the Group C formula and World Sportscar Championship were fading in participation br The circuit would also undergo one of its most notable changes in when the km long Mulsanne was modified to include two chicanes in order to stop speeds of more than km h mph from being reached again This began the ACO s trend to slow the cars on various portions of the track However speeds over km h mph are still regularly reached at various points on a lap br br br br br Following the demise of the World Sportscar Championship Le Mans saw a resurgence of production based grand tourer cars Thanks to a loophole in the rules Porsche succeeded in convincing the ACO that a Dauer Le Mans supercar was a production car allowing Porsche to race their Porsche for one final time dominating the field Although the ACO attempted to close the loophole for newcomer McLaren would win the race in their supercar s first appearance thanks to the reliability of the BMW V powered F GTR beating faster yet more trouble prone prototypes The trend would continue through the s as more exotic supercars were built in order to skirt the ACO s rules regarding production based race cars leading to Porsche Mercedes Benz Toyota Nissan Panoz and Lotus entering the GT categories This culminated in the event in which these GT cars were faced with the Le Mans Prototypes of BMW Audi Toyota and Ferrari BMW would survive with the victory their first and only overall Le Mans win to date At the same time Mercedes left sportscar racing indefinitely following three catastrophic though non fatal crashes stemming from severe aerodynamic flaws with their CLR br This strong manufacturer influence led the ACO to lend the Le Mans name to a sports car series in the United States in known as the American Le Mans Series which ran until the end of the season after which it merged with Grand Am to form the United SportsCar Championship br br br br br Many major automobile manufacturers withdrew from sports car racing after due to the high cost Only Cadillac and Audi remained and Audi easily dominated with the R Cadillac pulled out three years later and attempts by Panoz Chrysler and MG to beat Audi all fell short After three victories in a row Audi provided engine team staff and drivers to Bentley a corporate partner which had returned in In the factory Bentley Speed s beat privateer Audis The Chevrolet Corvette Racing Team and their C R won several times in the GTS class finishing st and nd in and They finished nd and rd in behind Ferrari br br br br br At the end of after five overall victories for the R and six to its V turbo engine Audi took on a new challenge by introducing a diesel engined prototype known as the R TDI Although not the first diesel to race it was the first to win at Le Mans This era saw other alternative fuel sources used including bio ethanol At the same time Peugeot decided to follow Audi s lead and pursue a diesel entry in with their HDi FAP In the race between the Audi R TDI and the Peugeot HDi FAP the Audi won by a margin of fewer than minutes For the Hours of Le Mans Peugeot introduced a new energy recovery system similar to the KERS used in Formula One Aston Martin entered the LMP category but still raced in GT with private teams Audi returned with the new R TDI but Peugeot prevailed in its first overall win since br The running reaffirmed the race as a test of endurance and reliability Peugeot chose overall speed in adjusting their cars and engines to adhere to the regulations while Audi chose reliability All four Peugeots had retired at the end of the race three due to engine failure while Audi finished br The and races were marred by a series of accidents In the Audi driven by Allan McNish crashed heavily in the first hour barrel rolling into a tire wall shortly after the Dunlop Bridge At night the defending race winning Audi driven by Mike Rockenfeller crashed similarly between the Mulsanne and Indianapolis corners Neither driver was injured nor were any spectators The third Audi entry was driven by Marcel F ssler Andr Lotterer and Beno t Tr luyer won the race The race saw two factory Toyotas replace Peugeot which had withdrawn earlier but one flipped at Mulsanne Corner Driver Anthony Davidson suffered two broken vertebrae but could exit the car himself Shortly after sunset the other Toyota retired with mechanical difficulties giving Audi another victory br In the race became the premier round of the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup attempting to make a world championship for endurance racing again In the race became the centerpiece of the FIA World Endurance Championship the successor to the ILMC The event was the first time the race was won by a hybrid electric vehicle which was the Audi R e tron quattro br br br br br Regulations were changed for notably with a requirement that all LMP cars must be closed cockpit some changes to the hybrid system and the introduction of the slow zone system br Porsche returned to Le Mans in with a new factory LMP program and Nissan returned to run an LMP program in Audi withdrew from racing at the Hours of Le Mans in and Nissan after only one attempt in br Porsche won the race in and with its hybrid and remains the most successful manufacturer at Le Mans with overall victories br In changes were made to the LMP regulations on cockpit and chassis meaning all prototype cars must be closed cockpit br In Toyota won their first Le Mans with Fernando Alonso S bastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima driving Toyota won the race again in and br also saw the race held behind closed doors for the first time due to the COVID pandemic br br br present br saw the introduction of the Hypercar class a class which allows for Le Mans Hypercars and from onwards also LMDh cars to participate saw the race once again being postponed this time to August For and non hybrid LMP cars were allowed to participate as grandfathered LMP cars although only Alpine would make use of this Other entries in the hypercar class were Toyota and privateer team Glickenhaus The new Hypercar regulations allowed manufacturers more freedom with the design leading to cars such as the wingless Peugeot X entering in and many other unique designs which will be added The LMP regulations were extended to with the next generation LMP cars which are also used as chassis for the LMDh cars is said to be introduced in will likely also see the introduction of hydrogen powered prototypes which will race for the overall victory The former LMGTE class was also replaced by LMGT in br br br Innovations br Le Mans has seen many innovations in automotive design to counteract the circuit s difficulties These have either been dictated by rules or have been attempts by manufacturers to outwit the competition Some innovations were incorporated into the everyday automobile br br br Aerodynamics br br One of the keys to Le Mans is top speed due to the long straights that dominate the circuit This has meant cars have attempted to achieve the maximum speeds possible instead of relying on downforce for the turns While early competitors cars were street cars with their bodywork removed to reduce weight innovators like Bugatti developed cars that saw the beginnings of aerodynamics Nicknamed tanks due to their similarity to military tanks in World War I these cars used simple curves to cover all the car s mechanical elements and increase top speed Once Le Mans returned after World War II most manufacturers would adopt closed bodies streamlined for better aerodynamics A notable example of the changes brought about by aerodynamics are the entries by Briggs Cunningham Cunningham entered two Cadillac Coupe de Villes one nearly stock and the other completely rebodied in a streamlined aluminum shape developed by Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation that looked so unusual that it was nicknamed Le Monstre by the French press The smoothing of body shapes and fairing in of various parts of the machine brought about by the continual search for reduction of aerodynamic drag led to a separation from Grand Prix cars which rarely had large bodywork br As the years went on bodywork became all enveloping while at the same time lighter The larger bodywork with spoilers was able to provide more downforce for the turns without increasing the drag allowing cars to maintain high speeds Extended bodywork would usually concentrate on the car s rear usually being termed long tail The bodywork also began to cover the cockpit for less drag However open cockpits would come and go over the years as rules varied Aerodynamics reached its peak in before the Mulsanne Straight was modified During the race the crew of a Peugeot powered WM prototype taped over the engine openings allowing Roger Dorchy to set a recorded speed of km h mph down the Mulsanne However the car was almost undrivable elsewhere on the circuit The engine was soon destroyed from a lack of cooling However for the event the Mercedes Benz C reached km h mph under qualifying conditions br br br Engines br br A wide variety of engines have competed at Le Mans in attempts to achieve greater speed and have better fuel economy and spend less time in the pits Engine sizes have also varied greatly with the smallest engines being a mere cc Simca Cinq and the largest upwards of cc SRT Viper GTS R Supercharging was an early innovation for increasing output first being raced in while turbocharging would not appear until br The first car to enter without an engine run by pistons would be in when Rover partnered with British Racing Motors to run a gas turbine with mixed success repeating in The American Howmet Corporation would attempt to rerun a turbine in with even less success Although the engines offered great power they were hot and not fuel efficient br Another non piston engine that would appear would be a Wankel engine otherwise known as the rotary engine Run entirely by Mazda since its introduction in the compact engine would also suffer from fuel economy problems like the turbine had yet would see the success that the turbine lacked After many years of development Mazda finally succeeded in being the only winner of the race not to have a piston powered engine taking the event with the B br Alternative fuel sources would also play a part in more normal engine designs with the first non gasoline car appearing in The Delettrez Special would be powered by a diesel engine In contrast a second diesel would appear in the form of the M A P the following year Although diesel would appear at other times over the race existence it would not be until when a prominent manufacturer Audi would invest in diesel and finally succeed with the R TDI br Ethanol fuel appeared in in a modified Porsche leading to a class win Alternative biological fuel sources returned again in with Team Nasamax s DM Judd In biofuels ethanol for petrol engines and biodiesel for diesel engines were allowed Audi was the first to use next generation BTL biodiesel developed by Shell and manufactured from biomass br Beginning in new regulations allowed hybrid vehicles with either KERS or TERS Kinetic Thermal Energy Recovery System setups However only electrical i e batteries energy storage was allowed ruling out flywheel based energy recovery Cars with KERS were allowed to race in under specific classification rules Since they have competed for points and the championship In the first KERS equipped car won the Audi R e tron with a flywheel hybrid system by Williams Hybrid Power activated and drove the front wheels This was only allowed in certain zones after the car had accelerated to at least km h to cancel out the acceleration advantage that all wheel drive cars could gain out of corners In the same year Toyota also started with a hybrid car the TS which used KERS to power its rear wheels meaning its usage was not restricted br In the Automobile Club de l Ouest is planning to introduce a hydrogen electric prototype class This class will be a one design class with a chassis provided by Red Bull Advanced Technologies Oreca and a powertrain supplied by GreenGT The development of the hydrogen fuel cells powering the cars will be left to the teams themselves According to the ACO s president Pierre Fillon there is also a possibility of the cars being powered by a hydrogen combustion engine The performance of the class is expected to be competitive with the top Hypercar class br br br Brakes br With increased speeds around the track brakes become a key issue for teams attempting to safely bring their cars down to a slow enough speed to make the Mulsanne Corner turn Disc brakes were first seen in when the Jaguar C Type raced at Le Mans In the Mercedes Benz SLR introduced the air brake using a large opening hood on the rear of the car Ford used a quick change brake rotor in to achieve their first victory at Le Mans br In the s anti lock braking systems became standard on most Group C cars as a safety measure making it less likely that cars lose control at high speeds By the late s reinforced carbon carbon brakes were adopted for better stopping power br br br Successful marques and drivers br br Over the years many manufacturers have managed to take the overall win while even more have taken class wins The most successful marque in the history of the race is Porsche which has taken nineteen overall victories including seven in a row from to and class victories Audi is next with thirteen wins and Ferrari follows with eleven also including six in a row from to Since Audi has dominated the event winning times in years of participation Audi and Team Joest have had two hat tricks the first being in and Jaguar has seven wins In contrast Bentley Alfa Romeo and Ford all won four races in a row with Bentley recording two additional victories in other years In Toyota became only the second Japanese marque to win following Mazda in Mazda is also the only company to win with a rotary engine After Porsche s total of class victories Ferrari has and Aston Martin Audi and Chevrolet each have br Three drivers stand apart for their number of victories Initially Jacky Ickx held the record at six scoring victories between and earning him honorary citizenship to the town of Le Mans His frequent racing partner Derek Bell trailing by a single win with five However Dane Tom Kristensen has beaten

is the only driver to win the so called Triple Crown of Motorsport winning the Indianapolis Monaco Grand Prix and the Hours of Le Mans br br br Accidents br br Le Mans has seen many fatal accidents due partly to the very high speed nature of all variants of the track throughout history The largest one was in when spectators and driver Pierre Levegh were killed In the wake of the disaster many races were cancelled including the Grand Prix races in Germany Spain and Switzerland the latter as a part of a blanket ban on motorsport round track races that was maintained until The accident led to safety regulations in all motorsports for both driver and spectator protection br Almost all decades in which Le Mans has been run have seen their fair share of horrific accidents such as in when Swede Jo Bonnier was catapulted into a forest surrounding the circuit after hitting a privately entered Ferrari near the Indianapolis section Bonnier was killed instantly The s was a decade where some of the race s worst ever accidents occurred Although Armco barriers had been installed along the straight in there were still no chicanes on the Mulsanne Straight It was here that almost all of the worst accidents occurred during that time The prototypes most of which were equipped with very powerful turbocharged engines in those days were capable of doing more than km h mph before reaching the kink and would still be doing the same kind of speeds at the end of the kilometre mi straight and even through the kink which was a flat out bend for all the cars on the track In Belgian Thierry Boutsen crashed horrifically on the Mulsanne Straight in his WM Peugeot killing a marshal In the same race Frenchman Jean Louis Lafosse was also killed on the Mulsanne Straight when his Rondeau suffered a suspension failure steered very suddenly to the right and slammed into the Armco barrier on the driver s side at extreme speeds The race saw British privateer John Sheldon crashing at more than km h mph at the Mulsanne Kink his Aston Martin V powered Nimrod tore through the Armco barriers into the trees The resulting explosion was so violent that the woods next to the track caught fire Although Sheldon survived with severe burns a track marshal was killed two others were also severely injured Sheldon s teammate American Drake Olson in the second Nimrod Aston Martin who was following him down the straight crashed heavily after running over Sheldon s bodywork he went into severe shock but survived with minor injuries The field was under the safety car for over an hour while the crash site was cleared and the destroyed Armco barriers were replaced br In a similar accident befell Briton Dudley Wood in a Porsche during practice The impact of the car against the Armco considering Wood was doing more than km h mph was so hard that it cracked the engine block Wood survived without injury Also in John Nielsen flipped his Sauber Mercedes while going over the Mulsanne hump at more than km h mph The car landed on its roof and was destroyed but Nielsen escaped without injury In Jo Gartner drove a Porsche C into the Mulsanne barriers and was killed instantly after the car rolled multiple times vaulted some Armco barriers and knocked down a telegraph pole Moreover in American Price Cobb crashed a works Porsche C after slipping on oil during Wednesday practice The fuel tank exploded and the car burned to the ground but Cobb escaped without injury br Gartner s fatal accident remained the most recent death in the race until Allan Simonsen s crash in However there was one fatality during a practice session in Sebastien Enjolras br In the Mercedes Benz CLRs suffered from aerodynamic instability leading to cars getting airborne and flipping backwards no less than three times After initially happening on Thursday to the car Mercedes rebuild the chassis on Friday and claimed to have solved the problem only for it to occur again at warmup on Saturday Mark Webber was the unlucky driver whose car flipped on both occasions The last and most damaging accident occurred during the race itself when Peter Dumbreck s CLR became airborne flying over the safety fencing and landing in the woods several metres away No drivers were severely hurt in any of the three accidents However Mercedes Benz withdrew its remaining entry and ended its entire sportscar programme to focus on F and the upcoming new DTM br In two horrific accidents occurred to two of the three factory Audis in the LMP class Near the end of the first hour the No car driven by Allan McNish collided with one of the Ferrari GT cars resulting in McNish s car smashing into the tyre wall and being thrown into the air at the Dunlop chicanes resulting in pieces of bodywork flying over and nearly hitting many photographers on the other side of the barrier In the eleventh hour of the race another accident occurred to the No car driven by Mike Rockenfeller when he had contact with another Ferrari GT car In the runup to Indianapolis corner Rockenfeller s Audi was sent into the outside barrier at over km h mph Only the main cockpit safety cell of the car remained along with major damage being done to the barriers that needed to be repaired before the race was resumed Audi had switched to a closed cockpit car starting in a decision credited for the fact that neither driver was injured The regulations required all cars to be closed cockpit due to the accident br In Anthony Davidson driving for the returning Toyota team in a Toyota TS Hybrid collided with a Ferrari GT of Piergiuseppe Perazzini and became airborne before crashing into the tyre barrier of the Mulsanne Corner at high speed The Ferrari also ended up in the barrier flipping and coming to a halt on its roof Davidson suffered broken vertebrae br In Dane Allan Simonsen died after crashing into the barriers at Tertre Rouge When the car collided with the guard rail a mature tree had been touching the barrier thereby preventing the guard rail from performing its safety function br br br Coverage br br Motors TV covered the Le Mans Hours in its entirety in and including coverage of the scrutineering qualifying
