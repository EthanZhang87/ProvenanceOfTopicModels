id: 1179365
The Ford Puma is a small car that was produced by Ford Europe from September to July The Puma is a three door coup that is based on the Mark IV Ford Fiesta and was built at Ford s Niehl plant in Cologne Germany The Puma follows common design cues with other Ford cars at the time and is in the New Edge family of vehicles br br br Concept br The Ford Puma program was initiated in when then CEO and President of Ford Jac Nasser and Ford s Small and Medium Vehicle design director Claude Lobo discussed the possibility of doing a coupe based on Fiesta chassis All development was done using Paintbox CAD system which allowed designers to render a D and D models br The first iteration of the design called the Lynx concept car was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in and production car was launched in Geneva Motor show br br br Technical details br br All Pumas are front engined front wheel drive three door coup s with four seats They came with inch mm alloy wheels as standard although the Ford Racing Puma was equipped with inch mm alloy wheels with front disc and rear drum brakes br The car was based on the Mark Ford Fiesta with new engines codeveloped with Yamaha a new body stiffer suspension wider track and close ratio gearbox among other changes br The Puma was available with four engine options litre litre litre VCT only used in the Puma and the Tickford tuned litre VCT which was only used in the Ford Racing Puma each of which used Ford s v Sigma engines branded as Zetec SE Additionally the litre engines used Nikasil cylinder plating which required a specific grade of oil W semisynthetic to minimise mechanical wear br The production journey of the litre VCT was quite interesting Rough machined cylinder blocks were shipped from Ford s Valencia plant in Spain to Yamaha in Japan for Nikasil coating and completion These were then shipped back to Ford s Cologne plant where the Puma was assembled br All litre engined Pumas were equipped with low speed traction control and antilock brakes The antilock braking system was optional in the litre Puma br During the relatively short production run approximately Pumas were built all models including the Ford Racing Puma At its peak were registered with the DVLA in the UK which has since reduced to including that have statutory off road notification SORN as of Q br br br Engines br br br Special

solely on computer and in record time The Millennium Edition Puma featured eye catching Zinc Yellow paintwork and an Alchemy Blue dark navy blue leather interior with Recaro seats A numbered badge and keyring were available upon purchase from Ford but the cars were not automatically numbered br The Ford Ka and Focus also received the same award and were also produced in the same quantity and

throughout the whole of the production run Magnum Grey was only available on the Thunder Edition All of the Thunder Editions featured a Midnight Black dark grey leather interior a six disc CD changer and multispoke alloy wheels similar to those featured on the Fiesta Zetec S br br br Ford Racing Puma FRP br br Years available V to br Quantity produced all numbered on inlet manifold br The Ford Racing Puma was the name eventually given to Ford s concept Puma the Puma ST Concept which was first unveiled to the public at the Geneva Motor Show At the time Ford were keen to stress that this was no mere styling job and the idea was to transfer the know how and technology learned directly from Ford Puma race and rally programmes to a road car It was created by the Ford Rally specialist team at Boreham The strictly limited production run was initially pencilled to run for units with destined for the German market and for the UK All conversions were carried out by Tickford Daventry UK In the end only the destined for the UK market were produced and sold br Less than half of the cars were actually sold directly to customers with the vehicle s high price when new often cited as a reason as rival performance cars such as the Subaru Impreza with an additional BHP Turbo four wheel drive and rallying pedigree were being offered for a maximum of with the optional Pro Drive pack The lower than anticipated demand had Ford offering Racing Pumas to senior managers through their MRC scheme which enabled cars to continue being registered and converted The lack of demand when brand new has allowed it to maintain an increased value over the standard Puma due to its rarity br br br Race braking system br For the Racing Puma Ford partnered with Alcon Design to produce a Piston Motorsport braking system The Alcon Racing Front Brake calipers use mm in x mm discs mm discs on the rear These brakes are one of the defining attributes of the Racing Puma and they contribute significantly to enabling the standard kg lb car to pull a substantial g of braking force in the dry This compares well to the normal Puma s ability to achieve g on regular smaller mm in x mm in brake discs and calipers br The brake calipers themselves being derived from a racing set up do not come fitted with any protective rubber boots which prevent brake dust and debris from coming into contact with the brake pistons This means the brakes should be serviced regularly fully dismantled and properly cleaned to maintain efficiency Furthermore the inner portions of the caliper were unpainted aluminium and are susceptible to corrosion br br br Bodywork and handling br The bodywork was beefed up with wider lightweight aluminium front and steel rear overhangs these covered a substantially widened track at both the front and rear requiring longer drive shafts unique to the Racing Puma A front aerodynamic air splitter and modified wider front bumper with sports grill were used The wheels are MiM Speedline alloys x in with an ET Offset and use tyres original fitment tyres were Michelin SXGT R this increases the width from mm to mm The S rally Puma is just mm wider than this br The Racing Puma s suspension was developed and honed by Ford s specialist division at Boreham Essex and the cars monocoque shell was originally designed to be Ford s WRC entrant Stig Blomqvist spent months fine tuning the car s handling to ensure its chassis dynamics were perfected The wider track uprated springs dampers and special geometry settings refined the car s cornering poise to another level beyond the standard car s already excellent handling The upshot of the improved chassis finesse was a bias towards tracks hence the car has a very firm ride br All Racing Pumas left the factory painted metallic Imperial Blue to signify their special racing edition status This colour was only used by Ford on a select range of cars such as the Ford Escort Cosworth and Mk Ford Focus RS edition models The colour was not available on the regular Pumas in the UK market br br br Gearbox and optional limited slip differential br The standard IB gearbox was strengthened on the Racing Puma in comparison to the standard models It contains modified shafts which have been shot peened to withstand the extra load placed upon them This allowed a revised Power train Control Module software to be used allowing more power and torque to be used in lower gears br Additionally Ford Racing offered an optional limited slip differential to enhance handling even further only customer cars actually came equipped with that option from factory but since then subsequent owners have been known to retrofit it br br br Racing inspired interior br Sparco were commissioned to provide high grip bucket seats for improved driver control in cornering situations The blue Alcantara trim used on the seats and steering wheel provided improved grip over other material types The door cards rear seats and rear interior were also trimmed with the same material and the front seats were embroidered with the Ford Racing emblem br br br FRP engine br The original design remit was to achieve bhp using a litre Zetec SE equipped with a turbocharger However due to spiralling project costs this was not achieved and eventually the Racing Puma engineers were forced to keep their changes within a naturally aspirated engine The majority of the engine remained unchanged from the Zetec SE used in the standard Puma Only the camshafts air intake with the unique edition number engraved on it a specially tuned complete exhaust system by Janspeed and a revised engine management software helped to increase power by hp reducing the mph km h time to seconds achieving a mph km h top speed br br br Rallying br br Ford produced a Ford Puma kit car which was designed specifically for rallying The Puma s technical details included a Zetec SE all alloy engine with four cylinders and valves at cm power over bhp kW at rpm front wheel drive via a Hewland six speed sequential gearbox limited slip differential dynamic front suspension using MacPherson struts with adjustable spring platforms Ford Racing rear trailing arm beam with adjustable dynamic suspension Alcon front brakes with mm in diameter ventilated discs using four piston calipers Alcon mm in diameter solid disc rear brakes with two piston calipers a welded steel safety roll cage and front and rear wheel arches and bumpers in composite br The fuel tank was a litre capacity FIA bag tank located beneath the rear floor Wheels were Tarmac x in aluminium wheels or x in aluminium wheels for gravel br br br Style and advertising br br Stylistically the Puma followed Ford s New Edge design strategy as first seen in the Ford Ka While not as controversial as the Ka when it first appeared the Puma did achieve critical acclaim for its well proportioned and cat like design cues br The Puma was memorable for its pan European launch campaign that featured Steve McQueen The original United Kingdom television advertisement used clips from the movie Bullitt and cut McQueen into the modern setting of a Puma in San Francisco In Q Ford once again used the McQueen footage for the first Ford Mustang commercial in the United States Both commercials were directed by British director Paul Street and won many advertising industry awards featuring in all time top ad charts br br br Discontinuation br The Puma was only sold in Europe Production ended in although sale of stock vehicles continued into Ford did not replace it with another small coup and instead introduced the Ford StreetKa a two seater convertible based on the Fiesta like the Puma was The StreetKa also borrowed the Puma s transmission and suspension There are Ford Pumas including cars declared as SORN that remain registered with the DVLA in the UK as of Q However the name was revived by Ford as a crossover model in br br br Awards br Named Top Gear s Car of the
