NIMH Timmy to the Rescue which was made without Bluth s involvement or input and met with poor reception br In a live action animated remake was reported to be in the works A television series adaptation was also revealed to be in development since br br Mrs Brisby a widowed field mouse lives in a cinder block with her children on the Fitzgibbons farm Brisby longs to move her family out of the field as plowing time approaches but her son Timothy has fallen ill confining them br Brisby visits Mr Ages a friend of her late husband Jonathan who diagnoses the illness as pneumonia provides Brisby with medicine and warns her that Timothy must stay inside for at least three weeks to avoid death On her way home Brisby befriends Jeremy a clumsy but friendly crow before they both narrowly escape from the Fitzgibbons vicious cat Dragon The next morning Brisby discovers that Farmer Fitzgibbons has started plowing early Although her neighbor Auntie Shrew helps her disable his tractor Brisby knows she must devise another plan Jeremy takes her to meet the Great Owl who tells her to visit a colony of rats that live beneath a rose bush on the farm and ask for the services of Nicodemus their wise and mystical leader br Brisby enters the rose bush and encounters an aggressive guard rat named Brutus who chases her away She is led back in by Ages and is amazed to see the rats use of electricity and other technology Brisby meets Justin the friendly captain of the guard Jenner a ruthless and power hungry rat opposed to Nicodemus and finally Nicodemus himself From Nicodemus she learns that many years ago the rats along with her husband and Ages were part of a series of experiments at the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH for short The experiments boosted their intelligence enabling them to escape as well as extending their lifespans and slowing their aging processes However they are unable to live as typical rats would and need human technology to survive which they have accomplished only by stealing The rats have eventually settled on a decision for them to leave the farm and live independently in an area they refer to as Thorn Valley Nicodemus then gives Brisby a magical amulet that will activate when the wearer is courageous Meanwhile Jenner who wishes for the rats to remain in the rose bush plots with his reluctant accomplice Sullivan to eliminate Nicodemus br Because of the rats relationship with Jonathan they agree to help her move her home First they need to drug Dragon so that it can be done safely Only Brisby can do this as the rats cannot fit through the hole leading into the house Jonathan was killed by Dragon in a previous attempt while Ages broke his leg in another That night she puts the drug into Dragon s dish but the Fitzgibbons young son Billy catches her While trapped in a birdcage she overhears a telephone conversation between Farmer Fitzgibbons and the staff of NIMH and learns that the institute intends to exterminate the rats in the morning Brisby then escapes from the cage and runs off to warn them br As a rainstorm approaches the rats begin moving the Brisby home with the children and Auntie Shrew inside using a rope and pulley system Disregarding Sullivan s protests Jenner soon sabotages the assembly causing it to fall apart and crush Nicodemus to death Brisby soon arrives to warn the rats about NIMH s arrival but Jenner attacks her and attempts to steal the amulet as Sullivan alerts Justin who comes to Brisby s aid Jenner mortally wounds Sullivan and engages Justin in a sword fight that ends with him being killed with a dagger thrown by the dying Sullivan br The Brisby home suddenly begins to sink into the muddy ground it landed on and Brisby and the rats are unable to raise it All appears lost until Brisby s will to save her family gives power to the amulet which she uses to lift the house and move it to safety The next day the rats with Justin as their new leader have departed for Thorn Valley as Timothy begins to recover Jeremy then meets and falls in love with a female crow who is just as clumsy yet good hearted as he is br br The film rights to the book Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH had reportedly been offered to Walt Disney Productions in but they were turned down br The Secret of NIMH was the first feature film to be directed by Don Bluth On September Bluth fellow animators Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy and eight other animation staff left the feature animation department at Disney to set up their own independent studio Don Bluth Productions The studio worked at first out of Bluth s house and garage but moved to a two story square foot m facility in Studio City California several months later br While they were still working at Disney they produced the minute short film Banjo the Woodpile Cat as a side project to gain other production skills that the company and their animation program were not addressing Bluth asked Ron W Miller Walt Disney s son in law and the president and CEO of the company at the time to view Banjo but Miller declined As Goldman recalled that pulled the enthusiasm rug out from under us We had hoped that the studio might like what we were doing and agree to buy the film and allow us to finish the short film in the studio which would allow us to recoup what we had spent in terms of money and the many hours that we and the other members of the team had invested in the film br Before they started making Banjo Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH was read by artist and story writer Ken Anderson who called it a wonderful story He gave the book to Bluth for him to read and make a film out of after Bluth finished the animation direction of Pete s Dragon Bluth later showed the novel to Disney animation director Wolfgang Reitherman who turned down Bluth s offers to make a film based on the book explaining that Disney has already a mouse named Mickey Mouse and they had recently made a similar film about mice named The Rescuers However Bluth also presented the novel to the other staff that would work for Don Bluth Productions later on and they all loved it Two months later former Disney executive James L Stewart who now had started Aurora Productions called Goldman and told him about Anderson s idea of making a film based on NIMH At Bluth Goldman and Pomeroy s request Aurora Productions acquired the film rights and offered Don Bluth Productions a budget of US million and months to complete the film tighter in both budget and schedule than most Disney animated features at the time br br One of the earliest drafts of the film was written by Steven Barnes who received a creative consultant credit in the final product and was closer to the original novel The story would have focused more on the rats and their time at NIMH as it did in the book which was reduced to a short flashback in later revisions to bring Mrs Brisby and her plight into the forefront It also included from the book a female rat named Isabella described as a young cute somewhat motor mouthed rat with a crush on Justin who was ultimately left out and much of her dialogue given to Nicodemus A revised synopsis dated July by an unattributed author would take the film closer to its completed form which ended with the mysterious disappearance of the rats leading the characters and audience to wonder if they ever really existed or were just an elaborate illusion br Bluth himself would later make several changes to the story most notably with the addition of mystical elements not present in the original novel He explained that regarding magic we really believe that animation calls for some magic to give it a special fantastic quality This was most apparent in the magic amulet given to Mrs Brisby which was meant to be a visual representation of her character s internal power something harder to show on film The object was also meant to introduce a spiritual aspect to the plot with the director remarking The stone or amulet is just a method of letting the audience know that Mrs Brisby has found Courage of the Heart Magic Maybe Spiritual Yes In the same vein Nicodemus was made into a wizard to create more mystery about himself and the rats colony br Among other changes the antagonist Jenner was given much more prominence in the film being only mentioned as a traitor who leaves in the book to add drama to the narrative by giving it a more visible enemy Justin also now succeeds Nicodemus as the leader of the rats to give his character more of an arc and allow him an opportunity to grow and change Unlike the original work Justin does not rescue Mrs Brisby from the cage at the Fitzgibbons house and she now helps her children without the rats assistance by using the amulet once again giving focus to her personal story As Bluth put it The Secret of NIMH is really a story about Mrs Brisby and her need to save her children If the rats save her children then she hasn t grown in the film br During the film s production Aurora contacted Wham O the manufacturers of Frisbee flying discs with concerns about possible trademark infringements if the Mrs Frisby name in O Brien s original book was used in the film Wham O rejected Aurora s request for waiver to use the same sounding name to their Frisbee in the film Aurora informed Bluth company that Mrs Frisby s name would have to be altered By then the voice work had already been recorded for the film so the name change to Mrs Brisby necessitated a combination of re recording some lines and because John Carradine was unavailable for further recordings careful sound editing had to be performed taking the B sound of another word from Carradine s recorded lines and replace the F sound with the B sound altering the name from Frisby to Brisby br br Goldman described the casting process as exciting fun and sometimes strange He stated that focusing on the characteristics of each character the voices and acting abilities were crucial saying that using voices that added to a film s texture was part of the team s philosophy in the development of a film Goldman found the most memorable casting decision to be Dom DeLuise for Jeremy the Crow which Goldman Bluth and Pomeroy all considered when they watched the film The End in their respective homes independently of each other Elizabeth Hartman was cast as Mrs Brisby with Goldman calling her performance in A Patch of Blue so believable and sincere that we all felt that she was right for the part Pomeroy suggested Derek Jacobi who starred in the miniseries I Claudius to play the part of Nicodemus Peter Strauss whom the team previously saw in another miniseries from Rich Man Poor Man was cast as Justin Paul Shenar was assigned to play Jenner since the staff liked his dark powerful voice Shakespearean actor John Carradine was perfect for the dark ominous Great Owl while Aldo Ray was assigned to voice Jenner s reluctant accomplice Sullivan whom Goldman said also had a great distinctive voice br br The production of The Secret of NIMH lasted from January to early June The studio set out with the explicit goal in mind of returning feature animation to its golden era concentrating on strong characters and story and experimenting with unusual and often more labor intensive animation techniques Bluth believed older techniques were being abandoned in favor of lower production costs and the only way that animation could survive was to continue traditional production methods br Among the techniques experimented with on The Secret of NIMH were rotoscoping multiple passes on the camera to achieve transparent shadows backlit animation where animated mattes are shot with light shining through color gels to produce glowing areas for artificial light and fire effects and multiple color palettes for characters to fit in different lighting situations from daylight to night to warm environments to underwater Mrs Brisby had different lighting situations therefore there were different color palettes or lists of color for her Two modern computerized versions of the multiplane camera were also manufactured for this production br To achieve the film s detailed full animation while keeping to the tight budget the studio strove to keep any waste of time and resources to a minimum The crew often worked long hours with no immediate financial reward though they were offered a cut of the film s profits a practice common for producers directors and stars of live action films but never before offered to artists on an animated feature producer Gary Goldman recalled working hour weeks during the final six months of production Around in house staff worked on the film with the labor intensive cel painting farmed out to people working from home Many minor roles including incidental and crowd voice work were filled in by the in house staff The final cost of the film was million The producers Bluth Goldman and Pomeroy and the executive producers at Aurora mortgaged their homes collectively for to complete the film with the understanding that their investment would be the first to be repaid The film was the sixth animated feature to be presented in the Dolby Stereo sound system br In animating Justin and Jenner s sword fight the animators referenced similar sequences in films such as The Adventures of Robin Hood and The Vikings br br The Secret of NIMH Original Motion Picture Soundtrack contains songs from the film written by Jerry Goldsmith and performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra One song Flying Dreams was vocally performed by Paul Williams and Sally Stevens It was Goldsmith s first composition for an animated feature which he admitted was such a departure from his normal work that in the end he approached the project like a live action score employing the same kind of extended themes and structural development What made the scoring process hard for Goldsmith was that he had to score scenes that were unfinished I was on the phone constantly with them My dupe copy of the film was in black and white and they d bring their color copy over so I could see it They were constantly adding footage and it was constantly What s going on here and What s happening here br David M Horton spent a year on the sound design for the film which was supervised by Goldman Goldman found the sound work by Horten his second favorite part of the production process recalling that some of his most beautiful efforts had to make way for the recordings of Goldsmith s music I remember hearing David s orchestration of ambient sounds and specific sound effects for the minute tractor sequence without Jerry s music cue It was amazing But then so was Jerry s minute music cue it remains extremely powerful We were able to combine a lot of David s sounds treating them like part of the orchestra It came out great but I couldn t help but feel empathy for David br The album was released on July on vinyl and a re released reissue on March on CD with a rearranged track listing Intrada Records issued a remastered limited edition album on CD on August with one previously unreleased cue At Your Service running and three demos of Flying Dreams as performed by Sally Stevens Paul Williams and as a piano duet totaling Varese Sarabande did release the soundtrack on CD prior to the re released reissue in with the artwork as the same as the LP jacket but with a black background and a different track arrangement br br Tim Hildebrandt spent two weeks painting The Secret of NIMH s promotional poster br The film s distributor MGM UA Entertainment Co barely did any promotion for the film leading Aurora to finance the advertising campaign themselves The financiers had expected the film to open in wide release in venues but MGM opted for a limited opening weekend in theaters with its widest release in only Although it faced competition with the blockbuster E T the Extra Terrestrial directed by future Bluth partner Steven Spielberg it performed better in those theaters alone in its opening week than Poltergeist Rocky III Firefox and Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan However as a result of its release and competition with other summer fare NIMH became only a moderate success grossing nearly million in North America though it was more successful on home video cable and foreign releases ultimately turning a profit br br The Secret of NIMH debuted on Super film and several home video formats in including VHS Betamax CED Videodisc Video and LaserDisc which were distributed by MGM UA Home Video in North America and Warner Home Video in Europe Australia and Japan A Video version was also released exclusively in Europe With a purchase price in the United States the VHS edition sold approximately copies within the first few months br On September the film was re released on both VHS and LaserDisc in a new advertising campaign with lower retail prices It was this new wide availability on video as well as broadcasts on cable that helped NIMH garner a cult following long after its theatrical debut This was followed by another VHS release under the MGM UA Family Entertainment label in along with a Philips CD i video disc version that same year which was available exclusively through Warner Home Video worldwide br The film was released on DVD for the first time on November which was reprinted numerous times in the ensuing years both as a stand alone release or bundled with other animated films from MGM or th Century Fox Don Bluth and Gary Goldman later oversaw a high definition restoration of the film which was released on June in a disc DVD set called the Family Fun Edition Improvements in the transfer over the DVD include color correction and dirt and dust removal and included special features such as audio commentary from both individuals and an interview featurette A Blu ray version was released on March which retained the special features of the Family Fun Edition br br The Secret of NIMH received positive reviews upon its release It holds an approval rating of on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews with an average rating of The consensus states The Secret of NIMH seeks to resurrect the classical style of American animation and succeeds telling a mature story with rapturous presentation The film also has a weighted average score of out of on Metacritic based on reviews which indicates generally favorable reviews br Critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the movie two yes votes on a July episode of their television program Sneak Previews stating that Don Bluth and his team had succeeded in their goal of matching the high quality animation of Disney s heyday while also incorporating a deeper plot and greater variety of settings than other recent animated films In his print review for the Chicago Sun Times Ebert gave the film three out of four stars calling it an artistic success praising the quality of its animation and saying that it contains that absolute rarity among feature length animated cartoons an interesting premise Ebert found that NIMH may not resonate as well on an emotional level with younger viewers since it has so many characters and involves them in so many different problems that there s nobody for the kids in the audience to strongly identify with Siskel writing for the Chicago Tribune found the film charming but stated that the narrative was littered with too many unimportant characters and that Dom DeLuise insert ed too much of himself into the character of Jeremy Despite this Siskel found the film particularly the second half to be a genuine pleasure and felt that even adults will be drawn into the story by the end giving it three stars out of four br Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted the film s animation was something of a technical and stylistic triumph comparable to that of Disney s golden age but expressed dismay at the narrative finding it too complicated and lacking in an easily identifiable central character In his review for the VHS re release Jeff Unger of Entertainment Weekly gave The Secret of NIMH a grade of A calling it a wonderful adaptation of the original book adding that Bluth and his animators bless them chose to revive an endangered art form classically detailed animation They drew their characters exquisitely and gave them individual personalities The entire ensemble artists actors animals and musicians created something unique the world s first enjoyable rat race Similarly Richard Corliss of Time magazine called the film something gorgeous to look at br br The Secret of NIMH won Best Animated Film of at the th annual Saturn Awards where it also received a nomination for Best Fantasy Film losing to The Dark Crystal In
