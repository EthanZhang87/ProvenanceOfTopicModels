Walt Disney Animation Studios WDAS sometimes shortened to Disney Animation is an American animation studio that creates animated features and short films for The Walt Disney Company The studio s current production logo features a scene from its first synchronized sound cartoon Steamboat Willie Founded on October by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O Disney after the closure of Laugh O Gram Studio it is the oldest running animation studio in the world It is currently organized as a division of Walt Disney Studios and is headquartered at the Roy E Disney Animation Building at the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank California Since its foundation the studio has produced feature films from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to Wish and hundreds of short films br Founded as Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio DBCS in renamed Walt Disney Studio WDS in and incorporated as Walt Disney Productions WDP in the studio was dedicated to producing short films until it entered feature production in resulting in s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs one of the first full length animated feature films and the first U S based one In during a large corporate restructuring Walt Disney Productions which had grown from a single animation studio into an international media conglomerate was renamed The Walt Disney Company and the animation studio became Walt Disney Feature Animation WDFA in order to differentiate it from the company s other divisions Its current name was adopted in after Pixar Animation Studios was acquired by Disney br For many people Disney Animation is synonymous with animation for in no other medium has a single company s practices been able to dominate aesthetic norms to such an overwhelming extent The studio was recognized as the premier American animation studio for much of its existence and was for many decades the undisputed world leader in animated features it developed many of the techniques concepts and principles that became standard practices of traditional animation The studio also pioneered the art of storyboarding which is now a standard technique used in both animated and live action filmmaking The studio s catalog of animated features is among Disney s most notable assets with the stars of its animated shorts Mickey Mouse Minnie Mouse Donald Duck Daisy Duck Goofy and Pluto becoming recognizable figures in popular culture and mascots for the Walt Disney Company as a whole br Three of the studio s films Frozen Zootopia and Frozen II are all among the highest grossing films of all time with the latter becoming the second highest grossing animated feature film of all time It also had the highest grossing worldwide opening of all time for an animated feature film up until the release of Nintendo and Illumination s The Super Mario Bros Movie br By the studio was no longer developing hand drawn animated features as a result of D computer animated films performing better at the box office and had laid off most of their hand drawn animation division However the studio stated in and that they are open to proposals from filmmakers for future hand drawn feature projects In addition in April Eric Goldberg confirmed plans within the Disney studio to once again return to hand drawn animation br br br History br br br Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio br br Kansas City Missouri natives Walt Disney and Roy O Disney founded Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio in Los Angeles in and got their start producing a series of silent Alice Comedies short films featuring a live action child actress in an animated world The Alice Comedies were distributed by Margaret J Winkler s Winkler Pictures which later also distributed a second Disney short subject series the all animated Oswald the Lucky Rabbit through Universal Pictures starting in Upon relocating to California the Disney brothers initially started working in their uncle Robert Disney s garage at Kingswell Avenue in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles then in October formally launched their studio in a small office on the rear side of a real estate agency s office at Kingswell Avenue In February the studio moved next door to office space of its own at Kingswell Avenue In Disney put down a deposit on a new location at Hyperion Avenue in the nearby Silver Lake neighborhood which came to be known as the Hyperion Studio to distinguish it from the studio s other locations and in January the studio moved there and took on the name Walt Disney Studio br Meanwhile after the first year s worth of Oswalds Walt Disney attempted to renew his contract with Winkler Pictures but Charles Mintz who had taken over Margaret Winkler s business after marrying her wanted to force Disney to accept a lower advance payment for each Oswald short Disney refused and as Universal owned the rights to Oswald rather than Disney Mintz set up his own animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons Most of Disney s staff was hired away by Mintz to move over once Disney s Oswald contract expired in mid br br Working in secret while the rest of the staff finished the remaining Oswalds on contract Disney and his head animator Ub Iwerks led a small handful of loyal staffers in producing cartoons starring a new character named Mickey Mouse The first two Mickey Mouse cartoons Plane Crazy and The Galloping Gaucho were previewed in limited engagements during the summer of For the third Mickey cartoon however Disney produced a soundtrack collaborating with musician Carl Stalling and businessman Pat Powers who provided Disney with his bootlegged Cinephone sound on film process Subsequently the third Mickey Mouse cartoon Steamboat Willie became Disney s first cartoon with synchronized sound and was a major success upon its November debut at the West th Theatre in New York City The Mickey Mouse series of sound cartoons distributed by Powers through Celebrity Productions quickly became the most popular cartoon series in the United States A second Disney series of sound cartoons Silly Symphonies debuted in with The Skeleton Dance br br br Reincorporation Silly Symphonies and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs br In disputes over finances between Disney and Powers led to Disney s animation production company reincorporated on December as Walt Disney Productions signing a new distribution contract with Columbia Pictures Powers in return signed away Ub Iwerks who began producing cartoons at his own studio although he would return to Disney in br Columbia distributed Disney s shorts for two years before the Disney studio entered a new distribution deal with United Artists in The same year Disney signed a two year exclusive deal with Technicolor to utilize its new strip color film process which allowed for fuller color reproduction where previous color film processors could not The result was the Silly Symphony cartoon Flowers and Trees the first film commercially released in full Technicolor Flowers and Trees was a major success and all Silly Symphonies were subsequently produced in Technicolor br By the early s Walt Disney had realized that the success of animated films depended upon telling emotionally gripping stories that would grab the audience and not let go and this realization led him to create a separate story department with storyboard artists dedicated to story development With well developed characters and an interesting story the Technicolor Silly Symphony cartoon Three Little Pigs became a major box office and pop culture success with its theme song Who s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf becoming a popular chart hit br In Walt Disney gathered several key staff members and announced his plans to make his first animated feature film Despite derision from most of the film industry who dubbed the production Disney s Folly Disney proceeded undaunted into the production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which would become the first animated feature in English and Technicolor Considerable training and development went into the production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and the studio greatly expanded with established animators artists from other fields and recent college graduates joining the studio to work on the film The training classes supervised by head animators such as Les Clark Norm Ferguson and Art Babbit and taught by Donald W Graham an art teacher from the nearby Chouinard Art Institute had begun at the studio in and were greatly expanded into orientation training and continuing education classes In the course of teaching the classes Graham and the animators created or formalized many of the techniques and processes that became the key tenets and principles of traditional animation Silly Symphonies such as The Goddess of Spring and The Old Mill served as experimentation grounds for new techniques such as the animation of realistic human figures special effects animation and the use of the multiplane camera an invention that split animation artwork layers into several planes allowing the camera to appear to move dimensionally through an animated scene br br Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs cost Disney a then expensive sum of million to complete including on story development alone and was an unprecedented success when released in February by RKO Radio Pictures which had assumed distribution of Disney product from United Artists in It was briefly the highest grossing film of all time before the unprecedented success of Gone with the Wind two years later grossing over million on its initial release the equivalent of in dollars br During the production of Snow White work had continued on the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series of shorts Mickey Mouse switched to Technicolor in by which time the series had added several major supporting characters among them Mickey s dog Pluto and their friends Donald Duck and Goofy Donald Goofy and Pluto would all be appearing in series of their own by and the Donald Duck cartoons eclipsed the Mickey Mouse series in popularity Silly Symphonies which garnered seven Academy Awards ceased in until the shorts returned to theatres with some re issues and re releases br br br New features strike and World War II br The success of Snow White allowed Disney to build a new larger studio on Buena Vista Street in Burbank where The Walt Disney Company remains headquartered to this day Walt Disney Productions had its initial public offering on April with Walt Disney as president and Roy Disney as CEO br The studio launched into the production of new animated features the first of which was Pinocchio released in February Pinocchio was not initially a box office success The box office returns from the film s initial release were below both Snow White s unprecedented success and the studio s expectations Of the film s million cost twice of Snow White Disney only recouped million by late with studio reports of the film s final original box office take varying between million and million However Pinocchio was a critical success winning the Academy Award for Best Original Song and Best Original Score making it the first film of the studio to win not only either Oscar but both at the same time br Fantasia an experimental film produced to an accompanying orchestral arrangement conducted by Leopold Stokowski was released in November by Disney itself in a series of limited seating roadshow engagements The film cost million to produce and although the film earned million in its roadshow engagements the high cost per theater of installing Fantasound placed Fantasia at an even greater loss than Pinocchio RKO assumed distribution of Fantasia in later reissuing it in severely edited versions over the years Despite its financial failure Fantasia was the subject of two Academy Honorary Awards on February one for the development of the innovative Fantasound system used to create the film s stereoscopic soundtrack and the other for Stokowski and his contributions to the film br Much of the character animation on these productions and all subsequent features until the late s was supervised by a brain trust of animators Walt Disney dubbed the Nine Old Men many of whom also served as directors and later producers on the Disney features Frank Thomas Ollie Johnston Woolie Reitherman Les Clark Ward Kimball Eric Larson John Lounsbery Milt Kahl and Marc Davis Other head animators at Disney during this period included Norm Ferguson Bill Tytla and Fred Moore The development of the feature animation department created a caste system at the Disney studio lesser animators and feature animators in between assignments were assigned to work on the short subjects while animators higher in status such as the Nine Old Men worked on the features Concern over Walt Disney accepting credit for the artists work as well as debates over compensation led to many of the newer and lower ranked animators seeking to unionize the Disney studio br br A bitter union strike began in May which was resolved without the angered Walt Disney s involvement in July and August of that year As Walt Disney Productions was being set up as a union shop Walt Disney and several studio employees were sent by the U S government on a Good Neighbor policy trip to Central and South America The Disney strike and its aftermath led to an exodus of several animation professionals from the studio from top level animators such as Art Babbitt and Bill Tytla to artists better known for their work outside the Disney studio such as Frank Tashlin Maurice Noble Walt Kelly Bill Melendez and John Hubley Hubley along with several other Disney strikers went on to found the United Productions of America studio Disney s key animation rival in the s br Dumbo in production during the midst of the animators strike premiered in October and proved to be a financial success The simple film only cost to produce half the cost of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs less than a third of the cost of Pinocchio and two fifths of the cost of Fantasia Dumbo eventually grossed million during its original release In August Bambi was released and as with Pinocchio and Fantasia did not perform well at the box office Out of its million budget it grossed million br Production of full length animated features was temporarily suspended after the release of Bambi Given the financial failures of some of the recent features and World War II cutting off much of the overseas cinema market the studio s financiers at the Bank of America would only loan the studio working capital if it temporarily restricted itself to shorts production Features then in production such as Peter Pan Alice in Wonderland and Lady and the Tramp were therefore put on hold until after the war Following the United States entry into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor the studio housed over U S Army soldiers who were responsible for protecting nearby aircraft factories from enemy bombers In addition several Disney animators were drafted to fight in the war and the studio was contracted on producing wartime content for every branch of the U S military particularly military training and civilian propaganda films From to percent of the studio s animation output was for the military During the war Disney produced the live action animated military propaganda feature Victory Through Air Power and a series of Latin culture themed shorts resulting from the Good Neighbor trip were compiled into two features Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros br Saludos and Caballeros set the template for several other s Disney releases of package films low budgeted films composed of animated short subjects with animated or live action bridging material These films were Make Mine Music Fun and Fancy Free Melody Time and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad The studio also produced two features Song of the South and So Dear to My Heart which used more expansive live action stories which still included animated sequences and sequences combining live action and animated characters Shorts production continued during this period as well with Donald Duck Goofy and Pluto cartoons being the main output accompanied by cartoons starring Mickey Mouse Figaro and in the s Chip n Dale and Humphrey the Bear br In addition Disney began reissuing the previous features beginning with re releases of Snow White in Pinocchio in and Fantasia in This led to a tradition of reissuing the Disney films every seven years which lasted into the s before being translated into the studio s handling of home video releases br br br Return of features Buena Vista end of shorts layoffs and Walt s final years br br In Disney returned to the production of full length features with Cinderella a feature film based on the fairy tale by Charles Perrault At a cost of nearly million the future of the studio depended upon the success of this film Upon its release in Cinderella proved to be a box office success with the profits from the film s release allowing Disney to carry on producing animated features throughout the s Following its success production on the in limbo features Alice in Wonderland Peter Pan and Lady and the Tramp was resumed In addition an ambitious new project an adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale Sleeping Beauty set to Tchaikovsky s classic score was begun but took much of the rest of the decade to complete br Alice in Wonderland released in met with a lukewarm response at the box office and was a sharp critical disappointment in its initial release Peter Pan released in on the other hand was a commercial success and the sixth highest grossing film of the year In Lady and the Tramp was released to higher box office success than any other Disney animated feature since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs earning an estimated million in rentals at the North American box office in Lady and the Tramp is significant as Disney s first widescreen animated feature produced in the CinemaScope process and was the first Disney animated feature to be released by Disney s own distribution company Buena Vista Distribution br By the mid s with Walt Disney s attention primarily set on new endeavours such as live action films television and the Disneyland theme park production of the animated films was left primarily in the hands of the Nine Old Men trust of head animators and directors This led to several delays in approvals during the production of Sleeping Beauty which was finally released in At million it was Disney s most expensive film to date produced in a heavily stylised art style devised by artist Eyvind Earle and presented in large format Super Technirama with six track stereophonic sound However despite being the studio s highest grossing animated feature since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs the film s large production costs and the box office underperformance of Disney s other output resulted in the studio posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year leading to massive layoffs throughout the studio br By the end of the decade the Disney short subjects were no longer being produced on a regular basis with many of the shorts divisions personnel either leaving the company or being reassigned to work on Disney television programs such as The Mickey Mouse Club and Disneyland While the Silly Symphonies shorts had dominated the Academy Award for Best Short Subject Cartoons during the s its reign over the most awards had been ended by MGM s Tom and Jerry cartoons Warner Bros Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies and the works of United Productions of America UPA whose flat art style and stylized animation techniques were lauded as more modern alternatives to the older Disney style During the s only one Disney short the stylized Toot Whistle Plunk and Boom won the Best Short Subject Cartoons Oscar br The Mickey Mouse Pluto and Goofy shorts had all ceased regular production by with Donald Duck and Humphrey continuing and converting to widescreen CinemaScope before the shorts division was shut down in After that all future shorts were produced by the feature films division until The last Disney short of the golden age of animation was It s Tough to Be a Bird Disney shorts would only be produced on a sporadic basis from this point on with notable later shorts including Runaway Brain starring Mickey Mouse and Paperman br Despite the layoffs and competition for Walt Disney s attention from the company s expanded live action film TV and theme park departments production continued on feature animation productions at a reduced level br In the studio released One Hundred and One Dalmatians an animated feature that popularized the use of xerography during the process of inking and painting traditional animation cels Using xerography animation drawings could be photochemically transferred rather than traced from paper drawings to the clear acetate sheets cels used in final animation production The resulting art style a scratchier line which revealed the construction lines in the animators drawings typified Disney films into the s The film was a success being the tenth highest grossing film of with rentals of million br The Disney animation training program started at the studio in before the development of Snow White eventually led to Walt Disney helping found the California Institute of the Arts CalArts This university formed via the merger of Chouinard Art Institute and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music It included a Disney developed animation program of study among its degree offerings CalArts became the alma mater of many of the animators who would work at Disney and other animation studios from the s to the present br The Sword in the Stone was released in and was the sixth highest grossing film of the year in North America with estimated rentals of million A featurette adaptation of one of A A Milne s Winnie the Pooh stories Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree was released in to be followed by several other Pooh featurettes over the years and a full length compilation feature The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh which was released in br Walt Disney died in December ten months before the studio s next film The Jungle Book was completed and released The film was a success finishing as the fourth highest grossing film of the year br br br Decline in popularity Don Bluth s entrance and departure rock bottom br Following Walt Disney s death Wolfgang Reitherman continued as both producer and director of the features The studio began the s with the release of The Aristocats the last film project to be approved by Walt Disney In Roy O Disney the studio co founder died and Walt Disney Productions was left in the hands of Donn Tatum and Card Walker who alternated as chairman and CEO in overlapping terms until The next feature Robin Hood was produced with a significantly reduced budget and animation repurposed from previous features Both The Aristocats and Robin Hood were minor box office and critical successes br The Rescuers released in was a success exceeding the achievements of the previous two Disney features Receiving positive reviews high commercial returns and an Academy Award nomination it ended up being the third highest grossing film of the year and the most successful and best reviewed Disney animated film since The Jungle Book The film was reissued in accompanied by a new Disney featurette Mickey s Christmas Carol br The production of The Rescuers signaled the beginning of a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth Ron Clements John Musker and Glen Keane The new animators culled from the animation program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson Frank Thomas Ollie Johnston and Woolie Reitherman got their first chance to prove themselves as a group with the animated sequences in Disney s live action animated hybrid feature Pete s Dragon the animation for which was directed by Bluth In September dissatisfied with what they felt was a stagnation in the development of the art of animation at Disney Bluth and several of the other new guard animators quit to start their own studio Don Bluth Productions which became Disney s chief competitor in the animation field during the s br Delayed half a year by the defection of the Bluth group The Fox and the Hound was released in after four years in production The film was considered a financial success by the studio and development continued on The Black Cauldron a long gestating adaptation of the Chronicles of Prydain series of novels by Lloyd Alexander produced in Super Technirama br The Black Cauldron was intended to expand the appeal of Disney animated films to older audiences and to showcase the talents of the new generation of Disney animators from CalArts Besides Keane Musker and Clements this new group of artists included other promising animators such as Andreas Deja Mike Gabriel John Lasseter Brad Bird and Tim Burton Lasseter was fired from Disney in for pushing the studio to explore computer animation production but went on to become the creative head of Pixar a pioneering computer animation studio that would begin a close association with Disney in the late s Similarly Burton was fired in after producing a live action short shelved by the studio Frankenweenie then went on to become a high profile producer and director of live action and stop motion features for Disney and other studios Some of Burton s high profile projects for Disney would include the stop motion The Nightmare Before Christmas a live action adaptation of Alice in Wonderland and a stop motion feature remake of Frankenweenie Bird was also fired after a few years working at the company for criticizing Disney s upper management as he felt that they were playing it safe and not taking risks on animation He subsequently became an animation director at other studios including Warner Bros Animation and Pixar br Ron Miller Walt Disney s son in law became president of Walt Disney Productions in and CEO in That year he expanded the company s film and television production divisions creating the Walt Disney Pictures banner under which future films from the feature animation department would be released br br br Michael Eisner takeover restructuring and return to prominence br br After a series of corporate takeover attempts in Roy E Disney son of Roy O and nephew of Walt resigned from the company s board of directors and launched a campaign called SaveDisney successfully convincing the board to fire Miller Roy E Disney brought in Michael Eisner as Disney s new CEO and Frank Wells as president Eisner in turn named Jeffrey Katzenberg chairman of the film division The Walt Disney Studios Near completion when the Eisner regime took over Disney The Black Cauldron came to represent what would later be referred to as the rock bottom point for Disney animation The studio s most expensive feature to that point at million The Black Cauldron was a critical and commercial failure The film s million box office gross led to a loss for the studio putting the future of the animation division in jeopardy br Between the s and s the significance of animation to Disney s bottom line was significantly reduced as the company expanded into further live action production television and theme parks As new CEO Michael Eisner strongly considered shuttering the feature animation studio and outsourcing future animation Roy E Disney intervened offering to head the feature animation division and turn its fortunes around while Eisner established the Walt Disney Pictures Television Animation Group to produce lower cost animation for television Named Chairman of feature animation by Eisner Roy E Disney appointed Peter Schneider president of animation to run the day to day operations in br On February Disney executives moved the animation division from the Disney studio lot in Burbank to a variety of warehouses hangars and trailers located about two miles east kilometers at Flower Street in nearby Glendale California About a year later the growing computer graphics CG group would move there too The animation division s first feature animation at its new location was The Great Mouse Detective begun by John Musker and Ron Clements as Basil of Baker Street after both left production of The Black Cauldron The film was enough of a critical and commercial success to instill executive confidence in the animation studio Later the same year however Universal Pictures and Steven Spielberg s Amblin Entertainment released Don Bluth s An American Tail which outgrossed The Great Mouse Detective at the box office and became the highest grossing first issue animated film to that point br Katzenberg Schneider and Roy Disney set about changing the culture of the studio increasing staffing and production so that a new animated feature would be released every year instead of every two to four The first of the releases on the accelerated production schedule was Oliver Company which featured an all star cast including Billy Joel and Bette Midler and an emphasis on a modern pop soundtrack Oliver Company opened in the theaters on the same day as another Bluth Amblin Universal animated film The Land Before Time however Oliver Company outgrossed The Land Before Time in the U S and went on to become the most successful animated feature in the U S to that date though the latter s worldwide box office gross was higher than the former br br At the same time in Disney started entering into Australia s long standing animation industry by purchasing Hanna Barbera s Australian studio to start Disney Animation Australia br While Oliver Company and the next feature The Little Mermaid were in production Disney collaborated with Steven Spielberg s Amblin Entertainment and master animator Richard Williams to produce Who Framed Roger Rabbit a groundbreaking live action animation hybrid directed by Robert Zemeckis which featured licensed animated characters from other studios such as Warner Bros MGM and Universal Disney set up a new animation studio under Williams supervision in London to create the cartoon characters for Roger Rabbit with many of the artists from the California studio traveling to England to work on the film A significant critical and commercial success Roger Rabbit won three Academy Awards for technical achievements and was key in renewing mainstream interest in American animation Other than the film itself the studio also produced three Roger Rabbit shorts during the late s and early s br br br Beginning of the Disney Renaissance successful releases and impact on the animation industry br br A second satellite studio Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida opened in with employees Its offices were located within the Disney MGM Studios theme park at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake Florida and visitors were allowed to tour the studio and observe animators at work That same year the studio released The Little Mermaid which became a keystone achievement in Disney s history as its largest critical and commercial success in decades Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements who d been co directors on The Great Mouse Detective The Little Mermaid earned million at the North American box office a record for the studio The film was built around a score from Broadway songwriters Alan Menken and Howard Ashman who was also a co producer and story consultant on the film The Little Mermaid won two Academy Awards for Best Original Song and Best Original Score br The Little Mermaid vigorously relaunched a profound new interest in the animation and musical film genres The film was also the first to feature the use of Disney s Computer Animation Production System CAPS Developed for Disney by Pixar which had grown into a commercial computer animation and technology development company CAPS ink and paint would become significant in allowing future Disney films to more seamlessly integrate computer generated imagery and achieve higher production values with digital ink and paint and compositing techniques The Little Mermaid was the first of a series of blockbusters that would be released over the next decade by Walt Disney Feature Animation a period later designated by the term Disney Renaissance br Accompanied in theaters by the Mickey Mouse featurette The Prince and the Pauper The Rescuers Down Under was Disney s first animated feature sequel and the studio s first film to be fully colored and composited via computer using the CAPS ink and paint system However the film did not duplicate the success of The Little Mermaid The next Disney animated feature Beauty and the Beast had begun production in London but was moved back to Burbank after Disney decided to shutter the London satellite office and retool the film into a musical comedy format similar to The Little Mermaid Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were retained to write the songs and score though Ashman died before production was completed br Debuting first in a work in progress version at the New York Film Festival before its November wide release Beauty and the Beast directed by Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale was an unprecedented critical and commercial success and would later be regarded as one of the studio s best films The film earned six Academy Award nominations including one for Best Picture a first for an animated work winning for Best Song and Best Original Score Its million box office gross set new records and merchandising for the film including toys cross promotions and soundtrack sales was also lucrative br The successes of The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast established the template for future Disney releases during the s a musical comedy format with Broadway styled songs and tentpole action sequences buoyed by cross promotional marketing and merchandising all carefully designed to pull audiences of all ages and types into theatres In addition to John Musker Ron Clements Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale the new guard of Disney artists creating these films included story artists directors Roger Allers Rob Minkoff Chris Sanders and Brenda Chapman and lead animators Glen Keane Andreas Deja Eric Goldberg Nik Ranieri Will Finn and many others br Aladdin released in November continued the upward trend in Disney s animation success earning million worldwide at the box office and two more Oscars for Best Song and Best Score Featuring songs by Menken Ashman and Tim Rice who replaced Ashman after his death and starring the voice of Robin Williams Aladdin also established the trend of hiring celebrity actors and actresses to provide the voices of Disney characters which had been explored to some degree with The Jungle Book and Oliver Company but now became standard practice br In June Disney released The Lion King directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff An all animal story set in Africa The Lion King featured an all star voice cast which included James Earl Jones Matthew Broderick and Jeremy Irons with songs written by Tim Rice and pop star Elton John The Lion King earned million at the worldwide box office to this date a record for a traditionally animated film earning millions more in merchandising promotions and record sales for its soundtrack br br Aladdin and The Lion King had been the highest grossing films worldwide in each of their respective release years Between these in house productions Disney diversified in animation methods and produced The Nightmare Before Christmas with former Disney animator Tim Burton Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed by providing the film s second layering traditional animation With animation becoming again an increasingly important and lucrative part of Disney s business the company began to expand its operations The flagship California studio was split into two units and expanded and ground was broken on a new Disney Feature Animation building adjacent to the main Disney lot in Burbank which was dedicated in also one of Disney s television animation studios in the Paris France suburb of Montreuil the former Brizzi Brothers studio became Walt Disney Feature Animation Paris where A Goofy Movie and significant parts of later Disney films were produced Disney also began producing lower cost direct to video sequels and prequels for its successful animated films using the services of its television animation studios under the name Disney MovieToons The Return of Jafar a sequel to Aladdin and a pilot for the Aladdin television show spin off was the first of these productions Walt Disney Feature Animation was also heavily involved in the adaptations of both Beauty and the Beast in and The Lion King in into Broadway musicals br Jeffrey Katzenberg and the Disney story team were heavily involved in the development and production of Toy Story the first fully computer animated feature ever produced Toy Story was produced for Disney by Pixar and directed by former Disney animator John Lasseter whom Peter Schneider had unsuccessfully tried to hire back after his success with Pixar shorts such as Tin Toy Released in Toy Story opened to critical acclaim and commercial success leading to Pixar signing a five film deal with Disney which bore critically and financially successful computer animated films such as A Bug s Life Toy Story Monsters Inc Finding Nemo and The Incredibles br In addition the successes of Aladdin and The Lion King spurred a significant increase in the number of American produced animated features throughout the rest of the decade with the major film studios establishing new animation divisions such as Fox Animation Studios Sullivan Bluth Studios both founded by Don Bluth Amblimation Rich Animation Studios Turner Feature Animation and Warner Bros Animation being formed to produce films in a Disney esque musical comedy format such as We re Back A Dinosaur s Story Thumbelina The Swan Princess A Troll in Central Park The Pebble and the Penguin Cats Don t Dance Anastasia Quest for Camelot and The King and I Out of these non Disney animated features only Anastasia was a box office success and it later ended up being acquired by Disney through the company s acquisition of st Century Fox in br br br End of the Disney Renaissance and declining returns br br Concerns arose internally at the Disney studio particularly from Roy E Disney about studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg taking too much credit for the success of Disney s early s releases Disney Company president Frank Wells was killed in a helicopter accident in and Katzenberg lobbied CEO Michael Eisner for the vacant president position Instead tensions between Katzenberg Eisner and Disney resulted in Katzenberg being forced to resign from the company on August of that year with Joe Roth taking his place On October Katzenberg went on to become one of the founders of DreamWorks SKG whose animation division became Disney s key rival in feature animation with both computer animated films such as Antz and traditionally animated films such as The Prince of Egypt In December the Animation Building in Burbank was completed for the animation division br In contrast to the early s productions not all the films in the second half of the renaissance were successful Pocahontas released in summer of was the first film of the renaissance to receive mixed reviews from critics but was still popular with audiences and commercially successful earning million worldwide and won two Academy Awards for its music by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz The next film The Hunchback of Notre Dame was partially produced at the Paris studio and although it is considered Disney s darkest film The Hunchback of Notre Dame performed better critically than Pocahontas and grossed million worldwide The following summer Hercules did well at the box office grossing million worldwide but underperformed in comparison to Disney s previous films It received positive reviews for its acting but the animation and music were mixed Hercules was responsible for beginning the decline of traditionally animated films The declining box office success became doubly concerning inside the studio as wage competition from DreamWorks had significantly increased the studio s overhead with production costs increasing from million in total costs production marketing and overhead for The Lion King in to million for Hercules three years later Moreover Disney depended upon the popularity of its new features in order to develop merchandising theme park attractions direct to video sequels and television programming in its other divisions The production schedule was scaled back and a larger number of creative executives were hired to more closely supervise production a move that was not popular among the animation staff br Mulan the first film produced primarily at the Florida studio opened to positive reviews from audiences and critics and earned a successful million at the worldwide box office restoring both the critical and commercial success of the studio The next film Tarzan directed by Kevin Lima and Chris Buck had a high production cost of million again received positive reviews and earned million at the box office The Tarzan soundtrack by pop star Phil Collins resulted in significant record sales and an Academy Award for Best Song br br br Slump downsizing and conversion to computer animation corporate issues br Fantasia a sequel to the film that had been a pet project of Roy E Disney s since premiered on December at Carnegie Hall in New York City as part of a concert tour that also visited London Paris Tokyo and Pasadena California The film was then released in IMAX theaters worldwide from January to April making it the first animated feature length film to be released in the format a standard theatrical release followed on June Produced in pieces when artists were available between productions Fantasia was the first animated feature produced for and released in IMAX format The film s million worldwide box office total against its million production cost resulted in it losing million for the studio Peter Schneider left his post as president of Walt Disney Feature Animation in to become president of The Walt Disney Studios under Joe Roth Thomas Schumacher who had been Schneider s vice president of animation for several years became the new president of Walt Disney Feature Animation By this time competition from other studios had driven animators incomes to all time highs making traditionally animated features even more costly to produce Schumacher was tasked with cutting costs and massive layoffs began to cut salaries and bring the studio s staff which peaked at people in down to approximately employees br In October Dream Quest Images a special effects studio previously purchased by The Walt Disney Company in April to replace Buena Vista Visual Effects was merged with the computer graphics operation of Walt Disney Feature Animation to form a division called The Secret Lab The Secret Lab produced one feature film Dinosaur which was released in May and featured CGI prehistoric creatures against filmed live action backgrounds The million production earned million worldwide below studio expectations and The Secret Lab was closed in br In December The Emperor s New Groove was released It had been a musical epic called Kingdom of the Sun before being revised mid production into a smaller comedy The film earned million worldwide on release though it was well reviewed and performed better on video Atlantis The Lost Empire an attempt to break the Disney formula by moving into action adventure received mixed reviews and earned million worldwide against production costs of million br By and early the notable successes of Pixar s computer animated films thanks to its distribution deal with Disney along with DreamWorks Shrek and Blue Sky Studios Ice Age respectively against Disney s lesser returns for The Emperor s New Groove and Atlantis The Lost Empire led to the speculation that hand drawn animation was becoming obsolete Disney laid off most of the employees at the Feature Animation studio in Burbank downsizing it to one unit and beginning plans to move into fully computer animated films A handful of employees were offered positions doing computer animation Morale plunged to a low not seen since the start of the studio s ten year exile to Glendale in The Paris studio was also closed in br The Burbank studio s remaining hand drawn productions Treasure Planet and Home on the Range continued production Treasure Planet a futuristic outer space retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson s Treasure Island was a pet project of writer directors Ron Clements and John Musker It received an IMAX release and generally positive reviews but was financially unsuccessful upon its November release resulting in a million write down for The Walt Disney Company in fiscal year The Burbank studio s D departments closed at the end of following completion of Home on the Range a long in production feature that had previously been known as Sweating Bullets br Meanwhile hand drawn feature animation production continued at the Feature Animation Florida studio where the films could be produced at lower costs Lilo Stitch an offbeat comedy drama written and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois became the studio s first bonafide hit since Tarzan upon its summer release earning million worldwide against an million production budget br By this time most of the Disney features from the s had been spun off into direct to video sequels television series or both produced by the Disney Television Animation unit Beginning with the February release of Return to Never Land a sequel to Peter Pan Disney began releasing lower budgeted sequels to earlier films which had been intended for video premieres in theaters a process derided by some of the Disney animation staff and fans of the Disney films br In Tom Schumacher was appointed president of Buena Vista Theatrical Group Disney s stageplay and musical theater arm and David Stainton then president of Walt Disney Television Animation was appointed as his replacement Stainton continued to oversee Disney s direct to video division Disneytoon Studios which had been part of the television animation department though transferred at this time to Walt Disney Feature Animation management br Under Stainton the Florida studio completed Brother Bear which did not perform as well as Lilo Stitch critically or financially Disney closed the Florida studio on January with the then in progress feature My Peoples left unfinished when the studio closed two months later Home on the Range released in April did not do as critically or commercially successful as Lilo Stitch as well Disney officially announced its conversion of Walt Disney Feature Animation into a fully CGI studio a process begun two years prior now with a staff of people and began selling off all of its traditional animation equipment br Just after Brother Bear s November release Feature Animation chairman Roy E Disney had resigned from The Walt Disney Company launching with business partner Stanley Gold a second external SaveDisney campaign similar to the one that had forced Ron Miller out in this time to force out Michael Eisner Two of their arguing points against Eisner included his handling of Feature Animation and the souring of the studio s relationship with Pixar The same year the studio collaborated with Walt Disney Imagineering on the D theme park film Mickey s PhilharMagic One of the studio s first attempts at CG animation the studio brought back several animators from the Renaissance period to work on the film each animator worked on a sequence that they had previously worked on such as Glen Keane animating Ariel for the Part of Your World sequence br Talks between Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs over renewal terms for the highly lucrative Pixar Disney distribution deal broke down in January Jobs in particular disagreed with Eisner s insistence that sequels such as the then in development Toy Story would not count against the number of films required in the studio s new deal To that end Disney announced the launching of Circle Animation a division of Feature Animation which would have produced sequels to the Pixar films while Pixar began shopping for a new distribution deal br In Disney released its first fully computer animated feature Chicken Little The film was a success at the box office earning million worldwide but was met with critically mixed to negative reviews Earlier that year after two years of Roy E Disney s SaveDisney campaign Eisner announced that he would resign and named Bob Iger then president of the Walt Disney Company his successor as chairman and CEO br br br Rebound Disney s acquisition of Pixar and renaming br br Iger later said I didn t yet have a complete sense of just how broken Disney Animation was He described its history since the early s as dotted by a slew of expensive failures like Hercules and Chicken Little the modest successes like Mulan and Lilo Stitch were still critically and commercially unsuccessful compared to the earlier films of the Disney Renaissance After Iger became CEO Jobs resumed negotiations for Pixar with Disney On January Disney announced that it would acquire Pixar for billion in an all stock deal with the deal closing that May and the Circle studio launched to produce Toy Story was shut down with most of its employees returning to Feature Animation and Toy Story returning to Pixar s control Iger later said that it was a deal I wanted badly and Disney needed badly He believed that Disney Animation needed new leadership and as part of the acquisition Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter were named president and Chief Creative Officer respectively of Feature Animation as well as Pixar br While Disney executives had discussed closing Feature Animation as redundant Catmull and Lasseter refused and instead resolved to try to turn things around at the studio Lasseter said We weren t going to let that closure happen on our watch We were determined to save the legacy of Walt Disney s amazing studio and bring it back up to the creative level it had to be Saving this heritage was squarely on our shoulders Lasseter and Catmull set about rebuilding the morale of the Feature Animation staff and rehired a number of its s new guard generation of star animators who had left the studio including Ron Clements John Musker Eric Goldberg Mark Henn Andreas Deja Bruce W Smith and Chris Buck To maintain the separation of Walt Disney Feature Animation and Pixar despite their now common ownership and management Catmull and Lasseter drew a hard line that each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and would not be allowed to borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other Catmull said that he and Lasseter would make sure the studios are quite distinct from each other We don t want them to merge that would definitely be the wrong approach Each should have its own personality br Catmull and Lasseter also brought to Disney Feature Animation the Pixar model of a filmmaker driven studio as opposed to an executive driven studio they abolished Disney s prior system of requiring directors to respond to mandatory notes from development executives ranking above the producers in favor of a system roughly analogous to peer review in which non mandatory notes come primarily from fellow producers directors and writers Most of the layers of gatekeepers midlevel executives were stripped away and Lasseter established a routine of personally meeting weekly with filmmakers on all projects in the last year of production and delivering feedback on the spot The studio s team of top creatives who work together closely on the development of its films is known as the Disney Story Trust it is somewhat similar to the Pixar Braintrust but its meetings are reportedly more polite than those of its Pixar counterpart br In Lasseter changed the name of Walt Disney Feature Animation to Walt Disney Animation Studios and re positioned the studio as an animation house that produced both traditional and computer animated projects In order to keep costs down on hand drawn productions animation design and layout were done in house at Disney while clean up animation and digital ink and paint were farmed out to vendors and freelancers br The studio released Meet the Robinsons in its second all CGI film earning million worldwide That same year Disneytoon Studios was also restructured and began to operate as a separate unit under Lasseter and Catmull s control Lasseter s direct intervention with the studio s next film American Dog resulted in the departure of director Chris Sanders who went on to become a director at DreamWorks Animation The film was retooled by new directors Byron Howard and Chris Williams as Bolt which was released in and had the best critical reception of any Disney animated feature since Lilo Stitch and became a moderate financial success receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Film br The Princess and the Frog loosely based on the fairy tale the Frog Prince and the novel The Frog Princess and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker was the studio s first hand drawn animated film in five years A return to the musical comedy format of the s with songs by Randy Newman the film was released in to a positive critical reception and was also nominated for three Academy Awards including two for Best Song The box office performance of The Princess and the Frog a total of million earned worldwide against a million production budget was seen as an underperformance due to competition with Avatar The underperformance was also attributed to the word Princess in the title resulting in future Disney films then in production about princesses being given gender neutral symbolic titles Rapunzel became Tangled and The Snow Queen became Frozen In Disney animator Tom Sito compared the film s box office performance to that of The Great Mouse Detective which was a step up from the theatrical run of the film The Black Cauldron In the studio also produced the computer animated Prep Landing holiday special for the ABC television network br br br Continued resurgence John Lasseter and Ed Catmull s departure br After The Princess and the

develop the technique for future projects including an animated feature br In the studio laid off nine of its hand drawn animators including Nik Ranieri and Ruben A Aquino leading to speculation on animation blogs that the studio was abandoning traditional animation an idea that the studio dismissed Later that same year in November Frozen a CGI musical film inspired by Hans Christian Andersen s
