Process br The production designer will read the script and allocate categories based on the required visual components such as interior exterior location graphic vehicles etc Discussion with the director is essential in the beginning of the production design process In this discussion the production designer will clarify the approach and focus required for the visual design of each scene br The production designer will move to researching which is important in every design process They will use mood board which consists of images sketches inspiration color swatches photos textiles etc that help with the ideation Learning about the time period the place and the culture also assists with coming up with an idea Moreover the PD has to plan to create a convincing space within a budget therefore it is important that the space can speak about the character or enhance the flow of the story rather than being filled with unnecessary decoration Additionally it also affects the location of filming whether it is in a studio or at a specific location br The production designer will ensure that all visual components of the film are complete in all stages of the production process br br br The importance of production design br br Production design plays an essential role in storytelling for instance in the movie Titanic when the characters Jack and Rose are in the cold water after the ship sank we know that they are cold because of the setting it is nighttime and there is ice on their hair A more specific example is The Wizard of Oz in which we know the story takes place on a farm because of the bale of hay Dorothy leans on and the animals around as well as the typical wooden fence In the scene in which Dorothy s dog is taken away we know that it happens in her aunt and uncle s house which adds more tension because her beloved friend Toto is not killed lost or kidnapped on the street but is forced to leave by an outsider Ms Gulch who enters Dorothy s private and safe zone her home Jane Barnwell states that the place the characters exist in gives information about them and enhances the fluency of the narrative Imagine Dorothy s home was dirty and everyone in her house were dressed untidily the viewer would have supported the outsider instead perhaps thinking that the outsider in a way rescued the dog from an unhealthy environment Additionally the characters clothing especially that of Ms Gulch makes the description own half the county more reliable in portraying Ms Gulch and also supports the reason why Dorothy cannot rebel against Ms Gulch by making the dog stay However this does not mean that the setting or costume should be extremely detailed and cluttered with information The goal is to not let the viewer notice these elements which however is how production design works Jon Boorstin states in his book Making Movies Work Thinking Like a Filmmaker that the background the camera motion or even the sound effect is considered well done if the viewer does not notice their appearance br br br Societies and trade organizations br In the United States and British Columbia production designers are represented by several local unions of the
