emotions during certain scenes the team additionally implemented a technique called Katie Vision which implements stock D and live action footage alongside the CG animation br When it came to designing the robot elements the animators went for a sleeker polished design to contrast with the watercolor style for the humans For the PAL MAX Prime robots animation supervisor Alan Hawkins invented a method that allows the robots to break apart mid movement via negative space inspired by the morphing effects used for the T as seen in the film Terminator Judgment Day According to Hawkins he invented tools that would allow animators to slice through the character like a knife and allowed each one to have their different approach as well Mike Lasker served as visual effects supervisor

original adventure that feels stitched together out of a hundred familiar film plots often freely acknowledging its pop cultural plundering as in the family s obligatory slo mo power strut away from a
