the University of Washington Tacoma found that while the film presents climate change as a serious issue that threatens the main characters the film s vagueness around what is causing this undermines the scientific consensus that humans are causing climate change Moore also found that the story contains numerous references to the biblical narrative of Noah s Ark citing as evidence for this connection the fact that the animals largely travel either as pairs or as couples with children to the boat that is to save them Moore ties these religious themes into what she perceives as the film s refusal to fully back anthropogenic climate change br br A tie in video game was published by Vivendi Universal Games br br The third Ice Age film Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs was released on July
