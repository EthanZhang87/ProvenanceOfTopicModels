chief creative officer John Lasseter first approached Stephen Anderson and Don Hall in November about making a new Winnie the Pooh film for theaters with the two becoming enthusiastic at the idea and

Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too to serve as lead storyboard artist for the film with Anderson and Hall directing After seeing all the feature films about Winnie the Pooh Mattinson thought he could use Milne s story In which Eeyore loses his tail and Pooh finds one as the basic idea for the plot Mattinson s five minute pitch for the sequence where Eeyore loses his tail is credited with convincing Disney executives to make the film a feature length work instead of a featurette Regarding the decision to use hand drawn traditional animation in lieu of computer generated imagery CGI Anderson stated that If this were a fully CG animated sic and rendered and lit Pooh it just wouldn t feel right We would be doing the characters a real disservice Many of the animation staff from The Princess and the Frog were brought in to work on Winnie the Pooh as the two films involved traditional animation and additional clean up inbetween animation and digital ink and paint was provided by Yowza
