and awed by the unfamiliar holiday Jack develops an obsession for it br Jack returns home to share his discovery with his friends and neighbors They relate to Christmas Town s ruler Santa Claus or Sandy Claws as Jack mistakingly knows him as but are unfamiliar with the concept of Christmas and conflate its customs with the Halloween traditions that they are used to Frustrated Jack isolates himself in his house and studies Christmas further intent upon finding a way to rationally explain it When days of study and experimentation accomplish nothing however Jack abandons his attempts to understand Christmas and decides to improve the holiday instead br Jack announces that Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year and assigns Christmas themed jobs such as singing carols making presents and building a sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer to various residents Sally the feminine creation of local mad scientist Doctor Finkelstein experiences a vision detailing that their efforts will end disastrously Jack whom she secretly loves dismisses her warnings and instructs her to make a Santa Claus suit for him He also tasks mischievous trick or treating trio Lock Shock and Barrel with abducting Santa however he orders them not to involve his long time rival and their superior Oogie Boogie a bogeyman with a passion for gambling in their plot br When Lock Shock and Barrel bring Santa to Halloween Town Jack tells Santa that he will take care of Christmas this year and orders the trio to keep Santa safe However they disobey Jack s orders and bring Santa to Oogie who plots to play a game with Santa s life at stake Meanwhile despite her best efforts Sally is unable to stop Jack from proceeding with his plan As Jack departs to deliver presents in the real world she attempts to rescue Santa from Oogie only to be captured herself br Unbeknownst to Jack at first his presents terrify the real world s populace who contact the local authorities and are instructed by them to

nonetheless reigniting his love for Halloween but must act fast to set things right br Upon returning home Jack rescues Santa and Sally then confronts Oogie and defeats him by unraveling a thread holding his cloth form together causing all of the bugs inside Oogie to spill out and reduce him to nothing Jack then apologizes to Santa who scolds him for the trouble he caused as well as ignoring Sally s warnings As Santa departs however both he and Sally assure Jack that Christmas can still be saved br Santa resumes his yearly duties as he replaces Jack s presents with genuine ones while all of Halloween Town celebrates Jack s survival and return To assure Jack that there are no hard feelings between them Santa brings a snowfall to the town thereby bringing the Christmas spirit upon it

Glenn Walters Sherwood Ball John Morris and Greg Proops voicing various characters Patrick Stewart recorded narration for a prologue and epilogue While not used in the final film the narration is included on the soundtrack album br br br Production br br br Development br br As writer Tim Burton s upbringing in Burbank California was associated with the feeling of solitude the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween it was great It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn t there before Burton would later recall After completing his short film Vincent in Burton who was then employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation wrote a three page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer How the Grinch Stole Christmas and the poem A Visit from St Nicholas Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor Vincent Price but also considered other options such as a children s book He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs who also sculpted character models Burton later showed his and Heinrichs works in progress to Henry Selick also a Disney animator at the time After the success of Vincent in Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or minute holiday television special However the project s development eventually stalled as its tone seemed too weird to the company As Disney was unable to offer his nocturnal loners enough scope Burton was fired from the studio in and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice and Batman for Warner Bros Pictures br Over the years Burton regularly thought about the project In Burton found out that Disney still owned the film rights He and Selick committed to produce a full length film with the latter as director Burton s own success with live action films piqued the interest of Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg who saw the film as an opportunity to continue the studio s streak of recent successes in feature animation Disney was looking forward to Nightmare to show capabilities of technical and storytelling achievements that were present in Who Framed Roger Rabbit Walt Disney Pictures president David Hoberman believed the film would prove to be a creative achievement for Disney s image elaborating we can think outside the envelope We can do different and unusual things br Nightmare marked Burton s third consecutive film with a Christmas setting Burton could not direct because of his commitment to Batman Returns and he did not want to be involved with the painstakingly slow process of stop motion To adapt his poem into a screenplay Burton approached Michael McDowell his collaborator on Beetlejuice McDowell and Burton experienced creative differences which convinced Burton to make the film as a musical with lyrics and compositions by frequent collaborator Danny Elfman Elfman and Burton created a rough storyline and two thirds of the film s songs Elfman found writing Nightmare s eleven songs to be one of the easiest jobs I ve ever had I had a lot in common with Jack Skellington Caroline Thompson had yet to be hired to write the screenplay With Thompson s screenplay Selick stated there are very few lines of dialogue that are Caroline s She became busy on other films and we were constantly rewriting re configuring and developing the film visually br br br Filming br Selick and his team of animators began production in July in San Francisco California with a crew of over workers utilizing sound stages for filming Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation At the peak of production individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming In total there were frames taken for the film The work of Ray Harryhausen Ladislas Starevich Edward Gorey tienne Delessert Gahan Wilson Charles Addams Jan Lenica Francis Bacon and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers Selick described the production design as akin to a pop up book In addition Selick stated When we reach Halloween Town it s entirely German Expressionism When Jack enters Christmas Town it s an outrageous Dr Seuss esque setpiece Finally when Jack is delivering presents in the Real World everything is plain simple and perfectly aligned Vincent Price Don Ameche and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film s prologue however all proved difficult to cast and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film s soundtrack br On the direction of the film Selick reflected It s as though Burton laid the egg and I sat on it and hatched it He wasn t involved in a hands on way but his hand is in it It was my job to make it look like a Tim Burton film which is not so different from my own films When asked about Burton s involvement Selick claimed I don t want to take away from Tim but he was not in San Francisco when we made it He came up five times over two years and spent no more than eight or ten days in total Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with digital effects and some second layering traditional animation Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was simultaneously filming Batman Returns and pre production of Ed Wood br The filmmakers constructed puppets to represent the characters in the movie with Jack Skellington having around four hundred heads allowing the expression of every possible emotion Sally s mouth movements were animated through the replacement method During the animation process only Sally s face mask was removed in order to preserve the order of her long red hair Sally had ten types of faces each made with a series of eleven expressions e g eyes open and closed and various facial poses and synchronized mouth movements The stop motion figurine of Jack was reused in James and the Giant Peach also directed by Selick as Captain Jack br br br Soundtracks br br The film s soundtrack album was released in on Walt Disney Records The film s soundtrack contains bonus tracks including a longer prologue and an

However the last song is the soundtrack for the Disneyland Haunted Mansion Holiday ride br br br Release br The Nightmare Before Christmas was originally going to be released under Walt Disney Pictures as part of the Walt Disney Feature Animation lineup but Disney decided to release the film under the studio s adult oriented Touchstone Pictures banner because the studio thought the film would be too dark and scary for kids Selick remembered Their biggest fear and why it was kind of a stepchild project was they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming To convey Burton s involvement and attract a wider audience Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton s The Nightmare Before Christmas Burton explained that it turned more into more of a brand name thing it

Around the release of the film Hoberman was quoted I hope Nightmare goes out and makes a fortune If it does great If it doesn t that doesn t negate the validity of the process The budget was less than

acclaim Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade B on an A to F scale br Roger Ebert praised the film s visual inventiveness One of the many pleasures of Tim Burton s The Nightmare Before Christmas is that there is not a single recognizable landscape in it Everything looks strange and haunting Even Santa Claus would be difficult to recognize without his red and white uniform He wrote that it presented a world that is as completely new as the worlds we saw for the first time in such films as Metropolis The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and Star Wars What all of these films have in common is a visual richness so abundant they deserve more than one viewing He wrote that The songs by Danny Elfman are fun too a couple of them using lyrics so clever they could be updated from Gilbert Sullivan And the choreography liberated from gravity and reality has an energy of its own as when the furniture the architecture and the very landscape itself gets in on the act He notes that some of the Halloween creatures might be a tad scary for smaller children but this is the kind of movie older kids will eat up it has the kind of offbeat subversive energy that tells them wonderful things are likely to happen br Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it a restoration of originality and daring to the Halloween genre This dazzling mix of fun and fright also explodes the notion that animation is kid stuff It s minutes of timeless movie magic James Berardinelli stated The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone For the kids it s a fantasy celebrating two holidays For the adults it s an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marveling at how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques There are songs laughs and a little romance In short The Nightmare Before Christmas does what it intends to entertain Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed the film s similarities to the writings of Oscar Wilde and the Brothers Grimm as well as The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and other German Expressionist films br Michael A Morrison discusses the influence of Dr Seuss How the Grinch Stole Christmas on the film writing that Jack parallels the Grinch and Zero parallels Max the Grinch s dog Philip Nel writes that the film challenges the wisdom of adults through its trickster characters contrasting Jack as a good trickster with Oogie Boogie whom he also compares with Seuss Dr Terwilliker as a bad trickster Entertainment Weekly reports that fan reception of these characters borders on obsession profiling Laurie and Myk Rudnick a couple whose degree of obsession with the film is so great that they named their son after the real life person that a character in the film is based on This enthusiasm for the characters has also been profiled as having spread beyond North America to Japan Yvonne Tasker notes the complex characterization seen in The Nightmare Before Christmas br br br Accolades br The
