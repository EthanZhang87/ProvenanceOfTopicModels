that his experience with the remote was a warning rather than a dream Michael throws away the remote before going to enjoy the company of his family br br On July Sony purchased Steve Koren and Mark O Keefe s spec script Click for million with plans for it to be an Adam Sandler film produced by Revolution Studios Columbia Pictures and Neal H Moritz s company Original Film the purchase occurred as Bruce Almighty also written by Koren and O Keefe had grossed million domestically in its two month run Click was the second comedy Moritz produced for Columbia Pictures after Not Another Teen Movie Although Sony planned filming to begin in April after Sandler finished shooting Spanglish that was postponed for Koren and O Keefe to rewrite the script under the supervision of Juan Jos Campanella who was announced as director in May However he was replaced by Frank Coraci who directed the Sandler films The Wedding Singer and The Waterboy in March Executive producer Tim Herlihy also revised the script Christopher Walken joined the cast on February br Imageworks began working on the film s digital effects in January without any research and development While most of the effects were shot compositings three dimensional graphics were also made for the display on the remote and matte painting a few settings such as the Bed and Beyond warehouse a city background at Michael s workplace and the winter backyard at his home programs such as Cinema D and Autodesk Maya were used to produce the graphics In order to make the fast forwarding and rewinding look DVD like effects of interlaced video and scan lines slicing through were added Motion control photography and green screen effects were used for scenes where Michael looked back on his life with the remote meaning that were occasionally two Michaels in the same shot while rotoscoping was used for the sequence where he changes the color of his face with the remote br For scenes where Michael pauses his surroundings the effects crew originally planned for everything to be frozen including the environment however they found out this bothered the eye thus switching the plan to only the characters being frozen while the environment such as leaves on the trees being blown by wind keeps in motion The primary challenge for the freeze shots was sharpening the frozen characters as much as possible there were some cases where the characters would freeze in a very active moment causing the effects team to have to work with the motion blur that resulted from it For instances where characters were frozen in a moment where they were still they were filmed staying in that position for seconds so that during post production the average of multiple frames would create a result absent of film grain br br Click s official website debuted in late December consisting only of the film s official trailer C S Strowbridge of The Numbers called the trailer better than I expected It seems like Adam Sandler is serious about maturing as an actor Other interactive features and pages were added later on such as a plot summary image gallery information about the cast and crew audio and video clips and a Control Your Universe poster generator br The film screened out of competition at the San Sebastian International Film Festival The film was released in the United States on June and made its UK premiere in a London Empire Cinema on September br br Click was released on DVD Blu ray and UMD on October by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment It was the first dual layer Blu ray disc released by Sony br br Before Click s theatrical run Strowbridge predicted on the basis of a weak critical reception and the commercial failure of a similar dramedy attempt of Sandler s Spanglish Click would be one of his lesser hits however he suggested it could still gross up to million due to its mixture of comedy and drama elements The weekend before the film s release Nikki Finke projected an opening weekend gross of million due to similarly high numbers of prior Sony produced Sandler comedies such as First Dates Mr Deeds and Anger Management The day before the film s theatrical start Entertainment Weekly s Joshua Rich projected Click to have a million opening weekend and a total overall gross of million for its broadly appealing high concept and the inclusion of Adam Sandler and Kate Beckinsale in lead roles br Domestically Click opened in theaters and debuted at number one at the box office grossing million on its opening day and million in its opening weekend Sony distributed the film in a hugely successful year as it was their seventh number one hit of Groups of viewers outside the young male demographic were also higher than previous Sandler films Sony s exit polls showed of attendees being female and over the age of Click was also one of the only three films to surpass a theater average that weekend with the other two were Wassup Rockers and Leonard Cohen I m Your Man both of which played at one theater br Strowbridge predicted that in its second weekend Click would fall and gross million due to intense competition with Superman Returns However while Click grossed approximately that amount and got dethroned by the superhero film as expected by analysts what wasn t anticipated was that The Devil Wears Prada would open with double the gross initially projected as a result The Devil Wears Prada made million in three days and placed Click in the number three spot br During its third weekend when the record breaking Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man s Chest debuted Click had the second strongest hold of all competitors in the top five it dropped only from the prior weekend while Pixar s Cars went down The Devil Wears Prada and Superman Returns Click also surpassed the million mark that weekend making it the seventh Sandler film to gross that amount It later grossed million in the United States and million internationally with a total gross of million worldwide br

countries and increasing the total gross to million br br Rotten Tomatoes gave Click a score of based on reviews The average score is a and the consensus is This latest Adam Sandler vehicle borrows shamelessly from It s a Wonderful Life and Back to the Future and fails to produce the necessary laughs that would forgive such imitation Metacritic gave it a score of out of based on reviews which indicates mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale Peter Bradshaw opined Click was an improvement over the previous Sandler flick Mr Deeds It has some moments of good natured sweetness and Adam Sandler is improving as a comic performer though he is still conceited and opaque br The film was criticized for its gross out humor and unlikeable protagonist Entertainment Weekly critic Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote Click failed at being It s a Wonderful Life because Michael earns none of George Bailey s mature wisdom honestly br When it came to positive reviews Newsweek claimed Click was predictable as a moral story but unusually dark occasionally touching and pretty funny for a Sandler comedy Empire s Sam Toy enjoyed the film for its smart and genuinely moving ideas Beckinsale s performance and a strong third act although dismissed the script for being overstuffed the first half of the film for Sandler being too restrained in his everyman role and actors such as Coolidge Hasselhoff and Walken for being put in small roles br br th Academy Awards Best Makeup Nominated br rd People s Choice Awards Favorite Movie Comedy Won br
