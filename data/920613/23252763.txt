Mike tells Sulley You ve been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade Scanlon said he had a dilemma with this line during pre production but he believed it was best if Mike and Sulley meet in college because we wanted to see their relationship develop when they were adults And we also felt like college is so much about self discovery and figuring out who you are He added It felt like the perfect place to do this but we had that line So we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college And we knew we didn t want to make Monsters Elementary Scanlon said during pre production that Pete Docter the original director and John Lasseter finally said to me it s great that you re honoring that but you have to do what s right for the story So we made a tough decision to just have them be in college and put that line aside Scanlon joked that the line from the first film was an old monster expression saying That s what monsters always say to each other br

became increasingly complex as the models and the setups became more technologically advanced The new lighting system uses path tracing a technique that imitates the behavior of the light in the real

four stars out of four saying it is true to the spirit of Monsters Inc and matches its tone But it never seems content to turn over old ground Trevor Johnston of Time Out gave the film four stars out of five writing It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of its fluffy furred cuteness has melted away For a mere prequel that s a result Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three stars out of four and said it is cute and funny and the animation though not exactly inspired is certainly colorful Jake Coyle of Associated Press gave the film three stars out of four saying it might not be as gifted as some of its other movies but sometimes it s alright to be OK Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three stars out of four and said It s all infectious fun despite the lack of originality In the art of tickling funny bones Crystal and Goodman earn straight A s Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review saying This minor film with major charms still deserves to have kids dragging their parents to the multiplex for one more peek at the monsters in the closet With Pixar familiarity breeds content Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film three and a half stars out of five and said it is one of those movies that has absolutely no reason to exist but once you ve seen it you re kind of glad it does Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review saying Monsters University feels not like the work of artists eager to express something but like that of likable pros whose existence depends on getting a rise out the kids It s like the scares Sully and Mike spring on those sleeping tykes technically impressive but a job un anchored to anything more meaningful br Leonard Maltin of IndieWire praised the animation and art direction but wrote that he wished the movie was funnier and wasn t so plot heavy and that Pixar has raised the bar for animated features so high that when they turn out a film that s merely good instead of great they have only themselves to blame for causing critics to damn them with faint praise Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four saying Monsters University the weirdly charmless sequel to the animated Pixar hit Monsters Inc is no better or worse than the average and I mean average time filling sequel cranked out by other animation houses Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review saying that it never surprises goes off in unexpected directions or throws you for a loop in the manner of the best Pixar stories Nor does it come close to elating through the sheer imagination of its conceits and storytelling Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three stars out of four and said it may not be as inventive as Inc but it s an amusing and amiable addition to Pixar s roster of animated coming of age stories Michael O Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film three stars out of four saying It may be children s terror that powers the movie s fictional universe but it s the energy of its stars that lights up Monsters University Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A and said it is exactly the rebound Pixar needed after s Cars left some wondering if the studio had lost its magic The delightful story of when Mike met Sulley puts those concerns to rest James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three stars out of four and wrote Although it falls short of the best Pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with Disney it s nevertheless worth a trip to the theater especially for kids br Not all reviews were positive Richard Roeper gave the film a C saying This is a safe predictable edge free nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets Stephen Whitty of Newark Star Ledger gave the film two and a half stars out of four and said The artwork is accomplished and intricate The G rating is genuine without any gross out gags And there s none of the usual winks to the adults with tired pop culture references Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film two and a half stars out of five and wrote Both the originality and stirring emotional complexity of Monsters Inc with its exquisitely painful and touching parallels with the human world are missing Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film two and a half stars out of four and said This is not a bad movie and to small children it will be a very good one but it s closer to average than one would wish from the company that gave us Up WALL E The Incredibles and the Toy Story series Rene Rodriguez of Miami Herald gave the film two stars out of five and wrote that it feels half hearted and lazy like they weren t even trying At least show a little effort guys br br Monsters University marks the first Pixar film not to be nominated for either an Oscar or a Golden Globe br br Official website br Monsters
