The Fiat Italian Cinquecento pronounced t i kwe t nto is an economy city car that was manufactured and marketed by Fiat Automobiles from until It was sold as a two door semi convertible or saloon car and as a three door panel van or estate car br Launched as the Nuova new in July as a successor to the Topolino it was an inexpensive and practical small car Measuring metres feet inches long and originally powered by a rear mounted cc two cylinder air cooled engine the was centimetres inches smaller than Fiat s launched two years earlier and is considered one of the first purpose designed city cars br In Dante Giacosa received a Compasso d Oro industrial design prize for the Fiat This marked the first time a Compasso d Oro was awarded to an automotive manufacturer br br In Fiat released the front engine Fiat Topolino economy car In to meet the demands of the post war market production resumed as the C with revised front and rear bodywork Initially it only had a door coup body with sun roof like before the war which was later complemented by an Estate version importantly offering some family valued rear seating space Both continued until when they were replaced by an all new lighter car The new car had a rear mounted engine on the pattern of the Volkswagen Beetle just like its bigger brother the Fiat Several car makers followed the until then uncommon rear engine and drive configuration at the time and were quite successful From October a Neckar version of the was manufactured in Heilbronn Germany under a complicated deal involving NSU motorcars and Steyr Puch produced a Fiat version under licence in Graz Austria br Despite its very small size the proved to be an enormously practical vehicle with large sales throughout Europe Besides the two door coup it was also available as the Giardiniera estate this variant featured the standard engine laid on its side the wheelbase lengthened by cm in to provide a more convenient rear seat a full length sunroof and larger brakes from the Fiat br Sports models were produced by Abarth as well as by Giannini An Austrian variant produced by Steyr Daimler Puch the Steyr Puch had a Puch boxer twin motor a sports model of which was the Steyr Puch TR br Production of the ended in although its replacement the Fiat was launched two years earlier The was not as successful as its predecessor in Italy but sold well in the Eastern Bloc countries being assembled and manufactured in Poland as a Polski Fiat The Fiat has a Cx aerodynamic resistance coefficient of a very good performance for its time br In the magazine Top Gear voted the Fiat the sexiest car br In the th anniversary of the Nuova s launch Fiat launched another new stylistically inspired by the Nuova featuring a front mounted engine and front wheel drive br In Fiat celebrated the th anniversary with an exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and received one of the Corporate Art Awards by pptArt at an event hosted by the President of the Italian Republic Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace br br The features a cc cc nominal two cylinder engine hence the name producing just horsepower This model also features a fabric roof foldable to the rear of the vehicle like that of a Fiat Topolino rather than the later roof design which only folds half way back along the roof The Nuova is one of three models featuring suicide doors br Including the Sport model in total examples of the Nuova were produced from until br br In mid Fiat introduced the Nuova Sport featuring a more powerful engine and a two tone livery white with a red stripe along the flanks Unique to the Sport was an all metal rigid roof with three longitudinal grooves A short open roof model was added a year later in br Coded type the Sport s two cylinder engine had been bored out to cc from the original cc bore and stroke now mm giving it a very respectable horsepower with the same block PS kW hp Top speed was over km h mph br br Replacing the original Nuova in the D looks very similar to the Nuova but there are two key differences One is the engine size the D features an uprated cc engine producing bhp as standard this engine is used right through until the end of the L in and the other is the roof the standard D roof does not fold back as far as the roof on the Nuova though it was also available as the Transformable with the same roof as the Nuova The D also features suicide doors br In New Zealand where it was locally assembled by Torino Motors the D was sold as the Fiat Bambina Italian for baby a name that is still in use there to describe this car br br The Giardiniera K on some markets estate version of the Fiat is the longest running model The engine is laid under the floor of the boot to create a flat loading surface The roof on this model also stretches all the way to the rear not stopping above the driver and front passenger as it does in other models of the same period The Giardiniera also features suicide doors and was the only model to continue to use this door type into the s In production was transferred to Desio where the Giardiniera was built by Fiat subsidiary Autobianchi under their marque from to A total of Giardinieras were produced and from sold only as Autobianchi Giardiniera br br A panel van variant of the Giardiniera estate was offered as the Furgoncino br br The F spans two periods of production the D and the L As such it is the most frequently misidentified model Between and the F carried the same badging as the D but the two models are distinguishable by the positioning of their door hinges The D has suicide doors the F produced from June at last featured front hinged doors Between and the F was sold alongside the Lusso model as a cheaper base model alternative While the F and L are mechanically very similar the key differences are the bumpers the L has an extra chrome nudge bar and the interior the F interior is nearly identical to the original design while the L sports a much more modern look br br In September Fiat put on sale the L or Lusso tipo F L a more richly trimmed and better appointed version of the standard F The L remained on sale until when the new Fiat was introduced br Perhaps the most obvious new feature of the L were tubular guards protecting the front bumper and the corners of the rear one As a result the car was about cm in longer than the F at mm in Other model specific exterior items were a new Fiat badge at the front redesigned hubcaps chrome plastic mouldings covering the roof drip rails and bright trim around windscreen and rear window Inside the dashboard was entirely covered in black anti glare plastic material instead of being bare painted metal and was fitted with a new trapezoid instrument binnacle replacing the round one used on all other models The steering wheel was black plastic with metal spokes The door cards upholstered in the same pleated pattern leatherette used on the seats carried redesigned and relocated door handles and new door pockets More storage space was provided in the form of a tray on the centre tunnel which like the rest of the floor was covered in carpet rather than rubber mats br Except for radial instead of bias ply tires from a mechanical standpoint the L was identical to the coeval F br br The last incarnation of the Fiat was the R model or Rinnovata Renovated Launched alongside the new Fiat in November it had the same cc engine of the however the power rating is the same as the L but at lower rpm instead of and with a bit more torque a full synchromesh gearbox is still missing The floor pan which was from either the L or later the new It was also more comfortable but more simply trimmed and equipped than before the fuel gauge was omitted and only the low fuel indicator remained The R was also a stop gap for Fiat prior to the launch of the Fiat and when the new was launched sales of the old Fiat R plummeted It was sold alongside the Fiat for another three years before Fiat retired the br br During the years in which it was produced the in Italy Fiat designed and produced a US market version of the car with prominent headlamps also used on the American Jolly About were made between and br br Of all the performance oriented models created by Karl Abarth later known as Carlo Abarth perhaps the esse esse is the best representation of the scorpion branded firm s collaboration with Fiat Around Fiat Abarth SS were produced and only are believed to remain br Abarth introduced its SS version in after the previous presentation back in The rear engine rear wheel drive layout Fiat was the basis of the project When compared to the production version of the aesthetically the was virtually identical except for the logo badge on the radiator grille and the coat of arms on both sides of the car The SS was the only version to feature flared arches and the need to raise the engine cover for extra stability and cooling br Like all Abarths the differences are found in the mechanical upgrades that helped to increase its top speed to around km h mph The OHV valves per cylinder inline two engine exhaust pipe head and valve springs were upgraded and specially designed pistons and camshaft fitted It had an equal square bore and stroke ratio of mm mm in in for a total displacement of cc L cu in and the original single Solex PBIC carburetor was increased in size with a compression ratio of developing PS bhp kW at rpm and N m lbf ft of torque at rpm br br Carrozzeria Ghia custom manufactured a Jolly variant of the inspired by the limited edition Fiat Jolly and featuring an open air doorless design with wicker seats and a removable fabric canopy roof similar in concept to the Citro n M hari BMC
