University Dan Scanlon was encouraged to develop personal stories He did not talk to his brother about the film because he wanted to keep him in the dark as these movies take so long to make In July then studio head of Pixar John Lasseter announced that a suburban fantasy world film at the D Expo was in development with Scanlon directing and Kori Rae producing The film was inspired by the death of Scanlon s father when he was just a year old and his older brother only three and their relationship with each other They had seen home videos about their father but there was no audio Scanlon

houses put for rent Ian tries to silence them with the staff but the spell is too weak When Ian and the goat girl are finally in a trance the mermaids place them in one of the houses The house they are in starts to sink into the ground br The goat girl was omitted because the filmmakers wanted the film to focus on the relationship between Ian and Barley The scene itself was removed because the filmmakers felt it was too grim br br According to effects supervisor Vincent Serritella the animators wanted the spells to be something that s abstract but also personify it so they had to converge on the idea of an image of magic go back to the base level of the sequences and the spells and what level of complexity would be given and how it affects the environment Director Dan Scanlon said that Ian s arc was helpful to the animators because they could use that for all of the magic we designed The animators chose to give the film s magic a unique style after studying several animated films featuring magic such as Fantasia Aladdin and Hercules Animators wanted the film s magic to fit with its suburban setting br Animators first developed the film s magic using hand drawn animated drawings before turning them into computer animated effects with Serritella saying that they made shapes and graphic elements that really lend themselves to what s happening in a D environment Serritella also said that the key was mixing hand drawn and computer animation arguing that g oing one way or the other didn t work Going too graphic didn t fit into the world that the background and the characters were created in And going too physical in an animated world seemed too real so they found the right balance by turning hand drawn animated graphics into light objects and giving them a true volumetric glowing atmosphere He further added that the choreography during the visitation spell sequence came directly from D while the CGI animation and lighting provided depth perception The film was completed on November br br On April Mychael and Jeff Danna who both previously worked with the studio on The Good Dinosaur were revealed to be the film s composers On February Brandi Carlile
