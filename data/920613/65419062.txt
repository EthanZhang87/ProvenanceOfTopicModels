consist of minute episodes When working on Toy Story Hobson and Yates realized that they had pretty different interpretations of how their creative meetings went so they used these differing interpretations to develop the idea of an animated series revolving around one event but with each character having their own conflicts surrounding the event Hobson explained that Win or Lose has all the humor and heart of a Pixar feature film but with a different type of storytelling She also stated It s less of a Rashomon and more You think you know a character and then you pull back the curtain and reveal they have their own thing going on Hobson and Yates also executive produced the series alongside Andrew Stanton and Lindsey Collins br Win or Lose is Pixar s first long form animated series as well as the first not to be based upon an existing property as most of Pixar s television projects are based upon an existing property and short form Pixar began considering developing a TV series following the creation of Disney Yates and Hobson said one of the reasons a TV show format was selected for the series was the idea of experimenting with the format and longer storytelling particularly regarding character perspectives as well as a love for television Another reason was how television would allow Pixar to do things a feature film format would not allow to Hobson and Yates noted they both had to learn how to work on an episodic format On July Lally confirmed on X that post production for the series was completed br br br Writing br According to Hobson and Yates a major theme on the series is how things are not as they seem and seeing things from different perspectives particularly how people in one place can suffer different experiences Each episode centers on a different character characters are first introduced in a different episode after which their episode further explores the said character after the perception first given in their debut Hobson said the characters were inspired by her and Yates as well as by people they have met through their lives and their own experiences br br br Casting br On September during the D Expo it was announced that
