Ultra HD Blu ray K Ultra HD UHD BD or K Blu ray is a digital optical disc data storage format that is an enhanced variant of Blu ray Ultra HD Blu ray supports K UHD pixel resolution video at frame rates up to progressive frames per second encoded using High Efficiency Video Coding These discs are incompatible with existing standard Blu ray players br The discs support both high dynamic range by increasing the color depth to bit per color and a greater color gamut than supported by conventional Blu ray video by using the Rec color space Ultra HD Blu Ray discs also support a bit per color container via Dolby Vision Dolby Vision content on K UHD Blu Ray can also be mastered for nits peak brightness whereas standard HDR can only achieve a maximum of nits of brightness Moreover Dolby Vision makes use of dynamic metadata which adjusts the brightness and tone mapping per scene In contrast standard HDR only makes use of static metadata which sets the same brightness and tone mapping for the entirety of the content br The first Ultra HD Blu ray Discs were officially released in the United States on February To differentiate retail Ultra HD Blu ray releases the format usually uses a black opaque or largely transparent keep case packaging format as opposed to blue but with the same case size as standard Blu ray The format is supported on Microsoft s Xbox One X One S Series X and Sony s PlayStation Software made for the PlayStation can use GB UHD Blu ray discs br br br Specifications br br The specification for K Blu ray allows for three disc capacities each with its own data rate GB at or Mbit s and GB and GB at or Mbit s On GB and GB discs the pits and lands are not narrower than those of a standard Blu ray Disc but shorter which increases the capacity of each layer from GB to GB This also means that each revolution of such a disc transfers more data than that of a standard Blu ray Disc which means the transfer rate is higher with the same linear velocity In addition the disc can be encoded to have the drive hold the full rpm until it reaches a point largely away from the innermost part of the disc if an even higher transfer rate is needed and GB use two layers and GB uses three layers Ultra HD Blu ray technology was licensed in mid and players had an expected release date of Christmas Ultra HD Blu ray uses a new revision of AACS DRM AACS AACS is used on certain releases such as Stand by Me Fury The Patriot and Zombieland br On May the Blu ray Disc Association revealed completed specifications and the official Ultra HD Blu ray logo Unlike conventional DVDs and Blu rays the new K format does not have region coding br On February the BDA released Ultra HD Blu ray with mandatory support for HDR Media Profile video and optional support for Dolby Vision br In December the BDA also settled the specification for an K Blu ray format for use in Japan More than two hours of K UHD content can be recorded on BDXL discs GB quad layer GB triple layer br On January the BDA spec v gained optional support for HDR and for SL HDR developed by Philips and Technicolor also known as Advanced HDR by Technicolor However no Ultra HD Blu ray player has ever supported SL HDR and no discs encoded in SL HDR have been released br br br Advanced HDR by Technicolor br The term Advanced HDR as used by Technicolor covers a group of three Technicolor HDR technologies SL HDR Single Layer HDR SL HDR SL HDR br br br SL HDR br According to Technicolor Technicolor has developed a single layer solution known as Technicolor HDR ETSI standard SL HDR which ensures backwards compatibility with all non HDR screens and non HDR equipment Broadcasters just need to produce a single feed and the technology allows content to be converted into a format for both legacy screens and HDR screens br br br Ultra HD Blu ray disc encoding br Most retail Ultra HD Blu ray discs are encoded with Ateme TITAN Ultra HD Blu ray discs use HDMV or BD J for menus Subtitles use Presentation Graphic Stream which is the same format as normal Blu ray discs br br br PC playback br Only computers with activated Software Guard Extensions SGX support Ultra HD Blu ray playback Intel introduced SGX in the Skylake generation Core processors in enabling PCs to play protected Blu ray discs for the first time In January Intel deprecated support for SGX for the Rocket Lake and Alder Lake generation desktop processors leading to Ultra HD Blu ray discs being unplayable on those systems even with licensed software such as PowerDVD However on systems without SGX support Ultra HD Blu ray discs can be ripped using a drive with patched firmware LibreDrive and compatible software such as MakeMKV DVDFab or AnyDVD HD br br br K format br The Blu ray Disc Association also completed the specification for an K Blu ray format supporting K UHD pixel resolution videos for use in Japan However a spokesperson from the association said that the release of such a format would be unlikely This may be partly driven due to lower than expected sales of K resolution televisions br br br
