problem was unavoidable Chris Farley had died and the story had been geared around him so when he went the story kind of went with him It went through an upheaval while they tried to find the right tone for it I think they were really close to shelving the project when a few of us came into story to try and find a tone that we could work with When Kelly Asbury moved on to Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron I became head of story along with Randy Cartwright Along with Andrew Adamson who stayed on as director we started pulling little pieces together out of what remained and part of the way through Jeffrey decided that I should be directing A few months later we started production br Jenson described the directing process as one in which we didn t try to figure out how to make adolescents laugh You have to use yourself as the best judge and use your own instincts We figured if we laughed at it chances are good someone else would too According to Adamson the co directors mutually decided to split the work in half so the crew could at least know whom to go to with specific questions about the film s sequences We both ended up doing a lot of everything We re both kinda control freaks and we both wanted to do everything Following the success of Shrek Jenson went on to co direct Shark Tale with Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman In while working on Shark Tale Jenson
