in foster care to find her forever family The main inspiration for Sam and her unluckyness came from television shows such as I Love Lucy and The Carol Burnett Show along with other inspiration from Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton and Donald O Connor In researching luck workers at Skydance Animation discovered how obsessed people are with the concept along with some interesting reversals including how it became random by good and bad luck For example black cats are considered good luck in Scotland which led them to create Bob By the end of the film he is revealed to be English as black cats are considered bad luck in England The land of Luck was designed by production designer Fred Warner to explain both sides being put of a coin br br br Casting br In April Emma Thompson was hired to voice

average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews br Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian rated the film two stars out of five describing the script as utterly zingless and contorted and writing Everything about this robotically made movie looks derivative and contrived the videogame aesthetic is dull and the quirky high concept plays like a pound shop knockoff of Inside Out and Soul John Anderson of The Wall Street Journal wrote The bigger problem is there are too many ideas and fantastical solutions to manufactured problems most of which feel as if they re being made up as the movie goes along IndieWire s David Ehrlich gave it a D grade calling it is a terrible idea for a movie executed poorly and by someone who used to know better The best thing I can say about the finished product is that unlike most forms of bad luck this one is wonderfully easy to avoid altogether br The Sydney Morning Herald s Paul Byrnes gave the film stars writing It has lively physical humour and appealing characters The Scottish cat is a laugh and the overall voice cast is distinguished with Jane Fonda and Whoopi Goldberg in significant roles But at minutes it s at least minutes too long with a complicated story that should have been smoothed out in development The Daily Telegraph s Robbie Collin gave it stars calling it a funny imaginative beautifully rendered coming of age parable with strong overtones of Monsters Inc and Inside Out br br br Accolades br br br Short film br On March in celebration of St Patrick s Day Apple TV released
