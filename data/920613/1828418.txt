Route is an American adventure crime drama television series that premiered on CBS on October and ran until March for a total of episodes The series was created by Herbert B Leonard and Stirling Silliphant who were also responsible for the ABC drama Naked City from which Route was an indirect spin off Both series employed a format with elements of both traditional drama and anthology drama but the difference was where the shows were set Naked City was set in New York City while Route had its setting change from week to week with each episode being shot on location br Route followed two young men traversing the United States in a Chevrolet Corvette convertible and the events and consequences surrounding their journeys Martin Milner starred as Tod Stiles a recent college graduate with no future prospects because of circumstances beyond his control He was originally joined on his travels by Buz Murdock played by George Maharis a friend and former employee of his father s with the character leaving midway through the third season after contracting echovirus Near the end of the third season Tod met a recently discharged Vietnam veteran named Lincoln Case played by Glenn Corbett who decided to follow Tod on his travels and stayed with him until the final episode br br br Format and characters br br Route was a hybrid between episodic television drama which has continuing characters and situations and the anthology format in which each week s show has a completely different cast and story In this narrative format dubbed semianthology by the trade magazine Variety the drama usually centers on the guest stars rather than the regular cast Series creator Stirling Silliphant s concurrently running drama Naked City also followed this semianthology format br br br Original concept and trial pilot br In the original concept under discussion between Silliphant and producer Leonard the two series leads were to be ex army men who had left the service and were looking to re establish themselves in American life George Maharis was signed to a contract by Leonard before the Route concept had been fully developed and was set to be a cast member from the beginning Actor Robert Morris was set to be the other lead br Morris was cast beside Maharis in a episode of Naked City that was written by Silliphant as a backdoor pilot to a potential spin off series featuring two young travelers who were looking to find themselves At that point the Route title was not yet decided upon and the potential spin off was tentatively entitled The Searchers The Naked City episode that served as the Searchers pilot was called Four Sweet Corners and in it Maharis played Johnny Gary while Morris was Link Ridgeway Both were ex servicemen After spending most of the episode rescuing Johnny s kid sister from a shoplifting ring the two friends decided they were too restless to stay in New York City and more of the world existed that they had to see Johnny and Link ended the episode by leaving Johnny s family s apartment building setting out for parts unknown br The half hour pilot and the chemistry between the leads was judged to be good by the producers although Leonard could not interest a network or a sponsor in the spin off show Morris was replaced with Martin Milner for the reworked version that occurred before the death of Morris in May at age br The concept was subsequently reworked The title of the series became Route the leads became Tod and Buz and neither had ties to the army Maharis was given the role of Buz while Martin Milner beat several actors including Robert Redford for the role of Tod Leonard personally financed the shooting of a new hour long pilot episode Black November written by Silliphant and CBS picked up the series in br br br Character profiles br br Tod and Buz and later Linc symbolized restless youth searching for meaning in the early s The two men take odd jobs along their journey like toiling in a California vineyard or manning a Maine lobster boat bringing them in contact with dysfunctional families or troubled individuals in need of help The lead characters are not always the focus of any given episode and their backstories are revealed only in occasional references across widely spaced episodes br Tod Stiles portrayed by clean cut Milner is the epitome of the decent honest all American type Tod came from a background of wealth and privilege his father owned a shipping company and Tod s early years were spent in New York and Connecticut He attended Yale but after the death of his father Tod discovered that his father s business had essentially gone bankrupt The only legacy left to Tod was a new Corvette br Buz Murdock meanwhile was an orphan who had worked with Tod s father as a laborer on one of his ships in New York City After the death of the senior Mr Stiles and the subsequent collapse of his business Tod and Buz decided to drive across America in search of work adventure and themselves The working class Buz George Maharis is looser hipper and more Beat Generation in attitude than Tod though the two characters share a mutual respect Subtle indications were given that the Buz character was intended to loosely embody Jack Kerouac in appearance and attitude Kerouac in fact contemplated a lawsuit against Leonard Silliphant and Chevrolet for misappropriating the characters and theme from his iconic novel On the Road br Toward the end of the second season Maharis was absent for several episodes due to a bout of infectious hepatitis He returned for the start of the third season but was again absent for a number of episodes before leaving the show entirely midway through season three Consequently in numerous episodes in late season two and early season three Tod travels solo while Buz is said to be in the hospital with echovirus Tod is often seen writing to Buz in these episodes or having a one sided phone conversation with him Tod appears solo in episodes br Buz made his final appearance in a January episode and was then out of the show without a definitive explanation the character simply stopped appearing and was never referenced again After five consecutive solo Tod stories Tod gained a new traveling companion named Lincoln Case Glenn Corbett in March Case is a United States Army veteran of the Vietnam conflict haunted by his past Tod met Linc in Fifty Miles From Home where Linc fought with an aspiring basketball player outside a Houston bus station Linc severely injured the young man whom Tod was coaching and training and the incensed Tod followed Linc to his hometown where he challenged him to a fistfight After some prolonged bloody sweaty pugilistic choreography the two came to an understanding of where Linc had been in life There Linc became Tod s new traveling companion Linc was more introspective than the often extroverted Buz but he had like Buz a sometimes explosive temper Linc was nonetheless a reliable companion as the duo continued their travels br The series concluded in Tampa Florida with the two part episode Where There s a Will There s a Way in which Tod Stiles married a Houston Texas commodities trader played by guest star Barbara Eden and Linc announced his intention to return home to his family in Texas after a long period of estrangement from his father Tod and his new wife headed back to Houston and offered to take Linc who had to remind Tod how small the car was The scene ends with Linc walking up a hill after loading the couple s luggage into the Corvette This episode made the series one of the earlier primetime television dramas to have a planned series finale resolving the fate of its main characters The show was filmed and presented in black and white throughout its run br br br Locations br Route shot each episode on location around the country Writer producer Stirling Silliphant traveled with location manager Sam Manners to a wide range of locales and wrote scripts to match the settings The actors and film crew would arrive some time later Locations included a logging camp shrimp boats an offshore oil rig Riverside Raceway and Glen Canyon Dam the latter while still under construction br The show had little connection with the U S Highway providing its name Most of the locations were far from The Mother Road which passed through

Route was officially created by producer Herbert B Leonard and writer Stirling Silliphant Silliphant wrote the majority of the episodes including the pilot while Leonard did not write at all It was

its premiere Route is still one of the few TV series to offer such a range of socially conscious stories including mercy killing the threat of nuclear annihilation terrorism runaways and orphans Other episodes dealt with the mentally ill lupus drug addiction or gang violence br Some stories were lighthearted such as a memorable episode featuring Richard Basehart as a folklorist trying to record the
