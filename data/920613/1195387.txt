significantly underperformed He returned to Pixar to develop Incredibles which was released in and became the second highest grossing animated film of all time br Bird has a reputation for supervising his projects to a high degree of detail Some commentators have drawn parallels between Bird s films and novelist Ayn Rand s Objectivism philosophy an analysis Bird has dismissed He advocates for creative freedom and the possibilities of animation and has criticized its stereotype as children s entertainment or classification as a genre rather than art br br br Early life br br Brad Bird was born in Kalispell Montana the youngest of four children to Marjorie A n e Cross and Philip Cullen Bird His father worked in the propane business and his grandfather Francis Wesley Frank Bird who was born in County Sligo Ireland was a president and chief executive of the Montana Power Company Bird s fascination with filmmaking began at an early age He started drawing at age three with his first cartoons clear attempts at sequential storytelling He was particularly enamored with animation after a screening of The Jungle Book and a family friend who had taken animation classes explained how the medium worked Bird s father found a used camera that could shoot one frame at a time and helped him setup the device for making films He began animating his first short subject at age that same year his family connection introduced him to composer George Bruns who set him up a tour of Walt Disney Productions in Burbank California Bird met the Nine Old Men the animators responsible for the studio s earliest and most celebrated features and proclaimed he would join them one day br Bird has characterized his parents as generous and supportive of his interests His mother once made a rainy drive two hours each way to the only theater playing a reissue of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs for Bird s education After two years Bird had completed his first short a fifteen minute adaption of The Tortoise and the Hare On his parents advice to start at the top and work your way down he sent the film to his idols at Disney The studio responded with an open invitation for Bird to stop by whenever in town which led him to make several visits to the studio s California headquarters in the ensuing years This opportunity an unofficial apprenticeship of sorts was never offered to anyone previously He worked closely with Milt Kahl whom he considered a hero He began another film titled Ecology American Style which was more ambitious and in color but the workload was intense Instead Bird focused on other interests in his high school years including dating athletics and photography Animation is the illusion of life and you can t create that illusion convincingly if you haven t lived it he later remarked The family relocated to Corvallis Oregon in his youth and he graduated from Corvallis High School in br That year he was awarded a scholarship by Disney to attend the newly formed California Institute of the Arts CalArts in Valencia California Bird has joked he was a retired animator by the time he received this offer Instead he considered attending the acting program at Ashland University After a three year break Bird chose CalArts and moved down south Bird s classmates included prominent future animators such as John Lasseter Tim Burton and Henry Selick Like many students they were dazzled by the special effects in Star Wars both Lasseter and Bird agreed these feats were possible in animation First year students met in the room labeled A a small sterile classroom with no windows Bird later used A as an Easter egg in his films it has since become a fixture of media made by the school s alumni The first use of A was in the pilot episode for the short lived television series Family Dog The pilot episode was a part of the series Amazing Stories which aired February and was titled Family Dog He used it for the license plate number on a van The first Disney movie he used it in was The Brave Little Toaster for which he was an animator br br br Career br br br Initial years br br br Disney and development deals br Within two years Bird accepted a job as an animator at Walt Disney Productions Bird arrived at the studio in the midst of a transition much of the studio s original creative staff were retiring leaving the studio to a new generation of artists What was left of the original staff got along with the newcomers but Bird clashed with the middlemen in charge While animating at Disney he became a part of a small group of animators who worked in a suite of offices inside the original studio called the Rat s Nest There Bird openly criticized the state of the studio and characterized senior leadership as unwilling to take risk He felt as though he was standing behind the studio s original principles This volatile attitude prompted his firing by animation administrator Edward Hansen He left Disney after only two years he received credits on The Small One and The Fox and the Hound and went uncredited on Mickey s Christmas Carol and The Black Cauldron br Bird was dispirited with the state of the American animation industry and he considered his departure from Disney as the end of his long held love of the form Still he pulled together funds to make A Portfolio of Projects a demo reel of potential animated projects ones he felt the medium was capable of Bird was hopeful of receiving financial backing from other studios but ended up frustrated by Hollywood s development system for every good project I ve made I ve got equally good projects that are sitting un produced by various studios he said in He relocated to the Bay Area eager to become a part of its burgeoning film scene which birthed films like Apocalypse Now and The Black Stallion He tried for several years to adapt Will Eisner s comic book The Spirit to feature animation but studios declined unwilling to take a risk given Disney s dominance He briefly attempted a computer animated film at Lucasfilm with Ed Catmull presaging his later work with Pixar He had all these ideas for making animated movies but he didn t have a technical bone in his body and he didn t have any tolerance that you would need to have at the time to put up with some of the awfulness of the early technology said Alvy Ray Smith Bird s next credit was as an animator on the dark animated drama The Plague Dogs he was also fired by the film s director Martin Rosen during its production br br br Work with Steven Spielberg br One piece from his test reel was Family Dog which attracted the attention of director Steven Spielberg Family Dog is centered on a pet s perspective of his dysfunctional suburban family and its original pencil test featured designs by Bird s classmate Tim Burton Bird had hoped to develop the concept into theatrical shorts like those from the golden age of American animation but the market simply no longer existed Instead Bird moved back to Los Angeles and joined Spielberg s Amblin Entertainment and became involved with his television program Amazing Stories an anthology series which debuted in He co wrote the screenplay for The Main Attraction the show s second episode with Mick Garris Spielberg enjoyed the script and invited Bird to pitch other ideas Bird storyboarded another Family Dog segment which was decided to be adapted into an episode of Amazing Stories The episode which aired in was a ratings success The experience was exciting for Bird Not only was Steven one of my favorite filmmakers but he was powerful enough to clear space that allowed us creative freedom he later remarked Family Dog was later spun off into its own half hour sitcom against Bird s urging and without his involvement as he felt the idea would not work He was also perturbed to see Burton s role in designing the characters overshadow his deeper contributions to the concept br He was later brought on to co write the screenplay for Batteries Not Included a comic sci fi film that stemmed from an Amazing Stories outline The film opened in fourth place domestically and was overall a box office hit generating million on its million budget Bird also helped with Captain EO a D short film starring Michael Jackson viewed at Disney theme parks These successes brought Bird more opportunity but he continued to spend many years in development hell with studios He grew irritated with notes from middle management executives he felt would analyze your work and dictate everything you d need to do to make it more pleasing to an audience and in the process would only make stories smaller and more like everything else he complained In his personal life he wed Elizabeth Canney an editor on Batteries Not Included In Bird s sister Susan with whom he was very close was killed by her estranged husband in a murder suicide The event was traumatic for Bird he felt emotionally kind of gone in that period I don t really have a lot of memories from it He had enough funds to support himself for a time so he simply rested I just kind of didn t do anything he confessed br br br Career moves br br br Work on The Simpsons br Bird s cinematic sense of visual storytelling with Family Dog was uncommon in television animation to that point mainly due to budgetary restrictions Most television productions retained rudimentary cinematography with frequent abuse of standard close ups medium angles and establishing shots to move the story along In contrast Bird favored using more filmic techniques utilizing extreme angles long panning shots quick camera cuts pushed perspective and so on Bird s work on Family Dog caught the eye of producers James L Brooks and Sam Simon who with Matt Groening were developing The Simpsons the first prime time animated sitcom in decades for Fox In he was invited to join Klasky Csupo and later Film Roman where he served as executive consultant for the show The role required Bird oversee the script to animation pipeline days per week the first episode produced on which Bird received credit save for the reworked cut of the pilot episode Some Enchanted Evening was There s No Disgrace Like Home br Bird worked on the show for its first eight seasons with his final credited episode being Treehouse of Horror VIII the second episode of season nine to be produced and directed the episodes Krusty Gets Busted and Like Father Like Clown He also designed the character Sideshow Bob who made his speaking debut in the former episode In his role Bird pushed the show s artists to visualize episodes as miniature films taking inspiration from the work of Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles In the s he also contributed to other episodic animated sitcoms like The Critic and the first season of King of the Hill both of which took cues from this established template Bird called his work at The Simpsons a golden opportunity recognizing that the material was more to his sensibility than the work he had done for Disney On a personal level the job was deeply fulfilling he attended weekly read throughs which he found delightful and he considered the gig the only bright spot in the years following his sister s passing The show s crew hoped to get Bird to direct its later film adaptation but he was too busy on Ratatouille which came out the same year br br br The Iron Giant br br Animation had a commercial and creative renaissance in the U S during the s with Hollywood studios eager to capitalize on the success of Disney s The Lion King Bird continued to shop around film ideas to studios throughout the decade but grew frustrated with his lack of progress in his dream of directing a feature He was momentarily signed to direct a live action comedy Brothers in Crime at New Line Cinema but it did not pan out In addition his growing family gave rise to other concerns I had anxiety about devoting my energy to work that was meaningful and spending time with my family which was also meaningful to me If I did one would I fail at the other he worried He poured these themes into a screenplay for The Incredibles which he pitched to studios beginning in He also developed an original sci fi feature titled Ray Gunn with a script co written by Matthew Robbins Its futuristic story centered on a private detective in an Art Deco world of humans and aliens Bird signed a production deal with Turner Feature Animation in January but the studio felt Ray Gunn would be too intense for its target demographic of young children The following year Turner merged with Time Warner which contained the last three months of Bird s contract br Warner executives set up a meeting and made it clear they had no interest in Ray Gunn Instead they offered Bird several in development projects including a musical version of poet Ted Hughes book The Iron Man first envisioned by rocker Pete Townshend Bird read the novel and felt enchanted by it he felt drawn to Hughes rationale for writing the story which was to comfort his children after the death of his wife Sylvia Plath Bird connected with its themes relating it to his sister s passing from gun violence He significantly revised the entire story to center on a central question What if a gun had a soul Warner leadership was sold and Bird signed the contract to direct The Iron Giant in December Bird penned the screenplay with Tim McCanlies which centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes who discovers and befriends a giant alien robot during the Cold War in br He was quickly faced with assembling a team with little time to spare most big budget animated films of the era were workshopped for years whereas Bird only had two Adding to the pressure was Bird s frequent disagreements with the film s co producer Allison Abbate In a trade off the crew received significant creative freedom to make the film they wanted to make though Bird occasionally fielded suggestions from executives to make the film more merchandisable or kid friendly The film scored highly on test screenings but Warner neglected to secure prominent promotion for the movie as they were promoting Wild Wild West instead The Iron Giant opened in August to rave reviews from critics but very low ticket sales theater owners discarded the picture after only a few weeks Altogether the movie grossed million worldwide against its million budget which was considered a significant loss for Warner Upon its arrival on home video the film took on a cult following Bird was disappointed by the failure of Giant he visited multiple cineplexes only to view the film in empty auditoriums Afterwards he was briefly attached to direct a Curious George adaptation for Universal but he instead set his sights toward another animation studio Pixar br br br Path to Pixar and beyond br br br The Incredibles and Ratatouille br In the late s Bird reconnected with old friend John Lasseter who went on to work for Pixar the computer hardware maker that had recently moved into animation The company released the first fully computer animated feature film Toy Story in Bird was stunned by the film and in the two began to negotiate Bird joining Pixar In March Bird went to Pixar s Emeryville California campus and pitched his ideas including The Incredibles to Lasseter The studio announced a multi film contract with Bird in May of that year making Bird the first outside voice for the studio which previously required talent to rise through the ranks He was excited to return to the Bay Area where had lived intermittently two decades prior He purchased a home in Tiburon across the bay from Pixar s Emeryville headquarters He grew comforted by the creative and supportive atmosphere at Pixar unlike many of the L A studios he had worked for he convinced a core team to join him up north including artists Tony Fucile Teddy Newton and Lou Romano all of whom had contributed development artwork for The Incredibles for much of the past decade br The Incredibles the film follows Bob Craig T Nelson and Helen Parr Holly Hunter a couple of superheroes known as Mr Incredible and Elastigirl who hide their powers in accordance with a government mandate and attempt to live a quiet suburban life with their three children Bob s desire to help people draws the entire family into a confrontation with a vengeful fan turned foe Syndrome Bird also provides the voice of costume designer Edna Mode As an inside joke the character Syndrome was based on Bird s likeness as was Mr Incredible and according to him he did not realize the joke until the movie was too far into production to have it changed The animation team was tasked with creating computer animation s first all human cast which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy clothing and realistic skin and hair Michael Giacchino composed the film s orchestral score marking the first in a series of collaboration between the two men The Incredibles was Bird s first global critical and box office smash grossing million making it the fourth highest grossing film of Bird won his first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and his screenplay was nominated for Best Original Screenplay It was the first animated film to win the prestigious Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation br br Bird s next project was Ratatouille which follows a rat named Remy who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant s garbage boy The film was developed by Jan Pinkava who worked on the concept for many years By the time the project was slated to enter the animation process Pixar leadership became concerned it was not ready Bird was hired on in July to assess the mistakes and turn the project around in a short time He disliked having to take over Pinkva s passion project It was a rough position to be in because I always come down on the side of the creator he later said However he was also in position with Pixar as a member of their brain trust a group of individuals who critique and help each other so he felt the role came naturally When Bird took over much of the design work had been completed but Bird wrote an entirely new script that eschewed much of its original dialogue Giacchino returned to compose the Paris inspired music for the film Upon release Ratatouille was another huge hit for Pixar the film grossed million and earned critical acclaim It won the Best Animated Feature award at the Golden Globes it was also nominated for five Academy Awards including Best Original Screenplay and Best Animated Feature which it won br br br Move to live action Ghost Protocol and Tomorrowland br Midway through the aughts Bird was attached to direct an adaption of James Dalessandro s novel which chronicles the tumultuous earthquake that struck San Francisco a century prior Due to the size and scale of such a project three studios were to finance its making Pixar Disney and Warner Bros but the project stalled He paused when Pixar management asked he take over Ratatouille and returned afterward He attempted to re write to work within the confines of a feature s length but struggled Instead Bird helmed the next installment of the action spy series Mission Impossible starring Tom Cruise br Bird s foray into live action filmmaking after a major career in animation had little precedent according to critics Cruise had been impressed by the style and storytelling of Incredibles and urged Bird to contact him should he venture into the live action sphere The idea of combining the commercial aspects of a franchise this was the third Mission sequel and more artistic tones challenged Bird who signed on to direct in May In the picture Cruise reprises his role of Impossible Missions Force agent Ethan Hunt who with his team race against time to find a nuclear extremist who gains access to Russian nuclear launch codes Ghost Protocol was shot on location partially in Dubai and includes a memorable scene when Cruise scales the newly erected Burj Khalifa Upon release in December it became the highest grossing film in the series up to that point with million worldwide It was the fifth highest grossing film of as well as the second highest grossing film starring Cruise br Though he was asked to direct Star Wars The Force Awakens Bird turned down the opportunity to focus on his new project the sci fi film Tomorrowland named for the futuristic themed land found at Disney theme parks Bird co wrote the screenplay with Damon Lindelof In the film a disillusioned genius inventor George Clooney and a teenage science enthusiast Britt Robertson embark to an intriguing alternate dimension known as Tomorrowland where their actions directly affect their own world The film ended up being a box office bomb losing Disney million and attracting a mixed critical response br br br Latest work br br br Incredibles br Over the years Bird mentioned the possibility of an Incredibles sequel in interviews An official sequel was announced in Bird began writing its screenplay in earnest the next year he attempted to distinguish the script from the breadth of superhero related content released since the first film focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre The story follows the Incredibles as they try to restore the public s trust in superheroes while balancing their family life only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes Though scheduled for release on June the film was completed on an accelerated production schedule as it was farther ahead in production than Toy Story which required more development and was later released on that day the two simply swapped years with Incredibles debuting in theaters on June Giacchino returned to compose the score br Incredibles made million in its opening weekend setting the record for best debut for an animated film and grossed over billion worldwide making it the second highest grossing animated film at the time the highest grossing Pixar film and the fourth highest grossing film of the year Incredibles was named by the National Board of Review as the Best Animated Film of The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the th Golden Globe Awards and st Academy Awards but lost both awards to Spider Man Into the Spider Verse br br br Recent events present br Bird has expressed interest in developing an animated Western or horror film In Bird announced he was developing an original musical film that would include music by frequent collaborator Michael Giacchino and contain about minutes of animation in it In it was announced that Bird had signed a deal with Skydance the previous year to revive his long dormant project Ray Gunn and reassembled frequent collaborators Michael Giacchino Teddy Newton Tony Fucile Darren T Holmes and Jeffrey Lynch for the film br br br Style and themes br br Bird says he was influenced by dozens of filmmakers singling out early moviemakers Buster Keaton Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd to mid twentieth century auteurs like David Lean Alfred Hitchcock Walt Disney and Akira Kurosawa More contemporary directors like Steven Spielberg Francis Ford Coppola George Lucas Hayao Miyazaki and the Coen brothers have inspired Bird as well His passion for the medium was evident even in his college years friend John Lasseter remembered Brad would hang out all night talking about Scorsese and Coppola and how he could do what they did in animation Bird himself has observed that his career was very long very delayed and full of disappointment mainly because he aspired to lofty self set expectations br He has been characterized as controlling with an exquisite attention to detail His demanding often punishing direction has prompted some to consider him difficult to work with Bird is outspoken about the potential of the art of animation and has asked the public not refer to his films as cartoons In the audio commentary for the home release of The Incredibles Bird joked he would fight the next person to refer to animated movies as a genre as opposed to art form br He has also taken exception to the classification of modern animated fare as solely for children or families suggesting it discriminatory and belittling He has expressed a love for hand drawn animation and lamented its current absence from the industry br Many critics have analyzed his films and suggested they reflect Russian American novelist Ayn Rand s Objectivism philosophy which Bird vehemently denies suggesting it a monumental misreading of his work Though he claims he was drawn to Rand s work in his younger years he offers Me being the Ayn Rand guy is a lazy piece of criticism He stated that a large portion of the audience understood the message as he intended whereas two percent thought I was doing The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged Tomorrowland s plot line a group of geniuses form a utopia to sequester themselves from the world has been considered reminiscent of Atlas Shrugged and its Galt Gulch enclave In The Incredibles father Bob Parr complains of what he feels is society s increasing celebration of mediocrity and later in the film its villain Syndrome asserts that when everyone s super no one will be Analysts suggested these lines a reflection of views shared by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche One writer distilled Ratatouille down to if you don t have talent you should get out of the way of people who do David Sims at The Atlantic has suggested Bird s films are instead stories about the frustrations of unbridled creativity In each film there s an indelible recurring image the frustrated genius locked away in a dusty closet obsessing over the talents he has to hide Likewise IndieWire s Eric Kohn called Bird a pivotal figure in exploring the American dream through the vernacular of popular culture br br br Personal life br Bird and his wife Elizabeth m have three sons Nicholas who voiced Squirt in the Pixar film Finding Nemo and Rusty the bike boy in The Incredibles Michael who voiced Tony Rydinger in The Incredibles and its sequel and Jack Bird
