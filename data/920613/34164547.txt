Background br br Walt Disney Productions began exploring a possible live action animated biographical film of author and poet Hans Christian Andersen in late before the December premiere of its film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs the first feature length hand drawn animated film In March Walt Disney suggested a co production to film producer Samuel Goldwyn in which Goldwyn s studio would shoot the live action scenes of Andersen s life and Disney s studio would animate Andersen s fairy tales After the United States entered World War II Disney focused on wartime propaganda this halted development of the Disney Goldwyn project in Goldwyn produced the live action film Hans Christian Andersen and Disney Animation shelved a number of unfinished animated projects including The Snow Queen br br Walt Disney Feature Animation began developing a new adaptation of The Snow Queen during the late s after the success of its Disney Renaissance era films but the project was scrapped in late when Glen Keane reportedly quit and worked on another project which became Tangled Before then Harvey Fierstein pitched his version of the story to Disney executives but was turned down Paul and Ga tan Brizzi Dick Zondag and Dave Goetz reportedly tried their hands at it but failed After a number of unsuccessful attempts from to Disney shelved the project again During one of those attempts Walt Disney Company chair and CEO Michael Eisner supported the project and suggested director John Lasseter at Pixar after the expected renewal of Pixar s contract with Disney Negotiations between Pixar and Disney collapsed in January however and the contract was not renewed Eisner s successor Bob Iger negotiated Disney s purchase of Pixar in January for billion and Lasseter was promoted to chief creative officer of Pixar and Disney Animation br br br Development br Development began in when Lasseter convinced Chris Buck who co directed the film Tarzan for the studio to return to Walt Disney Animation Studios from Sony Pictures Animation where he had co directed the film Surf s Up Buck pitched several ideas to Lasseter that September one of which was The Snow Queen Buck later said that his initial inspiration for The Snow Queen was not the Andersen fairy tale but he wanted to do something different on the definition of true love Disney had already done the kissed by a prince thing so I thought it was time for something new Lasseter had been interested in The Snow Queen for a long time when Pixar was working with Disney on Toy Story in the s he saw and was blown away by some of the pre production art from Disney s previous attempts Development began as Anna and the Snow Queen and traditional animation was planned Josh Gad said that he first became involved with the film at that early stage when the plot was still relatively close to the original Andersen fairy tale and Megan Mullally was going to play Elsa By early the project was in development hell when the studio again failed to find a way to make the story and the Snow Queen character work br On December following the success of Tangled Disney announced a new title for the film Frozen and a release date of November It was confirmed a month later that the film would be a computer animated feature in stereoscopic D instead of the originally intended hand drawn animation due to complex elements in the script requiring strong visuals Kristen Anderson Lopez and Robert Lopez joined the project and began writing songs for Frozen in January It was announced on March of that year that Buck would direct the film with Lasseter and Peter Del Vecho producing br One of the main challenges Buck and Del Vecho faced after Disney placed The Snow Queen into development again was the title character who was a villain in their drafts The studio traditionally screens animated films in development every twelve weeks followed by holding lengthy notes sessions in which directors and screenwriters from different projects provide extensive notes about each other s work br Buck and Del Vecho presented their storyboards to Lasseter and the production team adjourned to a conference room to hear his thoughts about the project Art director Michael Giaimo later called Lasseter the film s game changer I remember John saying that the latest version of The Snow Queen story that Chris Buck and his team had come up with was fun very light hearted But the characters didn t resonate They aren t multi faceted Which is why John felt that audiences wouldn t really be able to connect with them br The production team then addressed the film s problems drafting several versions of The Snow Queen until the characters and story felt relevant The first major breakthrough at that stage was the decision to rewrite the film s protagonist Anna who was based on Gerda in The Snow Queen as Elsa s younger sibling for a family dynamic between the characters This was unusual a relationship between sisters is rarely a major plot element of American animated films with the exception of Disney s Lilo Stitch To explore the dynamics of such relationships Disney Animation convened a Sister Summit at which women from the studio who grew up with sisters were asked to discuss those relationships br br br Writing br Jennifer Lee one of the writers of Wreck It Ralph was brought in as screenwriter in March Efforts by the previous screen and songwriters had imploded before Lee was hired which allowed the songwriters to put a lot of their DNA into the new script The production team essentially started over and had months which resulted in a very intense schedule a lot of choices had to be made fast br Lee said that several core concepts were already in place such as the film s frozen heart hook That was a concept and the phrase an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart The ending involved true love in the sense of the emotional bond between siblings not romance Anna was going to save Elsa We didn t know how or why She said that Disney Animation president Edwin Catmull told her early about the film s ending you have to earn that ending If you do it will be great If you don t it will suck However the final version differed significantly from the earlier ones Elsa was evil from the start in the original version kidnapping Anna from her own wedding to freeze her heart and later descending on the town with an army of snowmen The whole second act was about Anna trying to get to Hans and to kiss him and then Elsa trying to stop her Buck said that the original plot attempted to make Anna sympathetic by focusing on her frustration with being a spare in relation to the heir The revised plot focused on musical comedy with less action and adventure br A breakthrough was the song Let It Go by Lopez and Anderson Lopez which reimagined Elsa as a more complex vulnerable and sympathetic character According to a story in The Daily Telegraph the songwriters saw Elsa not as a villain but as a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift Bobby and Kristen started talking about what would it feel like to be Elsa Lee said And this concept of letting out who she is that she s kept to herself for so long and she s alone and free but then the sadness of the fact sic that the last moment is she s alone Del Vecho said that Let It Go changed Elsa into a person ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive this caused Lee to rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie So that was when we really found the movie and who these characters were br Another breakthrough was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans absent from the first drafts would be revealed as the true villain near the end Del Vecho said if we were going to make the ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer when he s not the answer it s Kristoff I f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way According to Lee Hans was written as sociopathic and twisted It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna s belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans betrayal of Anna too predictable in that the audience had to feel her feeling something but not quite understanding it Because the minute it is understood it deflated In earlier drafts Anna flirted with Kristoff at their first meeting that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chair Alan Horn said that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans br Lee had to work through developing Anna s personality some of her colleagues felt that the character should be more dysfunctional and co dependent Lee disagreed but it took her almost a year to articulate that this is what Anna s journey is No more than that No less than that She successfully argued for a simple coming of age story where she goes from having a naive view of life and love because she s lonely to the most sophisticated and mature view of love where she s capable of the ultimate love which is sacrifice Lee had to let go of ideas that she liked such as a scene of Anna and Elsa s relationship as teenagers because they needed to maintain the separation between the characters To construct Anna and Elsa s relationship Lee was inspired by her relationship with her older sister She called her older sister my Elsa in a Los Angeles Times op ed and walked the red carpet with her at the th Academy Awards Lee said h aving to lose each other and then rediscover each other as adults that was a big part of my life br The team changed Olaf from Elsa s obnoxious sidekick to Anna s comically innocent one Lee s initial response to the original mean version of Olaf was Kill the f ing snowman and she found him the hardest character to deal with The problem of how Anna would save Elsa at the climax was solved by story artist John Ripa At the meeting where Ripa pitched his take on the story Lasseter said I ve never seen anything like that before Ripa received a standing ovation The team abandoned considerable detail from earlier drafts such as a troll with a Brooklyn accent to explain Elsa s magical powers and a regent Lee hoped to cast comedian Louis C K as These were cut because they contributed to a much more complex story than really we felt like we could fit in this minute film As Del Vecho said the more we tried to explain things at the beginning the more complicated it got br With Lee s extensive involvement in the development process she was promoted to co director by studio heads Lasseter and Catmull in August Her promotion was announced that November making her the first woman to direct a full length animated film from Walt Disney Animation Studios Lee later said that she was really moved by a lot of what Chris had done and they shared a vision of the story having very similar sensibilities br The team thought they had cracked the film s story by November but according to Del Vecho in late February it was realized that it still wasn t working and more rewriting was done from February through June of that year W e rewrote songs we took out characters and changed everything and suddenly the movie gelled But that was close In hindsight piece of cake but during it was a big struggle Anderson Lopez joked that she and Lopez thought they could have ended up working as birthday party clown s if the final product pull ed down their careers W e were really writing up until the last minute In June five months before the announced release date the songwriters got the film working when they composed For the First Time in Forever which according to Lopez became the linchpin of the whole movie Disney conducted test screenings that month of the partially completed film for two audiences one of families and the other of adults in Phoenix Arizona at which Lasseter and Catmull were present Lee recalled that it was the moment when they realized they had something because the reaction was huge Catmull told her afterwards You did it br br br Casting br Kristen Bell was cast as the voice of Anna on March The filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell recorded when she was young in which she performed songs from The Little Mermaid including Part of Your World Bell completed her Frozen recording sessions while she was pregnant and rerecorded some lines after her pregnancy when her voice had deepened She was called in to re record dialogue for the film probably times which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are evolving About her approach to the role of Anna Bell said that she had dreamed of being in a Disney animated film since she was four years old I always loved Disney animation but there was something about the females that was unattainable to me Their posture was too good and they were too well spoken and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward I m really proud of that br br Idina Menzel a Broadway veteran was cast as Elsa Menzel had auditioned for Tangled but did not get the part Tangled casting director Jamie Sparer Roberts kept a recording of Menzel s performance on her iPhone however and asked her to audition with Bell for Frozen Before they were cast Menzel and Bell impressed the directors and producers at an early table read after reading the script aloud they sang Wind Beneath My Wings as a duet since no music had been composed yet Bell suggested that idea when she visited Menzel at her California home to prepare for the table read The songwriters were also present for the table read Anderson Lopez said that Lasseter was in heaven on hearing Menzel and Bell sing in harmony and said Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel have to be in the movie Lee said They sung sic it like sisters and what you mean to me a nd there wasn t a dry eye in the house after they sang Additional casting was announced between December and June including Jonathan Groff as Kristoff Alan Tudyk as the Duke of Weselton Santino Fontana as Prince Hans and Josh Gad as Olaf br br br Animation br Similar to Tangled Frozen employed a unique artistic style by blending features of computer generated imagery CGI and traditional hand drawn animation Buck knew that Giaimo was the best candidate to develop the style he had in mind drawing from the best Disney hand drawn films of the s the Disney Little Golden Books and mid century modern design and persuaded him to return to Disney as Frozen s art director Buck Lasseter and Giaimo were old friends who met at the California Institute of the Arts Giaimo had been the art director for Disney s Pocahontas on which Buck had worked as a supervising animator br To create the film s look Giaimo began pre production research by reading about Scandinavia and visiting the Danish themed city of Solvang California near Los Angeles He focused on Norway because percent of the visuals that appealed to him were from that country Disney eventually sponsored three research field trips Animators and special effects specialists were sent to Jackson Hole Wyoming to experience walking running and falling in deep snow in a variety of attire including long skirts which men and women both tried on lighting and arts teams visited Quebec City s Ice Hotel to study how light reflects and refracts on snow and ice Giaimo and several artists then traveled to Norway to absorb its mountains fjords architecture and culture We had a very short time schedule for this film so our main focus was really to get the story right but we knew that John Lasseter is keen on truth in the material and creating a believable world and again that doesn t mean it s a realistic world but a believable one It was important to see the scope and scale of Norway and important for our animators to know what it s like Del Vecho said There is a real feeling of Lawrence of Arabia scope and scale to this br In while Giaimo and the animators and artists conducted preparatory research and developed the film s overall look the production team was still struggling to develop a compelling script That problem was not solved until November of that year and the script would later require more revisions As a result the most daunting challenge facing the animation team was a schedule of less than months to turn Lee s evolving shooting script into a film Other films like Pixar s Toy Story had been completed on shorter schedules but the short schedule meant late nights overtime and stress Lee estimated the size of Frozen s team at to people including around lighting people plus animators and to storyboard artists br Del Vecho explained the organization of the film s animation team On this movie we do have character leads supervising animators on specific characters The animators themselves may work on multiple characters but it s always under one lead I think it was different on Tangled for example but we chose to do it this way as we wanted one person to fully understand and develop their own character and then be able to impart that to the crew Hyrum Osmond the supervising animator on Olaf is quiet but he has a funny wacky personality so we knew he d bring a lot of comedy to it Anna s animator Becky Bresee it s her first time leading a character and we wanted her to lead Anna Acting coach Warner Loughlin was brought in to help the animators understand the characters they were creating To get the general feeling of each scene some animators did their own acting I actually film myself acting the scene out which I find very helpful said animation supervisor Rebecca Wilson Bresee This helped her discover elements that made a scene feel real and believable Elsa s supervising animator was Wayne Unten who requested that role because he was fascinated by the character s complexity Unten carefully developed Elsa s facial expressions to bring out her fear contrasted with Anna s fearlessness He studied videos of Menzel s recording sessions and animated Elsa s breathing to match Menzel s Head of animation Lino DiSalvo said The goal for the film was to animate the most believable CG characters you ve ever seen br For the look and nature of the film s cinematography Giaimo was influenced by Jack Cardiff s work on Black Narcissus He aimed for hyper reality Because this is a movie with such scale and we have the Norwegian fjords to draw from I really wanted to explore the depth From a design perspective since I was stressing the horizontal and vertical aspects and what the fjords provide it was perfect We encased the sibling story in scale Ted D McCord s work on The Sound of Music was another influence on Giaimo It was his idea that Frozen should be produced in CinemaScope which was approved by Lasseter This made Frozen the first animated film completely produced in CinemaScope since s Titan A E Giaimo wanted to ensure that Norway s fjords architecture and rosemaling folk art were central in designing the environment of Arendelle With a background in traditional animation he said that the art design environment represents a unity of character and environment and he originally wanted to incorporate saturated colors typically ill advised in computer animation For further authenticity a live reindeer named Sage was brought into the studio for the animators to study its movement and mannerisms for the character of Sven br Another issue Giaimo insisted on addressing was costumes since he knew from the start that Frozen would be a costume film To realize that vision he brought in character designer Jean Gillmore as a dedicated costume designer Traditional animation integrates costume and character design and treats clothing as part of the characters but computer generated animation regards costume as a quasi separate entity with its own properties and behaviors Frozen required unprecedented detail of minutiae such as fabrics buttons trim and stitching Gillmore said that her general approach was to meld the historic silhouettes of Western Europe give or take with the shapes and garment relationships and details of folk costume in early Norway circa th century This meant using primarily wool fabric with accents of velvet linen and silk During production Giaimo and Gillmore ran around supplying departments with real world samples to use as references they drew on the studio s in house library of fabric samples and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts costume division in Fullerton California The film s look development artists the Disney job title for texture artists created digitally painted simulations of surfaces other departments dealt with movement rigging and weight and thickness and lighting of textile animation br The film s English title was changed from The Snow Queen to Frozen a decision that was compared to Tangled Peter Del Vecho said that the title Frozen came up independently of the title Tangled It s because to us it represents the movie Frozen plays on the level of ice and snow but also the frozen relationship the frozen heart that has to be thawed We don t think of comparisons between Tangled and Frozen though He also mentioned that the film will still retain its original title The Snow Queen in some countries because that just resonated stronger in some countries than Frozen Maybe there s a richness to The Snow Queen in the country s heritage and they just wanted to emphasize that br br br Technological development br The studio developed several new tools to generate realistic and believable shots particularly the heavy and deep snow and its effect on the characters Disney wanted an all encompassing organic tool to provide snow effects which did not require switching between different methods Several Disney artists and special effects personnel traveled to Wyoming to experience walking through deep snow California Institute of Technology professor Kenneth Libbrecht was invited to instruct the effects group on how snow and ice form and why snowflakes are unique Using this knowledge the effects group created a snowflake generator that allowed them to randomly create unique snowflake shapes for the film br Another challenge for the studio was to deliver shots of heavy and deep snow that interacted believably with the characters and had a realistic sticky quality According to principal software engineer Andrew Selle Snow s not really a fluid It s not really a solid It breaks apart It can be compressed into snowballs All of these different effects are very difficult to capture simultaneously To achieve this software engineers used advanced mathematics the material point method and physics with assistance from mathematics researchers at the University of California Los Angeles to create Matterhorn a snow simulator software application The tool was capable of depicting realistic snow in a virtual environment and was used in at least scenes in the film including several key scenes Software engineer Alexey Stomakhin called snow an important character in the film and it received special attention from the filmmakers When you stretch it snow will break into chunks Since snow doesn t have any connections it doesn t have a mesh it can break very easily So that was an important property we took advantage of explained Selle There you see Kristoff walking through and see his footprints breaking the snow into little pieces and chunk up and you see Anna being pulled out and the snow having packed together and broken into pieces It s very organic how that happens You don t see that they re pieces already you see the snow as one thing and then breaking up The tool was particularly useful in scenes with characters walking through deep snow ensuring that the snow reacted naturally to each step br Other tools designed to help artists with complicated effects included Spaces which allowed Olaf s deconstructible parts to be moved around and rebuilt Flourish which allowed extra movement such as leaves and twigs to be art directed Snow Batcher which helped preview the final look of the snow especially when characters walked through it and Tonic which enabled artists to sculpt their characters hair Tonic also helped animate fur and hair such as Elsa s hair which contains computer generated strands the average human has strands of hair Frozen has character rigs and cloth costume rigs far more than other Disney films to date Fifty effects and lighting artists worked together on technology to create one single shot in which Elsa builds her ice palace It required hours to render each frame with computers rendering one frame at a time br In addition to D effects the filmmakers used D artwork and drawings for specific elements and scenes which included Elsa s magic and snow sculptures and freezing fountains and floors The effects group created a capture stage where the entire world of Frozen was displayed on monitors which can be filmed on special cameras to create a three dimensional scene We can take this virtual set that s mimicking all of my actions and put it into any one of our scenes in the film said technology manager Evan Goldberg br Frozen was the final film from Walt Disney Animation Studios that used Pixar RenderMan for rendering The studio switched to Hyperion its new rendering software with Big Hero br br br Scandinavian and S mi inspiration br The setting is the fictional kingdom of Arendelle which was based on Norway and the film was influenced by Scandinavian culture Several locations in Arendelle are inspired by real life landmarks in Norway including the Akershus Fortress in Oslo the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim and Bryggen in Bergen A number of other Scandinavian cultural elements are also included in the film such as stave churches trolls Viking ships a hot spring Fjord horses clothes and foods such as lutefisk A maypole is also present in the film and runes briefly appear in a book which Anna and Elsa s father opens to learn where the trolls live A scene where two men argue over whether to stack firewood bark up or bark down refers to a perennial Norwegian debate about properly stacking firewood The film has several elements of S mi culture such as the use of reindeer for transportation and the equipment used to control them clothing styles the outfits of the ice cutters and parts of the musical score Decorations such as those on the castle pillars and Kristoff s sled are inspired by S mi duodji decorations Disney s team visited R rosrein a S mi family owned company in the village of Plassje that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events Arendelle was inspired by N r yfjord a branch of Norway s longest fjord Sognefjorden which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site an Oslo castle with hand painted patterns on all four walls inspired the kingdom s castle interior br The filmmakers trip to Norway provided information for the animators to design an aesthetic in terms of color light and atmosphere According to Giaimo they acquired three important factors from the Norway research trip the fjords and their massive vertical rock formations the setting for the secluded kingdom of Arendelle the medieval stave churches whose rustic triangular rooflines and shingles inspired the castle compound and rosemaling folk art whose distinctive paneling and patterns informed the film s architecture decor and costumes br br br Music and sound design br br The songs for Frozen were written by the husband and wife team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson Lopez both of whom had worked with Disney Animation on Winnie the Pooh also produced by Del Vecho who hired them for Frozen and with Disney Parks on Finding Nemo The Musical Lopez first heard Disney Animation s pitch in Los Angeles while he was working on The Book of Mormon Disney s production team traveled to New York City to pitch the film in person to Anderson Lopez who was raising the couple s two young daughters Lopez believes that Disney was particularly interested in his wife s story talent The decision was easy Whenever Disney asks if you want to do a fairy tale musical you say yes br About minutes of the film are dedicated to their musical numbers Because they live in New York City collaborating with the production team in Burbank required two hour long transcontinental videoconferences nearly every weekday for about months They recorded a demo of each song in their home studio with both singing and Lopez accompanying on piano and emailed it to Burbank for discussion at the next videoconference Lopez and Anderson Lopez were aware of the fact that their work would be compared to that of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman from the Disney Renaissance era and when they felt lost they asked What would Ashman do They wrote songs for the film and eight were included in the final version One song For the First Time in Forever had a reprise and another Let It Go was covered by Demi Lovato over the final credits for a total of ten songs Seven of the that did not make it were later released on the deluxe edition soundtrack br Christophe Beck was hired to score the film in February after his work on Paperman a Disney animated short film released the year before Frozen It was announced on September that S mi musician Frode Fjellheim s Eatnemen Vuelie would be the film s opening song with elements of joik a traditional S mi singing style The music producers recruited Norwegian linguist and composer Christine Hals to assist with the lyrics for an Old Norse song written for Elsa s coronation and traveled to Trondheim to record the Cantus choir for a piece inspired by traditional S mi music br Under the supervision of sound engineer David Boucher the lead cast members began recording the film s vocal tracks in October at the Sunset Sound recording studio in Hollywood before the songs were orchestrated they only heard Lopez s demo piano track in their headphones as they sang Most of the dialogue was recorded at the Roy E Disney Animation Building in Burbank under the supervision of original dialogue mixer Gabriel Guy who also mixed the film s sound effects Some dialogue was recorded after recording songs at Sunset Sound and Capitol Studios for scenes with Anna and Elsa both studios had vocal isolation booths where Menzel and Bell could read dialogue in line of sight with one another avoiding bleedthrough between their respective tracks Additional dialogue was recorded at an ADR facility on the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank across the street from the Disney Animation building and at the Soundtrack Group s New York studio since the production team had to work around the schedules of the film s New York based cast members such as Fontana Lopez and Anderson Lopez s piano vocal scores for the songs and the vocal tracks were sent to Salem Oregon based Dave Metzger for arrangement and orchestration and Metzger orchestrated a significant portion of Beck s score br For the orchestral score Beck paid homage to the Norway and S pmi inspired setting by employing regional instruments such as the bukkehorn and traditional vocal techniques such as kulning Beck worked with Lopez and Anderson Lopez on incorporating their songs into arrangements of the score and the trio s goal was to create a cohesive musical journey from beginning to end Beck s scoring mixer Casey Stone who also supervised the recording of the score worked with Boucher to align their microphones for seamless transitions between the songs and score despite their separate recording The final orchestrations of songs and score were recorded at the Eastwood Scoring Stage on the Warner Bros Pictures studio lot in Burbank by an piece orchestra with vocalists including Norwegian Christine Hals Hals performed kulning for Beck to use it in the score when Elsa misuses her magical powers Boucher supervised the recording of Anderson Lopez and Lopez s songs from July to and Stone supervised the recording of Beck s score on September and Boucher mixed the songs at the Eastwood stage while Stone mixed the score at Beck s studio in Santa Monica California br Director Jennifer Lee said that sound played a large part of making the film visceral and transported In letting it tell the story emotionally the sound of the ice when it s at its most dangerous just makes you shudder The complete silence at the climax of the film right after Anna freezes was Lasseter s idea one he really wanted In that scene the ambient sound that would normally be there was removed to make it feel unusual Lee said T hat was a moment where we wanted everything to feel suspended br To obtain certain snow and ice sound effects sound designer Odin Benitez traveled to Mammoth Mountain California to record them at a frozen lake The Foley work for the film was recorded on the Foley stage on the Warner Bros Pictures lot by a Warner Bros crew The Foley artists received daily deliveries of pounds kg of snow and ice to help them record all the necessary snow and ice sounds Because the film s visuals were finalized so late five separate versions of nearly every footstep on snow were recorded corresponding to five different types of snow one was selected during mixing to match the snow as rendered in the final version of each scene One issue the production team was particular about was the sound of Elsa s footsteps in the ice palace which required eight attempts including wine glasses and metal knives on ice they ended up using a mix of three sounds Although the vocals music sound effects and almost all the dialogue were all recorded elsewhere the final re recording mix in Dolby Atmos format was performed at the Disney lot by Casey E Fluhr of Disney Digital Studio Services br br br Localization br Like other Disney media products which are localized by Disney Character Voices International Frozen was translated and dubbed into languages The Lion King had been localized into Finding sopranos capable of matching Menzel s warm vocal tone and three octave vocal range in their native languages was a challenge Rick Dempsey the unit s senior executive called the process of translating the film exceptionally challenging It s a difficult juggling act to get the right intent of the lyrics and also have it match rhythmically to the music And then you have to go back and adjust for lip sync It requires a lot of patience and precision Lopez explained that they were told by Disney to remove complex wordplay and puns from their songs to ensure that the film was easily translatable and had universally appealing lyrics In casting the dubbed versions Disney required native speakers in to ensure that the film feels local Bell and Menzel s voices were the blueprint in casting with efforts to match the voices as much as possible and about singers auditioned to fill the slots for Elsa Elsa s singing and speaking roles were cast separately for almost dubbed versions since not all the vocalists could act the part they were singing After casting the other roles in all languages the international cast included over people who voiced their roles in about recording sessions The Italian version of the film received an award for best foreign dubbing worldwide br br Some local TV stations and independent studios have created unofficial dubs in Albanian Arabic TV Karachay Balkar Persian and Tagalog br br br Release br br Frozen was

of the New York Post br Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote that the film is the best animated musical to come out of Disney since the tragic death of lyricist Howard Ashman whose work on The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast helped build the studio s modern animated division into what it is today According to Duralde W hile it lags the tiniest bit on its way to the conclusion the script really delivers it offers characters to care about along with some nifty twists and surprises along the way Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called Frozen a true musical You can practically see the Broadway musical Frozen is destined to become while watching Disney s D animated princess tale McCarthy called the film energetic humorous and not too cloying as well as the first Hollywood film in many years to warn of global cooling rather than warming this tuneful toon upgrades what has been a lackluster year for big studio animated fare and beginning with its Thanksgiving opening should live up to box office expectations as one of the studio s hoped for holiday spanning blockbusters Scott Mendelson of Forbes wrote Frozen is both a declaration of Disney s renewed cultural relevance

Year s speech br Scott Foundas of Variety called the film formulaic praising its voice acting and technical artistry The tactile snow capped Arendelle landscape including Elsa s ice castle retreat is Frozen s other true marvel enhanced by D and the decision to shoot in widescreen a nod to the CinemaScope richness of Sleeping Beauty and Lady and the Tramp That s almost but not quite enough to make up for the somewhat slack plotting and the generic nature of the main characters Neither princess here is a patch on Tangled s babe in the woods Rapunzel while both Hans and Kristoff are cut from pretty standard issue hero cloth until a reasonably surprising third act twist somewhat ups the ante Only Olaf is unimpeachable Get this snowman a spinoff feature to call his own The Seattle Times gave the film two out of four stars While it is an often gorgeous film with computer generated fjords and ice sculptures and castle interiors the important thing that glues all this stuff together story is sadly lacking Joe Williams of the St Louis Post Dispatch also called Frozen s plot the film s weakest point On Roger Ebert s website Christy Lemire posted a mixed review and gave the film two and a half stars out of four Lemire praised the visuals the performance of Let It Go and the film s positive messages but called the film a cynical attempt to shake things up without shaking them up

Sexism was alleged after Frozen head of animation Lino DiSalvo said to Fan Voice s Jenna Busch Historically speaking animating female characters are really really difficult because they have to go through these range of emotions but you have to keep them pretty A Disney spokesperson later told Time that DiSalvo s quote was widely misinterpreted saying that he was describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters Director Lee said that DiSalvo s words were taken out of context when he was speaking in very technical terms about CG animation It is hard no matter what the gender is I felt horrible for him she said In an August interview DiSalvo reiterated the difficulty of turning any animated character from a series of sketches on a D emotion model sheet into a properly rigged D character model Translating that emotional range onto a CG character is one of the most difficult parts of the process Male Female Snowman Animal He added The really sad thing is people took that catchy headline and they just repopulated it everywhere People didn t get back to me for comments and the sad thing is that s the way the internet works They don t want the truth br br br Perceived LGBT parallels br A few conservative Christian commentators accused Frozen of promoting homosexuality saying that the themes of Elsa s being different from others her ostracism from society and her independence and rejection of male suitors are metaphors for lesbianism Her song Let it Go was compared to coming out of the closet Other viewers argued that Elsa represents a role model for LGBT youth The claims had a mixed reaction from audiences and the LGBT community Akash Nikolas wrote in The Atlantic that Disney films including Frozen subtly appeal ed to queer children with protagonists who are often social outcasts set apart by unusual desires and who reject traditional expectations of marriage Robert Geal wrote in Film International that although the film has a superficially progressive vision of homosexuality it perpetuates conservative notions of sexuality and gender Elsa s female homosexuality is visually pleasurable to a male gaze but male transgressions of heterosexuality are negatively coded Asked about perceived homosexual undertones in the film Lee was noncommittal I don t like to say anything let the fans talk I think it s up to them The film should have a point of view she said br br br Let it Go lawsuit br Chilean singer Jaime Ciero sued Demi Lovato Idina Menzel Walt Disney

transitioned from thanking people when they expressed their appreciation for Frozen to having to apologize when they said W e re still listening to those songs with their children Lee said that she
