supervising animator Glen Keane in In Keane pitched the idea to then Disney CEO Michael Eisner who approved it but requested the film to be computer animated However Keane was hesitant as he felt computer animation was not quite as fluid or organic as traditional animation was In October the film was announced as Rapunzel Unbraided as a computer animated feature scheduled for a release which Keane described as a Shrek like version of the film According to Ed Catmull Eisner himself had proposed using modern day San Francisco as the initial setting of the film The story initially centered on two teenagers Claire and Vince who live in San Francisco and are transported into the fairy tale world where they inhabit the bodies of Rapunzel and her prince Beau Rapunzel and Beau themselves are turned into a squirrel and a dog In July Reese Witherspoon and Kristin Chenoweth were in talks to portray roles with the latter intended to voice Rapunzel In October Dan Fogler was slated to provide a voice br In reflection Keane said of the original plot It was a fun wonderful witty version and we had a couple of great writers But in my heart of hearts I believed there was something much more sincere and genuine to get out of the story so we set it aside and went back to the roots of the original fairy tale In November Unbraided was pushed back to a summer release in order to give Keane more time to work on the story In January the film was then shut down about a week before Catmull and John Lasseter were placed in charge of the studio and one of their first decisions was to restart the project and ask Keane to keep going with the film It had originally been announced in April that Annie nominated animator and story artist Dean Wellins would be co directing the film alongside Keane br On October it was reported that Keane and Wellins had stepped down as directors due to other commitments and were replaced by the team of Byron Howard and Nathan Greno director and storyboard director respectively of Disney s animated feature Bolt Keane stayed on as an executive producer and animation supervisor while Wellins moved on to developing other short and feature films After the film s release Keane revealed that he had stepped back from the role of director because of a heart attack in br br The directors auditioned hundreds of young actresses to find Rapunzel s voice among them were Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell but both were rejected for not sounding right br On September it was announced that singer songwriter and actress Mandy Moore who previously worked with Disney on Disneytoon Studios Brother Bear had been cast as the voice of Rapunzel and actor Zachary Levi would provide the voice of Flynn Rider For the role of Flynn the studio mandated exclusively only UK actors to audition for the part as Ryder was intended to be British An American Zachary Levi impersonated a British Received Pronunciation RP accent to audition leading the producers to opt for him to use his natural American accent Mandy Moore approached the project through auditioning when she heard that a film about the story of Rapunzel was being made Moore later expressed that she had dreamed to be a Disney princess since she was young and said that with the role of Rapunzel she had fulfilled her ultimate childhood dream She described herself as a girly fan of Disney animated films like The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast Aladdin and The Lion King and that it was an honor for her to be part of this legacy the lineage of such Disney icons Since the film was going to be a musical it was required that all auditionees had to read several scenes and perform a song of their choice to ensure that the voice actors could both act and sing For this singing section Moore chose Help Me by Joni Mitchell a song that she herself had covered on her fourth studio album Coverage Moore revealed that she had to attend several audition sessions and described the experiences as pretty fun but didn t put much hope in getting the part because she believed there would be much competition for this role she just performed her best without any anxiety When she received a callback from Disney telling that she got the part Moore described herself as being over the moon I was working in New York at the time I was with some friends and my husband and I screamed as soon as I found out the news br The film reportedly cost more than million to produce br br When asked about the character of Rapunzel Mandy Moore said that Rapunzel was a relatable character and called her a Renaissance bohemian woman rather than a typical Disney princess Moore said Rapunzel doesn t know she s a princess until the end of the film She s just really sort of motivated to find out what else is out there beyond this crazy tower she s lived in for years and that she s very independent she can take care of herself and she s definitely come up with really entertaining ways to keep herself busy Moore also stated that she herself had little influence on Rapunzel The character was developed way before I had anything to do with it br According to Greno one of the most difficult problems during the development of the film s plot was how to get Rapunzel out of the tower without immediately ending the movie in that she had thereby escaped Mother Gothel and did not have any other specific objectives to pursue At a meeting one day animator John Ripa floated an idea which turned out to be the solution they had been looking for the mysterious floating lanterns br br In Tangled as with most animated films all voice actors had to record their dialogue separately from one another to avoid bleeding into each other s tracks Mandy Moore later recalled that during recording she had never met Donna Murphy and only met Zachary Levi once when they recorded I See the Light Moore thought that this was a good exercise in employing your imagination When recording action scenes the voice actors had to jog a little in place in order to make their voices sound realistic For the songs Moore and Levi recorded on a soundstage with a piece orchestra under the supervision of composer Alan Menken They sang live with the orchestra for several times in order to help everyone get a vibe and a feel for the music and the singing then were asked to go in isolation booths to record the actual tracks In order to aid animators in animating the characters the filmmakers did interviews with the voice actors and filmed their facial expressions throughout the recording sessions Disney animated films are usually animated to synchronize with recorded dialogue rather than asking the vocal talent to synchronize their delivery to animation after it is rendered Thus Moore felt that the recording process was challenging because at that time she had no animation to look at except for a few sketches br Due to scheduling conflicts with other projects Moore had to travel to different places such as London or New York and Levi could only record on weekends for five hours once every six weeks they did not record dialogue in the same order as in the final film When I came in maybe that sequence or scene had been recorded by Mandy Moore already maybe it hadn t We d end up doing the same scene five times depending Levi said After watching the finished film Moore was disappointed because she felt that her voice sounded shrill while Levi thought that his performance sounded incredibly nasally br br The film was made using computer generated imagery CGI although Tangled was modeled on the traditional look of oil paintings on canvas The Rococo paintings of French artist Jean Honor Fragonard particularly The Swing were used as references for the film s artistic style a style described by Keane as romantic and lush To create the impression of a painting non photorealistic rendering was used br br Glen Keane originally wanted the film to be animated using a traditional D animation process However Disney executives David Stainton and Dick Cook announced that they would only approve the film for production if it were created using the D computer graphics In response to that demand Glen Keane held a seminar called The Best of Both Worlds where he with Disney CGI artists and traditional artists focused on the pros and cons of each style After the meeting it was decided that the film would be made in D CGI animation but in a way as to become an extension of the traditional D Disney aesthetic a term which referred to the naturalistic animation that conforms to the fundamental principles of animation as documented by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston in the book The Illusion of Life Disney Animation br Due to limitations in computer technology especially regarding attempts to capture the complexity of a human form many basic principles of animation used in traditionally animated movies had been absent from earlier CGI films but technological advancements made it easier to blend the two combining the strengths of each style Keane stated repeatedly he was trying to make the computer bend its knee to the artist instead of having the computer dictate the artistic style and look of the film By making the computer become as pliable as the pencil Keane s vision of a three dimensional drawing seemed within reach with the artist controlling the technology Many of the techniques and tools that were required to give the film the quality Keane demanded did not exist when the project was started and Walt Disney Animation Studios had to create them on their own Keane said There s no photoreal hair I want luscious hair and we are inventing new ways of doing that I want to bring the warmth and intuitive feel of hand drawn to CGI br One of the main goals of the animators was to create movement that mimicked the soft fluidity of the hand drawn art found in older Disney animated films Keane credited Disney D animator Kyle Strawitz with helping to combine CGI with the traditional hand drawn style He took the house from Snow White and built it and painted it so it looked like a flat painting that suddenly started to move and it had dimension and kept all of the soft round curves of the brushstrokes of watercolor Kyle helped us get that Fragonard look of that girl on the swing We are using subsurface scattering and global illumination and all of the latest techniques to pull off convincing human characters and rich environments br Rather than focusing on realism the D team used an aesthetic approach Robert Newman the film s stereoscopic supervisor said that We re using depth more artistically than ever before and we re not as concerned with the literal transcription of depth between camera and projector as we are the interpretation of it To do this they used a new technique called multi rigging which is made up of multiple pairs of virtual cameras Each pair is used individually on each separate element that adds depth to a scene like background foreground and characters without adjusting for the relation with the other pairs When sandwiched together later in production the result was something that would be visually impossible in the real world but which created an appealing look to the film br As a counterpart to the appealing and cute design of Rapunzel the directors wanted to make Flynn Rider the most handsome most attractive male lead Disney has ever had They held a large Hot Man Meeting where they gathered about women from the studio and asked them what they considered attractive in a man They brought in hundreds of images of their favourite male actors and celebrities which were torn and pasted back again After much deliberation his look was eventually narrowed down to one concept drawing br br Existing technology continued to present difficulties in particular animating hair turned out to be a challenge Senior software engineer Kelly Ward spent six years writing programs to make it move the way they wanted As late as January the directors were still not sure if the Rapunzel character s length of hair was going to work These problems were finally solved in March An improved version of a hair simulation program named Dynamic Wires originally developed for Bolt was eventually used To make hair float believably in water and to surmount other similar challenges discrete differential geometry was used to produce the desired effects freeing the animators from executing these specific tasks directly which would have taken days instead of minutes br br When first put into production the film was promoted as having the title Rapunzel Unbraided which was later changed to Rapunzel Disney s previous animated feature The Princess and the Frog while being well received by various critics and taking in nearly million worldwide was not as successful as Disney had hoped and Catmull later admitted in writing that Disney Animation s faith that The Princess and the Frog s excellent quality would bring in all audiences notwithstanding the word princess in the title was their version of a stupid pill In order to market the new film to both sexes and additional age groups Disney changed the title from Rapunzel to Tangled while also emphasizing Flynn Rider the film s prominent male character showing that his story is just as important as that of Rapunzel Disney was criticized for altering the title as a marketing strategy Floyd Norman a former Disney and Pixar animator and story artist said The idea of changing the title of a classic like Rapunzel to Tangled is beyond stupid I m convinced they ll gain nothing from this except the public seeing Disney as desperately trying to find an audience br Justin Chang of Variety compared it to changing the title of The Little Mermaid to Beached Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle s blog Margot Magowan accused Disney of sexism writing br br Can you imagine if Disney switched a movie title so it wouldn t risk highlighting a male star It s awful that this kind of radical gender discrimination exists for our smallest people little kids who come into this world with huge imaginations and aspirations big dreams that get squashed by a bunch of billionaire guys who run massive entertainment franchises br On November the day of the film s release directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard disputed reports that the title change was a marketing decision They said they changed the title from Rapunzel to Tangled because Rapunzel is not the only main character in the film They went on to say that you cannot call Toy Story Buzz Lightyear and they really needed a title that represented what the film is and that it stars the duo of Rapunzel and Flynn Rider br In March executive producer John Lasseter explained that Disney had changed the name to improve the film s appeal to the four quadrants There was an audience perception that these movies were just for little girls but when boys men whatever actually see these movies they like them So on Rapunzel we changed the name and we called it Tangled We did marketing that made the people who would not normally show up say Hey this looks pretty good br br The musical score and soundtrack album were composed by Alan Menken with lyrics written by Glenn Slater It marked Menken s return to scoring for animated films after recurringly doing so for several Disney Animation films till Home on the Range As several Pixar employees being in charge for Disney and the sensibilities being changed Menken thought it as his biggest creative challenge and said that he was finding a way that we could wed musical theater storytelling with the Pixar style of storytelling was primary Menken said he attempted to blend medieval music with s folk rock to create the new songs and the score and soundtrack were recorded at a span of two and a half years br Several songs were written but eventually cut from the final film When Will My Life Begin replaced an earlier version called What More Could I Ever Need Menken reported that that opening number went through five or six different versions Elsewhere Menken reported that there was originally a love song called You Are My Forever that Mother Gothel sang to Rapunzel in a motherly way but was reprised later in the film by Flynn Rider in a romantic way This idea was apparently replaced with the two songs Mother Knows Best and I See the Light The song Something That I Want written and performed by Grace Potter from Grace Potter and the Nocturnals is featured in the closing credits The Latin American Spanish version of the song titled Algo quiero querer was recorded by Colombian pop singer Fanny L br The soundtrack released on Walt Disney Records on November and peaked at number on the
