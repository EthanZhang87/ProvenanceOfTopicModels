brought life to the ocean using a pounamu stone as her heart and the source of her power One day Maui the shape shifting demigod of the wind and sea and master of wayfinding stole Te Fiti s heart to give humanity the power of creation This caused Te Fiti to disintegrate and Maui was attacked by Te K a volcanic demon Maui lost both the heart and his magic fish hook to the depths of the sea br A thousand years later the ocean chooses Moana the daughter of Motunui s chief Tui to return the heart to Te Fiti Tui and Sina Moana s parents try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her to become the island s chief Sixteen years later blight strikes the island killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch Moana suggests going beyond the island s reef with her pet pig Pua to find more fish and find out what is happening but Tui forbids it Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked That afternoon Moana s grandmother Tala shows her a secret cavern of ships and reveals Motunui s people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti s heart the ocean was no longer safe without it Tala explains Te K s darkness is destroying the island but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and has him restore the heart of Te Fiti Having been given the heart by the ocean Tala gives it to Moana Tala later becomes severely ill and tells Moana to find Maui before she dies br Moana sets sail on a camakau from the cavern along with her dimwitted pet rooster Heihei who stowed away on it They are caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui who boasts about his achievements She demands Maui return the heart but he refuses and traps her in a cave before leaving on her boat She escapes and confronts Maui who reluctantly lets her on the camakau They are attacked by Kakamora coconut pirates who seek the heart but Moana and Maui outwit them Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart However Maui first needs to retrieve his fishhook in Lalotai the Realm of Monsters from Tamatoa a giant coconut crab While Moana distracts Tamatoa Maui retrieves his hook only to find himself unable to control his shape shifting He is overpowered by Tamatoa but Moana s quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook Maui reveals his first tattoo

her true calling She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K Maui returns having had a change of heart and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K destroying his hook in the process Upon being unable to find Te Fiti Moana realizes Te K is Te Fiti having become corrupted without her heart The ocean clears a path for Moana allowing her to return the heart to Te Fiti who

Puanani Cravalho Auli i Cravalho s mother as Villager No br br After directing The Princess and the Frog Clements and Musker started working on an adaptation of Terry Pratchett s Mort but problems with acquiring the necessary film rights prevented them from continuing with that project To avoid a recurrence of that issue they pitched three original ideas The genesis of one of those ideas the one that was ultimately green lit occurred in when Musker began reading up on Polynesian mythology and learned of the heroic exploits of the demigod M ui Intrigued with the rich culture of Polynesia he felt it would be a suitable subject for an animated film Shortly thereafter Musker and Clements wrote a treatment and pitched it to John Lasseter who recommended that both of them should go on research trips Accordingly in Clements and Musker went on research trips to Fiji Samoa and Tahiti to meet the people of the South Pacific Ocean and learn about their culture At first they had planned to make the film entirely about Maui but their initial research trips inspired Clements to pitch a new idea focused on the young daughter of a chief br Clements and Musker were fascinated to learn during their research that the people of Polynesia abruptly stopped making long distance voyages about three thousand years ago Polynesian navigational traditions had long predated those of European explorers beginning around CE Native people of the Pacific possessed knowledge of the world and their place in it prior to the incursion of foreigners For example K naka Maoli Native Hawaiians were well aware of the existence of far away islands had names for these places and were interested in exploring them to benefit their societies This voyaging heritage was made possible by a geographical knowledge system based on individual perspective rather than the European cardinal direction system The reasons for the halt of this voyaging tradition remain unknown but scholars have offered climate change and resulting shifts in ocean currents and wind patterns as one possible explanation Native peoples of the Pacific resumed voyaging again a thousand years later Clements and Musker set the film at that point in time about two thousand years ago on a fictional island in the central Pacific Ocean which drew inspiration from elements of the real life island nations of Fiji Samoa and Tonga Although Motunui is actually a real islet located south of Easter Island in Chilean Polynesia br Over the five years it took to develop and produce the film Clements and Musker recruited experts from across the South Pacific to form an Oceanic Story Trust who consulted on the film s cultural accuracy and sensitivity as the story evolved through nine versions The Trust responded negatively for example to a depiction of Maui as bald and to a proposed scene in which Moana threw a tantrum by throwing coconuts In response Maui was reworked with long hair and the coconut scene was scrapped br During the D Expo s panel for Disney s slate of upcoming animated films Moana s last name was given as Waialiki but that name was not retained in the final film br br Taika Waititi wrote the initial screenplay but went home to New Zealand in to focus on his newborn first child and What We Do in the Shadows Years later Waititi joked that all that was left of his original draft was EXT OCEAN DAY The first draft focused on Moana as the sole daughter in a family with five or six brothers in which gender played into the story However the brothers and gender based theme were deleted from the story as the directors thought Moana s journey should be about finding herself A subsequent draft presented Moana s father as the one who wanted to resume navigation but it was rewritten to have him oppose navigation so he would not overshadow Moana Instead Pamela Ribon came up with the idea of a grandmother character for the film who would serve as a mentor linking Moana to ancient traditions Another version focused on Moana rescuing her father who had been lost at sea The film s story changed drastically during the development phase which happens with most Disney films and that idea ultimately survived only as a subtle element of the father s backstory br Te K was referred to in early drafts of the film as Te P a reference to the M ori goddess Hine nui te p who was originally the life giving goddess Hine t tama but became the goddess of death upon discovering that her husband the god T ne was also her father M ui set out to defeat her in order to bring immortality to humans but failed and was himself killed br Aaron and Jordan Kandell joined the project during a critical period to help deepen the emotional story architecture of the film They are credited with developing the core relationship between Moana and Maui the prologue the Cave of the Wayfinders the Kakamora and the collector crab Tamatoa played by Jemaine Clement Jared Bush received sole credit as the writer of the final version of the screenplay br Several major story problems were identified in after the film had already transitioned from development into production but computer generated films tend to have much shorter production schedules and much larger animation teams in this case about animators than traditionally animated films Since Clements and Musker were already working hour days and Saturdays directing such a large team of animators Don Hall and Chris Williams who had just finished directing Big Hero came on board as co directors to help fix the film s story issues The scene in which Maui and Moana encounter the Kakamora is an intentional homage to Mad Max Fury Road br br After the filmmakers sat through auditions of hundreds of candidates from across the Pacific year old high school freshman Auli i Cravalho was cast as the lead character Moana At that point in time the design of Moana s face and personality was already complete and Cravalho s obvious physical resemblance to her character was simply a coincidence During animation production Disney animators were able to integrate some of Cravalho s mannerisms into Moana s behavior as depicted onscreen br The majority of the film s cast members are of Polynesian descent Auli i Cravalho Moana and Nicole Scherzinger Sina Moana s mother were born in Hawaii and are of Native Hawaiian heritage Dwayne Johnson Maui Oscar Kightley Fisherman and Troy Polamalu Villager No are of Samoan heritage and New Zealand born Rachel House Tala Moana s grandmother Temuera Morrison Tui Moana s father and Jemaine Clement Tamatoa are of M ori heritage br br Moana is Clements and Musker s first fully computer animated film One of the reasons for using computer animation was that the environment including the ocean benefited much more from the use of CGI as opposed to traditional animation The filmmakers have also suggested that three dimensional computer animation is well suited to the beautiful sculpturing of the faces of the people of the South Pacific Eric Goldberg worked on the hand drawn animation used to depict Maui s sentient tattoos During early development the filmmakers considered the possibility of making the film with hand drawn traditional animation but only a few early animation tests were made in that style In the final cut only Maui s tattoos are hand drawn br Moana was produced in makeshift quarters in a giant warehouse in North Hollywood together with Zootopia while Disney Animation s headquarters building in Burbank was being renovated Musker observed that Moana was similar in that respect to The Little Mermaid which was produced in a warehouse in Glendale Production wrapped on October br br The film s soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on November The songs were written by Opetaia Foa i Mark Mancina who previously collaborated with the studio on Tarzan and Brother Bear and Lin Manuel Miranda while the score was written by Mancina The lyrics are in English Samoan and the Tokelauan language The soundtrack peaked at number two on the Billboard br br In many European countries the name of the titular character Moana was changed to Vaiana due to a trademark conflict The film was released in those countries to bear the alternative name in the title In Italy the film was released with the title Oceania media outlets speculated that the name change was to avoid confusion with Italian pornographic actress Moana Pozzi and Disney Italy s head of theatrical marketing Davide Romani acknowledged they were thinking about the issue at a meeting of Italian exhibitors in br Following the success brought by international productions of Disney s Frozen which led to the release of a complete set album which included all the official versions of Let It Go released at the time Disney decided to produce a special Tahitian dubbing for the film On October at a press conference in Papeete it was announced that the film will be the first motion picture to be fully dubbed in the Tahitian language This marks the second time Disney has released a special dubbing dedicated to the culture which inspired the film the first case was The Lion King for which the directors travelled to South Africa to cast voice actors for a Zulu dubbed version The Tahitian dubbing was made available in schools and institutions but never for the public to purchase br In June a M ori language dubbing of the film produced by Matewa Media was announced premiering in Auckland on September with theatres screening it for free as part of M ori Language Week Rachel House Jemaine Clement Temuera Morrison and Oscar Kightley reprised their respective roles in this version directed by Rachel House herself In contrast to the Tahitian dubbing the M ori version was made available for purchase in Australia and New Zealand and the soundtrack was uploaded on Disney s official Vevo channel br In November a Hawaiian language lelo Hawai i dubbing was announced to be under way with Auli i Cravalho reprising her role as Moana and Nicole Scherzinger reprising the role of Sina The film premiered on June and like the Tahitian dubbing was later

Poland and between October to November in Latin America opposite Coco This re release included the short Once Upon a Studio which was shown before the film br br On October Hawaiian Airlines unveiled their Moana themed livery for three of their Airbus A fleet Disney initiating a partnership with Hawaiian Airlines to promote the film has been perceived as having the motive of fetishizing Polynesian island nations as exotic vacation spots the people and culture of which exist only to entertain foreign audiences as well as Auli i Cravalho speaking with The New York Times in an interview sharing travel tips for visitors to Hawaii Critiques of these promotional tactics focus on how adverse effects of tourism have devastated native communities in the Pacific resulting in environmental degradation and poverty br A Maui skin suit costume made to tie in with the film was pulled by Disney from its online store following complaints about it being culturally insensitive and for appearing to promote brownface br There are currently meet and greets with Moana at Disneyland Walt Disney World Disneyland Paris and at Aulani a Disney Resort and Spa At the parks she is located in
