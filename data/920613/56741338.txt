Mahito moves back to Tokyo with Shoichi Natsuko and his sibling br br br Voice cast br br br Production br br Following the release of The Wind Rises Miyazaki held a press conference in Venice in September announcing his retirement from feature animation saying I know I ve said I would retire many times in the past Many of you must think Once again But this time I am quite serious However Miyazaki later changed his mind after concluding work on the short film Boro the Caterpillar and decided to come out of retirement to direct another full length film a decision which was captured in the documentary film Never Ending Man Hayao Miyazaki He commenced storyboarding for the film in July and presented a project proposal for it the next month This proposal included the children s novel The Book of Lost Things by Irish author John Connolly which formed a loose framework for the project Edogawa Ranpo s Ghost Tower Y rei t which Miyazaki loved as a child inspired the tower in the film Toshio Suzuki later approved the project taking into account Miyazaki s commitment and storyboard work After Suzuki publicly announced the start of work on Miyazaki s new film in February the studio s official website posted a call for staff for the new project on May and production began in earnest With Miyazaki coming out of retirement Studio Ghibli reopened with many of its past collaborators working on the project At an event held at Waseda University in October Studio Ghibli announced the film would be titled Kimitachi wa D Ikiru ka after the novel of the same name by Genzabur Yoshino The release date was not determined but Miyazaki voiced his desire to release the film around the time of the Summer Olympics in Japan Suzuki said that Miyazaki is working on the film for his grandson as his way of saying Grandpa is moving on to the next world but he s leaving behind this film br Suzuki stated in August that the film was expected to be completed in or The film was confirmed to be complete at the end of October In a December interview with NHK Suzuki explained that the film is not to be expected anytime soon Miyazaki in his younger age used to produce minutes of animation every month but now his speed was reduced to minute per month He contended that Miyazaki was unlikely to retire completely as idleness would trouble him Despite talk of Miyazaki s upcoming film being his last Suzuki doubted it asserting that as long as Miyazaki lives he will likely keep making films Unlike his previous films Miyazaki did not oversee every single frame and focused solely on creating the film s blueprint through storyboarding while the animation director Takeshi Honda took charge of the animation process In March Suzuki disclosed that since the new film required a significant amount of time and money the studio planned to finance the production by showcasing their previously released films on streaming platforms like Netflix Miyazaki did not use a computer or smartphone and was unaware of online streaming so Suzuki convinced him to make this deal to cover the costs especially considering that the project differed from their previous endeavours br In May Suzuki recounted to Entertainment Weekly that the film was a big fantastical film He said that animators were working on the film and that an estimated minutes had been completed after three years of production saying we are still hand drawing everything but it takes us more time to complete a film because we re drawing more frames and they were hoping it will finish in the next three years In December Suzuki stated that the production was working with no deadlines similarly to The Tale of the Princess Kaguya which took eight years to make He said that the animation was half finished that COVID restrictions had not stopped production and that the film would be minutes long He also revealed that Miyazaki wanted to adapt Diana Wynne Jones s Earwig and the Witch during development but his son Goro an executive producer of Kimitachi wa D Ikiru ka alongside Koji Hoshino and Kiyofumi Nakajima directed the adaptation instead Cinematographer Atsushi Okui introduced the idea of utilizing Dolby Cinema to Miyazaki during the production of Earwig and the Witch which received the director s approval Okui was particularly drawn to the technology s ability to maintain image sharpness in bright scenes while preventing dark areas from becoming overly black In October the director conveyed to T that he was making the film because he didn t have an answer to the question Kimitachi wa D Ikiru ka while the producer characterized the forthcoming release as an ambitious fantasy project In October Hoshino mentioned during a press conference that the production of the film had progressed quite smoothly even during the pandemic and was nearing completion Hoshino did not specify the exact release date for the film but added that it would indeed be Miyazaki s final film In December Takuya Kimura who voiced Howl in Howl s Moving Castle hinted that he was in the film with a post on social media Suzuki considered The Boy and the Heron to be the most expensive film ever produced in Japan The production timeline spanned approximately seven years comprising two and a half years dedicated to pre production activities and about five years for the production phase In June Suzuki clarified that the novel is not related to the film beyond inspiring the title br GKIDS managed casting for the English version in collaboration with Studio Ghibli adhering to the SAG AFTRA Foreign Dubbing Agreement during the SAG AFTRA strike The dub was directed by Michael Sinterniklaas at NYAV Post and Stephanie Sheh wrote the English script The English cast unveiled on October features Christian Bale Dave Bautista Gemma Chan Willem Dafoe Karen Fukuhara Mark Hamill Robert Pattinson and Florence Pugh br br br Themes br The Boy and the Heron has autobiographical features The protagonist Mahito Maki mirrors Miyazaki s childhood Miyazaki s father like Mahito s father was employed by a company involved in the manufacturing of fighter plane components Additionally Miyazaki s family had to evacuate from the city to the countryside during the war The hospital fire at the beginning of the film evokes personal parallels with Miyazaki s loss of his mother who was known for her strong opinions and is believed to have been a source of inspiration for several of the director s female characters Mahito s emotional connection with his mother parallels Miyazaki s love for his mother The BBC defined the film as a coming of age tale in which a child must overcome his selfishness and learn to live for others br Suzuki spoke of Miyazaki s desire to create the film based on personal experiences and relationships when he proposed it in He was initially taken aback given Miyazaki s avoidance of highly personal themes The narrative is inspired by Miyazaki s Mahito professional relationships with Isao Takahata Granduncle and Suzuki Heron and integrates themes of destruction reconstruction and imagination Following Takahata s death in revisions were made to the film shifting the focus from the Granduncle to the relationship between Mahito and Heron Suzuki observed that Miyazaki s storytelling choices were deeply influenced by the memories shared between him and Miyazaki br Taichiro Yoshino the grandson of Genzabur Yoshino confessed to being somewhat bewildered by the film s messages He also mentioned a meeting he had attended at Studio Ghibli s offices in during which Miyazaki articulated his intention to create the film and reminisced about his past works primarily featuring cheerful and optimistic male protagonists and contrasted them with his perception of boys as complex individuals Miyazaki aimed to depict a protagonist who grapples with inner conflicts and insecurities emphasizing the transformative power of overcoming personal challenges Yoshino drew a distinction between The Boy and the Heron and Kimitachi wa D Ikiru ka as separate works yet highlighted their shared central theme how individuals navigate and come to terms with a world characterized by strife and loss br The film contains the message of creating a world without conflict with your own hands According to The Japan Times Miyazaki s faith in children s potential to surpass previous generations under challenging circumstances is exemplified in the film s Japanese title which offers children a choice between emulating the chaos of Japan s past war or forging a better path and thus demonstrates the continued optimism that serves as the greatest testament to the director s imagination The Hollywood Reporter noted that the film retains elements of the book that emphasize the theme of spiritual growth The film open to diverse interpretations fundamentally conveys resilience in the face of conflict and grief while advocating for the cultivation of meaningful friendships and trustworthy alliances ultimately promoting progress and fostering humanity and understanding to the world IndieWire s analysis argues that the film weaves together various thematic layers and tonal elements drawn from Miyazaki s past work It draws attention to the film s departure from the conventional children s genre instead aligning more closely with the violent style of Princess Mononoke rather than the cuddly charm of My Neighbor Totoro with the exception of the Warawara characters br A review on RogerEbert com asserts that the film s narrative explores themes of acceptance redemption and the power of creation drawing explicit connections between Miyazaki s youthful inspirations and his hopes of inspiring others over four decades The film delves into the juxtaposition of life and death wherein childhood and the end of life can serve as reflective counterparts As highlighted by Unseen Japan the film s themes make the viewer reflect on their role in a world marked by violence and uncertainty their obligations to future generations and their connection to their ancestors This view is shared by some publications commenting that Miyazaki s recurring exploration of mortality and the aftermath of profound loss is a central theme in the film showing the importance of everyday choices and depicting a journey of self discovery and the search for meaning amidst the uncertainties of life and underlining the film s open ended approach in contrast to the book which is centered on the moral development of adolescent boys The narrative imparts various moral lessons but centers on an impassioned plea from an aging master Granduncle to his descendants emphasizing the urgency of their tasks as time passes quickly br For Nikkei Asia the primary emotional driver in the film is the yearning for a mother s presence This emotion fuels the narrative occasionally diverting into adventures involving fantastical creatures Mahito s father marries Hisako s sister evoking significant Freudian undertones Miyazaki emphasizes the child s perspective sometimes with quasi sexual elements as seen in encounters with frogs Such moments though evocative are brief and dreamlike The film stands as one of Miyazaki s less textured works focusing on Mahito s mission to save his mother and stepmother emblematic of Miyazaki s recurring theme of worthiness Fiction Horizon referred to Mahito as resonant and inspiring associating these traits with his resilience vulnerability and transformative growth br Vulture noted that despite the serious narrative of the multi themed film it deliberately includes scenes of bird droppings which provides comic relief and which it felt were in line with Miyazaki s broader message about the messy and natural aspects of life as opposed to the oppressive order of Imperial Japan depicted in the film br br br Music br br The film score was composed by Miyazaki s longtime collaborator Joe Hisaishi The soundtrack consisting of songs was released in Japan on August by Tokuma Japan Communications Kenshi Yonezu was in charge of the theme song titled Chiky gi lit Globe in Japan and Spinning Globe internationally Yonezu s first visit to Studio Ghibli in led to his collaboration with Miyazaki driven by his composition of Paprika for the Summer Olympics Suzuki witnessed Miyazaki singing the song with children at Ghibli s nursery school and the director approved the composition after reviewing a demo recording Yonezu shown storyboards and provided with project details engaged in a five year creative process with Miyazaki and Suzuki resulting in the completion of the musical composition br br br Release br br br Theatrical br On December Toho declared that The Boy and the Heron would be released theatrically in Japan on July The film was released in Japan without any traditional marketing campaign with no trailers or promotional stills of the film released before its premiere with the exception of a single poster The decision to do so came from Suzuki who opted to eschew traditional marketing methods due to concerns about over revealing film content in response to what he believed to be a fundamental preference among moviegoers for a more enigmatic cinematic experience The cast and crew were kept largely undisclosed until the release date After the preview screening held in late February where strict confidentiality measures were in place a message from Miyazaki was read out following the end credits saying Perhaps you didn t understand it I myself don t understand it On June during the opening day of Friday Road Show and Ghibli Exhibition Tokyo Speaking publicly on how Miyazaki was worried over the lack of publicity for the film Suzuki

release of a teaser trailer in advance of the film s international premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival to reach a wider audience while preserving Ghibli s branding and integrity At the international premiere where the director Guillermo del Toro introduced the film at its gala presentation Studio Ghibli s Vice President Junichi Nishioka said that contrary to rumors of retirement Ghibli did not consider The Boy and the Heron to be Miyazaki s final film and that Miyazaki is developing ideas for a new film and maintains a daily presence at his office dispelling any notions of retirement He said that Studio Ghibli did not envisage this film as a contender in award competitions and rejects the notion of associating films with wins or losses and that Miyazaki s primary aim is for the audience to watch and enjoy the film Suzuki reiterated Nishioka s statement about Miyazaki s next project in October saying that Miyazaki has already moved on from The Boy and the Heron and is thinking about his new film every day Later in the same month the official guidebook for the film was released showing behind the scenes featurettes such as interviews roundtable discussions and

rapid box office success for the film s unconventional minimalist promotion strategy The achievement has evoked mixed feelings among industry insiders with distribution representatives expressing concerns to taka fearing the challenge of this no promotion strategy on their livelihoods and the necessity of traditional advertising methods In addition to this marketing strategy taka identified two important aspects of the film s commercial success The first is that the deliberate approach of leaving the film by itself capitalized on its existing fan base by generating discussion and interaction on social media He also mentioned Ghibli s earlier works regularly featured on Friday Road Show for a decade indirectly promoted the film br As of April the film has grossed US million It

visuals and storytelling but pointed out that non Ghibli enthusiasts might find the rapid scene transitions confusing Film and culture magazine Cinemas observed that the film draws on motifs and

mature complex masterpiece weaving together the director s past present and future a beautiful enigma that promises to be worth the wait Cezary Jan Strusiewicz from Polygon found the fantasy elements
