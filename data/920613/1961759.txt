id: 1961759
Edna E Mode is a fictional character in Pixar s animated superhero film The Incredibles and its sequel Incredibles She is an eccentric fashion designer renowned for creating the costumes of several famous superheroes having worked particularly closely with Mr Incredible and Elastigirl Bob and Helen Parr with whom she has remained friends When the couple resumes their superhero careers after a fifteen year hiatus Edna is summoned out of retirement to help both characters now parents with their costumes personal lives and family matters br Edna was created by writer and director Brad Bird to explain how The Incredibles superheroes obtain their costumes a topic he believes is rarely explored in superhero films convincingly Bird also decided to voice the character himself after several actresses originally considered for the role failed to replicate Edna s unique accent The director understood that in addition to fashion expertise the character would need to demonstrate proficiency in science engineering and technology in order to create costumes capable of withstanding the trials of superheroic activities and ultimately conceived her as a short confident character of both German and Japanese descent based on these countries reputations as small yet powerful nations Inspired by Q from the James Bond franchise Edna is widely believed to have been based primarily on costume designer Edith Head although there continues to be constant speculation as to which celebrities inspired Edna particularly Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour Iris Apfel and actress Linda Hunt br Despite having only supporting roles in both films Edna has since established herself as The Incredibles breakout character due to her popularity among fans Film critics agree that Edna is a scene stealer particularly praising her humor and dialogue Bird has also been lauded for his voice acting earning an Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production for his performance as the character Edna has been recognized as one of Pixar s greatest characters by several prominent media publications br br Edna was created for The Incredibles by writer and director Brad Bird Having watched several superhero themed films and television shows prior to developing The Incredibles Bird had often found himself wondering who is responsible for making the superheroes elaborate costumes Bird conceived Edna upon discovering that despite featuring characters dressed in fancy extravagant costumes traditional superhero films rarely offer plausible explanations as to how superheroes come to obtain these outfits or who provides them in the first place The director wanted to debunk the trope of muscular superheroes sewing their own costumes finding it hard to believe that superheroes would suddenly develop a strong enough interest in fashion and textiles to design their own outfits Therefore Bird decided that if the world was populated with superheroes there would naturally also be people responsible for designing their costumes who must also have a background in science and engineering thereby envisioning Edna as a scientist and technical genius in addition to being a fashion designer The director elaborated The way I saw it the costumes had to be created by somebody with a scientific and engineering background thus conceiving Edna as a half German half Japanese tiny powerhouse of a character br The Incredibles was the first Pixar film to earn a PG rating Edna is considered to be one of the studio s earliest attempts at approaching darker edgier comedy which is particularly demonstrated by the scene in which the character cites several graphic examples of capes directly resulting in the deaths of several superheroes one of whom is shown being consumed and killed by a jet turbine According to Bird the creation of Edna took the notion of superheroes wearing designed costumes to a further extreme Edna was named after EMode a software Pixar used at the time the film was made Bird identified Edna as the most fun character he created for the film br br Edna follows the tradition of Pixar directors voicing secondary characters in their films which was based around Bird s authoritarian voice during production Bird s voice for the character originated from story boarding sessions during which various Pixar employees typically provide characters voices temporarily Although these voices are usually eventually replaced with professional actors there are some unique instances when the original voices are retained as was the case with Bird s Edna performance Bird had also provided temporary voices for other characters during this time including Bob Parr and Syndrome who were ultimately voiced by Craig T Nelson and Jason Lee respectively br Several actresses were considered for the role of Edna including a performer who repeatedly asked Bird to demonstrate her dialogue until eventually telling him to simply voice the character himself The role was also offered to actress and comedian Lily Tomlin who ultimately declined relenting that she could never voice the character as funnily as the director Finally succumbing to popular demand from his staff Bird joked that he was ultimately cast as Edna simply because he was both affordable and available at the time A similar approach was used for several other supporting characters in The Incredibles animator Bret Parker voices Kari the Parr family s teenage babysitter writer Bud Luckey voices government agent Rick Dicker and production designer Lou Romano voices Bernie Kropp Dash s teacher br Bird described Edna s accent as a combination of Japanese and German deciding to draw influence from these regions because they re two small countries that have amazing design and amazing technology citing cameras and cars as examples of technology they specialize in Although Bird s performance is considerably broad he prevents Edna from becoming too much of a caricature in order to maintain the illusion that she is one of the film s smartest characters In the Italian and French language dubs of the film Bird s comic accent is replaced by that of French Italian entertainer Amanda Lear who offers a more seductive biting interpretation Lear said that dubbing Edna s voice was not an easy process but accepted the job after being offered the role upon seeing the film at the Cannes Film Festival in order to fulfill her dream of having always wanted to voice a Disney character Edna was the first character Lear was hired to dub in Italian br br Bird believes he shares some of Edna s personality traits specifically how he prefers to be involved in virtually every creative aspect of his projects Admitting both he and his character emanate immense self confidence when it comes to their own work and opinions Bird identified Edna as one of the film s most difficult characters to design The character went through several different changes in appearance during the development process ranging from taller and overweight to older younger and thinner Inspired by the large impact countries such as Japan and Germany have on the world despite being comparatively small in size Bird decided Edna would reflect this theme by being a tiny character that dominates the room when she gets into it Her home which uses high end technology similar to what she incorporates into the outfits she creates was deliberately designed to be significantly larger than she is to further emphasize this theme of dominance Edna s small stature was also inspired by singer Bette Midler of whom Bird has always been a fan The director recalled being surprised by Midler s height when he first met her Because she absolutely dominates the screen And it just struck me how much personality was in this small body In terms of animation Bird wanted all of the film s characters to move differently from each other providing Edna with a very confident walk to represent the fact that she has never experienced doubt in her life The animators found the fact that Bird provided the character s voice himself to be very helpful as he would often act out the way in which the character acts and behaves himself which helped in further defining the animators vision of Edna According to Bird Edna despite her petite stature is the only non superhero in The Incredibles capable of making superheroes feel uncomfortable Bird described Edna as a character who is not remotely intimidated by superheroes or anyone refusing to accept the word no when it is used in opposition of her opinions or beliefs br Describing Edna s physical attributes as severe Bird had envisioned the character with glasses and a pageboy haircut while remaining modern and elegant Edna s ethnicity has been identified as half German and half Japanese Both Edna s design personality and voice are widely believed to have been based on costume designer Edith Head with whom she shares her signature round glasses black bob cut and forthright demeanor Bird described Edna as a combination of Head and Q a character from the James Bond franchise The director has generally declined to confirm any direct influences on the character insisting that Edna is not based on one specific person although Head continues to be considered the character s most legitimate alleged inspiration However animator Teddy Newton who co designed Edna with Bird revealed he was inspired by the film Unzipped a documentary exploring the petulance of fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi and stylist Polly Allen Mellen Critics and fans have long speculated about the real life inspiration behind Edna s design and appearance Bird stated he has constantly been told by various fans and viewers that the character reminds them of at least different celebrities since the character debuted in The Incredibles Contributing to Fashion Erin Dunlop described the character as a supercharged hybrid of every fashion industry legend we can think of In an article discussing who Edna is based on Entertainment Weekly s Steve Daly cited Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour designer Coco Chanel and actress Lotte Lenya as possible influences while drawing similarities between the character s use of large framed glasses to architect Philip Johnson producer Robert Evans talent agent Swifty Lazar studio executive Lew Wasserman and fashion editor Carrie Donovan Some critics have suspected that the character is also based on Mary Quant and Una Jones Acknowledging that there are several female fashion designers who wear glasses upon whom Edna could have been based Bird admitted he drew inspiration from Head author Patricia Highsmith and actress Linda Hunt br For the sequel in order to design costumes for a character who happens to be a designer herself Imagire drew upon art school lessons while imagining what the character might be thinking when designing her own clothes Meanwhile character artist Deanna Marsigliese s first assignment was to create an entire line of clothing designed by Edna Although ultimately the completed clothing line was not used in the final film Marsigliese considered the experience a study in Edna s character nonetheless and drew inspiration from Edna s wardrobe and belongings in the first film Although she was aware that Edna enjoys being dramatic she acknowledges that designers do not necessarily have the same aesthetic as their clients Similarly Imagire agreed that fashion designers such as Kawakubo Ishioka and Abe always dressed comfortably in comparison to their models a contrast she wanted Edna to reflect Recalling that Edna dislikes models the artist envisioned that the character would instead design her own clothing to serve as a vehicle to celebrate superheroes and her powers Inspired by Italian fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli Marsigliese created a classic mid century inspired silhouette for Edna s costumes that were also bold and dramatic as though Edna herself had designed them then rearranging the designs to ultimately give them a more surreal appearance Dubbing the character a woman of the now Marsigliese explained that like Schiaparelli Edna is completely ahead of her time despite living in the s she used a lot of surrealist elements a lot of fun surprises and that was very inspiring for me br br According to Matthew Brunson of Creative Loafing Edna provides the majority of the film s comic relief Hischak believes Edna offers a whole new viewpoint to the world of superheroes in addition to demonstrating the film s oddball silliness Vogue Italia published a biography of Edna in which author Valentina Fabbri described her as a character who knows she s the best and she doesn t hide it and her lack of modesty is equalled only by her intuition with whom it is virtually impossible to have a conversation because she tends to dominate Due to her combination of genius level intellect and craziness Fabbri identified Edna as a fun bubbly caricature of the magicians of fashion by embod ying their talent and charisma their vices and virtues Screen Rant s Victoria Robertson observed that the character has a lot of personality packed into a small exterior taking stereotypical traits often attributed to designers and making them her own firstly remaining proud of her own work at all times Oliver Lyttelton of IndieWire identified Edna as quite possibly the film s most intelligent character Edna s criticisms of fashion can come off as unpleasant at times but are exaggerated to the point of which audiences find them to be comical Edna prefers to always think about the future finding dwelling on the past to be distracting from the present as demonstrated by her line I never look back dahling it distracts from the now and thus has proven capable of determining the needs of her superhero clientele before they have the opportunity to finalize their ideas themselves Her personality has been described by GamesRadar s Joshua Winning as brassy and no nonsense Q Fox described Edna as a gifted designer an assertive life coach and a witty talker using her mind and intelligence as a means of solving everyday issues BuddyTV believes that the character s bold and eccentric attitude is rivaled only by her considerable talent According to Kevin Carr of Film School Rejects Edna doesn t take crap from anyone yet she does so with poise and pride The San Francisco Chronicle s Carla Meyer argues that Edna is more a caricature than a character br br Scott Tobias of Rolling Stone called Edna a reminder that the superhero suit needs to the perfect synthesis of form and function without which greatness as both a crimefighter and an icon is impossible According to Thomas S Hischak author of Greatest American and British Animated Films Edna is just as concerned with the appearance of the costumes she designs as she is about their use and practicality proving capable of designing outfits that can stretch change their shape and resist oncoming attacks The character proves capable of designing a costume for Violet that can turn invisible whenever its wearer does She absolutely refuses to incorporate capes into her new designs due to the accessory having a history of contributing to the deaths of superheroes in the past among them Dynaguy Thunderhead Stratogale Meta Man and Splashdown presenting them as a montage of superhero couture faux pas Ultimately her belief in the dangers of capes is confirmed by the death of the film s villain Syndrome In terms of her own appearance Edna is costumed in futuristic black attire wearing a black dress that boasts square lines Estimating her height to be of approximately three feet The Tyee s Dorothy Woodend wrote that Edna is dressed in Issey Miyake pleats while being of indeterminate gender VPRO drew similarities between the character s hairstyle and personality to that of Vogue editor Anna Wintour the resemblance to whom Tech Times Katherine Derla identified as The first thing viewers are likely to remember upon seeing the character According to STATUS magazine Edna is often mistaken for the magazine editor largely due to her snappy sass and iconic bob Film s Angie Han joked that Edna s no nonsense demeanor would leave Wintour quaking in her Chanel boots When asked about the alleged similarities between her and the character Wintour revealed that she has yet to see the film Derla also wrote that Edna is capable of run ing the world but opts to operate from behind the scenes instead The term diminutive is often used to describe the character s height br Revering herself as too talented to design clothes for humans Edna resents having been forced to resort to designing for supermodels during the year absence of superheroes dismissing models as spoiled self centered stick figures after working with them in Milan and Paris She jokes that there is nothing super about supermodels despite their name Edna likens designing for superheroes to designing for gods and thus considers herself far superior to other fashion designers Despite her success as one of the world s most sought after designers Edna longs to return to working with superheroes so she can challenge her designs by fusing them with the latest technology Despite designing elaborate costumes for a living Edna prefers a more simple aesthetic for herself generally avoiding nail polish and accessories Racked s Carlye Wisel observed that although the sequel may have deep roots in midcentury modern design Edna remains true to her forward looking style wearing a red silk kimono In addition to designing their clothes she offers her clients advice whenever she feels they require it demonstrating a zero tolerance policy for emotional weakness which according to The Dissolve s Charles Bramesco echoes Bird s lament ing regular folks tendency to impede awesome people from being awesome Edna is known to refer to her clients as dahling who affectionately call her E In addition to citing her resemblance to Wintour journalist Hadley Freeman of The Guardian believes Edna s use of fashion in the film represents The highest pinnacle of human achievement without whom the world would end br br Edna first appears in The Incredibles as a fashion designer to superheroes and close friend of the titular characters During the golden age of superheroes Edna is one of a few elite guests who attend the private wedding ceremony of Bob and Helen Parr then better known to the public as the superheroes Mr Incredible and Elastigirl After all superheroes have been

film when she is unexpectedly visited by Bob who has resumed superhero work undercover a secret he keeps from his family Bob initially asks Edna to simply repair his original super suit but she ultimately convinces him to allow her to design an entirely new outfit on the condition that capes not be incorporated whatsoever due to safety concerns ultimately ending her years long retirement from superhero work Helen soon discovers that Bob s original super suit had received a patch job determining that the only person capable of repairing a super suit would be Edna and growing more suspicious of Bob s actions Later in the film Helen visits Edna in the hopes of finding out more information about Bob s whereabouts discovering that she had taken the liberty of designing a complete
