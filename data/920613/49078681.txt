Freeform is an American basic cable channel owned and operated by ABC Family Worldwide a sub division of the Disney Entertainment business segment and division of the Walt Disney Company Freeform primarily broadcasts programming geared toward teenagers and young adults with some skewing toward young women in the age range a target demographic designated by the channel as becomers Its programming includes contemporary off network syndicated reruns and original series feature films and made for TV original movies br Since the network was launched on April it has undergone various changes to its programming format and naming under different owners The network was originally founded as a religious channel the CBN Satellite Service an extension of televangelist Pat Robertson s Christian Broadcasting Network It evolved into a family focused entertainment network in It was spun off into a for profit company known as International Family Entertainment IFE in eventually becoming known as The Family Channel As a condition of the spin off the channel was contractually required to maintain airings of The Club and an annual telethon the last Sunday in January these conditions have applied to all future owners of the channel br In IFE and the Family Channel were acquired by a joint venture between News Corporation and Haim Saban This resulted in its rebranding as the Fox Family Channel a year later The new owners wanted to reposition the network toward younger viewers as a companion for the unpopular Fox Kids Network The venture was sold to Disney in October after the network began to struggle as a result of their changes The channel altered its name to ABC Family one month later on November The network was later rebranded as Freeform on January br As of September Freeform was available to more than million households in the United States according to Nielsen estimates The network s president reports to the chairman of Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment br br br History br br br Early history br br The channel traces its origins to the launch of the CBN Satellite Service CBN Satellite Network an arm of Pat Robertson s Christian Broadcasting Network CBN on April Focusing mainly on religious programming the channel was notable for being one of the first cable channels to distribute its signal nationally through satellite transmission the third overall as the method had been first pioneered by HBO in September as well as the first national basic cable originated network TBS which became the second cable channel in the U S to begin transmitting via satellite in December originated as a feed of broadcast television station WTCG now WPCH TV in Atlanta Georgia The channel changed its name to the CBN Cable Network on September and adopted a more secular programming format featuring a mix of family oriented series and films while retaining some religious programs from various televangelists mirroring the format used by CBN s independent television stations of that time Around this time the channel began airing a late night block of classic family oriented shows like You Bet Your Life with Groucho Marx I Married Joan and The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis This block of programming is said by some to have inspired the debut of the Nick at Nite classic TV block on Nickelodeon By this point its carriage grew to million homes with a cable television subscription br On January the word Family was incorporated into the channel s name to better reflect its programming format rebranding as The CBN Family Channel By the network had grown too profitable to remain under the Christian Broadcasting Network umbrella without endangering the ministry s non profit status On January of that year CBN spun out the network into a new for profit corporation known as International Family Entertainment IFE Managed by Pat Robertson s eldest son Timothy IFE was co owned by the Robertsons with a minority interest held by Liberty Media and Tele Communications Inc TCI owner John C Malone Following the spin off the channel s name was officially shortened to The Family Channel on September br As a stipulation included as part of the spin out from CBN to International Family Entertainment The Family Channel was required to continue its daily airings of CBN s flagship program The Club During this time from to The Family Channel sponsored NASCAR Winston Cup Series driver Ted Musgrave in the Ford Thunderbird for Roush Racing br br br Fox Family br br In after International Family Entertainment put The Family Channel up for sale News Corporation made an offer to acquire the channel The company aimed to turn The Family Channel into a competitor to children s cable networks such as Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon leveraging the library of Fox Kids Worldwide which was a joint venture between Fox and Haim Saban News Corporation negotiated to purchase a stake in the channel with IFE as a partner After competing bids were submitted by Nickelodeon parent Viacom and The Walt Disney Company parent of fellow competitor Disney Channel to acquire IFE as a whole News Corporation placed its own bid to buy the company for billion On June International Family Entertainment was acquired by the Fox Saban consortium renamed Fox Family Worldwide for billion The Family Channel was officially renamed Fox Family Channel on August br br When Fox Family Worldwide bought the channel the management team assigned to the network headed by newly appointed president and chief executive officer Rich Cronin sought to re program it towards a new dual audience kids in daytime families at night Notable programs aired during this era included S Club in Miami a sitcom serving as a starring vehicle for the eponymous British pop group and Big Wolf on Campus The New York Times classified both series as being among a larger wave of television programming catered towards children aged through also referred to as tweens Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen were also a prominent fixture of Fox Family s schedule The Adventures of Mary Kate Ashley and reruns of their short lived ABC sitcom Two of a Kind received frequent airplay by the channel Fox Family also planned to premiere a new original sitcom starring the twins So Little Time in June Airings of The Club were scaled back to three per day However this youth oriented programming strategy alienated the network s core audience of older viewers there was a drop in prime time viewership and Fox Family fell from th to th place in overall Nielsen cable network viewership numbers In October two spin off cable networks named Boyz Channel and Girlz Channel launched on select cable operators Both networks contained programming content targeted at the respective genders both channels ceased operations after one year on the air in August due to a combination of very limited national carriage by cable providers Boyz Channel and Girlz Channel were each carried in some homes in an era when digital cable television was in its infancy and the controversy that developed over the gender segregated channels br In the wake of Fox Family s struggles Saban offered to acquire the stake in the network held by News Corporation which had also begun negotiations to acquire television provider DirecTV but was unable to agree to a proper valuation A decision was made to sell the venture to a third party br br br Sale to Disney and rebranding as ABC Family br br On July it was announced that News Corporation and Saban had agreed to sell Fox Family Worldwide to The Walt Disney Company for billion in cash plus the assumption of billion in debt The sale gave Disney control of the Fox Family Channel Saban Entertainment and the international Fox Kids cable networks controlled by Fox Family Worldwide among other assets Analysts felt that Disney s purchase of Fox Family was influenced by the ongoing consolidation occurring in the media industry such as the then recently completed merger of America Online AOL and Time Warner and a desire to acquire a new pay TV outlet that had significant carriage at the time of the purchase the network was seen in million homes On November it was announced that the network would be renamed ABC Family in January co branding it with the company s flagship television property ABC which Disney has owned since Disney planned to perform layoffs at the network in order to reduce redundancy br Disney planned to maintain the off network ABC sitcoms Fox Family had acquired and add reruns of ABC and Touchstone Television distributed series such as According to Jim My Wife and Kids and Whose Line Is It Anyway There were initially plans to create a version of ABC s TGIF block for the channel as well Disney originally planned to use the channel to show reruns of current ABC programming although this strategy was hindered by the fact that ABC did not hold syndication rights to all of its programming at the time The company developed a programming strategy to turn ABC Family into a broad appeal programming network with its own identity picking up same season encores of ABC series such as Alias Less Than Perfect and Life with Bonnie adding a weeknight sitcom block and continuing to emphasize movies having already reached a year agreement for the cable rights to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone The network also announced plans to develop new original series though several series that originated on the channel under the Fox Family identity were canceled such as the s set period dramedy State of Grace and the channel scaled back its made for cable movie output br br The next major plan was to reposition the channel to market it toward college students young women or at a more hip audience under the name XYZ a reverse reference to ABC Disney ABC chose not to move forward with the XYZ rebranding rumoredly due to a stipulation thought to have been put in place by Pat Robertson during the sale of the network to Fox which rumoredly mandated that the word Family must be contained in the name of the channel for the entirety of its existence regardless as to who owns it The network was also used as a buffer to burn off failed ABC series such as the reality competition series All American Girl which featured former Spice Girls member Geri Halliwell The network s strength was also increased through the production of original series and films br Disney continued to be subject to stipulations requiring CBN programming including that The Club be aired thrice daily on the network On August Disney began distancing itself further from Robertson following his controversial remarks suggesting that Venezuelan president Hugo Ch vez should be assassinated An ABC Family spokesperson stated that it had no editorial control over The Club and that the company strongly rejects the views expressed by Pat Robertson Following the incident the disclaimers aired before CBN programs on ABC Family were also amended with a more explicit statement indicating that the views expressed during the programs did not reflect those of the channel br br br A New Kind of Family br On August ABC Family introduced a new slogan and imaging campaign A New Kind of Family The rebranding coincided with a new original programming strategy which targeted the teen and young adult demographics with series incorporating diverse portrayals of family lives as well as teen dramas At this time ABC Family discontinued Jetix an action oriented morning children s block that debuted on the network in relegating the block exclusive to sister channel Toon Disney br New original series such as the fantasy drama Kyle XY college set dramedy Greek and drama series The Secret Life of the American Teenager proved popular for the network the premieres of Kyle XY and Secret Life set viewership records for the channel In July the network earned its best ever ratings for the month of July in primetime and in total viewership credited to the strength of Secret Life and new series Make It or Break It Things I Hate About You and Ruby the Rockits along with airings of the Harry Potter film franchise and the television premiere of Labor Pains br On June ABC Family premiered Pretty Little Liars a teen drama based on the series of young adult mystery novels by Sara Shepard Pretty Little Liars quickly became ABC Family s flagship program frequently breaking ratings records by Pretty Little Liars had ranked among the five most watched scripted series on basic cable among multiple female age demographics and the second highest rated cable series among females Throughout the year ABC Family as a whole experienced its highest year to year primetime viewership among viewers in the and demographics With million viewers across its first broadcast and an encore airing the premiere of Switched at Birth surpassed Secret Life as the most watched series premiere in network history br Owing to his success at ABC Family The Walt Disney Company promoted network president Paul Lee to become president of the ABC Entertainment Group in July adding the main ABC network and ABC Studios to his oversight Lee resigned from the company in February and was replaced by Channing Dungey br br br Rebranding to Freeform br br In a December article Variety reported that ABC Family executives were proposing a relaunch of the network that would occur as early as including the expansion of programming appealing more toward young adults between the ages of and as opposed to families or teenagers as well as adopting new branding including a new name among the options being considered During the channel s upfront presentation on April ABC Family executives announced that it would establish a focus on becomers a group termed by network representatives to refer to what are normally identified as millennials ABC Family president Tom Ascheim explained in describing this demographic The most important question that young people ask themselves as they re going from high school to their thirties is Who am I becoming So we call the life stage becoming and the people going through it Becomers br On October Disney ABC Television Group announced that ABC Family would be rebranded as Freeform Ascheim explained that Freeform was intended to represent how becomers are in the formation of their lives and that the brand would reflect a participatory experience for viewers across multiple platforms An extensive campaign to promote the rebrand kicked off on the date of the announcement and encompassed the network s popular Nights of Halloween and Days of Christmas blocks during the fourth quarter of that year The new name which was chosen among proposals with some initial consideration of retaining ABC in the name was necessitated after an audience survey that sampled opinions of regular ABC Family viewers as well those who watched the channel on an infrequent basis revealed that although regular viewers understood the network s youth skewing concept non frequent viewers perceived the channel as still being more of a wholesome family oriented network br At the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour on January in addressing the reasoning behind the name which had been derided by some viewers on social media and news websites reporting on the pending rebrand ABC Family president Tom Ascheim noted that while it does not mind the wholesome perception it does not necessarily represent the network While it was rumored that the sale of the network from International Family Entertainment to Fox contained a stipulation that the channel must contain Family in its name in perpetuity regardless of its owner as supported by the failed proposal to relaunch the channel as XYZ in initially announcing the channel s rebranding Ascheim clarified that this was merely an urban legend as no such clause has been corroborated to have existed br The rebranding as Freeform took effect on January coinciding with the premiere of the second half of Pretty Little Liars sixth season and the series premiere of Shadowhunters a fantasy drama based on Cassandra Clare s novel series The Mortal Instruments As Freeform the channel planned to double the amount of original programming on its schedule through However despite firmly focusing on its specified target audience Freefor continued to carry much of the existing programming it aired beforehand under the ABC Family brand including family oriented series and films and its annual Days of Christmas and Nights of Halloween events br Although the socially conservative views expressed during the programs conflict with the culturally progressive adult content of some of the channel s secular programming Freeform also retained The Club and The Club Interactive along with CBN s day long telethon on the last Sunday in January as network executives were not able to reach an agreement with Pat Robertson to buy out CBN s time buy contract with the channel Disney ABC offered to pay million roughly the same amount that the ministry earned in revenue during from syndication fees for The Club and various related productions to terminate the agreement with the Christian Broadcasting Network though Robertson stipulated a higher payout that Ascheim deemed astronomical in comparison to its actual value The network airs disclaimers before and after the show airs mentioning that the network did not produce the programming and are often delivered in a sardonic tone similar to the bumpers on Adult Swim The disclaimers range from apologizing for carrying the program suggesting viewers change the channel and referencing the network s contractual obligation to carry the program br On April Freeform ordered a series from ABC Signature and Marvel Television based on the comic book series Cloak and Dagger marking the first work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to have been developed for the network Marvel Television had a Cloak and Dagger and Mockingbird based series in development for the network as early as Freeform also announced several new non scripted productions in development including Later Bitches a new late night talk show produced by The Daily Show alumni Jennifer Flanz and Elise Terrel an untitled late night talk show starring Iliza Shlesinger and Snapshots a series of pop culture oriented documentaries co produced by ESPN Films Shlesinger s new show Truth Iliza premiered on May In October the channel indicated that it would go to four nights of original programming starting in br br br A Little Forward br br On January Freeform unveiled a new logo and slogan A Little Forward which officially debuted on March The new slogan reflects refinements to the network s programming direction with a larger focus on forward looking series such as The Bold Type and the Black ish spin off Grown ish President Tom Ascheim explained that with the rebranding Freeform was purposefully and passionately moving our brand forward by defying expectations and dismantling conventions busting stereotypes of theme cast and culture in service to a more inclusive world on and off screen The network also unveiled upcoming series in development such as Scott Stewart s Augs as well as a new trailer and June premiere date for Marvel s Cloak and Dagger br On November Freeform s president Karey Burke was promoted to president of the ABC Entertainment Group to replace the outgoing Channing Dungey Burke s replacement at Freeform was to be determined at a later date On March Freeform announced that the channel was placing two animated series into development called Betches and Woman World These were the network s first original animated series since changing its name from ABC Family and served as the foundation of a female oriented animation block br br br Shift of programming towards Hulu and end of Spectrum carriage present br In May former Netflix executive Tara Duncan who was signed to an overall deal with sister streaming service Hulu in April became the new president of Freeform replacing the departing Ascheim who left to join Warner Bros Kids Young Adults and Classics br In April the network began a larger expansion into non scripted programming announcing the projects Day to Night later retitled The Come Up Dear Pony Keep This Between Us a documentary on child grooming in American high schools and The Deep End a documentary on Teal Swan br On September Freeform underwent a second rebranding initiated by Duncan and designed by Collins which launched alongside the premiere of The Come Up The logo consists of a wordmark with curved cut outs in its F lettering intended to create illusory motions Freeform s senior vice president of content marketing Joe Ortiz explained that the designs were intended to reflect the ability to change and an openness to change and create a sense we are never static and always growing br On September the carriage agreement between Disney and Charter expired due to the latter s request that Disney provide free access to Disney and ESPN for all of Charter s subscribers Disney requested that Charter maintain temporary carriage of their TV networks during the negotiation period but Charter declined This resulted in a dark period that lasted days during which million Spectrum TV customers lost access to Disney s TV networks br On September Charter and Disney agreed to a renewed carriage agreement which allowed Spectrum TV customers to resume watching the Disney content that were originally promised in their subscription package However several lower priority TV networks were permanently dropped in the renewed agreement In addition to Freeform other networks affected included BabyTV FXX FXM Nat Geo Wild Nat Geo Mundo Disney Junior and Disney XD Though Disney emphasized that there would be no change to its commitment to the Freeform brand some analysts expressed doubt about it remaining as a linear channel in future provider negotiations br br br Programming br br Outside of prime time Freeform as of July offers a slate of mostly reruns of contemporary comedy series and animated sitcom

br br Criticism br With the introduction of new shows to the network by Disney some parents reacted negatively to ABC Family s programming feeling that the network has gone from family friendly to too risqu and that content in shows such as Greek The Secret Life of the American Teenager The Fosters and Becoming Us was far too racy for family viewing Some critics claimed that ABC Family executives were only after attracting viewers without concern about showing young people in questionable scenarios in its series and films The main focus of the criticism was on teenage pregnancy underage drinking and LGBT related issues The channel s programming content standards had changed several years earlier after the sale of the channel by Pat Robertson and International Family Entertainment The channel had even aired some acquired series and movies that contained profanity violence and sexual content or dialogue after the sale to News Corporation only running this programming somewhat more
