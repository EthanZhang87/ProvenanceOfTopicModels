Versailles in June Another was its revelation of United States war plans on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack The Tribune s June front page announcement that the United States had broken Japan s

br A week later after studying the transcripts the paper s editorial board observed that the high dedication to grand principles that Americans have a right to expect from a President is missing from the transcript record The Tribune s editors concluded that nobody of sound mind can read the transcripts and continue to think that Mr Nixon has upheld the standards and dignity of the Presidency and called for Nixon s resignation The Tribune call for Nixon to resign made news reflecting not only the change in the type of conservatism practiced by the paper but as a watershed event in terms of Nixon s hopes for survival in office The White House reportedly perceived the Tribune s editorial as a loss of a long time supporter and as a blow to Nixon s hopes to weather the scandal br On
