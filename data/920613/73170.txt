gives the lamp to Jafar who throws him and Abu into the cave although not before Abu steals it back Later Aladdin rubs the lamp and meets the Genie who lives inside The Genie grants Aladdin three

Aladdin instead decides to keep his promise and frees the Genie Realizing Aladdin s nobility the Sultan allows Jasmine to marry whoever she chooses The Genie bids the group a fond farewell and leaves to explore the world while Aladdin and Jasmine start their new life together br br br Cast br br Scott Weinger as Aladdin a poor yet kind hearted Agrabah thief For his audition Weinger sent a homemade audition tape as Aladdin with his mother playing the Genie and after several callbacks found out six months later that he had been cast as the title character Aladdin s supervising animator was Glen Keane Brad Kane provides Aladdin s singing voice br Robin Williams as the Genie a hyperactive jinn with great power that can be exercised only when his master wishes it He serves as the film s comic relief Clements and Musker had written the role of the Genie for Robin Williams but when met with resistance created a reel of a Williams s stand up animation of the Genie The directors asked Eric Goldberg the Genie s supervising animator to animate the character over one of Williams s old stand up comedy routines to pitch the idea to the actor The resulting test in which Williams s stand up about schizophrenia was translated to the Genie growing another head to argue with himself made Williams laugh his ass off and convinced him to sign for the role Williams s appearance in Aladdin marked the beginning of a transition in animation to use celebrity voice actors rather than specifically trained voice actors br Williams also voices a peddler who appears at the beginning of the film who the directors intended to be the same Genie in disguise narrating the story The peddler s singing voice was provided by Bruce Adler br Linda Larkin as Jasmine the beautiful princess of Agrabah and daughter of the Sultan who is bored with life in the royal palace Larkin was chosen for the role of Jasmine nine months after her audition and had to adjust and lower her high pitched voice to reach the voice that the filmmakers were looking for in the character Jasmine s supervising animator was Mark Henn Lea Salonga provides Jasmine s singing voice br Jonathan Freeman as Jafar the power hungry Grand vizier of Agrabah Freeman was the first actor cast and spent months recording his dialogue He eventually readjusted his voice after Weinger and Larkin were cast as he felt that Jafar had to be seen as a real threat to Aladdin and Jasmine as he was originally envisioned as an irritable character but the directors decided that a calm villain would be scarier Jafar s supervising animator was Andreas Deja while Jafar s beggar and snake forms were animated by Kathy Zielinski br Frank Welker as Abu Aladdin s kleptomaniac pet monkey with a falsetto voice Welker also voices Jasmine s tiger Rajah and the Cave of Wonders Duncan Marjoribanks was the supervising animator for Abu Aaron Blaise was the supervising animator for Rajah and Goldberg was the supervising animator for the Cave of Wonders br Gilbert Gottfried as Iago Jafar s sardonic hot tempered parrot sidekick Will Finn was the supervising animator for Iago br Douglas Seale as the Sultan the na ve yet friendly ruler of Agrabah who desperately tries to find a suitor for his daughter Jasmine The Sultan s supervising animator was David Pruiksma br Jim Cummings as Razoul the Captain of the Guards Phil Young and Chris Wahl animated him and the other guards br Charlie Adler as Gazeem a thief who Jafar sends into the Cave of Wonders at the beginning of the film but is trapped inside for being unworthy Gazeem was animated by T Daniel Hofstedt br Corey Burton as Prince Achmed an arrogant prince who Jasmine rejects as a suitor br br br Production br br br Script and development br In lyricist Howard Ashman pitched the idea of an animated musical adaptation of Aladdin Ashman had written a page film treatment remaining faithful to the plot and characters of the original story but envisioned as a campy s style musical with a popular s style Genie With partner Alan Menken Ashman composed several songs and added original characters to the story such as Aladdin s friends Babkak Omar and Kassim br However Michael Eisner did not think that a story set in the Middle East would be commercially appealing and their project was removed from active development Ashman and Menken were soon recruited to compose songs for Beauty and the Beast Linda Woolverton who had also worked on Beauty and the Beast used their treatment and developed a draft with inspired elements from The Thief of Bagdad such as a villain named Jaf far an aged sidekick retired human thief named Abu and a human handmaiden for the princess br Directors Ron Clements and John Musker joined the production picking Aladdin from three projects offered which also included an adaptation of Swan Lake and King of the Jungle that eventually became The Lion King Before Ashman s death in March he and Menken composed Arabian Nights Friend Like Me Prince Ali and Ashman s last song Humiliate the Boy br Musker and Clements wrote a draft of the screenplay and delivered a story reel to studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg in April Katzenberg thought that the script didn t engage and on a day known by the staff as Black Friday he demanded that the entire story be rewritten without rescheduling the film s November release date Katzenberg requested for Clements and Musker to not be heavily dependent on Ashman s vision and the removal of Aladdin s mother remarking Eighty six the mother The mom s a zero br Katzenberg also influenced changing the plot element about Jasmine s marriage which originally had her to be married by age sixteen as required by law to remove the age the Sultan says only your next birthday and make it more specific that her suitor needed to be a prince which would also set up the ending in which the Sultan inspired by Aladdin s altruism changes the law to make it legal for Jasmine to able to marry anyone she deems worthy br Screenwriting duo Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were brought in to rework the story and the changes they made included the removal of Aladdin s mother the strengthening of the character of Princess Jasmine and the deletion of several of Ashman and Menken s songs Aladdin s personality was rewritten to be a little rougher like a young Harrison Ford the parrot Iago originally conceived as an uptight British archetype was reworked to a comic role after the filmmakers saw Gilbert Gottfried in Beverly Hills Cop II who was cast for the role By October Katzenberg was satisfied with the new version of Aladdin As with Woolverton s screenplay several characters and plot elements were based on The Thief of Bagdad although the location of the film was changed from Baghdad to the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah due to the Gulf War Because the war prevented them from travelling to Baghdad for research most of their research took place at the Saudi Arabian expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center br According to a article in The Advocate Katzenberg asked Thomas Schumacher an openly gay producer if any of the gay references in the film offended him such as a scene in which the Genie becomes an effeminate clothier and another in which he tells Aladdin I really like you too kid but that doesn t mean I want to pick out curtains with you Schumacher responded that such references were in good fun remarking that I know we all argue amongst ourselves but why try to deny the fact that swishy fashion designers exist They do What are we running from Show me ten hairdressers I ll show you eight gay men br br br Design and animation br br The design for most characters is based on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld which production designer Richard Vander Wende also considered appropriate to the theme due to similarities to the flowing and swooping lines found in Arabic calligraphy Jafar s design was not based on Hirschfeld s work because Jafar s supervising animator Andreas Deja wanted the character to be contrasting Each character was animated alone with the animators consulting with each other to make scenes with interrelating characters br Because Aladdin s animator Glen Keane was working in the California branch of Walt Disney Feature Animation and Jasmine s animator Mark Henn was in Florida at Disney MGM Studios they had to frequently phone fax or send designs and discs to each other The animators filmed monkeys at the San Francisco Zoo to study their movements for Abu s character Iago s supervising animator Will Finn tried to incorporate some aspects of Gottfried s appearance into the parrot s design especially his semi closed eyes and the always appearing teeth Some aspects of the Sultan were inspired by the Wizard of Oz to create a bumbling authority figure br Andreas Deja Jafar s supervising animator tried to incorporate Jonathan Freeman s facial expressions and gesturing into the character Animator Randy Cartwright described working on the Magic Carpet as challenging since it is only a rectangular shape that expresses itself through pantomime It s sort of like acting by origami Cartwright kept folding a piece of cloth while animating to see how to position the Carpet After the character animation was done the carpet s surface design was applied digitally br br Designed by a team led by supervising animator Glen Keane Aladdin was initially going to be as young as thirteen and was originally made to resemble actor Michael J Fox During production it was decided that the design was too boyish and lacked appeal so the character was made seventeen to eighteen and redesigned to add elements derived from actor Tom Cruise and Calvin Klein models br For the scenery design various architectural elements seen in th century orientalist paintings and photographs of the Arab world were used for guidance Other inspirations for design were Disney s animated films from the s and s and the film The Thief of Bagdad The coloring was done with the computerized CAPS process and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality the protagonists use light colors such as blue the antagonists darker ones such as red and black and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow Computer animation was used for several elements of the film such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene in which Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave Some of the software that was used was Pixar s RenderMan br Musker and Clements created the Genie with Robin Williams in mind although Katzenberg suggested actors such as John Candy Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role Williams came for voice recording sessions during breaks while filming two films he was making at the time Hook and Toys Unusual for an animated film much of Williams s dialogue was ad libbed For some scenes Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions but allowed to improvise his lines It is estimated that Williams improvised characters Eric Goldberg the supervising animator for the Genie reviewed Williams s recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match br The producers added many in jokes and references to Disney s previous works in the film such as a cameo appearance from directors Clements and Musker and drawing some characters based on Disney workers Beast Sebastian and Pinocchio make brief appearances and the wardrobe of the Genie at the end of the film a Goofy hat a Hawaiian shirt and sandals are a reference to a short film that Robin Williams did for the Disney MGM Studios tour in the late s br br br Robin Williams s conflicts with the studio br br In gratitude for his success with Touchstone Pictures s Good Morning Vietnam Robin Williams voiced the Genie for SAG scale pay instead of his usual asking fee of million on the condition that neither his name nor image be used for marketing and that his character take no more than of space on advertising artwork since Williams s film Toys was scheduled for release one month after Aladdin s debut For financial reasons the studio reneged on both counts especially in poster art by having the Genie in of the image but having other major and supporting characters portrayed considerably smaller The Disney Hyperion book Aladdin The Making of an Animated Film lists both of Williams s characters the Peddler and the Genie ahead of main characters but was forced to refer to him as only the actor signed to play the Genie br Disney while not using Williams s name in commercials as per the contract used his voice for the Genie in the commercials and used the Genie character to sell toys and fast food tie ins without having to pay Williams additional money Williams unhappily quipped at the time You realize when you work for Disney why the mouse has only four fingers because he can t pick up a check Williams explained to New York magazine that his previous Mork Mindy merchandising was different because the image is theirs But the voice that s me I gave them myself When it happened I said You know I don t do that And they Disney apologized they said it was done by other people br Disney attempted to assuage Williams by sending him a Pablo Picasso painting worth more than million but this move failed to repair the damaged relationship as the painting was a self portrait of Picasso as the artist Vincent van Gogh and apparently really clashed with the Williams s wilder home decor Williams refused to sign for the direct to video sequel The Return of Jafar and he was replaced by Dan Castellaneta as the Genie s voice actor When Jeffrey Katzenberg was replaced by Joe Roth as chairman at Walt Disney Studios Roth organized a public apology to Williams In turn Williams would reprise the role in the second sequel Aladdin and the King of Thieves in br br br Music br br Aladdin was the third after The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast and the final Disney film that Alan Menken and Howard Ashman had collaborated on with Tim Rice as lyricist after Ashman had died in March Although fourteen songs were written for Aladdin only seven are featured in the film three by Ashman and four by Rice Menken Ashman and Rice were praised for creating a soundtrack that is consistently good rivaling the best of Disney s other animated musicals from the s br The Special Edition soundtrack released in included four songs in early animation tests and a music video of one Proud of Your Boy performed by Clay Aiken which also appears on the album Disneymania The pop duo version of the song A Whole New World performed by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle which plays over the end credits is as of the only Disney song to win a Grammy Award for Song of the Year br br br Themes br br The filmmakers thought that the moral message of the original tale was inappropriate and decided to put a spin on it by making the fulfillment of wishes seem like a great solution but eventually becoming a problem Another major theme was avoiding an attempt to be what the person is not both Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble pretending to be different people and Prince Ali s persona fails to impress Jasmine who falls for Aladdin only when she finds out who he truly is Being imprisoned is also presented a fate that occurs to most of the characters Aladdin and Jasmine are limited by their lifestyles while the Genie is attached to his lamp and Jafar to the Sultan and is represented visually by the prison like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine eventually frees Jasmine is also depicted as a different type of Disney Princess being rebellious against the royal life and the social structure br br br Release br br br Box office br A large promotion campaign preceded Aladdin s debut in theaters with the film s trailer attached to most Disney VHS releases

Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating universal acclaim Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare A grade on a scale of A to F br Most critics praised Robin Williams s performance as the Genie with Janet Maslin of The New York Times declaring that children needn t know precisely what Mr Williams is evoking to understand how funny he is br Warner Bros Cartoons director Chuck Jones called the film the funniest feature ever made br James Berardinelli gave it stars out of praising the crisp visuals and wonderful song and dance numbers br Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said that the comedy made the film accessible to both children and adults a vision shared with Desson Howe of The Washington Post who also said that kids are still going to be entranced by the magic and adventure br Brian Lowry of Variety praised the cast of characters describing the expressive magic carpet as its most remarkable accomplishment and considered that Aladdin overcomes most story flaws thanks to sheer technical virtuosity br Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times awarded the film stars out of and commented that Williams and animation were born for one another However he considered the music to be inferior to The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast and claimed that Aladdin and Jasmine were pale and routine He criticized what he saw as the film s use of ethnic stereotypes writing Most of the Arab characters have exaggerated facial characteristics hooked noses glowering brows thick lips but Aladdin and the princess look like white American teenagers br Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wrote a negative review describing the film as racist ridiculous and a narcissistic circus act from Robin Williams br br br Accolades br br br Controversies br One of the verses of the opening song Arabian Nights in which the speaker uses the lyric where they cut off your ear if they don t like your face to describe his homeland was altered to where it s flat and immense and the heat is intense following complaints from the American Arab Anti Discrimination Committee ADC The revision first appeared on the video release The original lyric was intact on the initial CD soundtrack release but the rereleases use the edited lyric The Broadway adaptation also uses the edited line The subsequent line however It s barbaric but hey it s home was left intact br The film has also been subject to criticism for its use of Orientalist stereotypes that depict Arab societies as exotic and foreign The ADC has pointed out that the characters in the movie that the viewer is supposed to identify and sympathize with are generally presented with more white features while the villains are presented with more Arab features Other people have pointed out that the movie is quite inaccurate in its depictions of Arab societies The main palace is inspired by Mughal architecture but many of the clothes are Turkish in origin and the outside environment is closer to that of the Arabian Desert br Entertainment Weekly ranked Aladdin in a list of the most controversial films in history due to this incident The number has been described in reviews as simultaneously glamorizing and barbarizing the Arab world The ADC also complained about the portrayal of the lead characters Aladdin and Jasmine They accused the filmmakers of anglicizeing their features and giving them Anglo American accents in contrast to the other characters in the film which have foreign accents grotesque facial features and appear villainous or greedy In October in response to the criticism and in acknowledgment of racial stereotypes in the wake of the George Floyd protests Disney added a disclaimer to many of their features including Aladdin on Disney acknowledging the content as racist br Concerns were raised to another scene When Aladdin is threatened by the tiger Rajah on the palace balcony Aladdin quietly says a line that some people reported as hearing as Good teenagers take off your clothes which they considered a subliminal reference to promiscuity However according to the commentary track on the DVD while Musker and Clements did admit that Scott Weinger ad libbed during the scene they claimed that we did not record that we would not record that and said that the line was Good tiger take off and go and that the word tiger is overlapped by Rajah s snarl After the word tiger a second voice can be heard that has been suggested was accidentally grafted onto the soundtrack Later editions of the movie edit the line to avoid further speculation br Animation enthusiasts have noticed similarities between Aladdin and Richard Williams s unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler also known as The Princess and the Cobbler under Allied Filmmakers and Arabian Knight under Miramax Films These similarities include a similar plot similar characters scenes and background designs and the antagonist Zig Zag s resemblance to character design and mannerisms to the Genie and Jafar Although Aladdin was released first The Thief and the Cobbler initially began production in the s and was mired in difficulties including financial problems copyright issues story revisions and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work The late release coupled with Miramax purchasing and re editing the film has sometimes resulted in The Thief and the Cobbler being labeled a rip off of Aladdin br br br Legacy br Alongside its role in the Disney Renaissance Aladdin is often credited as the catalyst in the rise of casting film stars as voice actors in Hollywood animated films with the success of Robin Williams s Genie performance Entertainment writer Scott Meslow wrote that compared with the character of Aladdin Williams s Genie is the character audiences responded to and more importantly to Disney its most marketable character by far which he concluded led to the celebrification of later animated films such as Shark Tale and Puss in Boots br br br Sequels and spin offs br Before the theatrical release of Aladdin Disney commissioned Tad Stones and Alan Zaslove to produce an animated series of Aladdin following the recently developed one of The Little Mermaid Stones liked the character of Iago and wanted him in the cast so he came up with an idea for a followup story that would free him from Jafar to join Aladdin Stones suggested turning it into a wholesale direct to video sequel as opposed to an hourlong television special and The Return of Jafar was released in June The film saw the debut of a new character Abis Mal voiced by Jason Alexander and all of the original cast returned except for Robin Williams replaced by Dan Castellaneta and Douglas Seale replaced by Val Bettin br The plot focuses mainly on Jafar seeking revenge on Aladdin However this time with Iago on Aladdin s side Abis Mal becomes Jafar s new henchman Aside from a preview on The Disney Channel in early the Aladdin TV series followed in September on the syndicated The Disney Afternoon block The episodes focused on Aladdin s adventures after the events of the second film In the final sequel to Aladdin Aladdin and the King of Thieves was released on video The story concludes as Aladdin and Jasmine are about to be married and Aladdin discovers that his father is still alive but is the king of all thieves in Agrabah br The Aladdin characters made a crossover with Hercules The Animated Series and were featured as guests in the television series House of Mouse and related works to those series Jafar was the leader of the villains in Mickey s House of Villains br The film also inspired a Disney On Ice presentation and two attractions in Disney s theme parks The Magic Carpets of Aladdin a Dumbo the Flying Elephant like ride at both Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World Resort Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Resort Paris and Tokyo DisneySea at Tokyo DisneySea and the show Disney s Aladdin A Musical Spectacular at Disney s California Adventure Park br br br Video games br With the film s
