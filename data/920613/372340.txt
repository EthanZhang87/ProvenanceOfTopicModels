the commentary box at the conclusion of Fox s broadcast schedule for the NASCAR season in June br br br Early years br br Waltrip was born on February in Owensboro Kentucky Starting his driving career in Go karts at age Waltrip entered his first stock car race just four years later Waltrip and his father built a Chevrolet coupe and headed to a local dirt track near their Owensboro home The first night out was far from a success as the youngster barely old enough to drive on the street slammed the wall and heavily damaged the coupe Waltrip soon left the dirt and found his niche on asphalt where the smoothness he learned in the karts proved a valuable asset Waltrip was a graduate of Daviess County High School in Owensboro br He was an early racer at the Kentucky Motor Speedway an asphalt track in Whitesville and Ellis Raceway a dirt track on US Highway west in Daviess County Ellis Raceway is now closed driving a car called Big built by Harry Pedley owner of Pedley s Garage on West Second Street in Owensboro and sponsored by R C Bratcher Radiator and Welding Co His success gained the attention of Nashville owner driver P B Crowell who urged Waltrip to move to the area to race at the Fairgrounds Speedway at the Tennessee State Fairgrounds in Nashville where he would win two track championships in and br Waltrip drove the No P B Crowell owned Ford sponsored by American Home in Nashville where he aggressively promoted the week s race when he appeared on a local television program promoting the speedway s races and was not afraid to embrace the local media when other competitors were reluctant to do so Some of the notorious on air trash talking included making fun of some of the other local drivers such as Coo Coo Marlin whose son Sterling later raced at the circuit and is a two time Daytona winner and James Flookie Buford whose nickname he would mock on air It pleased track management that he was helping sell tickets leading to packed grandstands and extra paychecks from track operators for his promotional skills br He became friends with WSM radio host Ralph Emery in his early years forming a bond which would be influential throughout his career as Waltrip would appear frequently on Emery s early morning television show on local Nashville television station WSMV and later substitute for Emery in the s on Emery s television show Nashville Now on the former TNN cable network now the Paramount Network Waltrip would use the success he enjoyed at the Music City Motorplex and his notoriety and public speaking skills that he acquired from television appearances in Nashville as a springboard into NASCAR s big leagues br He became a Christian in but states it was years later before God came first in his life One of the charities he supports is the Motor Racing Outreach MRO providing spiritual support to racers and their families br br br NASCAR career br br br Early years in NASCAR br Waltrip started in NASCAR Winston Cup Series Winston Cup NASCAR s top racing series at age years months days on May at the Winston at Talladega Alabama the series fastest and longest track at miles kilometers driving a Mercury Cyclone he purchased from Holman Moody originally the Ford Fairlane driven by Mario Andretti to victory in the Daytona Waltrip finished th in his first Winston Cup race after retiring on lap due to engine failure Waltrip paid for the car a spare engine and some spare parts and drove it in cup series events until mid The car was converted from the Ford Fairlane Andretti drove to a Mercury Cyclone as driven by Waltrip and later converted to a Mercury Cyclone The car was sponsored by Terminal Transport of Owensboro Kentucky Waltrip s first major sponsor Waltrip still owns the car today as part of a collection of cars he has raced and is one of his favorites br The early years found Waltrip competing against legendary stock car racers such as Richard Petty David Pearson Cale Yarborough and Bobby Allison among others Waltrip soon earned the respect of his more experienced peers He was given the No as a number but Waltrip preferred car No because his hero David Pearson had success with the number in earlier years As an owner driver Waltrip ran races in races in races in with top five finishes and races as an owner driver in with his first Winston Cup victory coming at his home track May at age years months days in the Music City outpacing the field by two laps at the track where he had won track championships in Nashville Tennessee in the No Terminal Transport Chevrolet a car Waltrip owned br During the season Waltrip drove Winston Cup races for Bud Moore Engineering br br br DiGard years br br Except for five races in driving for Bud Moore Engineering Waltrip primarily drove his own cars from the beginning of his NASCAR career until the middle of the NASCAR Winston Cup Series Winston Cup season when he was signed to a multi year contract and replaced driver Donnie Allison to drive the No DiGard Chevrolet Waltrip s long awaited jump into the big leagues of United States stock car auto racing The DiGard racing team was founded in part by Mike DiProspero and Bill Gardner who were brothers in law with the legendary Robert Yates as engine builder br br Waltrip s first race with DiGard came on August at the Talladega Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega Alabama finishing nd after experiencing engine failure Waltrip would compete in ten more races in the season for DiGard sponsored by Terminal Transport and get his second career Winston Cup victory October in the Capital City in Richmond Virginia He would post three top five and four top ten finishes in the races he ran for DiGard in br During the late s Waltrip would begin his domination of NASCAR s short track venues especially at the Bristol International Speedway Bristol Tennessee Martinsville Speedway Martinsville Virginia and the Music City Motorplex Nashville He holds the track record at Bristol International Speedway for wins with victories and for pole positions at Martinsville Speedway with pole position awards br In Gatorade became Waltrip s primary sponsor as he started his first full race season at age driving the DiGard Gatorade Chevrolet Waltrip won only one Winston Cup race in the Virginia at Martinsville Speedway in Ridgeway Virginia but in and working with legendary NASCAR crew chief Buddy Parrott he won six times each year including his first of four career victories at the Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega AL on May and his first of a five career victories in the series longest race a grueling mile race the Coca Cola formerly the World May Waltrip and Parrott would win NASCAR races together from through br In perhaps the most famous and most well known NASCAR race the Daytona held February a race that Richard Petty won Waltrip was a pre race favorite to win the race As the first NASCAR race covered flag to flag on national television Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison while battling for the lead on the last lap came together and crashed hard taking each other out in the third turn While the Allison and Yarborough cars were spinning and coming to rest in the grassy infield attention turned quickly to the new leaders Richard Petty running third and Waltrip running closely behind in fourth as a fist fight ensued between Yarborough Donnie Allison and his brother and racer Bobby Allison in the turn three grass Earlier in the race Waltrip s DiGard Gatorade Oldsmobile dropped a cylinder and while able to hang onto the slipstream of the Petty car on the final lap was not able to draft past the Petty car in the fourth turn on the final lap due to the reduction in horsepower Still Waltrip finished runner up in perhaps the most famous race in NASCAR history and was an early turning point in Waltrip s career br The Daytona would be an early season precursor for the remaining nine months of the racing season Waltrip and Petty would engage in a bitter battle race after race for the NASCAR championship In that season Waltrip won seven Winston Cup races and was a serious contender for what would have been his first championship despite numerous engine failures mechanical problems and differences with DiGard management On September after winning pole position and leading laps at the Old Dominion at Martinsville Virginia Waltrip again experienced engine failure The DiGard team pitted the car and made a rare mid race engine change in a record minutes Waltrip lost laps in the pits but was able to finish th as Petty finished nd br At the start of the final race of the season the Los Angeles Times at Ontario Motor Speedway Ontario California Waltrip led Richard Petty by a scant points in the year long championship battle after finishing the race th ahead of Petty s th place finish in the previous race the Dixie Atlanta Motor Speedway November However Petty won an unprecedented seventh and his final NASCAR Cup Series championship by finishing the final race of the season in th position as Waltrip finished th The final margin of Petty s championship victory over Waltrip was only points the third closest points race in NASCAR Cup Series history br Waltrip closed out the s driving the No DiGard Chevrolet sponsored by Gatorade ranked NASCAR s No driver having won Winston Cup races in just race starts His aggressive driving style and outspoken demeanor earned him the nickname Jaws a reference to the film about a killer shark The nickname was given to Waltrip by rival Cale Yarborough in an interview after Waltrip crashed Yarborough and D K Ulrich out of the Southern Ulrich assumed that Yarborough had caused the wreck and questioned him after the race to which Yarborough famously responded That Jaws ran into you Waltrip himself preferred the nicknames D W or D Dubya but he acknowledged Yarborough by displaying an inflatable toy shark in his pit at the next race br br At the height of his NASCAR Cup Series success in the early s fans often booed Waltrip in large part because of his success on the track defeating more established drivers with large fan followings but also because of his open criticism of NASCAR his admitting to condoning cheating and his aggressive take no prisoners win at all costs approach to driving Doing him no favors was his widely publicized falling out with DiGard leadership where he publicly admitted that he would not have won a championship as long as he drove for them He attempted several times to be released from his driving contract with DiGard in a year in which Waltrip won five Winston Cup races Still Waltrip had a huge and devoted fan following It was often said by race commentators and sports columnists that you either hate him or love him br It was Waltrip s rival Cale Yarborough driver for legendary owner Junior Johnson that privately told Waltrip that he intended to cut back on his racing appearances and leave Junior Johnson Associates team at the end of the season opening the position for Waltrip but only if Waltrip could successfully negotiate an early termination of his contract with DiGard Waltrip successfully negotiated his exit from DiGard and would take over the No for br br br Junior Johnson years br br Waltrip s success driving the Junior Johnson prepared cars came immediately and even surpassed the highly successful years he had with DiGard In his first two years as driver for the Mountain Dew sponsored Buick Regal Waltrip won races each year and his first two NASCAR Winston Cup Series Winston Cup championships in and Waltrip s success and driving prowess helped to bring the Buick Grand National into prominence The company later honored the Waltrip years with throwback paint schemes once in and again in br It was during the early s with Junior Johnson that Waltrip first worked with Jeff Hammond a pit crewman for Johnson Hammond was at first skeptical of Waltrip s driving style since it differed so much from the former driver for whom he worked Cale Yarborough Yarborough made adjustments to his driving based on the handling of the car in a particular race whereas Waltrip wanted the car adjusted around his driving style Hammond eventually came to appreciate Waltrip s finesse and smooth driving style which proved highly successful Waltrip and Hammond would benefit from each other s knowledge and abilities and would work together for most of their careers in the sport Waltrip and Hammond work together even today as broadcaster and analyst at Fox Sports and Speed TV br Waltrip s first season with Junior Johnson was a huge success He won races including big races such as the Rebel the Food City and the Riverside event He almost swept Talladega for his season by nearly winning the Talladega On the final lap rookie Ron Bouchard dove under Waltrip and Terry Labonte to take the lead Bouchard beat Waltrip by a foot in a wide drag race in what has been called the biggest upset in NASCAR history Waltrip reportedly said Where the hell did he come from in an interview Waltrip also stated in a post race conference that part of the reason he lost the race was because he thought Bouchard was a lap down and therefore did not block Bouchard br He ended with poles wins top fives and top tens Not only did Waltrip win races he also won the Winston Cup championship over nemesis Bobby Allison rallying from a nearly point deficit in midsummer and taking the points lead for keeps with a second place finish at Dover in September Waltrip then strung together four consecutive victories and ran well in the final two races of the season to win by points br In Waltrip again won races and basically repeated his season He claimed his second championship in a row that year again scratching and clawing his way past Bobby Allison with a late season charge taking the lead at Martinsville in October and winning the title by points br At the Daytona on February Waltrip a pre race favorite to win the race drove the Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS Pepsi Challenger He was involved in an accident when his car spun on lap at exit of turn at nearly mph km h as he was making an evasive maneuver to avoid rear ending a much slower car ahead of him Waltrip locked his brakes but the car slid for several hundred feet then struck an earthen embankment near the entrance to pit road The force of the impact was so violent that Waltrip s car was thrown back onto the track in front of oncoming traffic Waltrip then made hard contact with the outside concrete retaining wall once again into oncoming traffic Cale Yarborough the eventual winner of the race barely avoided hitting the demolished Pepsi Challenger Waltrip suffered a concussion and was taken by ambulance to the Halifax Medical Center for observation and medical treatment The crash was a wake up call and a life changing event for Waltrip When he heard drivers and fans joking that the crash would knock him conscious or finally shut him up he realized for the first time how unpopular he was and resolved to clean up his image The years following that crash would see a different Darrell Waltrip one who worked hard to repair and rebuild his relationship with fans and fellow drivers Years later Waltrip would be voted by NASCAR fans Most Popular Driver two years in a row br br Waltrip would continue his unprecedented success driving for Junior Johnson through the season winning his third and final Winston Cup championship in winning the inaugural All Star race The Winston in and compiling total wins with the team br Waltrip was quick to recognize the new and rapid expansion of the sport s popularity among teens and young adults and others never before considered NASCAR fans The growth was primarily due to increasing national network and cable subscription television which televised almost every NASCAR event live and the growing interest of new family oriented sponsors never before associated with motorsports NASCAR was becoming a multi regional sport enjoyed by men women and children alike In addition to the huge influx of money from new sponsors and television the more astute NASCAR team owners immediately embraced new resources such as computers telemetry research and development multi car teams for information sharing wind tunnel testing and engineering Waltrip now one of two drivers for Johnson was quick to envision the future of NASCAR and sought to take advantage of the coming changes something his car owner Junior Johnson a pioneer of the sport was somewhat reluctant to embrace Johnson and his team had enjoyed success for decades and won numerous races and championships spanning decades using his own formulas for success br Well aware of Junior Johnson s long standing steadfast rule of never discussing an adjustment to a driver s contractual salary and never really comfortable with the allocation of resources that Johnson s two car team required Waltrip approached Johnson about an increase in his contract salary Although the story as told by Waltrip is most likely folklore Waltrip drove his final race for Junior Johnson on November in a Chevrolet sponsored by Budweiser finishing th at that year s Winston Western at Riverside International Raceway completing one of the most successful owner driver partnerships in all of motorsports history Waltrip and Johnson remained close friends and respected each other as pioneers and champions of the sport br br br Hendrick Motorsports years br br Waltrip s partnership with car owner Junior Johnson led to huge success with three NASCAR Winston Cup Series Winston Cup championships and Winston Cup wins The connection between fast cars and alcohol consumption became a concern for him He began to seek other opportunities after a conversation with his friend and pastor Cortez Cooper Johnson had signed Budweiser to be his team s primary sponsor in which unintentionally made Waltrip one of the faces of the connection he was so concerned about br Years before Waltrip had opened a Honda dealership in his home town of Franklin Tennessee with the help of his friend Rick Hendrick owner of Hendrick Motorsports During the season Waltrip and Hendrick discussed the possibility of Waltrip joining the Hendrick organization which fielded cars for Geoff Bodine and Tim Richmond and the two discussed the potential of Waltrip moving to a new team Waltrip was still under contract with Johnson for the season but following the year he was able to break the contract in a unique way As he recounted in an interview for the Fox Sports Net series Beyond the Glory in Waltrip gained his release by purposely breaking one of Johnson s cardinal rules asking for a raise Johnson forbade his drivers from discussing money matters including raises with him After signing Hendrick formed a third team for Waltrip carrying the No and sponsored by Tide br In his first year with Hendrick Motorsports Waltrip had limited success compared to his previous years with Johnson He won only one race at the Goody s and had six Top finishes In he won two races including his fourth Coca Cola win br In the first race of the Daytona Waltrip won the race for the first time in his th attempt with a fuel conservation strategy along with his long time crew chief Jeff Hammond making his final pit stop for fuel a distant laps miles from the finish Most of the other cars could run no more than or laps on a tank of fuel so that meant Waltrip would need to feather the throttle and draft off other cars in order to save enough fuel to make it to the finish without an additional pit stop Hammond interviewed by television pit reporters during the final laps of the race said that his strategy was for Waltrip to draft off anybody and everybody to save fuel Even though Waltrip s car ran much slower than other cars in the last laps he was able to avoid making the additional pit stop for fuel that the other cars had to make The strategy provided Waltrip with the track position needed to win the race His post race interview with CBS pit reporter Mike Joy became famous with Waltrip shouting I won the Daytona I won the Daytona Wait this is the Daytona ain t it Thank God accompanied by the Ickey Shuffle dance in Victory Lane Later after the Daytona win Waltrip visited president George H W Bush at the white House in Washington D C br Waltrip s popularity as a driver would come full circle on the evening of The Winston an all star racing event held May an event that did not award points toward the NASCAR national championship at Charlotte Motor Speedway With two laps to go Waltrip was leading the race and poised to win when Rusty Wallace hit his car exiting the th turn sending him into the infield and costing him the victory and the purse Not only was Waltrip and his crew upset at being knocked out of the victory the fans watching the race issued boos to Wallace the winner The two crews scuffled in the pits and harsh words were said after the race Waltrip was quoted after the race as saying I hope he chokes on it referring to the that Wallace collected for the victory Waltrip s car was clearly superior to that of Wallace and had it not been for the contact initiated by Wallace on the final lap Waltrip would have won the all star event During the and seasons Waltrip was voted NASCAR s Most Popular Driver by fans br Waltrip would win six races in his best year with Hendrick Motorsports and helped develop NASCAR s version of the new Chevrolet Lumina in and delivered its first victory by winning a historic and unprecedented fifth Coca Cola that May Besides establishing a race record for victories the win prepared him for a chance to win the one remaining major race which had eluded him since his first race at the Heinz Southern at Darlington A Darlington victory would award him a one million dollar bonus for winning three of the sport s four majors in the same season the Daytona the Winston Coca Cola and the Mountain Dew Southern The pressure of both the million dollar bonus and Career Grand Slam adversely affected Waltrip He made contact with the wall early in the Southern and was never a contender for winning the race and the million dollar bonus br For many reasons Waltrip was unable to carry his success of the previous year into Waltrip failed to visit victory lane all season although he finished nd in a controversial finish in the season s th race the First Union at North Wilkesboro Speedway Brett Bodine had led laps in the middle of the race and then re took the lead on lap after short pitting on a round of green flag pit stops When the caution came out on lap the pace car mistakenly picked up Dale Earnhardt as the race leader putting Brett almost a full lap in front of the entire field During the ensuing confusion of a lap caution flag NASCAR did not have electronic scoring at the time Bodine was able to make a pit stop for fresh tires without losing any positions When NASCAR reset the lineup with Bodine as the leader he led the final laps of the race a race high laps overall to take the victory br We messed up said Chip Williams NASCAR s public relations director By throwing the caution on the second place car it kept Bodine in the lead He slipped into the pits and came out without losing the lead because the pace car was keeping the second place car back We messed up by picking up the wrong car It was a judgment call Waltrip filed a protest post race only to be denied on the grounds that judgment calls were not subject to protest appeal was the first year since that Waltrip did not win a race and Waltrip still remains irked to this very day over the result Waltrip only visited victory lane five more times and never won again after br While practicing for his th career NASCAR start in the Pepsi at Daytona Waltrip s car spun in oil laid down by another car experiencing engine failure and was hit by an oncoming car driven by Dave Marcis Waltrip suffered a broken arm a broken leg and a concussion He missed the Pepsi but came back to run one lap at Pocono before giving way to Jimmy Horton as a relief driver A driver who starts and completes one lap is credited the NASCAR points regardless of who is driving the car at the finish Despite missing the next five races due to his injuries Waltrip finished th in driver points and the team finished th in owner points with substitute drivers taking turns in the car br br br Owner driver years mid br br After his fourth season as a driver for Hendrick Motorsports Waltrip formed his own team to field cars in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series Winston Cup season Driving his own cars had been his passion since he successfully drove his own cars in his early NASCAR career in the early and mid s He would continue his relationship with Chevrolet and drive a Chevrolet Lumina with Western Auto as the primary team sponsor Waltrip purchased team assets including the racing facilities from his former owner Rick Hendrick in Charlotte North Carolina and hired long time friend and crew chief Jeff Hammond to oversee the building of race cars and to continue as crew chief Waltrip and Hammond enjoyed much success together as Hammond had been with Waltrip during the championship winning years with Junior Johnson and most of the Hendrick Motorsports years and was Waltrip s crew chief for his Daytona win and of his Coca Cola wins br In the season Waltrip visited victory lane twice his first win in his second stint as owner driver coming in only the th race of the season on April in the First Union at North Wilkesboro Speedway in North Wilkesboro North Carolina His second win of the year came in the th race of the season on June in the Champion Spark Plug at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond Pennsylvania br Just two races after celebrating his second win of Waltrip would again be involved in another serious crash again at the Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach Florida It came after completing the th of laps on the mile superspeedway Waltrip and driver Alan Kulwicki were racing side by side leading a large grouping of cars battling for th position The car drafting Alan Kulwicki bumped the Kulwicki car causing his car to hit Waltrip s Western Auto Chevrolet at speeds approaching mph on the long backstretch Waltrip s car slowed and was collected by driver Joe Ruttman s car both cars sliding sideways several hundred feet on the grassy infield The tires of Waltrip s car clipped the edge of an access road causing it to become airborne and tumbling end over end several times before coming to a stop upside down in a grassy area near turn Waltrip was extricated and only suffered minor injuries but many feared that he could have re injured his shattered leg from the crash at the same track the previous year Slow motion video and still photography showed that Waltrip s left arm was outside the car as the car tumbled and came to rest Waltrip still had a plate in his left leg from the compound fractures he suffered in the earlier crash at the Pepsi at the Daytona International Speedway Waltrip commented on January SPEED Television broadcast of the Daytona NASCAR winter testing that he had spent more time in the hospital from injuries suffered at the Daytona Speedway than at any other track he had raced Waltrip would compete in the following race the summer race at the Pocono Raceway in Long Pond Pennsylvania but was crashed again when driver Ernie Irvan spun driver Hut Stricklin in front of almost the entire field Waltrip won the year s spring race at the track just weeks before br Waltrip finished the first year of his second stint as owner driver th in the overall Winston Cup points championship after being as high as rd place after races His first year was generally viewed as a successful first year outing However Waltrip was now years old had children and had many pressures as owner driver that he did not concern himself with driving for multimillion dollar highly financed race teams such as Hendrick Motorsports br In Waltrip collected three more wins including the Mountain Dew Southern a race held at Darlington Raceway in Darlington South Carolina United States September the last major race which had eluded his year career and finished th in points after being as high as th after races That would be Waltrip s th and final NASCAR career victory tying him with Bobby Allison for what was then third on the all time list behind Richard Petty with wins and David Pearson with wins Both he and Allison have since been passed by Jeff Gordon who has wins by the time he retired at the end of the season br In Waltrip signed former Richard Childress Racing engine builder Lou LaRosa to build engines and Barry Dodson a former championship winning crew chief He posted four top ten finishes but did not finish higher than third saw him make his final appearance in the top ten in championship points by finishing th He had a then unprecedented streak over two seasons of races without a DNF all with in house engines His only engine failure in the season was after the car crossed the finish line Waltrip finished th in points in when he crashed at The Winston and was forced to let relief drivers take over for several weeks His second half of the season was highlighted by his final career pole position at the NAPA br br In Waltrip posted two top ten finishes Western Auto remained the sponsor as part of Waltrip s th anniversary celebration While the year was one of Waltrip s most profitable his results continued to fall off br br At the UAW GM Quality Waltrip failed to qualify for the first time in over years as Terry Labonte also failed to make the race Because Labonte was a more recent Cup champion in fact he was the defending Cup champion that season he was able to take the past champion s provisional Waltrip who was th in owner points was too low in the owner points position to make the race only the top four in owner points of cars not in the field excluding the most recent former champion not in the field were added after qualifying under rules After the season Waltrip and his team were struggling to find sponsors but were able to put together a last minute deal with the Ohio based company Speedblock for Speedblock only paid portions of what was promised and the deal was canceled Waltrip s team at this point was nearly insolvent and he sold the team to Tim Beverly Waltrip s final race as an owner driver was at the TranSouth Financial and was originally post drive a sponsorless car but instead decided to drive a Tim Flock Special as the former time Grand National Series champion was fighting liver and throat cancer and was without medical insurance and Waltrip wanted to help raise money for Flock and his family by having a trust fund with NASCAR s th Anniversary Flock died at age just nine days after the race In Waltrip admitted the reason that he failed as a driver owner team was because he thought like a driver not as an owner br br br mid season with Dale Earnhardt Inc br br Beverly chose not to race the team immediately instead choosing to rebuild the team now part of Dale Earnhardt Inc after two sales and a merger During this time Waltrip signed with Dale Earnhardt Inc to drive the No Pennzoil Chevy filling in for injured rookie Steve Park During his tenure with DEI Waltrip posted a fifth place finish at the California and led in the final stages of the Pocono and finished sixth br br br Final years of racing br br At the Brickyard Beverly returned Waltrip s former team as the No Chevrolet Monte Carlo with Tabasco sponsorship with Waltrip driving A sponsorship conflict with Tabasco would switch the team to the Pontiac Grand Prix Waltrip resigned at the end of the season citing performance issues After a brief flirtation with retirement Waltrip signed to drive the No Big K Ford Taurus for Haas Carter Motorsports with teammate Jimmy Spencer Waltrip failed to qualify seven times during that season with a new qualifying rule for the Past Champion s Provisional On August Waltrip announced during the practice session for the Brickyard that he would retire from NASCAR at the end of the season following a farewell tour br During his retirement year of Waltrip s best run came at the Brickyard where he qualified on the outside pole and finished eleventh His final race came on November in the NAPA at Atlanta Motor Speedway where he posted a th place finish in the Haas Carter Motorsports owned No Route Big K Ford Taurus He finished th in points that season and failed to qualify six times br br br Craftsman Truck Series br br In Waltrip built a Craftsman Truck Series team and found success by when Rich Bickle finished second in overall season standings winning three races and made Waltrip one of the few car owners to have won races in NASCAR s three national series When Sears ceased sponsorship of the team in Waltrip suspended his truck team not returning until when he re entered the series as an owner and part of Toyota NASCAR development program br br br Broadcast career br Prior to retiring from racing Waltrip provided commentary on several IROC broadcasts for ABC Also from to on weekends that Winston Cup was not competing had provided commentary on many NASCAR Busch Series one level below Winston Cup races broadcasts on TNN teaming with Mike Joy In after his final season as a NASCAR driver Waltrip signed with Fox to be lead NASCAR Winston Cup Series Winston Cup analyst and race commentator on the network s NASCAR telecasts teaming with Mike Joy and Larry McReynolds br br br Inaugural broadcasts and safety advocate br Waltrip began his career with Fox at the Daytona His younger brother Michael Waltrip won the race but Michael s victory was overshadowed by the death of Dale Earnhardt On the final scheduled lap Earnhardt s car made contact with Sterling Marlin as the black No drifted low on the track probably attempting a blocking maneuver so that either Michael Waltrip or Dale Earnhardt Jr driving for Dale Sr s DEI although he himself drove for RCR would win the race After contacting the Marlin car Earnhardt s car suddenly veered right and slammed hard head on into the retaining wall in turn four Earnhardt s car came to rest in the infield as Michael Waltrip won the race with Darrell Waltrip shouting for joy as he called the final run to the checkered flag His joy at his brother s victory soon gave way to concern for Earnhardt as he watched replays of the crash br Waltrip and Earnhardt had been bitter rivals on the track in the s but as the years passed the rivalry and bitterness had given way to a deep respect and close friendship After the race Waltrip was taken from the Fox Broadcast booth to the Halifax Medical Center to meet with the Earnhardt family and his brother Michael Waltrip later gave the invocation at the Earnhardt funeral and gave the invocation at the following week s race praying for Earnhardt and the promise of moving on from the tragedy br At the following week s race Waltrip interviewed NASCAR President Mike Helton for a pre race segment during the broadcast This was before NASCAR mandated the use of the HANS device to reduce the risk of catastrophic head and neck injuries and the SAFER Steel and Foam Energy Reduction barriers used at all NASCAR tracks today Waltrip believed that four deaths in the previous ten months all caused by basilar skull fractures incurred in accidents were too many and was not shy about asking Helton for an explanation Helton s responses irritated Waltrip who was noted by one magazine for acting a lot more like the next Mike Wallace of Minutes than the next John Madden Waltrip delivered the pre race invocation for the race in honor of Earnhardt br As a long time advocate for motorsports safety Waltrip then pushed for mandatory head and neck restraints and two weeks later demonstrated the device during the broadcast at Atlanta Motor Speedway explaining the benefits and how the device worked Seven months later NASCAR mandated the devices after a crash during an ARCA Re Max Series race held after qualifying for the UAW GM Quality killed driver Blaise Alexander br br br Broadcast style br As the cars take the green flag to start each race Waltrip shouts Boogity boogity boogity let s go racing boys and girls This somewhat nonsensical phrase has become Waltrip s trademark in recent years The phrase boogity boogity boogity also appears in the doo wop parody Who Put the Bomp in the Bomp Bomp Bomp by Barry Mann Humble Pie used the shorter phrase boogity boogity in their song Red Light Mama Red Hot Ray Stevens used the phrase throughout his hit The Streak Jerry Reed also said this phrase in the movie Smokey and the Bandit Waltrip was featured on a home video from Ray Stevens entitled the Amazing Rolling Revue In this home video Waltrip played the part of the out of control driver of the tour bus rolling venue Waltrip explained that the catchphrase arose because as a driver he grew tired of hearing his spotter or crew chief say green green green at the start of every race and wanted to hear something more original The catchphrase had always been preceded by fellow analyst and former crew chief Larry McReynolds telling Waltrip to reach up there and pull those belts tight one more time until recent years when McReynolds used the phrase less and less and eventually phased it out altogether br In Waltrip stated that his favorite race to have broadcast thus far was the Aaron s The race lead was exchanged many times among many different drivers rather than the lead being dominated by a single driver The race ended with driver Kevin Harvick beating driver Jamie McMurray for the win by only the length of a bumper br Waltrip also lends his unique verbiage to his commentary speaking of coop petetion when racers work together but keep each other under a watchful eye s perince when talking about driving skills of a veteran driver and using the chrome horn when a driver somewhat purposefully bumps a car that s in the way bumpers on cars used to be made of metal and coated in chrome In early Waltrip was nominated for an Emmy in the category
