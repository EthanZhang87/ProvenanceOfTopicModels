to go to the wild too to learn how to roar like his father but Samson disapproves of the idea br When the zoo closes all the animals are free to roam Samson and his friends Benny the squirrel Bridget the giraffe whom Benny has a crush on Larry the dim witted anaconda and Nigel the unlucky but popular koala compete in a turtle curling championship Ryan and his own friends accidentally cause a stampede which heads to the game and endangers the animals br Samson and Ryan have a falling out and Ryan runs off before Samson can apologize He later sneaks into a green Intermodal container which is rumored to be heading to the wild Just as he regrets his decision Ryan suddenly gets locked inside the container which is then being loaded onto a freight truck eventually shipping him away in the process br With the help of a pigeon Hamir Samson and his friends go after Ryan hiding in a garbage disposal truck but Benny falls overboard After passing through Times Square and nearly being crushed in the truck the group encounters a pack of rabid dogs and instead of standing his ground Samson escapes through the sewer rather than fighting as his friends expect for him to do There they take directions to the docks from two friendly streetwise sewer alligator brothers Stan and Carmine br The next morning they steal a tugboat during a hectic escape from the harbor After reuniting with Benny who has followed them with a flock of geese Samson manages to drive the boat with Larry s help and the geese lead them to the right direction toward Ryan s ship br A few days later the boat runs aground in Africa where all the animals in the area are being evacuated by the carriers as a nearby volcano is about to erupt They witness Ryan run into the jungle but Samson is unable to find him After failing to eat a rock hyrax named Colin his friends question if he has ever been in the wild before to which he forlornly confirms The rest of the group heads back to the ship but Samson continues to search for his son While walking he sees plants and rocks changing colors which he attributes as his instincts working br Nigel is abducted by a herd of wildebeest who reside in the volcano and their leader Kazar pronounces him The Great Him based on an omen he received when he was young about to be devoured by lions a toy koala fell from a plane and scared the lions away saving his life This experience made Kazar believe that The Great Him will help him and his kind create a change in the food chain that will allow prey to become predators and vice versa In order to do that he thinks the wildebeest have to eat a lion Bridget and Larry are also captured and planned to be eaten as well br Ryan hides up in an old tree but a gang of vultures attacks him under Kazar s orders The branch breaks and traps his paw Samson hears Ryan s cries and runs to save him scaring off the vultures The two reunite but are interrupted by the wildebeest Ryan is shocked when Samson tells him to run They retreat to a tree where Samson reveals the truth about his past he was actually born in a circus and was unable to roar just like Ryan Because of this Samson s callous father stated that he would ve roared better if he was born in the wild and allowed him to be sent to the zoo where he lied about his origins to avoid embarrassment The wildebeest discover them and push the tree over the cliff with Samson still hanging on Ryan is captured and taken to the volcano br After a run in with a group of female German dung beetles Benny finds Samson and gives him the confidence to be himself even if he is not from the wild They soon find out that Samson s instincts were actually two chameleons named Cloak and Camo who have been leading Samson to the volcano so he would help them defeat Kazar s army Samson uses the chameleons camouflage abilities to sneak into the volcano but when his disguise blows off due to the intense heat of the mountain Kazar orders his army to attack Seeing Samson in danger Ryan climbs onto a catapulting device and launches himself at Kazar finally letting out a roar With Kazar distracted Samson easily overpowers him Ryan tells Samson that he is happy to have him as a father The other wildebeest are touched by this and refuse to serve Kazar any further having grown fed up with his delusions Samson then gains the courage and roars powerfully enough to push back a charging Kazar The group and the wildebeest flee leaving Kazar to die in the erupting volcano br Everyone manages to escape on the boat and travel back to the Central Park Zoo in

Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews and an average rating of The site s critical consensus reads With a rehashed plot and unimpressive animation there s nothing wild about The Wild On Metacritic the film has a score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote that The CGI characters seem less like artwork than humans wearing animal suits but despite the overall ugliness and sitcom timing this has enough action violence and invention to keep kids amused Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three stars out of four He praised the film s animation but acknowledged the film s realism ventured towards the uncanny valley He remarked that the framing of some of the characters is too close they hog the foreground and obscure the background And the fur hair and feathers on the creatures look so detailed thanks to the wonders of CGI that once again we re wandering toward the Uncanny Valley br Marc Savlov reviewing for The Austin Chronicle wrote The animation is top notch and the film sports some of the most realistic and colorful fur feathers and hair this side of Fashion Week in Milan However The Wild feels as though much of its backstory along with most of the good jokes have been cut out along the circuitous path to your neighborhood cineplex resulting in a finished film that will probably delight the under set while leaving everyone else marveling at how bored they are Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film two stars out of four writing Though dull there are three reasons one might want to see the film The computer animators ability to realistically represent animal fur is nothing short of dazzling So detailed are the lion s mane and squirrel s tail that younger viewers could mistake it for a petting zoo br br br Comparisons to Madagascar br Critics considered The Wild to be heavily derivative of the DreamWorks film Madagascar Claudia Puig reviewing for USA Today suggested that The Wild was the most wildly derivative animated movie in ages It borrows its theme from Finding Nemo and Cats Dogs copies elements of The Jungle Book The Lion King and All Dogs Go To Heaven and has a shockingly similar plot to Madagascar Similarly Justin Chang of Variety felt Samson s rescue mission directly channels the father son Sturm und Drang of both The Lion King and Finding Nemo though absent the former s powerhouse dramatics or the latter s eye popping visual splendor In summary he wrote that Uninspired character animation and obnoxious banter aside The Wild is ultimately done in by the persistent stench of been there seen that br Similarities include its setting in New York s Central Park Zoo similar animals as characters and the primary plot of introducing zoo animals to the wild The name of the film and the tag line Start spreading the newspaper a play on the opening line from the Theme from New York New York were both used as integral plot points in Madagascar br A few critics defended The Wild as the superior film Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote The Wild is better mostly because it has some truly spectacular animation and because the cast is just as likable even in some cases preferable Mike Sage of the Peterborough This Week wrote don t be mistaking this for a Madagascar rip off when it was that sloppy DreamWorks turd that only managed to make it to theaters first because of corporate espionage Without addressing which film was the original concept Tim Cogshell of Boxoffice Magazine simply wrote for the adult who may very well have to experience this film and who may have experienced Madagascar The Wild is better The animation is better the jokes intended for your children are better the jokes intended for you and not your children are much better the songs are better and it s more fun br br br Accolades br br Jen Rudin and Corbin Bronson won the Artios Award for Best Animated Voice Over Feature Casting The film was nominated for the Stinkers Bad Movie Award
