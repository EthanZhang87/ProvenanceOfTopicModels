a prisoner of war camp The farm is run by the cruel Mrs Tweedy and her submissive husband Mr Tweedy who kill and eat any chicken that is no longer able to lay eggs Led by the rebellious Ginger the chickens constantly devise new ways to try to escape but are always caught Mr Tweedy suspects the chickens are organised and plotting resistance but his wife dismisses his theories while being frustrated with making minuscule profits br One night Ginger witnesses an American rooster named Rocky Rhodes glide over the coop s fences and crash land the chickens put his sprained wing in a cast and hide him from the Tweedys who have been promised a handsome reward by Rocky s owner for his return Inspired by Rocky s apparent flying abilities Ginger begs him to help teach her and the other chickens to fly so they can escape threatening to alert the humans if he refuses Rocky reluctantly gives them training lessons One evening a load of equipment is delivered to the farm containing the parts for a chicken pie machine that Mrs Tweedy has ordered as part of a plan to convert the farm into a profitable pie making factory When the Tweedys increase the chickens food rations and ignore the decline in egg production Ginger deduces that the couple s new plan is to fatten the chickens for slaughter After Ginger and Rocky get into an argument Rocky holds a morale boosting dance party during which it is revealed that his wing is healed Ginger insists that he demonstrate flying the next day but Mr Tweedy finishes assembling the machine and puts Ginger in it for a test run Rocky saves her and sabotages the machine buying them time to warn the chickens and plan an escape from the farm br The next day Ginger finds Rocky has left leaving behind part of a poster that shows that he is in fact part of a chicken cannonball act with no ability to fly on his own making them realize that their chance to learn how to fly has been crushed In the midst of being devastated Ginger is inspired by elderly rooster Fowler s stories of his time in the Royal Air Force to build an aircraft to flee the farm The chickens assemble parts for the plane as Mr Tweedy fixes the pie making machine Meanwhile Rocky comes across a billboard advertising Mrs Tweedy s chicken pies and returns to the farm out of guilt br Mrs Tweedy orders Mr Tweedy to gather all the chickens for the machine but the chickens subdue him and finish the plane which Ginger persuades Fowler to pilot As the plane approaches the take off ramp Mr Tweedy is able to knock over the ramp before being knocked out Ginger races to reset the ramp but a now alerted Mrs Tweedy attacks her Before Mrs Tweedy can hurt Ginger Rocky returns and subdues her before holding up the ramp with Ginger allowing the plane to take flight Rocky and Ginger grab on to the runway lights which have been snagged by the departing plane An axe wielding Mrs Tweedy follows them by climbing up the lights but Ginger tricks Mrs Tweedy into cutting the line sending her falling into the pie machine causing it to explode in a mushroom cloud of gravy br The chickens celebrate their victory after defeating the Tweedys while Ginger and Rocky kiss each other and they fly to an island bird sanctuary where they make their home Sometime later the chickens have settled into their new home and Rocky and Ginger have started a romantic relationship Nick and Fetcher two rats that have been helping the chickens throughout the escape decide to set up their own egg farm but they fall into a circular debate over whether they must use a
