Willys pronounced Willis br was a brand name used by Willys Overland Motors an American automobile company founded by John North Willys It was best known for its design and production of World War II era military jeeps MBs Willys M and M A military jeeps as well as civilian versions Jeep CJs and branding the jeep military slang word into the Universal Jeep marque br br In John Willys bought the Overland Automotive Division of Standard Wheel Company and in renamed it Willys Overland Motor Company From to Willys was the second largest producer of automobiles in the United States after Ford Motor Company br In Willys acquired a license to build Charles Yale Knight s sleeve valve engine which it used in cars bearing the Willys Knight nameplate In the mid s Willys also acquired the F B Stearns Company of Cleveland and assumed continued production of the Stearns Knight luxury car as well br John Willys acquired the Electric Auto Lite Company in and in formed the Willys Corporation to act as his holding company In it acquired the Russell Motor Car Company of Toronto Ontario and the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company in Buffalo New York by New Process Gear and in acquired the Duesenberg Motors Company plant in Elizabeth New Jersey The New Jersey plant was replaced by a new larger facility in Indianapolis and was to be the site of production for a new Willys Six at an adjacent site but the depression of brought the Willys Corporation to its knees The bankers hired Walter P Chrysler to sort out the mess and the first model to go was the Willys Six deemed an engineering disaster Chrysler had three auto engineers Owen Skelton Carl Breer and Fred Zeder later nicknamed The Three Musketeers begin work on a new car commonly referred to as the Chrysler Six br To raise cash needed to pay off debts many of the Willys Corporation assets were put on the auction block The Elizabeth plant and the Chrysler Six prototype were sold to William C Durant then in the process of building a new third empire The plant built Durant s low priced Star while the Chrysler Six prototype was substantially reworked to become the Flint br Walter Chrysler and the three engineers who had been working on the Chrysler Six all moved on to Maxwell Chalmers where they continued their work ultimately launching the Chrysler Six in January In the Maxwell car company became the Chrysler Corporation br br In Willys Overland introduced a new line of small cars named Willys Overland Whippet In the economic depression of the s a number of Willys automotive brands faltered Stearns Knight was liquidated in Whippet production ended in its models were replaced by the Willys Six and Eight Production of the Willys Knight ended in There was also a pickup truck version of the Whippet called the Willys Six C reflecting its wheelbase in inches This was not a sales success with a mere units being built This vehicle was picked up by International Harvester who installed their own cubic inch engine and offered it in as the International D br In Ward M Canaday who beginning in had done advertising for the company before becoming a full time employee had taken on the role of chairman He helped guide the company through its current receivership br At this time Willys decided to clear the boards and produce two new models the cylinder Willys and the cylinder Willys but since the firm was once again on the verge of bankruptcy only the went into production It was forced to sell its Canadian subsidiary itself in weak financial shape and started a massive reorganization Only the main assembly plant and some smaller factories remained the property of Willys Overland The other assets were sold off to a new holding company that leased some of the properties back to W O The parent company was thus able to ride out the storm br In the Willys Overland Motor Company was reorganized as Willys Overland Motors br In Willys redesigned the cylinder model It gained a semistreamlined body with a slanted windshield headlamps integrally embedded into the fenders and a one piece rounded hood transversely hinged at the rear br For the Model featured Lockheed hydraulic brakes a two inch increase in wheelbase to inches and an improved DID four cylinder engine with power increased from to hp The Model was marketed as an Overland and as a Willys Overland rather than as a Willys br In the company built a factory that built vehicles located at what is now Randolph Street Commerce California During World War II the factory built aircraft assemblies for Lockheed Hudson bombers When the war ended the factory resumed automobile production and was one of two locations to build the first CJ A as well as the Willys Aero The factory was closed in The location is now occupied by Prologis Eaves Distribution Center br br Willys Overland was one of two bidders when the United States Army sought an automaker that could begin rapid production of a lightweight reconnaissance car based on a design by American Bantam br In Joseph W Frazer had joined Willys from Chrysler as chief executive He saw a need to improve the firm s cylinder engine to handle the abuse to which the vehicle would be subjected This objective was brilliantly achieved by ex Studebaker chief engineer Delmar Barney Roos who wanted br br an engine that could develop horsepower at r p m and run for hours without failure What he started with was an engine that developed horsepower at r p m and could run continuously for only two to four hours It took Barney Roos two years to perfect his engine by a whole complex of revisions that included closer tolerances tougher alloys aluminum pistons and a flywheel reduced in weight from fifty seven to thirty one pounds br Production of the Willys MB better known as Jeep began in shared between Willys Ford and American Bantam units were produced that year and units before the end of World War II Willys Overland ranked th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts In total military Jeeps were manufactured br The origin of the name Jeep has been debated for many years Some people believe jeep is a phonetic pronunciation of the abbreviation GP from General Purpose that was used as part of the official Army nomenclature The first documented use of the word Jeep was the name of the character Eugene the Jeep in the Popeye comic strip known for his supernatural abilities e g walking through walls It was also the name of a small tractor supplied to the U S Army by Minneapolis Moline in Whatever the source the name stuck and on February Willys Overland filed a trademark application on the use of the term Jeep with the U S Patent Office After several denials by the patent office and appeals by Willys Overland the trademark Jeep was finally awarded to the company on June br Willys also built airframes for the JB Loon br br After the war Willys did not resume production of its passenger car models choosing instead to concentrate on Jeeps and Jeep based vehicles The first postwar Willys product was the CJ A an MB stripped of obviously military features particularly the blackout lighting and with the addition of a tailgate br Willys initially struggled to find a market for the vehicle first attempting to sell it primarily as an alternative to the farm tractor Tractors were in short supply having been out of production during the war However sales of the Agri Jeep never took off mainly because it was too light to provide adequate draft br The CJ A was among the first civilian vehicles of any kind to be equipped with four wheel drive from the factory and it gained popularity among farmers ranchers hunters and others who needed a lightweight vehicle for use on unimproved roads and trails br br In a year after the introduction of the CJ A Willys produced the Willys Jeep Utility Wagon based on the same engine and transmission with clear styling influence from the CJ A Jeep The next year came a Jeep Utility Truck with four wheel drive In the wagon was available in four wheel drive making it the ancestor of all sport utility vehicles br Willys planned to re enter the passenger car market in with the Willys sedan Its name came from the fact it was powered by a cylinder engine that produced hp The was touted as the first stock car in America that offered independent suspension on all four wheels but it never entered production br In under a contract from the U S Army Willys produced a small one man four wheeled utility vehicle called the Jungle Burden Carrier which evolved into the M Utility ton vehicle br Willys later produced the M Jeep for the U S Army and continued the CJ series of civilian Jeeps One variation was the Jeepster which came with a cylinder or cylinder engine but only with two wheel drive to the rear br br In Willys re entered the car market with a new compact car the Willys Aero At first available only as a two door sedan it was available with either an L head or F head six cylinder engine Export markets could get the Aero with a four cylinder engine A four door sedan and a two door hardtop were added for along with taxi models The Aero cars were called Lark Wing Falcon Ace or Eagle depending on year engine and trim level except for a small production run in its final year with models called Custom and Bermuda The bodies for the Willys Aero were supplied by the Murray Body Corporation which also made the bodies for the short lived Hudson Jet Also in CJ B Jeeps went into production By over were sold br In Kaiser Motors purchased Willys Overland and changed the company s name to Willys Motor Company The same year production of the Kaiser car was moved from Willow Run Michigan to the Willys plant at Toledo Ohio Although Jeep production was steady sales of the Willys and Kaiser cars continued to fall br br Willys Overland established its Brazilian operations in just before the Kaiser Frazer takeover The tooling for the Aero went to Brazil where it entered production in In Brazil s Executive Group for the Automotive Industry GEIA had approved Willys Overland for production of the Aero the Willys MB Jeep a truck version of the Jeep called the Rural and the French Renault Dauphine small car Also an abortive plan was made to create a company called Chrysler Willys do Brasil SA to build the Plymouth Savoy and a Dodge truck there in the hope of taking advantage of Willys Brazilian made credentials Willys went through considerable effort to appear as a Brazilian company even selling a large portion of their company to Brazilian stockholders to forestall a possible nationalist backlash and to become eligible for various government incentives br The little tail engined Dauphine was a result of Kaiser s Renault connection and was produced by Willys do Brasil from until Willys Overland was one of the first companies to enter the Brazilian passenger automobile market and their early entry originally paid off with sales spiking in when Willys became the number one selling car Being distributed by the family of Get lio Vargas closest advisor Osvaldo Aranha also helped and Willys Overland reached a share of Brazilian passenger car production in Willys held a market share of around in Brazil from until its last full year as an independent mostly Brazilian owned company br Willys entered the Brazilian market in the hope of offsetting their shrinking market and losses at home However unlike in the case of the Argentinian Kaiser operations which were essentially developed around hand me downs Willys built a very modern plant from the ground up in Brazil The original promise was to build cars for export back to the United States but such a situation never materialized However by late Brazilian built Willys Jeeps began to be exported to Chile Willys expanded into Brazil s impoverished northeast in the early s when they built an assembly plant for the Jeep in the state of Pernambuco br In Willys started building the French Alpine A as the Willys Interlagos It was produced until and was the first Brazilian made sports car It was also the car in which many Brazilian racers cut their teeth including greats such as Emerson Fittipaldi Willys also designed and showed a larger sports car called the Capeta Devil in powered by the litre six cylinder Aero engine In Willys Overland do Brasil and Renault began collaborating on a new front wheel drive car called Project M and meant to replace the aging Dauphine Developed in parallel with the Renault which it antedated the car eventually saw light as the Ford Corcel Early Corcels had Willys stamping in the glass and the Corcel line which continued in production until as the Ford Pampa always showed its French origins in its characteristic three bolt wheels In Ford took a controlling interest in Kaiser and thereby gained control of Willys Overland do Brasil br The Aero based Itamaraty continued in production until the early s in latter years wearing Ford badges Dauphine production ended in but the Willys Rural Pickup and its derivatives were built as the Ford F until The only visual difference is that the post cars have a tailgate with Ford rather than Jeep stamped in it The military version of the Jeep Pickup was called the F br In America the company had already changed its name in to Kaiser Jeep Corporation the Willys name disappeared thereafter br br Kaiser Jeep was sold to American Motors Corporation AMC in when Kaiser Industries decided to leave the automobile business After the sale AMC used engines it had developed for its other cars in Jeep models to improve performance and standardize production and servicing br Renault purchased a major stake in AMC in and took over operation of the company producing the CJ series until Chrysler purchased AMC in after the CJ had already been replaced with the Jeep Wrangler also known as the YJ and later TJ The Jeep marque owned by DaimlerChrysler and later Fiat S p A and Stellantis produces Jeep vehicles at a new Toledo Complex br DaimlerChrysler introduced the Overland name for a trim package on the Jeep Grand Cherokee The badging is a recreation of the Overland nameplate from the early twentieth century br In the Willys trademark was acquired by Italian Carrozzeria Viotti declaration of Emanuele Bomboi head of design of Viotti Carrozzeria Viotti together with Fabbrica Italiana Maggiora introduced at the Bologna Motor Show the Willys AW Berlineta a concept car inspired by the original Willys Interlagos assembled by Willys in Brazil under license of the French Alpine Viotti and Maggiora plans to produce the vehicle in limited edition and relaunch the Willys marque br Stellantis reintroduced the Willys name as a trimline for the Jeep Gladiator pickup truck in the early s br br The coup s and pickups were very popular gassers The best known would be the Willys Only were sold in in in including a new panel delivery and the company s final year making it a puzzle why it became popular it was neither cheap nor plentiful br After the company revived the coup s sedans and pickups were again popular with hot rodders and gasser teams and again comparatively low production leaves unexplained why they gained so much attention Ollie Olsen s Wil A Meaner coup driven by Bob
