Geri s Game is a American animated short film produced by Pixar and written and directed by Jan Pinkava The film which shows an elderly man named Geri who competes with himself in a game of chess was Pixar s first film to feature a human being as its main character Geri later made a cameo appearance in Toy Story as The Cleaner here voiced by Jonathan Harris instead of Bob Peterson br Geri s Game was released eight years after Knick Knack the last short by Pixar to that point made as part of an effort to reignite the studio s short film series which had been put on standby in order to focus on the creation of television commercials as well as the studio s first feature film which would become the first ever full length computer animated film Toy Story A dedicated research and development team worked alongside the filmmakers to devise ways to get around the burdens of animating a human character leading to an in house computer simulation to mimic the natural movement of clothing on a character Subdivision surface modeling a technique partly pioneered by Edwin Catmull in but mostly ignored in favor of NURBS surfaces was used to bestow natural movement and realistic skin textures on Geri br Geri s Game premiered on November winning an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film the following year It was later shown with the theatrical release of Pixar s second feature film A Bug s Life the following year and became part of a Pixar tradition of pairing shorts with feature films br br br Plot br In an empty park Geri blows the leaves off a table and sets up a chessboard He proceeds to play a chess game against himself playing the parts of both participants by moving to opposite sides of the board and either removing or replacing his glasses The player without the glasses and playing as Black is aggressive and confident while the player with the glasses who plays White is timid and makes several mistakes The camera work eventually makes it look like two people are actually playing the game showing black Geri s hand and white Geri s body in the same frame Black captures all of White s pieces except the king at which point White fakes a heart attack and falls to the ground startling Black who starts to take his own pulse White surreptitiously turns the board around so the player without the glasses has the white pieces and the bare king and the player with the glasses has the black pieces and has lost no material He gets up and reveals to the player without glasses that he is alright and takes his turn The player without glasses confused and upset knocks down his king and concedes defeat and gives the player with the glasses the prize his false teeth The camera zooms out to remind the audience that only one person was playing the game the entire time br br br Development br Geri s Game was Pixar s first original short film since when Knick Knack was released It was directed and written by Jan Pinkava who joined the studio in to work on their TV commercials while the other directors and writers were preoccupied with the production of Toy Story and had been continuously approaching executive producer Darla K Anderson with the proposal that the studio make a new short film br br br Initial conception br Work on the short began shortly after the release of Toy Story and during early production of A Bug s Life when Ed Catmull decided that the studio should resurrect its short films production as a way to bring new animators and storytellers into Pixar and as a way to further push research and development for the studio For the first of these shorts which would be the first one made in years Catmull wanted Pixar to create a story which featured a human as its central protagonist Upon Anderson s suggestion he reached out to Pinkava to direct the short According to Pinkava himself Catmull said he could direct the short as long as it starred a human character and had a serviceable story behind it br When trying to brainstorm a concept Pinkava asked himself if he would be able to come up with a story that featured only one character which would both give it an artistic edge and make development easier on the technical side of things as coming up with just a single stylized but credible human character was hard enough He designed an elderly character belonging to the polar opposite age sector of Billy the infant character in Tin Toy and one of Pixar s earliest attempts at creating a human character He felt it would be interesting to animate a character with the body language of an old man similar to how Billy was animated with the gesticulations of a baby br br br Story evolution br After spending time storyboarding and brainstorming ideas Pinkava came up with three different concepts starring an elderly male character one of these concepts was about him playfully riding up and down an elevator while another one involved him playing a game of chess against himself The latter idea was inspired by Pinkava and his elderly relatives love of chess particularly his grandfather an avid chess player who would often play rounds of the game with only himself br Pinkava pitched an early animatic version of the chess story and was turned down and given a second chance to restart and further develop the story After giving a second pitch with a more structured plot the project was green lit and Karen Dufilho was issued to produce the project br Pinkava who grew up in Czechoslovakia was inspired by the works of Czech filmmaker and storywriter Ji Trnka particularly his stop motion puppet films Trnka s characters usually human ones were marionette puppets that had vastly stylized body and facial features which Pinkava similarly applied somewhat to Geri s character design with facial attributes such as his nose and chin Pinkava did several maquettes of different designs for Geri before settling on his final appearance which he then sculpted into a D clay model that was baked by Jerome Ranft and digitally scanned into Pixar s animation software Ranft initially was the clay sculptor for the character working on his head and hands but after receiving continuous suggestions on how to tweak the model he reportedly handed the sculpting utensil to Pinkava simply telling him You do it while smiling br br br Technology br Geri s voice vocal intonations came from Pixar writer Bob Peterson Peterson wanted Pixar to be able to create a short that could technologically push the studio to new heights specifically he wanted Pixar to create a short film featuring a character that could display both convincing looking skin and realistic cloth animation The first Pixar short film with a human main character Geri s Game was produced with the goal of taking human and cloth animation to new heights To achieve the goal of producing a believable D human character two people were brought on to do research for the project Michael Kass who did the calculations behind the physics for a dynamic cloth system and Tony DeRose who made use of subdivision surfaces a technique invented by Catmull in conjunction with Silicon Graphics founder Jim Clark which allowed for more lifelike skin surfaces br Previously most D character surfaces were crafted using several non uniform rational B splines NURBS that had to be stitched together which made for less expressive movement and caused models to frequently tear The use of subdivision surfacing which renders a character s skin as one large surface allowed for smoother object movement as well as more intricate detail DeRose had been working on the technology at the University of Washington and had already brought subdivision surfaces to CAD makers who were ultimately unconvinced and held their faith in NURBS before bringing it to Pixar which was much more receptive br On the clothing side after toiling endlessly by candlelight Kass managed to create a system which could emulate simulate the movement of cloth at which point the team realized that the suit jacket they had modeled didn not fit with Geri s movement outside of a default T pose According to Pinkava Steve Jobs upon a hearing about the issue had offered to help him by enlisting tailor Giorgio Armani to help them design an outfit for Geri which he ultimately declined The development of a dynamic cloth simulator made several changes to the way that animators work for instance the animation when completed needed to be sent to the simulator which would automatically insert Geri s jacket and calculate its movements rather than being directly sourced to the renderer after being finished Geri also needed to be animated frames in advance in order to get the simulation going and animators could not cheat by having off camera body parts go unanimated as it would affect how the simulating program moved the clothing br Like other Pixar shorts Geri s Game contains no spoken dialogue and so is driven only by the actions and expressions of its main character To further push the ability to convey the film s story extra detail was put into Geri s facial rigging compared to previous rigging methods with rigger Paul Aichele giving the character hundreds of face controls for animators to use These new more detailed rigging methods went on to be used in A Bug s Life which was being worked on at the same time br br br Staff br Like previous short films made by Pixar Geri s Game was made by a temporary branch of Pixar employees and was separate from the people working on the studio s feature films It took roughly a year to produce according to Pinkava largely due to the amount of time allotted to developing the cloth simulation While the short was being made most of Pixar Studios was preoccupied with making A Bug s Life Despite this there were different animators that worked on the project including Pixar storywriter Pete Docter who contributed a few scenes out of sheer interest Despite being preoccupied directing A Bug s Life John Lasseter suggested adding a scene in which Geri checks to make sure he is alright after seeing his alter ego stage a heart attack and keel over Lasseter physically staged out the entire scene to Pinkava br br br Release br Geri s Game premiered on November at Laemmle s Monica Theater in Santa Monica California It was also attached to the theatrical release of Pixar s second feature film A Bug s Life in and subsequently featured on that film s VHS and DVD releases br br br Awards br br br br Academy Award Best Animated Short Film br Anima Mundi Animation Festival Best
