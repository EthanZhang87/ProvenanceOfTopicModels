Marin The Graveyard by the Sea The film also references Tatsuo Hori s semi autobiographical novel The Wind Has Risen and uses visuals to depict Hori s words The manga portrayed certain characters as

year of the Mitsubishi A M s maiden flight and intertwines with fictional encounters with Caproni and Nahoko Satomi The scenes with Nahoko in the manga included elements from the novel The Wind Has Risen in which Tatsuo Hori wrote about his life experience with his fianc e Ayako Yano before she died from tuberculosis The name Nahoko Satomi was created from the female protagonist of another novel by Tatsuo Hori Nahoko br Characters frequently discuss Thomas Mann s novel The Magic Mountain and in a letter to Nahoko Jiro names his fleeing German friend Mr Castorp after its protagonist The

overseas expansion He was asked to return to Japan to model for the character s appearance and a suitable voice br After the release of Ponyo Miyazaki wanted his next film to be a sequel to the film but producer Toshio Suzuki proposed to adapt the manga The Wind Has Risen instead At first Miyazaki rejected the proposal because he created the manga as a hobby and considered its subjects not suitable for children the traditional audience of Studio Ghibli s features However he changed his mind when a staff member suggested that children should be allowed to be exposed to subjects they are not familiar with He was also inspired to make the film after reading a quote from Horikoshi All I wanted to do was to make something beautiful br br The film s score was composed and conducted by Joe Hisaishi and performed by the Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra br The film also includes singer songwriter Yumi Matsutoya s song Hik ki Gumo Matsutoya had collaborated with Studio Ghibli on Kiki s

out of based on critics indicating universal acclaim br Critic David Ehrlich rated the film and called it perhaps the greatest animated film ever made He wrote While initially jarring Miyazaki s unapologetic deviations from fact help The Wind Rises to transcend the linearity of its expected structure the film eventually revealing itself to be less of a biopic than it is a devastatingly honest lament for the corruption of beauty and how invariably pathetic the human response to that loss must be Miyazaki s films are often preoccupied with absence the value of things left behind and how the ghosts of beautiful things are traced onto our memories like the shadows of objects outlined by a nuclear flash The Wind Rises looks back as only a culminating work can Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called the film visually exquisite and emotionally charged Film critic Mark Kermode called it a rich treat for the eye and soul alike br The Japan Times gave the film three and a half out of five and stated A visually sumptuous celebration of an unspoiled prewar Japan In a review for The Asia Pacific Journal Matthew Penney wrote What Miyazaki offers is a layered look at how Horikoshi s passion for flight was captured by capital and militarism and that it was one of Miyazaki s most ambitious and thought provoking visions as well as one of his most beautifully realized visual projects br br In Japan The Wind Rises received criticism from both the Japanese political right and from the Japan Society for Tobacco Control Miyazaki added to the controversy by publishing an essay in which he criticized the proposal by Japan s right wing Liberal Democratic Party to change Article of the Japanese Constitution to allow Japan to remilitarize br Miyazaki also attracted political criticism from Korean internet users who argued that the Zero represents Japanese military aggression and that many planes were assembled by Korean forced labour Miyazaki told Korean journalists that Horikoshi was someone who resisted demands from the military I wonder if he should be liable for anything just because he lived in that period In an interview with the Asahi Shimbun Miyazaki said he had very complex feelings about World War II since as a pacifist he felt militarist Japan had acted out of foolish arrogance However he also said that the Zero plane represented one of the few things we Japanese could be proud of they were a truly formidable presence and so were the pilots who flew them br br The Wind Rises received nominations and awards for Best Animated Feature including one
