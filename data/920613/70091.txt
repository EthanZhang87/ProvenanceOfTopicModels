Shoten Nippon Television Network Dentsu Buena Vista Home Entertainment Tohokushinsha Film and Mitsubishi and distributed by Toho br Miyazaki wrote the screenplay after he decided the film would be

were rejected With a budget of US million production of Spirited Away began in Pixar animator John Lasseter a fan and friend of Miyazaki convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film s North American distribution rights and served as executive producer of its English dubbed version Lasseter then hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W Ernst as producer while screenwriters Cindy and Donald Hewitt

grossing million at the worldwide box office Accordingly it became the highest grossing film in Japanese history with a total of billion million It held the record for years until it was surpassed by Demon Slayer Kimetsu no Yaiba The Movie Mugen Train in br Spirited Away was a co recipient of the Golden Bear with Bloody Sunday at the Berlin International Film Festival and became the first hand drawn Japanese anime and non English language animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the th Academy Awards The film is now regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and has been included in various best of lists including ranking fourth on BBC s Greatest Films of the st Century br br br Plot br Ten year old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home Chihiro s father decides to take a shortcut and stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park which her mother insists on exploring despite Chihiro s protests Upon finding a seemingly empty restaurant still stocked with food Chihiro s parents immediately begin to eat While exploring further Chihiro finds an enormous bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset However Chihiro discovers her parents have been transformed into pigs and she cannot cross the now flooded river br Haku finds Chihiro and instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse s boiler man Kamaji a y kai commanding the susuwatari Kamaji refuses and asks a worker named Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba the witch who runs the bathhouse and cursed her parents as well as Haku s master Yubaba tries frightening Chihiro away but eventually gives her a work contract As Chihiro signs the contract with her name Yubaba takes away the second kanji in her name renaming her Sen She soon forgets her real name and Haku later explains that Yubaba controls people by taking their names if she completely forgets hers like he once did she will never be able to leave the spirit world br Sen is frequently mocked by the other workers except for Kamaji and Lin While working she invites a silent creature named No Face inside believing him to be a customer The spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen s first customer After she cleans him he gives her a magic emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude Meanwhile No Face demands food from the bathhouse workers granting gold copied from the river spirit in exchange However when Sen declines the gold and leaves he angrily swallows some workers br Sen sees paper shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed When he crashes into Yubaba s penthouse with grievous injuries Sen follows him upstairs A shikigami that stowed away on her back shapeshifts into Yubaba s twin sister Zeniba who turns Yubaba s son Boh into a mouse and creates a false copy of him Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her that carries a deadly curse Haku strikes the shikigami causing Zeniba to vanish He falls into the boiler room with Sen where she feeds him part of the emetic dumpling causing him to vomit up the seal and a slug that Sen disgustedly kills br Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba She confronts an engorged No Face and feeds him the rest of the dumpling to regurgitate the workers No Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse and Lin helps them leave Sen No Face and Boh travel to see Zeniba with train tickets gifted by Kamaji Meanwhile Yubaba nearly orders Sen s parents slaughtering but Haku reveals Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents Yubaba complies but only if Sen can pass a final test br Sen meets with Zeniba who makes her a magic hairband and reveals that Yubaba used the slug to control Haku Using his dragon form Haku flies Sen and Boh back while No Face decides to stay with Zeniba Mid flight Sen recalls falling into the Kohaku River years earlier and being washed safely ashore correctly guessing Haku s real identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River Nigihayami Kohakunushi br When they arrive at the bathhouse Yubaba tests Sen to identify her parents among a group of pigs to leave After she answers correctly that none of the pigs are her parents her contract disappears and she is given back her real name Haku takes her to the now dry riverbed and vows to meet her again Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents Shortly before leaving for her new home Chihiro looks back at the tunnel her hairband from Zeniba still intact br br br Voice cast br br br Production br br br Development and inspiration br br During summers Hayao Miyazaki spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family The idea for Spirited Away came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki s Delivery Service but he had not created a film for ten year old girls For inspiration he read the sh jo manga magazines like Nakayoshi and Ribon that the girls had left at the cabin but felt they only offered subjects on crushes and romance Miyazaki felt this was not what these young friends held dear in their hearts and resolved to make the film about a young heroine whom they could look up to br br Miyazaki had wanted to produce a new film for years but his two previous proposals one based on the Japanese book Kiri no Muk no Fushigi na Machi by Sachiko Kashiwaba and another about a teenage heroine were rejected His third proposal which ended up becoming Spirited Away was more successful The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki s hometown He thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bath house Miyazaki was always curious about what was behind it and he made up several stories about it one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of Spirited Away br br Production of Spirited Away commenced in February on a budget of billion US million Walt Disney Pictures financed ten percent of the film s production cost for the right of first refusal for American distribution As with Princess Mononoke Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli staff experimented with computer animation With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage D the staff learned the software but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story instead of stealing the show Each character was mostly hand drawn with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length When production began Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot He had to delete many scenes from the story and tried to reduce the eye candy in the film because he wanted it to be simple Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a pretty girl At the beginning he was frustrated at how she looked dull and thought She isn t cute Isn t there something we can do As the film neared the end however he was relieved to feel she will be a charming woman br br During production Miyazaki often sought inspiration by visiting the Edo Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei Tokyo He based some of the buildings in the spirit world on the Pseudo Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic especially when I stand here alone in the evening near closing time and the sun is setting tears well up in my eyes Another major inspiration was the Notoya Ryokan a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film Miyazaki has denied this The D go Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the Spirited Away onsen bathhouse br Toshio Suzuki the producer of the film also cites European inspirations and influences in the production of Spirited Away He specifically invokes the structure of the film as European inspired due to Miyazaki s own influences by European films such as The Snow Queen and The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep br br br Music br br The film score of Spirited Away was composed and conducted by Miyazaki s regular collaborator Joe Hisaishi and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic The soundtrack received awards at the th Mainichi Film Competition Award for Best Music the Tokyo International Anime Fair Best Music Award in the Theater Movie category and the th Japan Gold Disk Award for Animation Album of the Year Later Hisaishi added lyrics to One Summer s Day and named the new version of the song The Name of Life Inochi no Namae which was performed by Ayaka Hirahara br The closing song Always With Me Itsumo Nando Demo lit Always No Matter How Many Times was written and performed by Youmi Kimura a composer and lyre player from Osaka The lyrics were written by Kimura s friend Wakako Kaku The song was intended to be used for Rin the Chimney Painter Entotsu kaki no Rin a different Miyazaki film which was never released In the special features of the Japanese DVD Hayao Miyazaki explains how the song in fact inspired him to create Spirited Away The song itself would be recognized as Gold at the rd Japan Record Awards br Besides the original soundtrack there is also an image album titled Spirited Away Image Album Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi Im ji Arubamu that contains tracks br br br English dub br John Lasseter Pixar animator and a fan and friend of Miyazaki would often sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki s work when encountering story problems After seeing Spirited Away Lasseter was ecstatic Upon hearing his reaction to the film Disney CEO Michael Eisner asked Lasseter if he would be interested in introducing Spirited Away to an American audience Lasseter obliged by agreeing to serve as the executive producer for the English adaptation Following this several others began to join the project Beauty and the Beast co director Kirk Wise and Aladdin co producer Donald W Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of Spirited Away respectively Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H Hewitt penned the English language dialogue which they wrote in order to match the characters original Japanese language lip movements br The cast of the film consists of Daveigh Chase Jason Marsden Suzanne Pleshette in her final film role before her death in January Michael Chiklis Lauren Holly Susan Egan David Ogden Stiers and John Ratzenberger a Pixar regular Advertising was limited with Spirited Away being mentioned in a small scrolling section of the film section of Disney com Disney had sidelined their official website for Spirited Away and given the film a comparatively small promotional budget Marc Hairston argues that this was a justified response to Studio Ghibli s retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters which limited Disney s ability to properly market the film br br br Themes br br br Supernaturalism br The major themes of Spirited Away heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto Buddhist folklore centre on the protagonist Chihiro and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures including kami come to bathe Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants Miyazaki says of this In my grandparents time it was believed that kami existed everywhere in trees rivers insects wells anything My generation does not believe this but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything Chihiro s archetypal entrance into another world changes her status as one somewhere between child and adult Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting The use of the word kamikakushi literally hidden by gods within the Japanese title and its associated folklore reinforces this liminal passage Kamikakushi is a verdict of social death in this world and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant social resurrection br Additional themes are expressed through No Face who reflects the characters who surround him learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes This nature results in No Face s monstrous rampage through the bathhouse After Chihiro saves No Face with the emetic dumpling he becomes timid once more At the end of the film Zeniba decides to take care of No Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse br br br Fantasy br The film has been compared to Lewis Carroll s Alice s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass as the stories are set in fantasy worlds involve disturbances in logic and stability and there are motifs such as food having metamorphic qualities though other developments and themes are not shared br Yubaba has many similarities to the Coachman from the film Pinocchio in the sense that she mutates humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of Pleasure Island were mutated into donkeys Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse Yubaba s seizure of Chihiro s true name symbolically kills the child who must then assume adulthood She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format to recover continuity with her past Chihiro must create a new identity br br br Traditional Japanese culture br Spirited Away contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues Chihiro has been seen as a representation of the sh jo whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post war Japan Just as Chihiro seeks her past identity Japan in its anxiety over the economic downturn occurring during the release of the film in sought to reconnect to past values In an interview Miyazaki has commented on this nostalgic element for an old Japan br Japanese philosophy plays a huge role in Spirited Away specifically through concepts like Kami and principles like Mottainai and On The concept of Kami for instance involves various spirits that each represent different elements and aspects of nature The principle of Mottainai which is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture embodies a sense of regret towards waste valuing the complete utilization of an object or resource While the principle of On a key tenet of Japanese ethics that signifies a sense of moral indebtedness plays a significant role in Chihiro s character development br br br Western consumerism br Similar to the Japanese concept of On the film can be partly understood as an exploration of the effect of greediness and Western consumerism on traditional Japanese culture For instance Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse wearing a Western dress and living among European d cor and furnishings in contrast with the minimalist Japanese style of her employees quarters representing the Western capitalist influence over Japan in its Meiji period and beyond Along with its function within the ostensible coming of age theme Yubaba s act of taking Chihiro s name and replacing it with Sen an alternate reading of chi the first character in Chihiro s name lit one thousand can be thought of as symbolic of capitalism s single minded concern with value br br The film s setting encapsulates Miyazaki s commentary on modern Japanese values and the erosion of cultural heritage The bathhouse situated within an abandoned theme park symbolizes Japan s distorted cultural identity This once traditional locale is marred by neon signs and Westernization exemplifying cultural degradation Early scenes highlight economic concerns and consumerism The film s visuals underscore the commercialization of Japanese culture The failed theme park serves as a metaphor for the unsuccessful fusion of ideologies The Meiji design of the park is the setting for Chihiro s parents metamorphosis the family arrives in an imported Audi car and the father wears a European styled polo shirt reassuring Chihiro that he has credit cards and cash before morphing into literal consumerist pigs because of their bad habits Miyazaki has stated Chihiro s parents turning into pigs symbolizes how some humans become greedy At the very moment Chihiro says there is something odd about this town her parents turn into pigs There were people that turned into pigs during Japan s bubble economy consumer society of the s and these people still haven t realized they ve become pigs Once someone becomes a pig they don t return to being human but instead gradually start to have the body and soul of a pig These people are the ones saying We are in a recession and don t have enough to eat This doesn t just apply to the fantasy world Perhaps this isn t a coincidence and the food is actually an analogy for a trap to catch lost humans br The bathhouse of the spirits cannot be seen as a place free of ambiguity and darkness Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human and corruption is ever present it is a place of excess and greed as depicted in the initial appearance of No Face In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro s journey and transformation is the constantly chaotic carnival in the background br br br Environmentalism br Commentators have often referred to environmental themes in the films of Miyazaki In Spirited Away two major instances of allusions to environmental issues have been noted Pam Coats for example a Vice President of Walt Disney Feature Animation describes Chihiro dealing with the stink spirit who it turns out is actually a river spirit but is so corrupted with filth that one cannot tell what it is at first glance It only becomes clean again when Chihiro pulls out a huge amount of trash including car tires garbage and a bicycle This alludes to human pollution of the environment and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go br The second allusion is seen in Haku himself Haku does not remember his name and lost his past which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse Eventually Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River which was destroyed and replaced with apartments Because of humans need for development they destroyed a part of nature causing Haku to lose his home and identity This can be compared to deforestation and desertification humans tear down nature cause imbalance in the ecosystem and demolish animals homes to satisfy their want for more space housing malls stores etc but do not think about how it can affect other living things br br br Release br br br Box office and theatrical release br Spirited Away was released theatrically in Japan on July by distributor Toho It grossed a record billion

making films that looked like this or that were as inventive as this was at this time The film has been cited as influence for various Disney and Pixar animated films Production designer Harley Jessup

Commercial and cultural significance br According to Time Spirited Away arrived at a time when animation was widely perceived as a genre solely for children and when cultural differences often became barriers to the global distribution of animated works but it shattered preconceived notions about the art form and also proved that as a film created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore central to its core it could resonate deeply with audiences around the world Denison emphasized that John Lasseter and Disney boosted Spirited Away s visibility in America by heavily campaigning for the film to be considered for the Academy Awards and cited it as one of the reasons why it won Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Writer Jonathan Clements whose published works revolve around East Asian culture anime and Japanese television dramas emphasized that the film s Oscar win was a wake up call for a lot of people in the film business who had been disregarding Japanese animation for years Susan Napier professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University called Spirited Away s wins at major Western award shows a very big shot in the arm to the Japanese animation industry She
