The Isetta is an Italian designed microcar built under license in a number of different countries including Argentina Spain Belgium France Brazil Germany and the United Kingdom Because of its egg shape and bubble like windows it became known as a bubble car a name also given to other similar vehicles br In the BMW Isetta became the world s first mass production car to achieve a fuel consumption of l km mpg imp mpg US It was the top selling single cylinder car in the world with units sold br Initially manufactured by the Italian firm Iso SpA the name Isetta is the Italian diminutive form of Iso meaning little Iso br br br Iso Isetta Italy br br The car originated with the Italian firm of Iso SpA In the early s the company was building refrigerators motor scooters and small three wheeled trucks Iso s owner Renzo Rivolta decided to build a small car for mass distribution By the engineers Ermenegildo Preti and Pierluigi Raggi had designed a small car that used the motorcycle engine of the Iso Moto and named it Isetta br The Isetta caused a sensation when it was introduced to the motoring press in Turin in November It was unlike anything seen before Small only m ft long by m ft wide and egg shaped with bubble type windows the entire front end of the car hinged outwards to allow entry In the event of an accident the driver and passenger were to exit through the canvas sunroof The steering wheel and instrument panel swung out with the single door simplifying access to the single bench seat The seat provided reasonable comfort for two occupants and perhaps a small child Behind the seat was a large parcel shelf with a spare wheel located below A heater was optional Ventilation was provided by turning out the front triangle windows and or opening the fabric sunroof br Power came from a cc cu in kW hp two stroke split single motorcycle engine The engine was started by a combination generator starter known as Dynastart A manual gearbox provided four forward speeds and reverse A chain drive connected the gearbox to a solid rear axle with a pair of closely spaced mm in rear wheels The first prototypes had one wheel at the rear but having a single rear wheel made the car prone to roll overs so the rear wheel layout was changed to two wheels set mm in apart from each other This narrow track eliminated the need for a differential The front axle was a modified version of a Dubonnet independent front suspension br The Isetta took over seconds to reach km h mph from rest Top speed was about km h mph The fuel tank held litres US gal imp gal the Isetta would get somewhere between l km mpg US mpg imp and l km mpg US mpg imp br In Iso entered several Isettas in the legendary Mille Miglia where they took the top three spots in the economy classification Over a distance of km mi the drivers achieved an average speed of over km h mph br After its initial success the Isetta was beginning to slip in popularity at home mainly due to renewed competition from Fiat with its C model br Renzo Rivolta wanted to concentrate on his new Iso Rivolta sports car and was interested in doing licensing deals Plants in Spain and Belgium were already assembling Isettas and Autocarros using Italian made Iso components BMW began talking with Rivolta in mid and bought not just a license but also the complete Isetta body tooling Rivolta also negotiated licensing deals with companies in France and Brazil br After some units production of the Italian built cars ceased in Iso continued to build the Isetta in Spain until br br br Iso Autocarro br br In addition to the Iso Isetta vettura described above Iso also built the Autocarro a commercial version with full width rear axle The Autocarro was offered in several body styles a flatbed pickup enclosed truck a tilt bed or even a fire engine although some of these might not have been sold The Autocarro was very popular in Italy and many manufacturers produced some variant of the type br Iso had previously produced a motorcycle type Isocarro The Iso Autocarro was larger than most with its four wheel layout conventional rear axle with differential and leaf springs and a large tubular ladder type frame It could carry a kg lb load The name Isetta Autocarro was also used It is thought that more than Autocarros were built between and The Autocarro was also built in Spain br br br VELAM Isetta France br br In VELAM acquired a licence from Iso to manufacture a car based on the Isetta Since Iso had sold the body making equipment to BMW VELAM developed their own body but used the original Iso engine The VELAM body was rounder and more egg like than Iso s Isetta and was known by the French as the yogurt pot Instead of a chassis like the Italian and German versions there was a sub frame bolted to the body at the rear which held the rear tires engine and transmission The front suspension was bolted to the front of the body The front door was opened by push button instead of a handle and the speedometer was mounted in the center of the steering wheel br br VELAM started production of the car in June at the old Talbot factory at Suresnes France and the car was introduced at the Paris car show All told five versions of the car were built the standard Isetta a convertible version a luxury version a one off Sport version and a record car with a roadster body The luxury model called crin jewel box was presented in and built in examples In the streamlined roadster set seven world records for the sub cc class at the Linas Montlh ry autodrome Due to competition from the Citro n CV and then the Renault Dauphine production ceased in January br br br De Carlo Isetta Argentina br br The Metalmec nica Company in Buenos Aires commenced automotive manufacturing in when they started assembling a licensed version of the BMW Isetta This received a light redesign with a tiny two piece grille being installed on the door examples were made but they soon changed over to the BMW which was built in examples from until Metalmec nica went on to built the BMW which they later redesigned to look similar to the Simca In they changed over and began building Simca Arianes under license from the French company SIMCA br br br Romi Isetta Brazil br br In Iso licensed the Isetta to Ind strias Romi S A a machine tool manufacturer headquartered in the city of Santa B rbara d Oeste in the state of S o Paulo The Isetta was chosen because it was considered an ideal vehicle for use in the cities by virtue of its size and economy Released on September it was one of the first cars produced in Brazil after Ford do Brasil and General Motors do Brasil The car had received government approval as a part of a state supported drive to establish an automotive industry in Brazil but ended up being built without government backing br Some of the Romi Isettas were manufactured from to They kept the Iso design and used Iso engines until in they switched to the BMW cc engines br br br BMW Isetta West Germany br The BMW Isetta differed widely from the Iso model While the major elements of the Italian design remained intact BMW re engineered much of the car so much so that none of the parts between a BMW Isetta Moto Coupe and an Iso Isetta are interchangeable BMW changed the powerplant to a one cylinder four stroke cc motorcycle engine of their own manufacture which generated PS kW br br The first BMW Isetta appeared in April In May three years after launching the conventionally modern looking BMW BMW ceased production of Isettas A total of units had been built br In the s the BMW Isetta had garnered a resurgence through the television show Family Matters in which one of the main characters Steve Urkel Jaleel White drives a BMW Isetta br br br BMW Isetta br While it retained the bubble window styling it differed from the Italian model in that its headlamps were fixed separately to the sides of the bodywork and it carried the BMW badge below the windscreen The car was also redesigned to take a modified version of the cc four stroke engine from the BMW R motorcycle and the front suspension was changed The single cylinder generated PS kW at rpm The crankcase and cylinder were made of cast iron the cylinder head of aluminium The head was rotated by compared with the motorcycle engine The twin bearing crankshaft was also different in the Isetta motor being larger and featuring reinforced bearings One of the reasons for this was the heavy Dynastart unit a combined dynamo and starter motor The fuel mixture was provided by a Bing sliding throttle side draft motorcycle carburetor In addition to further changes of detail the BMW engineers enlarged the sump for installation in the car and cooled the engine by means of a radial fan and shrouded ducting br The power train from the four speed gearbox to the two rear wheels was also unusual fixed to the gearbox output drive was something called a Hardy disc which was a cardan joint made of rubber On the other side of it was a cardan shaft and finally a second Hardy disc which in turn was located at the entrance to a chain case A duplex chain running in an oil bath finally led to a rigid shaft with the two rear wheels at each end Thanks to this elaborate power transfer the engine gearbox unit was free of tension in its linkage to the rear axle and well soundproofed br In West Germany the Isetta could be driven with a motorcycle license The top speed of the Isetta was rated as km h mph br The first BMW Isetta rolled off the line in April and in the next eight months some were produced br br br BMW Isetta br br In the government of the Federal Republic of Germany changed the regulations for motor vehicles Class IV licences issued from that time onward could only be used to operate small motorcycles and could no longer be used to operate motor vehicles with a capacity of less than cc At the same time tax classes were restructured with one category limit set at cc Class IV licences issued before the change in the regulations were grandfathered and allowed to be used as before br This change in regulations encouraged BMW to revise the Isetta In February a cc engine was introduced br The engineers enlarged the single cylinder to a mm in bore and mm in stroke which gave a displacement of exactly cc at the same time they raised the compression ratio from to As a result the engine power output rose to PS kW at rpm and the torque rose to N m ft lbf at rpm The maximum speed remained at km h mph yet there was a marked increase in flexibility chiefly noticeable on gradients br In October the Isetta Moto Coup DeLuxe sliding window Isetta was introduced The bubble windows were replaced by longer sliding side windows br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br BMW br br The BMW was intended as an enlarged Isetta with more power and a more conventional four wheel configuration br br The front end of the was virtually unchanged but the s wheelbase was stretched to accommodate four seats A conventional rear axle was added BMW introduced the semi trailing arm independent suspension on the This suspension would be used on almost every new model for the next four decades To deal with the increased size and weight the was fitted with the cc boxer engine from the R motorcycle Top speed was km h mph br In the two years that the model was in production s were made In its price segment it was in competition with the entry level VW Beetle In the late s consumers wanted cars that looked like cars and they had lost interest in economy models Sales of the were however aided by the energy crisis of br br br BMW Isetta United Kingdom br br In March Dunsfold Tools Ltd signed a lease on part of the former Brighton railway works on the south coast of England with the intention of beginning production of the BMW Isetta under licence in May of that year Shortly afterwards Dunsfold Tools Ltd was renamed Isetta of Great Britain and the British Isetta was officially launched at the Dorchester hotel in April The factory had no access by road therefore components were delivered by rail and finished cars were shipped out the same way br br The British cars had right hand drive with the door hinged from the right hand side of the car and the steering column moved across to the right as well Right hand drive meant that both the driver and the engine were on the same side so a kg lb counterweight was added to the left side to compensate Dunlop tyres were used and Lucas electrics replaced the German Hella and Bosch components with a different headlamp housing being used Girling brake components replaced the ATE brake parts br The Isetta was not popular in the UK until a three wheeled version was introduced Although three wheeled vehicles offer a less stable ride in the UK there was the advantage of being classed as three wheeled motorcycles which meant a lower tax class and the requirement of only a motorcycle driving licence Isetta of Great Britain also continued to produce four wheeled Isettas but only for export to Canada New Zealand and Australia br In Isetta of Great Britain stopped production of the cars Isetta engines were produced until br br br Modern successors br br br Isetta replica kits br The now defunct British firm Tri Tech under the model name Zetta sold a kit car or even an assembled complete BMW Isetta lookalike replica from modern parts including Honda CN cc single cylinder water cooled engines with automatic transmission standard or Kawasaki GPS two cylinder water cooled motorcycle engines with optional manual transmission br Some parts new or used were from donor vehicles Front suspension and steering were from the Suzuki Super Carry Bedford Rascal later Vauxhall Rascal Drum brakes and wheels were from Morris and the subsequent British Leyland Motor Corporation Mini Prices ranged from c for the kit up to c for a complete version br It could be legally registered for use under British laws Tri Tech also supplied some body parts which can be used for running non exact restorations of BMW Isettas br br br Possible BMW reintroduction br In Auto Express reported that BMW had partnered with the University of Bath in order to develop a series of three and four wheeled rear engine rear wheel drive city cars This led to speculation that the Isetta badge would be returning as a competitor to small cars such as the Toyota iQ Following this during the development of the Megacity BMW i brand rumours and reports suggested that one of the upcoming cars would be named the iSetta taking its name and inspiration from the classic BMW Isetta No such car was produced although the i brand was subsequently launched with the BMW i and BMW i br br br Durax D Face br br At the Tokyo Motor Show Gifu based company D Art revealed the Durax D Face a front entry rear engine bubble car taking inspiration from the Isetta The microcar was powered by a kW electric motor coupled with a kW petrol generator giving a range of around miles A top speed of around mph likely limited the car to city driving br br br Microlino br br At the Geneva Motor Show Swiss entrepreneur Wim Ouboter of Micro Mobility Systems revealed the Microlino a small electric microcar inspired by the Isetta After being postponed production of the vehicle commenced in with pre orders for over vehicles costing EUR each br br br Suzhou Eagle EG K br In Chinese company Suzhou Eagle revealed the Eagle EG K a low speed electric vehicle styled after the BMW Isetta and BMW Primarily aimed at young people living in large cities the car featured a kWh lead acid battery giving a top speed of around mph and a range of around miles br br br Artega Karo
