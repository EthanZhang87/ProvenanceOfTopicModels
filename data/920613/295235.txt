with hydraulics The standard perimeter type frame was abandoned replaced by a unit with rails laid out in the form of an elongated X Chevrolet claimed that the new frame offered increased torsional rigidity and allowed for a lower placement of the passenger compartment This was a transitional step between conventional perimeter frame construction and the later fully unitized body chassis the body structure was strengthened in the rocker panels and firewall This frame was not as effective in protecting the interior structure in a side impact crash as a conventional perimeter frame br br br
