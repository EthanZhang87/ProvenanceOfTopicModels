Voice cast br br Paige O Hara as Belle a bibliophilic young woman who seeks adventure and offers her own freedom to the Beast in return for her father s In an effort to enhance the character from the original story the filmmakers felt that Belle should be unaware of her own beauty and made her a little odd Wise recalls casting O Hara because of a unique tone she had a little bit of Judy Garland after whose appearance Belle was modeled James Baxter and Mark Henn served as the supervising animators for Belle br Robby Benson as the Beast a young prince who is transformed into a talking beast by an enchantress as punishment for his arrogance and selfishness The animators drew him with the head structure and horns of an American bison the arms and body of a bear the eyebrows of a gorilla the teeth and mane of a lion the tusks of a wild boar and the legs and tail of a wolf Chris Sanders one of the film s storyboard artists and visual development artists drafted the designs for the Beast and came up with designs based on birds insects and fish before coming up with something close to the final design Glen Keane supervising animator for the Beast refined the design by going to the zoo and studying the animals on which the Beast was based Benson commented There s a rage and torment in this character I ve never been asked to use before The filmmakers commented that everybody was big fee fi fo fum and gravelly while Benson had the big voice and the warm accessible side so that you could hear the prince beneath the fur br Richard White as Gaston a hunter who vies for Belle s hand in marriage He serves as a foil personality to the Beast who was originally as egotistical as Gaston prior to saving Belle from the wolves Gaston s supervising animator Andreas Deja was pressed by Jeffrey Katzenberg to make Gaston handsome in contrast to the traditional appearance of a Disney villain an assignment he found difficult at first In the beginning Gaston is depicted as more of a narcissist than a villain but later he threatens to put Maurice in a mental institution if Belle does not marry him and eventually leads all the villagers to kill the Beast enraged that Belle would love a beast more than him br Jerry Orbach as Lumi re the kind hearted but rebellious French accented ma tre d of the Beast s castle who has been transformed into a candelabra He has a habit of disobeying his master s strict rules sometimes causing tension between them but the Beast often turns to him for advice He is depicted as flirtatious as he is frequently seen with the Featherduster and immediately takes a liking to Belle A running gag throughout the film is Lumi re burning Cogsworth Nik Ranieri served as the supervising animator for Lumi re br David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth the Beast s majordomo the head butler of the household staff and Lumi re s best friend who has been turned into a mantel clock He is extremely loyal to the Beast so as to save himself and anyone else any trouble often leading to friction between himself and Lumi re Will Finn served as the supervising animator for Cogsworth Stiers also narrates the prologue br Angela Lansbury as Mrs Potts the housekeeper turned into a teapot who takes a motherly attitude toward Belle The filmmakers went through several names for Mrs Potts such as Mrs Chamomile before Ashman suggested the use of simple and concise names for the household objects David Pruiksma served as the supervising animator for Mrs Potts br Bradley Pierce as Chip Mrs Potts s son who has been transformed into a teacup Originally intended to only have one line the filmmakers were impressed with Pierce s performance and expanded the character s role significantly eschewing a mute Music Box character Pruiksma also served as the supervising animator for Chip br Rex Everhart as Maurice Belle s inventor father The villagers see him as insane for crafting devices believed impossible to construct in reality but his loyal daughter believes he will be famous one day Ruben A Aquino served as the supervising animator for Maurice br Jesse Corti as LeFou Gaston s sidekick He looks up to Gaston as his hero and sings a song with the other villagers to cheer him up His name is French for The Madman and also a phonetic play on The Fool Chris Wahl served as the supervising animator for LeFou br Jo Anne Worley as the Wardrobe the castle s authority over fashion and a former opera singer who has been turned into a wardrobe The character of Wardrobe was introduced by visual development artist Sue C Nichols to the then entirely male cast of servants and was originally a more integral character named Madame Armoire Wardrobe is known as Madame de la Grande Bouche Madame Big Mouth in the stage adaptation of the film and is the only major enchanted object character whose human form does not appear in the film Tony Anselmo served as the supervising animator for the Wardrobe br Hal Smith as Philippe Belle s horse Russ Edmonds

credits Babette is the name given to this character later in the stage adaptation of the film Fifi in the animated musical film Belle s Magical World and Plumette in the live action remake br Frank Welker as Sultan the castle s pet dog turned into a footstool br br br Production br br br Early versions br Following the widespread critical and commercial success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in Walt Disney sought out other stories to adapt into feature films with Beauty and the Beast being among the stories he considered Attempts to develop the Beauty and the Beast story into a film were made in the s and s but were ultimately given up because it proved to be a challenge for the story team Peter M Nichols states Disney may later have been discouraged by Jean Cocteau having already done his version br Decades later as Who Framed Roger Rabbit was nearing completion in the Disney studio resurrected Beauty and the Beast as a project for the satellite animation studio it had set up in London England to work on Roger Rabbit Richard Williams who had directed the animated portions of Roger Rabbit was approached to direct but declined in favor of continuing work on his long gestating project The Thief and the Cobbler In his place Williams recommended his colleague English animation director Richard Purdum and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non musical version of Beauty and the Beast set in th century France At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner Beauty and the Beast became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter This was an unusual move for an animated film which is traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in a scripted form Linda Woolverton wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began and worked with the story team to retool and develop the film br br br Script rewrite and musicalization br br Upon seeing the initial storyboard reels in Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg was dissatisfied with Purdum s idea and ordered that the film be scrapped and started over from scratch A few months after starting anew Purdum resigned as director The studio had approached John Musker and Ron Clements to direct the film but they turned down the offer saying they were tired after just having finished directing Disney s recent success The Little Mermaid Katzenberg then hired first time feature directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale Wise and Trousdale had previously directed the animated sections of Cranium Command a short film for a Disney EPCOT theme park attraction In addition wanting another musical film Katzenberg asked songwriters Howard Ashman and Alan Menken who had written the song score for The Little Mermaid to turn Beauty and the Beast into a Broadway style musical film in the same vein as Mermaid Ashman who at the time had learned he was dying of complications from AIDS had been working with Disney on a pet project of his Aladdin and only reluctantly agreed to join the struggling production team To accommodate Ashman s failing health pre production of Beauty and the Beast was moved from London to the Residence Inn in Fishkill New York close to Ashman s New York City home Here Ashman and Menken joined Wise Trousdale Hahn and Woolverton in retooling the film s script Since the original story had only two major characters the filmmakers enhanced them added new characters in the form of enchanted household items who add warmth and comedy to a gloomy story and guide the audience through the film and added a real villain in the form of Gaston br These ideas were somewhat similar to elements of the French film version of Beauty and the Beast which introduced the character of Avenant an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston as well as inanimate objects coming to life in the Beast s castle The animated objects were however given distinct personalities in the Disney version By early Katzenberg had approved the revised script and storyboarding began again The production flew story artists back and forth between California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman though the team was not told the reason why br br br Casting and recording br Disney had originally considered casting Jodi Benson from The Little Mermaid as Belle They eventually decided upon Broadway actress and singer Paige O Hara in favor of having a heroine who sounded more like a woman than a girl According to co director Kirk Wise O Hara was given the role because she had a unique quality a tone she would hit that made her special reminiscent to that of American actress and singer Judy Garland O Hara who after reading about the film in The New York Times competed for the role against hopefuls believes the fact that lyricist Howard Ashman admired her cast recording of the musical Show Boat proved integral in her being cast Laurence Fishburne Val Kilmer and Mandy Patinkin were originally considered to voice the Beast the role was eventually given to actor Robby Benson John Cleese was originally intended to voice Cogsworth but later turned it down to voice Cat R Waul in the Universal Pictures animated film An American Tail Fievel Goes West and the role was eventually given to David Ogden Stiers Julie Andrews was originally considered to voice Mrs Potts but the role was eventually given to Angela Lansbury br br br Animation br br Production of Beauty and the Beast was to be completed on a compressed timeline of two years rather than the traditional four year Disney Feature Animation production schedule this was due to the loss of production time spent developing the earlier Purdum version of the film Most of the production was done at the main Feature Animation studio housed in the Air Way facility in Glendale California A smaller team at the Disney MGM Studios theme park in Lake Buena Vista Florida assisted the California team on several scenes particularly the Be Our Guest number br Beauty and the Beast was the second film after The Rescuers Down Under produced using CAPS Computer Animation Production System a digital scanning ink paint and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar The software allowed for a wider range of colors as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the early s CAPS ink paint also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects placing characters and or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards away from the camera on the Z axis to give the illusion of depth as well as altering the focus of each layer br In addition CAPS ink paint allowed an easier combination of hand drawn art with computer generated imagery which before had to be plotted to animation paper and then xeroxed and painted traditionally This technique was put to significant use during the Beauty and the Beast waltz sequence in which Belle and Beast dance through a computer generated ballroom as the camera dollies around them in simulated D space The filmmakers had originally decided against the use of computers in favor of traditional animation but later when the technology had improved decided it could be used for the one scene in the ballroom Before that CGI environments had first been printed out as wireframe but this was the first time Disney made use of D rendering The success of the ballroom sequence helped convince studio executives to further invest in computer animation The technology hardware that was used for the CGI was SGI and the software that was used is Pixar s RenderMan br The final dance between Belle and the Prince was reused from the final dance sequence between Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip from the film Sleeping Beauty According to Trousdale this was done because production of the film was nearing the deadline and this was the easiest way to do that sequence br br br Music br br Ashman and Menken wrote the Beauty song score during the pre production process in Fishkill the opening operetta styled Belle being their first composition for the film Other songs included Be Our Guest sung in its original version to Maurice by the objects when he becomes the first visitor to eat at the castle in a decade Gaston a solo for the swaggering villain and his bumbling sidekick Human Again a song describing Belle and Beast s growing love from the objects perspective the love ballad Beauty and the Beast Tale as Old as Time and the climactic The Mob Song As story and song development came to a close full production began in Burbank while voice and song recording began in New York City The Beauty songs were mostly recorded live with the orchestra and the voice cast performing simultaneously rather than overdubbed separately in order to give the songs a cast album like energy the filmmakers and songwriters desired br During the course of production many changes were made to the structure of the film necessitating the replacement and re purposing of songs After screening a mostly animated version of the Be Our Guest sequence story artist Bruce Woodside suggested that the objects should be singing the song to Belle rather than her father Wise and Trousdale agreed and the sequence and song were retooled to replace Maurice with Belle The film s title song went through a noted bit of uncertainty during production Originally conceived as a rock oriented song it was changed to a slow romantic ballad Howard Ashman and Alan Menken asked Angela Lansbury to perform the song but she did not think her voice was suited for the melody br When she voiced her doubts Menken and Ashman asked her for at least one take and told her to perform the song as she saw fit Lansbury reportedly reduced everyone in the studio to tears with her rendition nailing the song in the one take asked of her This version went on to win the Oscar for Best Original Song Human Again was dropped from the film before animation began as its lyrics caused story problems about the timeline over which the story takes place This required Ashman and Menken to write a new song in its place Something There in which Belle and Beast sing via voiceover of their growing fondness for each other was composed late in production and inserted into the script in place of Human Again br Menken would later revise Human Again for inclusion in the Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast and another revised version of the song was added to the film itself in a new sequence created for the film s Special Edition re release in Ashman died of AIDS related complications at the age of on March eight months before the film s release He never saw the finished film though he did get to see it in its unfinished format Ashman s work on Aladdin was completed by another lyricist Tim Rice Before Ashman s death members of the film s production team visited him after the film s well received first screening with Don Hahn commenting that the film would be a great success Who d have thought it Ashman replied I would br A tribute to the lyricist was included at the end of the credits crawl To our friend Howard who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul we will be forever grateful Howard Ashman A pop version of the Beauty and the Beast theme performed by C line Dion and Peabo Bryson over the end credits was released as a commercial single from the film s soundtrack supported with a music video The Dion Bryson version of Beauty and the Beast became an international pop hit and performed considerably well on charts around the world The song became Dion s second single to land within the top of the Billboard Hot peaking at number nine The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary chart In Canada Beauty and the Beast peaked at number two Outside of North America the song peaked within the top ten in New Zealand and the United Kingdom while peaking within the top twenty in Australia Netherlands and Ireland The song sold over a million copies worldwide This version of the song was also nominated for Record of the Year Song of the Year and

Walt Disney Company an unfinished version of Beauty and the Beast was shown at the New York Film Festival on September The film was deemed a work in progress because roughly only of the animation had

offerings The film also holds a score of on Metacritic which indicates the reviews as universal acclaim Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare A grade br Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the film with the following statement Two years ago Walt Disney Pictures reinvented the animated feature not only with an eye toward pleasing children but also with an older savvier audience in mind Disney truly bridged a generation gap with The Little Mermaid Now lightning has definitely struck twice with Beauty and the Beast Awarding the film a perfect score of four stars Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times compared Beauty and the Beast positively to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio writing Beauty and the Beast reaches back to an older and healthier Hollywood tradition in which the best writers musicians and filmmakers are gathered for a project on the assumption that a family audience deserves great entertainment too In Ebert again gave the IMAX re release a full out of stars br James Berardinelli of ReelViews rated the film similarly while hailing it as the finest animated movie ever made writing Beauty and the Beast attains a nearly perfect mix of romance music invention and animation The use of computer animation particularly in the ballroom sequence was singled out in several reviews as one of the film s highlights Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review calling the film A delightfully satisfying modern fable a near masterpiece that draws on the sublime traditions of the past while remaining completely in sync with the sensibility of its time Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a positive review saying It is a surprise in a time of sequels and retreads that the new film is so fresh and altogether triumphant in its own right Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying Beauty and the Beast is certainly adequate holiday entertainment for children and their more indulgent parents But the film has little of the technical facility vivid characterization and emotional impact of Disney past br Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film four out of five stars saying It s not an especially scary movie but right from the start you can tell that this Beauty and the Beast has a beauty of a bite John Hartl of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four saying It s exceptionally difficult to make an audience care for animated characters unless they re mermaids or anthropomorphized animals or insects yet the Disney animators with a big assist from the vocal talents of a superb cast have pulled it off Gene Siskel also of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars saying Beauty and the Beast is one of the year s most entertaining films for both adults and children On their Beauty and the Beast edition of Siskel Ebert both Siskel and Roger Ebert proclaimed that the film is a legitimate contender for Oscar consideration as Best Picture of the Year Michael Sragow of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review saying It s got storytelling vigor and clarity bright eclectic animation and a frisky musical wit Eric Smoodin writes in his book Animating Culture that the studio was trying to make up for earlier gender stereotypes with this film Smoodin also states that in the way it has been viewed as bringing together traditional fairy tales and feminism as well as computer and traditional animation the film s greatness could be proved in terms of technology narrative or even politics Animation legend Chuck Jones praised the film in a guest appearance on Later with Bob Costas he claimed he Loved it I think it should have won Best Picture I think the animation on the beast is one of the greatest pieces of animation I ve seen br Animation historian Michael Barrier wrote that Belle becomes a sort of intellectual less by actually reading books it seems than by hanging out with them but says that the film comes closer than other Disney studio films to accepting challenges of the kind that the finest Walt Disney features met David Whitley writes in The Idea of Nature in Disney Animation that Belle is different from earlier Disney heroines in that she is mostly free from the burdens of domestic housework although her role is somewhat undefined in the same way that contemporary culture now requires most adolescent girls to contribute little in the way of domestic work before they leave home and have to take on the fraught multiple responsibilities of the working mother Whitley also notes other themes and modern influences such as the film s critical view of Gaston s chauvinism and attitude towards nature the cyborg like servants and the father s role as an inventor rather than a merchant br Beauty and the Beast has been named one of Disney s most critically acclaimed films Leah Pickett of Consequence described it as arguably the most critically lauded animated film of the th century In IGN named Beauty and the Beast as the greatest animated film of all time directly ahead of WALL E The Incredibles Toy Story and The Iron Giant br Most critics regard the animated film as superior to the live action remake Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune stated that the film worked wonderfully because it was pure Broadway written for the screen blending comedy and romance and magic and just enough snark in the margins while the remake got lost in translation since The movie takes our knowledge and our interest in the material for granted It zips from one number to another throwing a ton of frenetically edited eye candy at the screen charmlessly Phillips also wrote of the film that too often we re watching highly qualified performers plus a few less conspicuously talented ones stuck doing karaoke or motion capture work of middling quality Dana Schwartz of the Observer criticized some of the film changes to characters such as the Beast and Gaston as regressive by watering down their distinguishing personalities from the film further arguing that the added backstory to the characters in the version failed to advance the plot or theme in any meaningful way David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that the film feels particularly egregious in part because it s so slavishly devoted to the original every time it falls short of its predecessor which is quite often it s hard not to notice br br br Accolades br Alan Menken and Howard Ashman s song Beauty and the Beast won the Academy Award for Best Original Song while Menken s score won the award for Best Original Score Two other Menken and Ashman songs from the film Belle and Be Our Guest were also nominated for Best Original Song Beauty and the Beast was the first picture to receive three Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song a feat that would be repeated by The Lion King Dreamgirls and Enchanted Academy rules have since been changed to limit each film to two nominations in this category due to the consecutive unintentional failures of Dreamgirls and Enchanted to win the award br The film was also nominated for Best Picture and Best Sound It was the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture and remained the only animated film nominated until the nominee Up after the Best Picture field had been widened to ten nominees Thus it remains the only animated film nominated for the award when only five nominees were allowed It was the third Disney film ever to be nominated for Best Picture following Mary Poppins and Dead Poets Society It became the first musical in twelve years to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture of the Year following All That Jazz and the last one to be nominated until Moulin Rouge ten years later It lost the Best Picture award to The Silence of the Lambs and the Best Sound award to Terminator Judgment Day With six nominations the film currently shares the record for the most nominations for an animated film with WALL E although with three nominations in the Best Original Song category Beauty and the Beast s nominations span only four categories while WALL E s nominations cover six individual categories br While The Little Mermaid was the first to be nominated Beauty and the Beast became the first animated film to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy This feat was later repeated by The Lion King and Toy Story br br In Beauty and the Beast was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed culturally historically or
