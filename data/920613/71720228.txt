Inside Out director Pete Docter was germinating ideas for a sequel while the original film s nominations were unveiled at the th Academy Awards in January Development on the story began in early and Pixar officially confirmed the sequel s development during the D Expo announcement in September with Amy Poehler coming on stage to discuss the film alongside Docter Kelsey Mann was announced as the director of the sequel making it his feature directorial debut with Mark Nielsen producing while Meg LeFauve was announced to write the film s screenplay returning from its predecessor br To utilize truthful worldbuilding Mann used Docter s five to emotions idea from the first film that he pitched during its production Mann s first pass included nine new emotions to make Joy feel overwhelmed with all the new emotions showing up but felt that the story could not keep track with so many emotions taking the spotlight or not adding to the story so after the first screening he decided to simplify the number Among those emotions was Schadenfreude having joy at someone s expense Jealousy and Guilt but the latter two influenced the film despite being removed with Mann feeling that Envy could relate to Jealousy and how remnants of Guilt could be found within Anxiety s introduction even giving Anxiety some of Guilt s baggage which was inspired by that of Disneyland hotels br br br Research and writing br The production team frequently consulted author and clinical psychologist Lisa Damour and used her books as guidance on accurately portraying how teenagers emotions change during puberty Professor of psychology at the University of California Berkeley Dacher Keltner who helped on the first Inside Out returned as a consultant as well Keltner played a key role in selecting which emotions should be introduced in the story A character based on the emotion of shame was intended to be a part of the film but was axed in part due to Keltner contesting that shame was not an emotion br To assist with the development of the film Pixar enlisted a group of nine teenagers who were dubbed Riley s Crew to provide feedback on the film to ensure it accurately portrayed modern teenage life Their input led to the inclusion of the emotion Nostalgia and influenced various scenes including everyday elements of the emotions lives and the transition from middle school to high school Nielsen and Mann were also inspired by their own daughters when crafting the film As development on the story began during lockdown due to the COVID pandemic the two were able to gather personal research from studying their children some of whom were Riley s age in the film Their perspective as parents helped in shaping the film and characterizing the emotions especially Joy br Initially the plot of the film was to involve a talent show but that idea ended up being scrapped After about three test screenings Nielsen Mann and LeFauve decided it was best to center the story on Riley playing hockey as they felt it was a unique aspect of her character The decision was also influenced by input Mann received from Turning Red director Domee Shi when he asked how to make the film unique from other teenage coming of age stories including her own The scene where the old emotions are locked in a vault was originally longer but was trimmed down as several gags were cut out due to time constraints br br br Casting br br Poehler accepted an offer of million with lucrative bonuses to reprise her role as Joy from the first film Phyllis Smith and Lewis Black also reprise their roles

poignantly perceptive tale of the conundrums of early adolescence since Eighth Grade David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a C rating writing that the film so perfectly ticks Pixar s boxes in a way that forces the sincerity of its storytelling into a losing battle with the cynicism of its existence Manhola Dargis in The New York Times praised Pixar s skill for turning ideas into images some of which actually manage to slip past the safety of its nice worldview with shocks of the sublime Other positive reviews include The Guardian and Empire while reviews from the BBC and Los Angeles Times were more mixed Among the other mixed reviews Siddhant Adlakha writing for IGN found the film was s urprising and disappointing in equal measure br Robert Daniels in his review on RogerEbert com felt that the film effectively used Anxiety to transform Riley into a blank character while Joy and other emotions navigate her mind For Daniels this structure allowed the film to blend visually stunning scenes with a whimsical style that is both gentle and entertaining addressing the pressures faced by teenage girls Daniels noted that the new emotions introduced were not as memorable as the main emotions br Writing for Deadline Diamond Wise however was rather negative about the film and concluded Battle weary parents of surly teens will have some fun here and there especially when Ennui s blas influence opens up a sar chasm in Riley s brain that makes everything sound well sarcastic But when all s said and done the stakes are so minor it s hard to imagine anyone will leave this
