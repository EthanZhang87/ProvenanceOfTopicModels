id: 748684
The Dodge Dart is a line of large passenger cars produced by Dodge from the to model years in North America with production extended to later years in various other markets br Chrysler first used Dart name plates on two Italian styled show cars in and before it became a Dodge model name br The production Dodge Dart was introduced as a lower priced full size model in and but became a mid size car for one model year for and was then reduced to a compact for two generations from to br The Dart nameplate was resurrected for a Fiat derived compact car that was introduced in br br br History br br The Dart name originally appeared on a Chrysler show car featuring a streamlined body designed by the Italian coachbuilder Carrozzeria Ghia that was later modified and renamed the Dart Diablo For Ghia built Chrysler a second visually similar show car the Chrysler Ghia Super Dart br br br First generation br br br br The first Dodge Darts were introduced for the model year They were downsized large cars developed to replace Plymouths in the standard low priced car segment for the Dodge dealer network Dodge dealers had been selling Plymouths since but divisional restructuring took the Plymouth brand away from the Dodge dealer network Project planners proposed the name Dart only to have Chrysler executives demand an expensive research program that produced the name Zipp This was promptly rejected in favor of Dart br With the cancellation of Chrysler s upper level DeSoto brand upper level Dodge products were pushed upmarket while using Plymouth products with more features for lower level Dodge products br The Dart sedans and coupes were based on the unibody Plymouth platform with a in mm wheelbase shorter than the standard size Dodge line However the Dart station wagons used the same in mm wheelbase as the upmarket Polara wagons The Dart line was offered in three trim levels the basic Seneca mid range Pioneer and premium Phoenix The new Dart came standard with a new engine the cu in L slant six The cu in L standard equipment on certain Phoenix and Pioneer body styles and cu in L V s were optional with two barrel or four barrel carburetors and with single or dual exhaust The Dodge cu in L V was added in Brakes were inch drums br Sales of the new Dart were greater than those of the full size Dodge Matador and Dodge Polara which also created an in house competitor for Plymouth Advertising from and compared the Dart to the C car Chevrolet the F car Ford and the P car Plymouth After the economic downturn of Dodge production for rebounded to cars the division s highest total to date and good for sixth place behind Chevrolet Ford Plymouth Rambler and Pontiac Chrysler officials were somewhat less comforted at how of Dodge s volume consisted of the low profit Dart line compared to the upmarket Matador and Polara of which only were sold for the model year br As the Dart s sales climbed Plymouth s sales dropped Chrysler executives did little to stop the infighting between the divisions Dart sales were so strong in that production of the medium priced model lines were reduced The full size mid priced Matador was discontinued after the model year as buyers selected the slightly smaller but better appointed and less expensive Dart Phoenix The premium Polara remained in the medium price segment in br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br For the model year the Dart continued as the smallest full size Dodge It retained the in mm wheelbase and was restyled to emulate the larger Polara The same three trim levels were available the premium Phoenix mid range Pioneer and base Seneca Once again wagons shared the Polara s in mm wheelbase they also shared the Polara s unique side mounted taillights br Engine choices included the cu in L slant six and the cu in L and cu in L V s were also available in various configurations Phoenix convertibles were equipped with V engines Beginning mid year some Darts ordered with the engine were equipped with the die cast aluminum block Darts in all series were equipped as standard with three speed column shifted manual transmissions Chrysler s pushbutton shifted TorqueFlite automatic was available at extra cost The alternator introduced as standard equipment in on the Valiant replaced the previous DC generator on all Chrysler products Canadian built Darts were identical to U S models on the outside but the interior trim controls and displays were those used on the U S Plymouth br Virgil Exner s styling with its reverse fins rear fender scalloping the taillights were widely referred to as ingrown toenails and the concave grille was highly unpopular with consumers The low position and small size of the Dart s tail lights just above the corners of the bumper was also criticized and drivers of following cars complained that they could not see them The wraparound taillights projected light sideward not rearward By mid year Dodge made auxiliary taillights available at extra cost through its dealer network However these large round lights were mounted near the inboard side of the reverse fins and aggravated the already awkward styling br The automobile market was generally an off year for automobile sales and Dodge production went down to units of which were Darts Among all the Darts sold almost half were the Seneca line down from in Combined sales of Dart and Polara were lower than Plymouth s sales for Dodge ranked ninth in sales in the American market in down from sixth place in Sales of the compact Dodge Lancer were units compared to its Plymouth twin the Valiant which sold units for the same year The model year saw Dodge s total production drop below the slow selling model year and almost the disastrous recession year of when Dodge faced the consequences of the poor reputation of its models br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Second generation br br For the Seneca Pioneer and Phoenix trim levels and names were dropped instead trim levels became Dart Dart Dart and Polara offered in downsized two and four door hardtop and convertible styles that stood out by their raised protruding grilles encompassing what look like inner headlights similar to the inner headlights in the protruding grille of a Ford Mustang br The Dodge Polara was dimensionally identical but not officially a Dart by dint of its different name and it was not built nor sold in Canada The Dart models were the same in Canada as in the U S except that the base model was badged Dart br The Dart and Polara were downsized as part of Chrysler s hasty effort to compete with what company leaders thought would be downsized large cars from Chevrolet However they had overheard talk not of the big Chevrolets but of the compact Chevy II Nova This was a basic front engine compact to compete more directly than the Corvair with the Ford Falcon Rambler American and Plymouth Valiant Chevrolet s Impala and Ford s Galaxie both remained sized in accord with the prevailing norms of full size cars br The redesigned Dart was perceived more as an intermediate like the Rambler Classic or the Ford Fairlane When Dodge dealers voiced their displeasure at having no true full size car to offer Chrysler quickly created the Dodge Custom in January by putting the Dodge Polara front end assembly on a version of the Chrysler Newport body br The Dart like the Plymouth was on a new lightweight unibody B platform featuring Chrysler s well received Torsion Aire torsion bar front suspension and asymmetric rear leaf springs The rigidity gained through the nearly pure unibody platform combined with the suspension s low unsprung weight and near ideal geometry provided sound handling braking and acceleration the latter especially with the mid year hp kW Ramcharger cu in L V which was aimed primarily at sanctioned drag racing where it quickly broke performance records br The Dart s new B body chassis platform was quite long lived while was the only year for a B body model named Dart the B platform remained in use with only very slight modification and a few new letter designations through to the R body cars br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Third generation br br For Dodge made a last minute decision to drop the Lancer name in favor of Dart for Dodge s newly designed senior compact a marketing term referring to the wheelbase having grown to in mm from the Lancer s in mm This longer wheelbase used the same A body suspension of the Valiant and defunct Lancer and would underpin all Darts from to except the station wagons which used the Valiant s in mm wheelbase and the Demon Sport which used the Plymouth Duster s in mm wheelbase The longer wheelbase gave more rear seat legroom than the previous Lancer or the contemporaneous Valiant The Dart was available as a or door sedan a door hardtop coupe a station wagon and a convertible Three trim levels were offered the low spec the high spec and the premium GT which was available only as a door hardtop or convertible The Dart has a turning diameter of ft m br The Dart was an instant market success with sales up sharply compared to those of the Lancer The Dart remained extremely popular through the end of the Dart s production run in in comparison to the Ford Falcon and the Chevrolet Nova br Initial engine offerings were two sizes of the slant six a cu in L hp kW version was fitted as standard equipment and a cu in L hp kW version was available for less than extra The aluminum engine block for the was discontinued early in the model year After the start of the model year an all new compact lightweight cu in L LA V producing bhp kW with a barrel carburetor was introduced as the top engine option was the last year for pushbutton control of the optional Torqueflite automatic transmission so and models were the only compact Darts so equipped Standard axle ratios in were with automatic transmission and engine or with manual transmission and engine or with engine and either transmission A ratio was optional New features included stronger door locks and a refined automatic choke br In the barrel remained available but a new performance version of the engine was released with a barrel carburetor compression a more aggressive camshaft with solid tappets and other upgrades which increased output to bhp kW At the same time the Dodge Dart Charger was offered The Dart Chargers were yellow Dart GT hardtops with black interiors Charger engines Plymouth called their barrel Commando premium mechanical and trim specifications and special Charger badging They were the first Dodge models to bear the Charger name The following year the larger B body Dodge Charger was introduced and the Charger name was thenceforth associated with Dart models only in the Charger marketing name for the optional larger cylinder engine br Other new options for included upgraded suspension components and larger in mm wheels and tires Factory installed air conditioning became available after the start of the model year as well as disc brakes which required the in mm wheels to clear the calipers Front seat belts became standard br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Fourth generation br br br Engines br The cu in L Slant engine remained standard equipment though its power rating rose from bhp kW to bhp kW for owing to the installation of the engine s barrel Carter BBD or Holley series carburetor and the revised camshaft the bigger engine had received in For North American domestic market vehicles the base engine was replaced for with a stronger new cu in L version of the slant This new base engine was also less costly to make for unlike the previous engine the used the same block as the The smaller displacement was achieved with a new crankshaft in mm stroke vs the in mm stroke of the crank and connecting rods in mm long vs the in mm rods in the Nevertheless the remained an upgrade option The barrel cu in L small block V was supplanted on the option list in by a cu in L barrel engine The was rated at bhp kW versus the barrel carbureted s bhp kW At the same time the barrel carbureted bhp kW was replaced on the options list by the bhp kW barrel carbureted cu in L available only in the Swinger and the hottest Dart the performance oriented GTS models The Dart GTS came standard with the cu in L V A hp kW cu in L big block was optional br br br br The Dart and its sister model the Plymouth Valiant were substantially redesigned for the model year In addition to new styling the cars received revised steering systems wider front track and frame rail spacing and redesigned K members capable of accepting larger engines The Dart kept this basic form with facelifts consisting of revised front and rear end styling and interior trim until the end of A body production in for North America and for South America br The restyled Dart for featured a rear window with compound inverse curves This created a unique appearance at the rear of the greenhouse but tended to collect snow and created thick C pillars that looked formal but created blind spots for drivers Curved side glass was used for the first time on a Chrysler compact The front featured a new dual plane front end contour the center section of the grille bumper and leading edge of the hood were recessed from the front plane of the car The single headlamps were placed forward of the recessed center section defining the front plane Park turn lamps were set into the grille in the corners formed by the transition area between the recessed and forward sections br With the new design changes were made to the Dart lineup beginning with the elimination of its station wagons and the base model s designation The only body styles were the and door sedans the hardtop and the convertible The base model was now badged simply as Dart The and GT versions carried on unchanged for the most part In late the GTS model debuted but was built in limited quantities due to its lateness in the model year the GTS was arguably improved by fitting the new high output cu in L V as standard equipment br The Dart along with all other Chrysler products got a new dual circuit brake hydraulic system to ensure a loss of pressure in the front brakes would not prevent the rear brakes from working and vice versa The system also incorporated a brake system fault telltale on the dashboard Other changes to comply with new federal safety laws included collapsible steering columns additional padding on the dashboard and sun visors Shoulder belt anchors were also provided for front outboard occupants br The redesign removed all traces of the older Virgil Exner styling that proved less popular by the early s The newer body was trimmer and proved extremely popular causing sales of the Dart to surpass compacts from Ford and GM br br br br br Changes for were relatively subtle The park and turn lights in the grille were moved slightly inboard and made round Side marker lights were added to the front fenders and rear quarter panels to comply with newly introduced Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Shoulder harnesses separate this year and until from the lap belts and non glare matte finish on the windshield wiper arms were also part of the federally mandated safety package Chrysler s clean air package emission control system became standard equipment on cars sold in all states The steering linkage was revised again as were the windshield and rear window gaskets and trim lock strips leaving the pieces as one year only items The standard rear axle ratio was dropped from to with all standard performance engines and automatic transmission Part throttle downshift functionality was added as a refinement to the TorqueFlite automatic transmission in cylinder cars to retain acceptable city performance with the taller rear axle ratio br br br Hemi Dart br A limited option for only code L the Hurst reworked Hemi Darts used the cu in L Hemi engine These special models only were made were created strictly for drag racing and included a non warranty disclaimer On February corporate headquarters in Highland Park Michigan sent out a press release to Dodge dealerships It was a promotional pitch purposed at selling drag ready Hemi powered Darts The press release stated that Dodge wanted to make a factory built and ready drag racer out of the Dart GTS hardtop for competition in class B Super Stock drag racing Engineers stated the new Hemi Dart reached speeds of mph km h in less than seconds and mi m times in the second range although times have been reported as low as the second range br To keep weight low a fiberglass hood and fenders were used The hood featured a functional intake scoop and four hood pins for full lift off removal of the hood Lightweight acid dipped steel doors with thin side window glass were used As the doors lacked a window mechanism a strap was attached to the bottom of the glass on the interior door panel To keep glass up the strap latched to the inside of the door The interior included only two bucket seats from a Dodge van The center console heater sound deadeners side view mirrors radio carpeting and even armrests were omitted to save weight br The engine was a race spec Hemi These motors had a compression ratio of pistons bore x stroke in in mm mm fed through a X barrel Holley carburetors atop a lightweight crossram aluminum intake manifold rated at hp PS kW at rpm and a maximum torque of lb ft N m at rpm A high performance Mopar battery was moved to the trunk to free up room and improve weight distribution br Darts could be ordered with either a four speed manual or three speed automatic transmissions Manual transmission equipped cars code A featured a Dana built heavy duty axle with a gear ratio heavy duty clutch steel bellhousing and special torque shaft and pivots Manual transmissions were modified by removing synchronizers which lowered the chances of missed shifts A Hurst floor mounted shifter came standard br The automatic transmissions were the then new Chrysler built TorqueFlite three speed with inch large stem pinion center section with a gear set and a rpm high speed torque converter They were also modified with a floor mounted Hurst shifter for manual shifting br Other features include heavy duty rear shocks heavy duty radiator with a seven blade fan and deep groove pulleys a high capacity oil pump solid lifter cam and a roller timing chain to reduce stretch and provide more reliable performance A transistorized dual points breaker distributor coupled with a Prestolite ignition and solid core wires were also used br The cars weighed approximately lb kg The cars were designed to meet street legal requirements but due to the modifications the cars came with disclaimers that they were not for street use but rather supervised acceleration trials or drag racing br br br br br The door sedan was dropped at the end of and replaced with the Swinger door hardtop for available in Custom GT and GTS trim Also added was the Swinger br The entire Dart range received trim updates including another minor revision of the grille and a return to rectangular park turn lights The round side marker lights were replaced with rectangular reflectors Head restraints were optional equipment until January when their installation became mandatory under federal law The cylinder models received a carburetor anti ice system borrowed from Canadian market Chrysler cylinder engines and the drum brake automatic adjusters were revised for more consistent operation At the top of the Dart performance range for there was limited availability of the V in the Dart GTS model br br br br br The Dart was refreshed for with front and rear changes designed to bring the car closer to the design themes found in Dodge s full size vehicles through grille and contour changes In the rear the Dart s new rectangular tail lights were set into a wedge shaped rear bumper design continuing the angled trailing edge of the new deck lid and quarter panels The revised rear styling did not change the cubic ft trunk space of the model inch wheels became standard equipment and the cu in L slant was replaced by a larger cu in L version for improved base model performance and greater manufacturing economy the used the same block as the while the had used a different block Changes to the fuel system improved drivability economy and emission control Part throttle downshift was added to the cylinder automatic transmissions In compliance with FMVSS side marker lights and reflectors were installed at all four corners Darts for the US and Canadian markets were built in Canada at the Windsor Ontario or Los Angeles California assembly plant All Darts got the federally mandated steering column and ignition lock br The Swinger name was applied to all the Dart two door hardtops except in the high line custom series Other changes were made to the Dart line to avoid internal competition with Dodge s new Challenger the Dart convertible was discontinued along with the optional cu in L V leaving the bhp kW barrel V as the top Dart engine br The performance model in the Dart line for was the Swinger door hardtop The Swinger came with functional hood scoops with emblems Standard equipment included front disc brakes only on the Swinger heavy duty Rallye suspension a rear axle ratio fiberglass belted bias ply tires mounted to inch steel wheels and a bumblebee stripe Optional equipment included an upgrade over the standard bench seat with all vinyl bucket seats with which a center console could be ordered A performance hood upgrade with scoops was painted flat black with hood tie down pins Mechanical options included power assisted brakes and steering Rallye wheels and wire wheel covers were also optional as was a rpm tachometer and a vinyl roof covering in black or white br br br br br For Chrysler introduced a door hardtop in the Valiant line called the Scamp It was the same car as the Swinger with a Valiant front clip The Dart s dual tail lamps were given over to the badge engineered Scamp while the Dart received new smaller quad taillamps that would be used through The custom door hardtop coupe became the Swinger and the standard Swinger became the Swinger Special Dodge gained a version of Plymouth s popular Valiant based fastback Duster which was to be named the Beaver but when Chrysler s marketing department learned that beaver was CB slang for vagina the vehicle was renamed the Dart Demon br As was the case with previous Dodge rebadges of Plymouth Valiants such as the Lancer sales of the Demon lagged behind those of the Duster With optional hood scoops and blackout hood treatment the car was advertised as a performance car The Demon s Dart type front fender wheel lips and Duster type rear wheel fender lips reveal the car was essentially a Duster with Dart front sheet metal and other minor styling changes A new audio option became available for Chrysler s cassette recorder Unlike the track tapes the cassette player was relatively compact and it was mounted on the console or on its own floor mount casing This unit offered an available microphone in which one could record their own dictation br The Swinger Dart s performance model was replaced by the Demon HP engine with an optional speed manual transmission optional hood scoops and blackout hood treatment In Chrysler ended their longstanding corporate practice of installing left hand threaded wheel studs on the left side of the vehicle all wheel studs on the Dart thenceforth used conventional right hand threads br br br br br Changes for included a revised grille without the central divider of the and items new surface mounted sidemarker lights rather than the previous flush mount units the instrument cluster was now shared with the Valiant and featured a large rectangular speedometer and several small round gauges the AM FM radio option returned The Demon had new fender mounted metal Demon badges without the small devil character on the decals The Demon decal on the rear of the car was replaced by Dodge and Dart emblems on the lower right edge of the deck lid Some Demons with the side and rear panel tape stripes retained the tape devil character A new optional single hood scoop replaced s dual scoops and was coupled with a hood paint blackout that had been standard on the high trim high value Demon Sizzler model Cars equipped with the optional rally wheels now came with newly restyled center caps finished in a light argent silver paint Demon production was substantially less than Duster s this is reflected in higher collector car values for the Demon especially V models br br br br br The model year Darts received new front styling with revised fenders grille header panel and hood Impact absorbing front bumpers were installed to comply with new federal regulations as well as side impact guard beams in the doors and new emission control devices New single piston disc brakes replaced the more complex piston units offered from to br Chrysler s new electronic ignition system was standard equipment on all engines and starter motors were revised for faster engine cranking The K frame was modified to accommodate a new spool type engine mount that limited engine roll to The upper ball joints were upgraded to the larger B body units Along with these chassis changes the wheel bolt pattern on Darts with disc brakes was enlarged from in mm to the in mm pattern common to the larger B and C body Chrysler built passenger cars Darts with wheel drum brakes continued with the smaller bolt pattern The standard rear axle was still the inch unit but the heavy duty option was now an inch item rather than the previous inch rear axle Standard rear axle ratios were with automatic transmission and with manual though other ratios were available Vent wings were deleted from the Swinger but not from the door sedans A new Quiet Car package was available consisting of extra sound insulation premium exhaust hangers and an exhaust resonator br The Demon fastback was renamed Dart Sport in response to poor sales It was thought that the Demon name and devil with pitchfork logo negatively affected sales to people of faith br The high performance model thus became Dart Sport and saw styling changes to go along with the name change The Dart Sport received the same new front end as the other Darts and its taillights were changed to two lights per side each with a chrome trim ring These would remain unchanged through the model year br br br br br In the US federal mph km h bumper impact standards were expanded to cover rear bumpers as well as front ones and as a result the Swinger and Dart sedan s rear bumpers grew much more massive Taillights larger than the previous year s items were set above the rear bumper rather than within it Shoulder and lap belts were finally combined in all Chrysler products into a retractable inertia sensitive single buckle design Chrysler called Unibelt replacing the difficult to use separate lap and shoulder belts that had been installed through br The Arab oil embargo of increased sales of smaller cars in the U S Dodge introduced the Dart SE special edition in mid as a four door sedan and two door hardtop The SE included velour high back bucket seats with folding armrest carpeted door panels woodgrain instrument panel and deluxe wheel covers along with a TorqueFlite automatic transmission as standard equipment The SE came equipped with the quiet car package introduced in The air conditioning system available on all Darts had increased capacity quicker cooldown and lower minimum temperatures An evaporator pressure regulator valve long used on larger Chrysler products varied the compressor s capacity without cycling the clutch br The Dart Sport was replaced by the Dart Sport Bhp as the cu in L V engine replaced the cu in L engine discontinued after br br br br br The models were virtually identical to the s except for a new grille and that California and some high altitude models were equipped with catalytic converters and so required unleaded gasoline All models were required to pass a roof crush test and to meet this stringent requirement additional reinforcements were added to all Dart door hardtops Heavy gauge steel in the windshield pillar area had been incorporated into the windshield pillar and roof design Darts were also equipped with an improved energy absorbing steering column which used multiple slots in the column jacket to replace prior used convoluted mesh design At impact force applied to the steering wheel curled the column jacket back over a mandrel mounted on the floor Federal Motor Safety Standards briefly required that the front seat belts include a starter interlock system that prevented the engine from starting unless the front seat outboard occupant and the driver fastened their belts br The slant six engine was discontinued and the became standard equipment on all models As in the V was limited to the Dart Sport model A speed manual transmission was offered with the cylinder engine for the first time in the North American market since and with a new overdrive th gear ratio It was Chrysler s first application of overdrive since The final drive ratio in fourth gear was on the slant six cars equipped with rear axle and on the V s equipped with rear axle The result was less engine noise and wear and greater fuel economy br Also for heaters had more heating capacity than in the previous year s models The added capacity was the result of adding a third speed to the blower system which provided greater airflow at maximum setting The electrically heated backglass defogger grid timer cycle was doubled to minutes Additionally sound insulation was improved br br br br br was the Dart s final year in the North American market The rear view mirror was mounted on the windshield rather than from the roof Front disc brakes became standard equipment on January in accord with more stringent U S federal brake performance requirements a new spoke steering wheel debuted and a new foot operated parking brake replaced the under dash T handle used since the Dart s introduction as a compact car The grille s parking lamps were cast in amber whereas the previous years had clear lenses with amber colored bulbs br The Dart Sport was dropped as a separate model in but the cu in L four barrel dual exhaust without catalytic converters V was a option except in California for the Dart Sport V models with automatic transmission Car Driver magazine tested the Dart Sport in the April issue pitting it against the Chevrolet Corvette and Pontiac Trans Am and found its top speed of mph km h to be second to the Corvette s mph km h br Dart Custom Door Sedan was dropped as the mid level door sedan model but the features and trim were carried over as option package A Sedans equipped with the Custom package received the same Custom front fender badges as were applied to the standalone models of the same name Elimination of the Custom series narrowed Dart s Door Sedan offerings in Dart s final year to two models Dart and Dart Special Edition br br br A Police Package br In the Dart was offered with a police package with production code A The A Dart had high specification components and systems throughout including a heavy duty suspension with a rear sway bar stronger leaf springs and firmer shock absorbers larger brakes with semi metallic front disc pads maximum engine cooling as well as a high capacity alternator and battery The engines were Chrysler s slant six V and cu in L LA V H P with non catalyst in state models and a true dual exhaust California models had a single exhaust with the catalytic converter with an A TorqueFlite transmission Police specific equipment such as a calibrated speedometer certified mph high intensity dome light and wiring harness for a rooftop light bar were standard equipment with an A pillar spotlight and push bars were optional Production volume was low with most A Darts going to the Los Angeles and Ventura police departments in Southern California For the most part police agencies preferred the larger intermediate Dodge Coronet or full size Dodge Monaco br A Taxi Package br A Taxi Package was also offered in Dart s final year of production Standard equipment included roof light wiring structural reinforcements in the body frame members heavy duty shocks and alternator and maximum capacity radiator Engine options were the slant six or V The Taxi package also included numerous interior upgrades including high grade black vinyl heavy duty floor mats and heavy duty springs in front and rear seat cushions and seat backs At

packages br br br Convertriple and Hang br br For and the Convertriple option on the Dart Sport included a fold down rear seat security panel offering ft in m of lengthwise space and a manually operated metal sunroof It was advertised as three cars in one an economy compact a convertible alternative because of the sunroof and a roomy station wagon alternative because of the fold down rear seat br The Convertriple was the basis for the Hang option It was aimed at surfers in an attempt by Dodge marketers to better determine consumer preferences in a declining performance market Hang ten is a surfing expression for balancing at the end of a surfboard with ten toes over the nose of the board while riding the wave Available only in eggshell white exterior with a factory installed sunroof the car s fold down rear seat permitted the loading of a surfboard through the trunk The Hang option continued the surfing theme with various colored stripe material accenting the white vinyl seats and door panels Orange shag carpet covered the back of the fold down rear seat while the dash and center console had orange accents Red and blue exterior stripes started at the quarter panels

In response to increased interest in fuel economy Dodge offered the Dart Lite fuel economy package which weighed at least lb kg less than the ordinary Dart Sport The slant six was the only available engine equipped with an aluminum intake manifold for the first time since and a specially calibrated carburetor and distributor Bumper reinforcement brackets were aluminum instead of steel while the hood and trunk lid bracing and inner panels were also aluminum The slant six engine block had already been modified for reduced weight in in the middle of production its crankshaft was changed from forged steel to lighter cast iron The high flow exhaust system included a dual biscuit catalytic converter a larger headpipe and the muffler used on V models The Dart Lite was equipped with a rear axle rather than the customary ratio when the car was ordered with a three or four speed manual transmission The A OD Overdrive speed manual transmission housing was made of aluminum and had a final drive ratio which allowed cruising at highway speeds with minimum engine revolutions Like all other Darts the Dart Lites with automatic transmission came with a rear axle as standard equipment The Dart Lite with manual transmission was rated by the EPA at mpg L km in highway driving The Plymouth version was the Feather Duster br br br Taxi br Darts were offered to the taxicab industry for their whole production run from to While specifications varied by year interior upgrades generally included heavy duty front and rear black rubber floor mats heavy duty seat cushion springs with full foam

which was the slant six series with California emissions hp kW and lb ft N m Options included a radio suppression package and a Fuel Pacer System Many if not all of them had a body color paint sales code of meaning special order paint br br br Racing and competition br br br D Dart br Dodge offered a performance version of the Dart GT in Known as the D Dart for competitive use in NHRA s D stock class the V was modified to produce bhp kW Most of the power came from a larger carburetor and a more radical camshaft The bulletin sent to the dealers from Chrysler also mentions an in mm rear axle with final drive ratio br br br SCCA competition br In the SCCA introduced the new Trans American Sedan Championship that allowed competition among Dodge Darts Plymouth Barracudas Chevrolet Corvairs Ford Mustangs and other production touring cars with a maximum wheelbase of in mm The cars competed in two classes over liters and under liters Few modifications were allowed bumpers rear seats and floor mats could be removed mufflers could be replaced with straight pipes and different wheels could be used so long as the stock rim diameter and width were maintained Any engine component available over the dealer parts counter was sanctioned for use Bob Tullius race team called Group used Dart model coupes and GT coupes with bbl engines and were sponsored by Quaker State The team won the hour endurance race at Marlboro Motor Raceway in car No driven by Tullius and Tony Adamowicz who would also go on to win at Riverside International Raceway Dodge pulled sponsorship of the Darts after one season br br br Super stock br Although racers like Dick Landy and Don Garlits had modified Darts in the mid s to run in the National Hot Rod Association NHRA funny car class using the Hemi super stock class racing of the Dart was almost non existent due to the small V s available In Dodge contracted Hurst Performance to build a limited number of Darts powered by the cu in L RB big block and cu in L Hemi powered Darts to compete in the SS B class as the LO Hurst Hemi Dart According to Chrysler staff engineer Larry Shepard the majority of these Darts were Hemi powered although a small pilot run of fifty powered Darts were also built in In said Shepard we built over powered Darts basically the same as the GTS except for the engine br br br Foreign markets br Right hand drive and Darts were exported to Commonwealth countries such as Australia New Zealand South Africa and Singapore In Australia they were badged as the Dodge Phoenix In South Africa a DeSoto branded version of the car called the Diplomat was sold from to as well Once the Dart name was moved to Dodge s compact car for the Phoenix was no longer Dart related each year thereafter through the Phoenix name was applied to the RHD version of a Dodge or Plymouth B body or C body for Commonwealth export br Chrysler Australia used the Dart front end in the Australian built VE Valiant The two door coupe versions of the subsequent VF and VG models used the Dart two door s body from the A pillar back married to an Australian front end Australian sedan and pickup truck models were also exported in knock down kit form to New Zealand for local assembly there from to br Dodge Darts were assembled in right hand drive in South Africa during the s and up until and sold locally as the Chrysler Valiant All South African models were built with a locally sourced cu in six cylinder engine U S Plymouth Dodge models were fully replaced by Australian Chrysler products from br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

Production of A body Darts continued in Brazil where they were also sold as Charger Magnum and Le Baron through and in Colombia through Dart based A body cars with various names including Valiant Coronado and Polara were produced in Argentina through The Brazilian A body cars used the inch wheelbase mm bodystyle from and were always equipped with the cubic inch V set up to run on the lower octane fuel used in Latin America at the time Originally a three speed manual transmission was standard with an optional Torqueflite automatic transmission and later a four speed manual was also

power but was taxed considerably less These vehicles were also exported to other European markets such as France and the United Kingdom but without much success The Spanish Dodges never met sales goals and was an expensive failure for the Barreiros concern The break even point was cars per year a goal which was only surpassed once in The Barreiros brothers were forced to sell off the company

original year production run the Dart earned a good reputation The Dart was one of the most successful compact cars ever introduced in the American automobile marketplace according to R D McLaughlin then vice president of Chrysler s Automotive sales division It enjoys a strong owner loyalty and is a car that has established a reputation for reliability and value these are some reasons why we will continue to market the Dart while introducing the new compact Aspen br The A body Dart was replaced by the F body Dodge Aspen in late spring of alongside the somewhat larger M body Dodge Diplomat which was seen as a high end mid size car or even a low end full size car that was positioned between the Aspen and St Regis Nevertheless as these cars were considerably too large for the compact car market that segment would be occupied by the Omni for Dodge to compete in a rapidly changing automobile market The Aspen was replaced in by the Dodge Aries and the Dodge in These models would then be succeeded by the Dodge Spirit and later by the Stratus and Avenger sedans The Diplomat would be produced until when it was replaced by the full size Monaco and then the Intrepid The Intrepid was then replaced by the Dodge Charger sedan After years the Dodge Dart PF was resurrected for the model year as a nameplate in the domestic market to replace the Caliber as Dodge s compact passenger car br br
