Jessie is a fictional cowgirl rag doll in the Disney Pixar Toy Story franchise She first appeared in Toy Story and returned in the sequels Toy Story and Toy Story The idea for introducing a female character was suggested by Nancy Lasseter while John Lasseter Pete Docter Ash Brannon and Andrew Stanton developed and created the character She is voiced by Joan Cusack in the Toy Story filmography while Sarah McLachlan is her singing voice in Toy Story Kat Cressida also voiced the character in the Disney Infinity series br Jessie is a brave and excitable rag doll who is abandoned by her owner after she outgrew her Years of being in storage leads her to develop claustrophobia and abandonment issues She is eventually rescued by series protagonist Woody and finds a new owner in Andy Davis Years later she and her friends are donated to Bonnie Anderson who claims Jessie as her new favorite toy With Woody s departure after reuniting with Bo Peep she is given his sheriff badge as a token of her significance to Bonnie br Jessie has received a largely positive critical reception since her debut with praise for her tragic backstory and her characterisation as a strong female character Some critics criticised Pixar for sidelining her in the third and fourth films in particular reducing her role to a romance subplot with Buzz Lightyear Cusack s vocal performance was positively received and she was awarded for voicing Jessie at the Annie Awards br br The story concept for Toy Story began with director John Lasseter considering what scenario would be most upsetting for a toy He decided that the idea of a toy collector who seals toys in cases ensuring that they will never to be played with was worse than being replaced by another toy He took inspiration from a toy collector character that appeared in an early draft of Toy Story but was removed The concept involved series protagonist Woody being part of a collectible set an idea that originated in a draft story titled A Tin Toy Christmas Ralph Guggenheim a producer on Toy Story said that the team took inspiration from s children s cowboy television series including Howdy Doody and Hopalong Cassidy to define the rest of the characters in Woody s set You would find a gruff old prospector You would find other characters like an Annie Oakley Calamity Jane sort of character a tough frontier girl Lasseter s wife Nancy also encouraged him to include a female character that would appeal to girls and to make her a more substantial character than Bo Peep Jessie was originally created as a character named Se orita Cactus designed as a Mexican sidekick of the prospector character to entice Woody with her feminine charms By the time she had been redefined as Jessie her personality was also updated to be tougher br The Pixar team knew that a key aspect of the plot was to find a reason for Woody to leave Andy s room so they wanted to create a compelling character to engage with Woody emotionally Chief creative officer Pete Docter said that the team knew that Woody could not be convinced to leave through logic and reason so they decided that it needed to centre on a relationship Jessie brought this sense of responsibility and duty Toy Story director Josh Cooley said that Jessie was created to support Woody and show him a new perspective and as she evolved she continued to support him Production designer Bob Pauley described Jessie as superfun and energetic and a nice complement to Woody She was initially designed by Jill Culton who found her hair particularly difficult but her design was later upgraded Lasseter said that the team worked hard on making Jessie a strong female character He explained that after being abandoned by her owner Jessie believes that her only opportunity to be loved by children again is in a museum which requires a Woody doll her whole love of children is hinged around the fact that Woody got there He said that several attempts were made to create the scene in which Jessie tells her backstory but when this failed to work they found that it was better expressed through the song When She Loved Me written by Randy Newman and performed by Sarah McLachlan Lasseter explained that every time she would tell the story it lost some emotion Although the Pixar team generally avoided having characters break into song they decided that the song was the right format for expressing the emotion It brought tears to our eyes br br Joan Cusack was cast as the voice actor for Jessie in Toy Story and voiced the role in the third and fourth Toy Story feature films Discussing her voice work she commented that Jessie s voice is inherent in that cowboy genre and that much of her characterisation is just being a kid Lasseter was a fan of McLachlan so she took on the singing part of the role Newman said that she had the ability to hold long notes so he wrote Jessie s song with her voice in mind He was tasked by the Pixar team to write a song that would explain Jessie s relationship with her owner and her sadness when the girl grew up In the fictional s series Woody s Roundup Jessie s yodelling voice is provided by Mary Kay Bergman On the film soundtrack which was released after the film Devon Dawson a yodeller discovered by Riders in the Sky at a music festival sings the part of Jessie in two songs In addition Kat Cressida has voiced Jessie in

give young girls someone to look up to without having her pander to men at all Conversely her developing relationship with Buzz Lightyear received positive commentary from Sara Martin Alegre who said that it could be considered a subversion of the dominant male romance trope due to the healthy and consensual feelings that Buzz and Jessie bear for one another Ella Alexander of Harper s Bazaar noted that in Toy Story Jessie is pushed to the background except for her scenes involving her romance with Buzz Lightyear while in Toy Story she is again given a minor supporting role in favour of Bo Peep

several characters alongside Dory and Mrs Incredible that take second billing to the male characters in Pixar films at worst they re token love interests stay at home mums and other stereotypes bent
