herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him He informs Mufasa of Simba s peril knowing that he will rush to save him Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge s

s newborn cub to the assembled animals continuing the circle of life br br Donald Glover as Simba A lion who is the crown prince of the Pride Lands Glover said that the film will focus more on Simba s time growing up than the original film did stating that Favreau was very keen in making sure we saw Simba s transition from boy to man and how hard that can be when there s been a deep trauma br JD McCrary as young Simba br Seth Rogen as Pumbaa A slow witted warthog who befriends and adopts a young Simba after he runs away from home Rogen said a s an actor I don t think I m right for every role there are a lot of roles I don t think I m right for even in movies I m making but Pumbaa was one I knew I could do well Favreau encouraged Rogen and Timon s Billy Eichner who did their voice recordings together to improvise a lot Rogen s casting would also mark the first time that Pumbaa was not played by Ernie Sabella who had reprised the role for every Disney project the character was involved in up to that point br Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar The treacherous brother of Mufasa the brother in law of Sarabi and the uncle of Simba who seeks to take the mantle of king of the Pride Lands Ejiofor described Scar as more psychologically possessed and brutalized than in the original film Ejiofor said that especially with Scar whether it s a vocal quality that allows for a certain confidence or a certain aggression to always know that at the end of it you re playing somebody who has the capacity to turn everything on its head in a split second with outrageous acts of violence that can completely change the temperature of a scene Ejiofor also said that Scar and Mufasa s relationship is completely destroyed and brutalized by Scar s way of thinking He s possessed with this disease of his own ego and his own want Favreau said of casting Ejiofor He is just a fantastic actor who brings us a bit of the mid Atlantic cadence and a new take on the character He brings that feeling of a Shakespearean villain to bear because of his background as an actor It s wonderful when you have somebody as experienced and seasoned as Chiwetel he just breathes such wonderful life into this character br Alfre Woodard as Sarabi The Queen of the Pride Lands Mufasa s wife and Simba s mother br Billy Eichner as Timon A wise cracking meerkat who befriends and adopts a young Simba after he runs away from home Eichner described Timon as physically the smallest character but he has one of the bigger personalities and I love the combination of those two things I kind of played into Timon as I ve done with many characters of mine the notion that he might be small in stature but he has a huge sense of entitlement which is always funny to play and that when Timon speaks and when he s quote unquote being funny he s very loud and boisterous but his singing allows this vulnerable side a slightly softer side especially in Can You Feel the Love Tonight and other moments Eichner also talked about having what some may consider a gay sensibility that he brought to the table when he voiced Timon br John Kani as Rafiki A wise mandrill who serves as the shaman of the Pride Lands and a close friend of Mufasa s Likening his role to that of a grandfather Kani said Rafiki reminds all of us of that special wise relative His wisdom humor and his loyalty to the Mufasa dynasty is what warms our hearts towards him He s always happy and wisecracking jokes as lessons of life and survival br John Oliver as Zazu A hornbill who is the majordomo to the King of the Pride Lands Speaking of his role Oliver said I think Zazu is basically a bird who likes structure He just wants things to be as they should be I think there are British echoes there because we tend to favor structure in lieu of having an emotional reaction to anything br Beyonc Knowles Carter as Nala Simba s childhood best friend and future love interest According to Favreau the character has a bigger role than in the original film Favreau felt that part of Beyonc joining the film is that she s got young kids part of it is that it s a story that feels good for this phase of her life and her career and she really likes the original very much And then of course there are these wonderful musical numbers that she can be involved with and my God she really lives up to her reputation as far as the beauty of her voice and talent br Shahadi Wright Joseph as young Nala Joseph reprises her role from the Broadway production Joseph chose to work on the film because Nala inspires little girls She s a great role model br James Earl Jones as Mufasa The King of the Pride Lands Sarabi s husband and the father of Simba Jones reprises his role from the original animated film According to Favreau Jones lines remain mostly the same from the original film Ejiofor said that the comfort of Jones reprising his role is going to be very rewarding in taking the audience on this journey again It s a once in a generation vocal quality Favreau saw Jones return as carrying the legacy across the original film and the remake and felt that his voice s change in tonality compared to the original film served the role well because he sounds like a king who s ruled for a long time br Florence Kasumba Keegan Michael Key and Eric Andr voice Shenzi Kamari and Azizi The Matriarch of the spotted hyena clan and her two lieutenants who join forces with Scar in order to kill Mufasa While Shenzi is a character that was featured in the original animated film Kamari and Azizi are the respective names of new characters loosely based on Banzai and Ed from the original film The hyenas characterizations were heavily altered from the original film s as Favreau felt that they had to change a lot to fit the remake s realistic style stating that a lot of the stuff around them in the original film was very stylised Kasumba elaborated declaring that t hose hyenas were funny These hyenas are dangerous Kasumba also voices Shenzi in the German dub of the film br Additionally Penny Johnson Jerald voices Sarafina Nala s mother Amy Sedaris Chance the Rapper Josh McCrary and Phil LaMarr voice a guineafowl a bushbaby an elephant shrew and an impala respectively Timon and Pumbaa s neighbors in the oasis J Lee voices a hyena that chases after Timon and Pumbaa br br On September Walt Disney Pictures confirmed that

Unity Technologies to build the film s technology platform using the Unity game engine br MPC was in charge of all the VFX shots for the film There are VFX shots The animals were designed from art and photo references From that the characters were built all the rigging shapes textures and furs were rendered step by step for further improvement After that the animation of the animals was crafted by hand based on the reference clips The movements muscles eyes facial expressions and the way the animals breathe was animated for more than species The environment was created entirely in CGI from reference materials such as high definition photos of the African landscape All the FX simulations such as water dirt and fire were created by combining VR technology with cameras shots so that scenes could be digitally built within a VR simulated environment New software developed for the movie made it possible to create scenes with the shaky cam look of a handheld camera Sean Bailey Disney s President of Production said of the film s visual effects It s a new form of filmmaking Historical definitions don t work It uses some techniques that would traditionally be called animation and other techniques that would traditionally be called live action It is an evolution of the technology Jon Favreau used in Jungle Book br Rather than have animators do everything the team used artificial

Angeles Times called the film polished satisfying entertainment Todd McCarthy at The Hollywood Reporter considered it to be inferior to the original noting The film s aesthetic caution and predictability begin to wear down on the entire enterprise in the second half At The Guardian Peter Bradshaw found the film watchable and enjoyable But I missed the simplicity and vividness of the original hand drawn images Among the vocal performances the roles of Eichner and Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa respectively received particular praise by critics with The A V Club s A A Dowd proclaiming Ultimately only Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as slacker sidekicks Timon and Pumbaa make much of an impression their funny possibly ad libbed banter feels both fresh and true to the spirit of the characters the perfect remake recipe br William Bibbiani of TheWrap wrote in his review Jon Favreau s remake looks incredibly literal but the digital animal performers lack the facial expressions and body movement to tell the story Sreeparna Sengupta of The Times of India praised the film giving it a score of and stating For those who haven t seen the original The Lion King is certainly worth a watch for its gorgeous visuals and technical genius Helen O Hara of Empire gave the film stars saying The great circle of life has thrown up a gorgeous star studded story but trading feeling for realism means that we lose something of the original film s excellence Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert com gave the film stars saying The worst thing you can say about this movie and perhaps the highest compliment you can pay it is to say it would be even more dazzling if it told a different story with different animals and the same technology and style and maybe without songs because you don t necessarily need them when you have images that sing Kevin Maher of The Times gave the film stars praising it as an improvement over the original though he criticized the ending as descend ing into a sprawling Avengers style donnybrook with little dramatic resonance Edward Porter of The Sunday Times gave the film stars praising the visuals and performances but criticizing the lack of expressiveness of the characters faces br A A Dowd writing for The A V Club summarized the film as Joyless artless and maybe soulless it transforms one of the most striking titles from the Mouse House vault into a very expensive star studded Disneynature film Dowd bemoaned the film s insistence on realism commenting We re watching a hollow bastardization of a blockbuster at once completely reliant on the audience s pre established affection for its predecessor and strangely determined to jettison much of what made it special Scott Mendelson at Forbes condemned the film as a crushing disappointment At almost every turn this redo undercuts its own melodrama by downplaying its own emotions David Ehrlich of IndieWire panned the film writing Unfolding like the world s longest and least convincing deepfake Jon Favreau s almost photorealistic remake of The Lion King is meant to represent the next step in Disney s circle of life Instead this soulless chimera of a film comes off as little more than a glorified tech demo from a greedy conglomerate a well rendered but creatively bankrupt self portrait of a movie studio eating its own tail Hans Zimmer s score received particular praise by critics with Jonathan Broxton wrote I have always considered The Lion King to be one of Hans Zimmer s greatest career achievements but somehow here he has made the already superb into something spectacular The enhanced orchestrations and larger instrumental ensemble gives more weight and more power to something that was already powerful and weighty The actual composition itself in terms of recurring thematic ideas and intelligent application of those ideas is highlighted by many of the new arrangements and the way in which Zimmer uses his instruments to pick out specific moments of emotional resonance is deeply impressive br Elton John who worked on the film s soundtrack disowned the film and stated The new version of The Lion King was a huge disappointment to me because I believe they messed the music up Music was so much a part of the original and the music in the current film didn t have the same impact The magic and joy were lost br br On September Deadline Hollywood reported that a follow up film was in development with Barry Jenkins attached to direct While The Hollywood Reporter said the film would be a prequel about Mufasa during his formative years Deadline said it would be a sequel centering on both Mufasa s origins and the events after the first film similar to The Godfather Part II Jeff Nathanson the screenwriter for the remake has reportedly finished a draft In August it was reported that Aaron Pierre and Kelvin Harrison Jr had been cast as Mufasa and Scar respectively The film will not be a remake of The Lion King II Simba s Pride the direct to video sequel to the original animated film In September at the D Expo it was announced that the film will be titled Mufasa The Lion King and that it will follow the titular character s origin story Seth Rogen Billy Eichner and John Kani will reprise their roles as Pumbaa Timon and Rafiki respectively The film is scheduled to release on December br br Official
