Infinity Base With the exception of non humanoid characters such as those from the Cars series each character has a double jump and a default set of attacks as well as an ability unique to each figure For example Sulley and Jack Skellington can roar to scare others while Violet and Randall can turn invisible There were two main modes in this game Play Set and Toy Box Each playset is essentially a self contained world with its own gameplay based on a specific film or series with recognizable characters and storylines In play set mode the player can earn items tools and characters to use in Toy Box mode Characters from one world cannot enter into another world but players can put any characters together in Toy Box mode Toy Box is a sandbox mode that players can fully customize and explore and earn items tools and characters to customize and explore from play sets br br br Play Set Mode br There are a number of playsets available which are accessed via placing the relevant playset piece onto the Infinity Base These include Pirates of the Caribbean Monsters University The Incredibles Cars The Lone Ranger and Toy Story in Space These playsets have their own unique campaign which could be played with up to two players However all characters from a specific franchise can only play in their respective playset for example Mr Incredible cannot be used in the Pirates of the Caribbean playset meaning two figures from the same series are required to play a play set in split screen multiplayer Playing through Play Set mode unlocks objects and vehicles that can be used in the Toy Box mode br br br Toy Box mode br Toy Box mode allowed players to create their own game in an open world arena Players can mix and match everything that is unlocked within each of the play sets including characters weapons and gadgets By unlocking new content in the Disney Infinity play sets players are able to build their own worlds and essentially create their own game There are various adventures in this mode which help teach the player how to use the mode s tools Players can also earn spins by playing through playsets or leveling up their characters which can be used to unlock additional items The mode supports online multiplayer in which players can play around with items that only the other player has albeit only during that session br A portable Toy Box became available in late for the iPad A version of the Toy Box is also available for Windows PC These versions of the Toy Box utilized the web codes included with each Disney Infinity character br br br Physical elements br The Starter Pack edition of the game was bundled with three figurines and an Infinity Base The Infinity Base has two round spots to place figurines and a hexagonal spot to place world discs When the figurines are placed on the Infinity Base the characters are imported into the game while world discs unlock Play Sets br Power Discs are discs that can be placed on the Infinity Base along with their characters to add new elements to the game Players can use up to three environment enhancements Hexagonal Power Discs that can only be used in the Toy Box mode and up to two character enhancements Circular Power Discs per character The environment enhancements can alter the terrain change the background sky add new vehicles or add new weapons The character enhancements will alter things about the character such as damage done replenish health allow for faster experience gain for leveling and so on One Power Disc is included with the Starter Pack while additional discs are sold in blind bags each containing two discs br br br Alternate versions br Following a delay the PC version of Disney Infinity was released on November This version was available free of charge and could be downloaded from the Disney Infinity website It originally contained the game s Toy Box mode similar to the iPad version However a patch was released on February that added in all six Play Sets putting it on par with the console versions The game featured several changes from the console version however The game did not support the Infinity Base Instead characters were unlocked either by purchasing them from the Disney Infinity website at a discounted rate due to the lack of a physical figurine or by redeeming a web code card included with the physical figurines Since Power Discs do not come with web codes they had to be purchased from the PC Shop The game also did not support multiplayer though players could link up with the console version to share Toy Boxes between the two versions br Due to the space limitations of the Wii platform some design decisions had to be made in the game The gameplay does not have online play or multiplayer in Play Sets but there is multiplayer in Toy Box That means that there are smaller playset worlds and no downloadable or shareable Toy Box worlds Toy Box has six different worlds each with different toys and tools On August the Disney Infinity software was released as a free download for the North American Wii U eShop for the convenience of upgrading to the superior Wii U version for players who originally own the Wii Starter Pack although the Wii version is backwards compatible on Wii U The game s subsequent sequels Disney Infinity and Disney Infinity were not available for Wii br Different from the console and PC versions the Nintendo DS version of the game is a party game in which up to four players play on various themed game boards and participate in various minigames The Toy Box mode can be used to create new game boards This version uses its own Infinity Base which has only one character slot compared to the console version and connects to the DS wirelessly br br br Development br The idea for the game emerged out of Avalanche s previous work on the video game adaptation of Toy Story One of the more well received modes of the game was an open world section called The Toybox and the team set out to make a spiritual successor to the mode which would have been set at Star Command The team was challenged by Disney Interactive s new president John Pleasants who asked the developers What is the biggest idea you can think of at which point the team decided to switch from making a single game to making a platform that would use multiple IPs br br br Game Developers br br br Reception br br Disney Infinity received
