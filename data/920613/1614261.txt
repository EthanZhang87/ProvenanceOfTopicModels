help Toad keep the estate which is the pride of the community One summer day MacBadger asks Toad s best friends Water Rat and Mole to persuade him to give up his latest mania of recklessly driving around the countryside in a gypsy cart pulled by his horse Cyril which is accumulating financial liability in damaged property Rat and Mole confront Toad and unsuccessfully try to change his mind Toad then sees a motor car for the first time and is taken over by motor mania br To keep him out of trouble Rat and Mole lock Toad in his bedroom but he escapes and is soon charged with car theft At his trial Toad represents himself with Cyril as his first witness Cyril testifies that the car which Toad was accused of taking had been stolen by a gang of weasels Unaware of this Toad found weasels in a tavern and offered to buy the car from them but since he had no money he traded Toad Hall for the car The court shows disbelief at the statement so Toad calls Mr Winky the barman from the tavern to testify in his favor When Winky instead implicates Toad in trying to sell him the stolen car Toad is found guilty on the spot and sentenced to imprisonment in the Tower of London His friends try to appeal his case but to no avail br On Christmas Eve Cyril visits Toad and helps him escape by giving him a disguise Toad hijacks an engine from a railway station and heads to the riverbank where he hides in the Rat s house after escaping from the police MacBadger visits them to tell that the weasel gang has taken over Toad Hall with Winky as their leader confirming that Toad had indeed traded his estate for the stolen car To prove his innocence before the law Toad McBadger Rat and Mole sneak into the estate and narrowly manage to take the deed bearing Toad and Winky s signatures away from the weasels after a chase around Toad Hall br Toad is exonerated and regains his house but develops a mania for planes As MacBadger Rat and Mole celebrate the New Year s Day Toad and Cyril recklessly fly past on a Wright Flyer br br br The Legend of Sleepy Hollow br In the s Ichabod Crane arrives in Sleepy Hollow a small village outside Tarrytown New York to be the town s new schoolmaster Due to

falls in love with Katrina the daughter of the richest farmer in the town Baltus Van Tassel and Brom s unofficial fiancee Despite being obsessed with Katrina s beauty Ichabod mainly desires to take her family s money for himself Brom who has never been challenged before proceeds to compete badly and unfairly with the schoolmaster but Ichabod wins Katrina over at every opportunity Intrigued by this Katrina uses Ichabod to tease Brom making him jealous and angry br On Halloween both Ichabod and Brom are invited to the annual frolic at Van Tassel s house At the party Brom desperately tries to separate Ichabod and Katrina but all his attempts backfire During dinner Brom discovers that Ichabod is extremely superstitious and decides to scare him with the tale of the Headless Horseman Brom tells that the horseman travels through the woods every year on Halloween searching for a living head to replace the one he lost and the only way to escape from him is to cross a covered bridge at which point he will vanish Katrina and all the guests find the story amusing but Ichabod is intimidated br Riding home from the party Ichabod becomes frightened of every sound he hears His imagination begins to take over and heighten his fear and anxiety as he passes through the Hollow where the Headless Horseman is rumored to appear While traveling through the old European cemetery Ichabod believes he hears the sound of a unknown horse galloping toward him but discovers the sound is being made by nearby cattails bumping on a log He and his plow horse tired old Gunpowder begin to laugh but their laughter is cut short by the appearance of the real Headless Horseman who is mounted on a fiery black horse and carrying a jack o lantern Ichabod and Gunpowder run off with the Horseman in pursuit after being chased through the forest and nearly decapitated Ichabod remembering Brom s advice attempts to cross over the bridge but ends up turning back towards the Horseman where he is horrified to see that the Horseman truly has no head He finally rides across the covered bridge to stop the ghost s pursuit but as he looks back the Horseman stops and throws the jack o lantern which hits him with a crash br The next morning Ichabod s hat and the shattered pumpkin are found near the bridge with the schoolmaster himself nowhere to be found Rumors spread that Ichabod survived and

having received a copy from an English correspondent Roy O Disney acquired the rights to the novel during his European acquisition spree of properties for potential features in April but Walt was not interested finding the story awfully corny After reading the book story artist James Bodrero convinced him to put The Wind in the Willows into production which was originally intended to be a single narrative feature The first story meetings were held as early as in September with the film s production officially confirmed the following month Disney commissioned Mel Shaw to create the concept artwork and James Algar was appointed to direct the film Bodrero and fellow story artist Campbell Grant prepared first storyboards and a Leica reel which combined story sketches with rough dialogue performed by members of the animation staff The animation work had begun by April as animators and writers had come off from Bambi which was nearly complete The project was put on hold the following month due to the Disney animators strike although Shaw who was relatively indifferent to the politics of the situation continued to work on the film before leaving the Disney studio that summer to found a new animation studio with Hugh Harman br The Wind in the Willows was put back into production by October after the strike was settled At the same time Joseph Rosenberg of the Bank of America issued an ultimatum in which he would permit an absolute loan limit of million In return he ordered the Disney studio to restrict itself to producing animation shorts and to finish features already in production such as Dumbo and Bambi but no other feature film would begin work until they had been released and earned back their costs In response most of the studio s feature film productions were heavily scaled although The Wind in the Willows was kept in production as animation work had already begun After reviewing the animation footage a few weeks later Walt Disney decided to shelve the project feeling that the quality was too far below the standard necessary to be successful on the market Over feet of animation had been completed by that time By January The Wind in the Willows was officially put on hold br br br Return to production br The Wind in the Willows resumed production in October with Bodrero and Grant reattached and joined by Perce Pearce and Paul Gerard Smith It was the only feature that Bank of America allowed to proceed during World War II aside of Peter Pan Around this same time Walt Disney planned to combine The Wind in the Willows with either The Legend of Happy Valley which would later evolve into the Mickey and the Beanstalk segment for Fun and Fancy Free or The Gremlins an original story developed for Disney by Roald Dahl into a package film His brother Roy disapproved this idea calculating that the project would recoup its production costs only as a feature film The Wind in the Willows underwent additional story treatment by February but in general the film progressed slowly through production After finishing his military service in World War II Frank Thomas returned to the Disney studio in April and was assigned to direct additional footage alongside James Algar in hopes of salvaging the project Under Disney s orders the film was shortened down to a length of minutes br The Wind in the Willows was shelved again following layoffs in August with Bodrero and Grant leaving the studio while Thomas went on to work on Johnny Appleseed segment for Melody Time By October of that year the film was put back into production with Ward Kimball Jack Kinney Homer Brightman and Harry Reeves brought in to work out the pace and add more gags to the story In early Disney started production on an animated version of Washington Irving s short story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow which was to be co directed by Kinney and Clyde Geronimi Like The Wind in the Willows it was originally intended to be a feature film By November Disney decided to pair both productions into a singular package film titled Two Fabulous Characters as neither part was long enough to be a full length feature The project was scheduled to be released in late and was eventually renamed The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad br br br Casting br Most of the voices for The Wind in the Willows segment were recorded in before the United States entered World War II Claud Allister who had just recorded as Sir Giles for The Reluctant Dragon was cast as Water Rat Walt Disney considered Eric Blore for the role of Mr Toad as early as when the project was first announced Blore completed his recording sessions in a few days receiving about per day Story artist Campbell Grant provided the voice of Angus MacBadger for an early Leica reel and recorded the final dialogue for the character in The same reel featured John Dehner as the prosecuting attorney he was replaced by John McLeish in the final film Oliver Wallace the film s music director was cast as Mr Winky although several sources alternatively cite Alec Harford as the voice of the character br Gracie Fields originally signed on to narrate and sing in The Wind in the Willows segment in July although Charles Laughton was sought to provide narration for the segment by February The following month it was reported that Bing Crosby had signed on to narrate the Sleepy Hollow segment Basil Rathbone eventually signed on to provide narration for The Wind in the Willows segment br br br Songs br br br The Wind in the Willows br br br The Legend of Sleepy Hollow br br br Release br br The

Television airings br The Mr Toad segment of The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad was first screened on television in edited form as part of the inaugural season of the Disneyland anthology series on February under the title The Wind in the Willows It was paired with an edited version of Disney s The Reluctant Dragon due to the fact that both cartoons are based on stories by author Kenneth Grahame The Ichabod segment of the film had its television premiere during the following season of TV s Disneyland on October under the title The Legend of Sleepy Hollow Notably for this airing of Sleepy Hollow and subsequent reruns a new minute animated prologue was added recounting the life of Washington Irving the story s author This prologue has never been released on home media br The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was released on its own to theaters as a minute featurette in September This was the same edit presented on the Disneyland television series minus the minute prologue and the Walt Disney live action host segments Similarly in the Wind in the Willows segment of the original film was re released to theaters under the new title The Madcap Adventures of Mr Toad to accompany Disney s feature film Hot Lead and Cold Feet br The Legend of Sleepy Hollow had a subsequent television airing in truncated form as part of the TV specials Halloween Hall o Fame and Disney s Halloween Treat br Once it was split into two segments for airing on the Disneyland television series The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad was not available for viewing in its original form for many years thereafter but was instead screened as two individual items When first released on home video the segments retained their names from the Disneyland series The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and The Wind in the Willows respectively having taken their names from the original stories br Some of the scenes were cut when the segments were split up for home video release For example br br The Wind in the Willows br Part of the introduction was cut because of the new music added As a side effect most of the original audio for the introduction was synced incorrectly br The scene where Angus MacBadger confronts the angry townspeople who are suing Toad br The newspaper scene regarding Toad s disgrace was shortened by removing the newspaper articles of his friends attempts to reopen his case br When Toad realizes he is underwater after unknowingly jumping into a river to elude the police pursuing him there is a brief full body scene of Toad frantically trying to pull out the ball and chain he is shackled to out of the floor of the river br The Legend of Sleepy Hollow br The only thing that was cut was the introduction in the bookcases br br br Home media br The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad received its first complete home video release in the UK in and in the US in when it was released by Walt Disney Home Video on VHS and LaserDisc A subsequent complete release on VHS followed in as the last title in the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection line In it appeared on DVD for the first time as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection line br The theatrical version of The Legend of Sleepy

and Fancy Free on August It was also released as solely on Blu ray DVD and digital copy combo and a stand alone DVD exclusively to Walmart stores br The film was available to stream on Disney when the service launched on November br br br Reception br br br Critical response br A H Weiler of The New York Times praised the film saying that Mr Disney abetted by his staff such perfect narrators as Bing Crosby and Basil Rathbone and a pair of durable literary works has fashioned a conclave of cartoon creatures which by and large have the winsome qualities and charm of such noted creations as Mickey Mouse Dumbo et al Herman Schoenfeld of Variety felt the film ranks among the best full length cartoons turned out by the Walt Disney studios On The Wind in the Willows he commented that it has a subtle satirical edge on its comedy which will limit its appreciation to adult audiences The Irving legend however is treated with splashes of color and broad strokes of humor and violence that will appeal in a fundamental way to all age groups Together they comprise a solid package of varied entertainment br A review in Life magazine felt Disney s adaptation of The Wind in the Willows leaves out the poetry and most of the subtlety but it still has enough action for the children and wit enough for everybody It is deft and pleasant and throughout ironic and goodhearted Although the Ichabod part of Ichabod and Mr Toad is silly and bumbling Mr Toad s half is good enough to convince Disney admirers that the old master can still display the bounce and vitality he had before the war A review in Time magazine felt the film was an uneven doubleheader by Walt Disney who has combined into one film two dissimilar literary classics However they particularly praised The Wind in the Willows writing This lighthearted fast moving romp has inspired some of Disney s most inventive draftsmanship and satire They were less receptive to Sleepy Hollow writing it was Disney at his facile best The rest of the story dealing with quaint legendary people is flat and prosaic br Leonard Maltin writing in his book The Disney Films wrote that the film was one of Disney s most beguiling animated features The Wind in the Willows in particular has some of the finest work the studio ever did Altogether he claimed these sequences form a most engaging feature with as the saying goes something for everyone The half hour length seems ideal for each of the stories with neither a feeling of abruptness nor a hint of padding to reach that length And somehow the two tales seem to complement each other quite well providing an interesting contrast notable in style and execution and more obviously in the change of narrator M Faust of Common Sense Media gave the film five complete stars writing Two classic stories told in the best Disney style On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad has an approval rating of based on reviews with an average score of Its consensus states This Disney two fer may not be the most reverent literary adaptation but it s remarkably crafted and emotionally resonant On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of
