compartment This was a transitional step between traditional construction and the later fully unitized body chassis the body structure was also strengthened in the rocker panels and firewall However this frame was not as effective in protecting the interior structure in a side impact crash as a traditional perimeter frame br A coil spring suspension replaced the previous year s rear leaf springs

moved from the trunk lid to the door pillars br All Chevrolet vehicles featured a larger shock absorbing front bumper due to new federal mandates which required mile per hour km h impact protection New taillights were mounted in the still conventional rear bumper The convertible was moved upmarket to the Caprice Classic series Tweaks to the suspension and frame gave better roadability according to Chevrolet general manager John Z DeLorean Steering wheels and instrument panels were color keyed to interior colors as opposed to the matte black used in The steering wheel rim got a soft feel grip and replaced the Impala badge with generic Chevrolet The inline six cylinder engine was now offered on the Bel Air door sedan only and only with the speed manual transmission Interiors had repositioned front seats for more legroom The Impala name returned for the Kingswood station wagon Suspension and chassis design was modified for better roadability The bench front seat position was modified to fit tall drivers more comfortably shorter drivers found it less so br One thousand Impalas were built with an Air Cushion Restraint System ACRS that used an Oldsmobile instrument panel and unique steering wheel that contained both a driver and front passenger air bag They were all four door sedans painted in a special green gold color The system was not advertised in a big way and many of the cars were used for crash testing by both GM and the U S government Over the decades the system proved durable and successfully protected front passengers in front end collisions Chevrolet did not offer ACRS in however it was offered in Oldsmobile Buick and Cadillac models that year as an option and did save lives One ACRS equipped Impala was preserved and remains a witness to the ability of an American automaker to design life saving safety systems into cars without a government mandate Notably an ACRS equipped Impala was used on the television series Seinfeld as Kramer s personal vehicle No other examples are known as of this time br In the rear bumper was redesigned with shock absorbers to meet the upgraded standards and new tail lights were added The front end was also

two The rooflines of the Impala coupes were also revised For the Custom Coupe was no longer a hardtop with large fixed rear quarter glass and a thick B pillar The Sport Coupe still a pillar less hardtop now used larger roll down quarter glass like that of the Custom Coupe and had a narrower fastback style flat back window Sedans used carryover body shells from previous years In an unusual

available in This body style had been introduced for the model year a precursor to Detroit s complete abandonment of pillarless body styles before the end of the s Impalas used a previous year Caprice nose with a new egg crate grille insert The Impala had round headlamps while the Caprice used the new quad rectangular ones For fleet buyers Chevrolet offered a lower priced Impala S model that deleted some of the standard model s luxury features such as radial tires sound insulation and trunk light The S was available in both a door sedan and station wagon and effectively replaced the Bel Air for the U S market the Bel Air continued in production in Canada until br br br Sixth generation br br The changes in the automobile marketplace resulted in Chevrolet redesigning the Impala for the model year to meet changing demands It as well as the other downsized B body sedans went on sale in late September The new downsized Impalas were shorter in length taller and narrower than before The new Impala s frame was a shortened version of the one introduced in and would be used until when the B body production line was shut down Even with its trimmer exterior dimensions the new Impala featured increased headroom rear seat legroom and trunk space Production of the downsized model increased substantially over and the Impala regained the number one U S sales position The redesigned Impala Caprice was named Motor Trend s car of the year br Pillarless hardtops were discontinued the result of rumors of federal rollover standards looming in the near future The coupes sported a double bent tempered rear window similar to what was later used for the Chevrolet Monte Carlo Aerocoupe For the model year a mid cycle refresh replaced this complex backlight in the coupe with a more upright nearer flat glass although the overall design remained similar br Engine availability was reduced for the inline was reintroduced with hp kW Options included and cubic inch and L V engines The cubic inch L V engine was optional in some years Oldsmobile s cubic inch L V diesel engine also was available Starting in the inline was replaced by a cubic inch liter V from Chevrolet which was different from the liter cubic inch V from Buick that was installed in numerous GM models of different divisions br The Impala and the upscale Caprice sold well into the early s The Impala was reduced to the base model full size Chevrolet and was popular with fleet usage including taxi and police pursuit vehicles but had coupe and wagon body styles dropped after and was eliminated in while the Caprice continued unchanged until Upon the demise of the Impala name the base model full size Chevrolet was rebranded Caprice starting in with the upper models being called the Caprice Classic and Caprice Classic Brougham br In some model years these vehicles were also assembled in Southgate CA and St Louis MO br Production Figures br br br Seventh generation Impala SS br br In January the GM B platform s body was redesigned for the model year though it retained the same shortened frame design of the model year redesign The Impala SS badge was resurrected at the Detroit Auto Show as a concept car designed by GM designer Jon Moss The concept car was two inches lower to the ground than the regular Caprice and was powered by an liter cu in engine Eventually the concept car s engine was replaced with a detuned liter cu in LT V engine derived from the fourth generation Corvette br The Impala SS went into production on February at GM s plant in Arlington Texas and was almost identical cosmetically to the concept car with the only noticeable change being the chromed bowtie logo on the grill vs a red logo on the concept The car was in essence a high performance version of the Caprice heavily based on the Caprice C police package As such it got much of the equipment formerly available only to law enforcement and government agencies This included a sport tuned suspension with reinforced shocks and springs a high capacity reverse flow cooling system derived from the Corvette s LT four wheel disc brakes transmission cooler dual exhaust a higher output electrical system and other minor mechanical and electrical alterations The Impala SS did not receive the C s external oil to air engine oil cooler nor were all the body mounts secured the standard Caprice and Impala SS were assembled at the factory with the front three body mounts missing one of the rubber cushions while the C was assembled with all rubber cushions in place br The Impala SS was fitted with a standard gear The limited slip rear differential was standard as opposed to the optional G on Caprices and the suspension was an inch lower A retuned LT liter cu in small block V was standard on the Impala SS making hp kW PS and lb ft N m of torque retuned from the prototype s hp kW PS rating The primary difference between the LT in the Impala and the LT that was in the Corvette and Camaro was that the Impala engine was fitted with cast iron cylinder heads instead of aluminum ones and a camshaft that was designed more for low end torque than high end horsepower Another difference was that the block casting for the Impala LT had two bolt main bearing caps while the casting used for the Corvette LT had four bolt main bearing caps The transmission was the L E which was an electronically controlled version of the previously hydraulically controlled L However the transmission was not upgraded up for the power of the LT nor the extra weight of the body and frame and transmission failures after miles km were commonplace br The Impala SS received body colored trim a unique single bar grille with no hood ornament and a rear deck spoiler It was fitted with inch mm brushed aluminum wheels with ZR all season tires Inside the car came with a central console with cup holders and models and a storage compartment leather seats embroidered with the Impala SS logo and a standard leather wrapped steering wheel For the model year it was available only in black with a gray interior Due to a shortage of the unique five spoke aluminum wheels only cars were sold However the wheel shortage was remedied for the model year and cars were sold br In Dark Cherry Metallic and Dark Grey Green were added as exterior color options and the body paneling on the rear quarter panel was altered to reflect the cosmetic effect formerly achieved by a window insert The black units continued to receive semi gloss door moldings and wheel well trim whereas the other color offerings received those items in full gloss Another change from was the placement of the side mirrors from pods attached to the door to a larger format attached to the A pillar was the last year of production with units sold The Impala SS was also exported to the Middle East as the Caprice SS with the car being identical to its American counterpart except for the side fonts on the rear quarter panel and the badge on the dashboard saying Caprice SS The Impala SS production went late into the model year the last one being produced on December Marblehead Gray Metallic had been planned for that final year however the option was cancelled at the last minute even though many trim part numbers for the color had already been designated The last year saw minor interior alterations with the digital speedometer being replaced by an analog one along with a tachometer The shifter was moved from the column to the center console and the engine was given an OBD II computer control system the camshaft was reground to adjust for the new computer br br br Discontinuation br The entire B body line consisting of the Chevrolet Caprice Impala SS and Buick Roadmaster as well as the related D Body Fleetwood was discontinued as GM wanted more assembly lines to be able to produce more profitable SUVs A ceremony was held at the plant on December as the last Impala SS was produced br br br Eighth generation br br The Impala name was revived for the model year being introduced on April With a wheelbase three inches longer though an inch shorter overall than the mid size Lumina the new Chevrolet Impala was categorized as full size by cars com but mid size by Consumer Guide Automotive Based on the Lumina s W body platform it was built at Oshawa Car Assembly in Oshawa Ontario Canada Unlike the earlier Impalas built on a B body this one was front wheel drive and was available with a choice of two engines the L V engine and the slightly smaller L V engine A new Impala SS with a supercharged L

model s time also showing seconds albeit seconds on average To commemorate Chevrolet s long relationship with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indianapolis race a limited edition produced Impala Indy SS was offered in notably featuring a black grille with gold Chevrolet bowtie emblem that would be carried over to all Impala models in various Indy logos on the exterior and interior inch chrome wheels and gauge cluster package br br br Impala C and C eighth generation br br Also released with this version was the C Police Package first released in as well as the C Undercover Police

seats It also offered preparation for a criminal cage to be installed between the front and rear seats It was only available in a few basic colors Another addition was the SURV MODE switch that replaced the fog light switch found on the LS This enabled the driver to turn off all lights in the vehicle and hide something not allowed with the civilian models as automatic headlights were standard The C was comparably equipped to the C but the ability to add other convenience options and more paint and interior choices set the C apart br Sales for the Impala C and C were strong with law enforcement and they were especially popular with large city fleets such as the NYPD and Philadelphia Police Department However the Ford Crown Victoria P still held the sales lead and was preferred by most agencies due to its larger size much more durable V engine rear wheel drive layout and body on frame platform br br br Engines br br br Ninth generation br br br br The Impala was

beginning with the model year GM made some minor structural enhancements to the Impala beginning in December models produced after that received a Good in the IIHS frontal offset crash test br In September a local news station s investigative team in Rhode Island discovered that GM s fleet customers who purchased the Impala were able to order them with the side curtain airbags deleted for a savings of per vehicle Because these fleets typically sell off their cars after two to three years of use many of the Impalas that were built without side curtain airbags became privately owned cars Current owners may be able to tell if their car has side airbags by checking the VIN and or by checking to see if air bag is printed on the roof support between the front and back rows br Another potential safety hazard affecting Impalas of model years and is premature rear tire wear caused by defective rear suspension components Police vehicles were upgraded to correct this defect and law enforcement agencies were compensated for expenses incurred for tire replacement but civilian vehicles were not recalled As a result Impala owners launched a class action lawsuit in July against General Motors In response the current General Motors leadership claimed about a month later that they were not responsible to repair the defective vehicles manufactured pre General Motors bailout

concerns relating to the sedan s emergency braking system This followed the NHTSA receiving a complaint from a driver who experienced inappropriate activation of the emergency braking system adding it alleges that the driver assist system inappropriately activated emergency braking bringing the vehicle to a complete stop under what the driver considered to be full braking force The driver also went
