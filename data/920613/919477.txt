predators such as Carnotaurus br The initial idea was conceived in by Phil Tippett and Paul Verhoeven which they conceived as a darker naturalistic film about dinosaurs The project underwent numerous iterations with multiple directors attached In Walt Disney Feature Animation began development on the project and spent several years developing the software to create the dinosaurs The characters in Dinosaur are computer generated However most of the backgrounds are live action and were filmed on location A number of backgrounds were found in various continents such as the Americas and Asia various tepuis and Angel Falls also appear in the film With a budget of million Dinosaur was reportedly the most expensive computer animated film at the time Dinosaur is also the first film from Walt Disney Feature Animation to be D animated br Dinosaur was released on May to generally positive reviews from critics who praised the film s opening sequence soundtrack and animation but criticized the story for its lack of originality The film grossed million worldwide becoming the fifth highest grossing film of It became the fourth best selling home video release of selling million copies and garnering million in sales br br br Plot br A Carnotaurus hunts a herd of dinosaurs destroys an Iguanodon nest and kills a Pachyrhinosaurus The lone surviving Iguanodon egg is stolen by an Oviraptor and after a series of mishaps arrives at an island inhabited by prehistoric lemurs Plio the daughter of lemur patriarch Yar names the newly hatched baby Aladar and raises him alongside her daughter Suri despite Yar s initial objections br Several years later a fully grown Aladar watches the lemurs take part in a mating ritual in which Plio s awkward teenage brother Zini fails to find a female Moments after the ritual ends they are interrupted by a meteor crashing into the Earth creating an explosive shockwave that destroys the island Aladar and Yar s family flee across the sea to the mainland Being the only survivors they mourn their losses before journeying inland br While crossing the burnt desert left by the meteor the group is attacked by a pack of Velociraptors They escape by joining a multi species herd of dinosaur refugees heading for the communal Nesting Grounds Falling afoul of callous Iguanodon herd leader Kron they retreat to the end of the line and befriend the old Styracosaurus Eema her pet Euoplocephalus Url and her equally elderly friend Baylene a Brachiosaurus The herd travels for days without water to the site of a lake only to find it seemingly dried up Kron orders the herd to move on and let the weakest perish but Aladar stays behind with a struggling Eema He and Baylene dig until they reach the water table The rest of the herd follows suit and Kron s sister Neera impressed by Aladar s compassion begins to grow closer to him However Kron sees Aladar s increasing popularity as a threat br Meanwhile two Carnotaurus have been tracking the herd and ambush a scouting party led by Kron s lieutenant Bruton Surviving the attack a badly wounded Bruton warns of the approaching predators Ushering the herd away from the lake Kron deliberately leaves Aladar the lemurs the elderly dinosaurs and the injured Bruton behind hoping that they will slow their pursuers down The abandoned group takes shelter in a cave when a rainstorm begins but the Carnotaurus find them during the night and attack Fending off the attacking predators Bruton sacrifices himself to cause a cave in that kills one of the Carnotaurus forcing the survivor to retreat br The group ventures deeper into the cave but they reach a dead end causing Aladar to briefly lose hope Baylene reproaches him for giving up and uses her strength to smash through the wall revealing the intact Nesting Grounds on the other side While the group briefly celebrates Eema notices that a landslide has collapsed the usual entrance into the valley Aladar rushes off to warn Kron who is attempting to force the herd to climb the rubble unaware of the sheer drop on the other side Kron sees the warning as a challenge for the position of herd leader and attacks Aladar until Neera joins the fight on Aladar s behalf She and the herd leave with Aladar but Kron does not follow br The surviving Carnotaurus arrives on the scene Aladar rallies the herd to stand together against it forcing the outnumbered Carnotaurus to back off The predator then notices Kron trying to climb the rocks alone and attacks him instead Aladar and Neera rush to Kron s aid but fail to arrive in time to save him Aladar manages to push the Carnotaurus towards the edge of the drop where the ground gives way causing the Carnotaurus to fall to its death Aladar and Neera mourn Kron then lead the herd to the Nesting Grounds Some time later a new generation of dinosaurs hatches among them Aladar and Neera s children and the lemurs find more of their own kind br br br Voice cast br D B Sweeney as Aladar a

br Production br br br Development br br After founding his own namesake studio special effects artist Phil Tippett directed Prehistoric Beast an experimental animated short film in which a Centrosaurus is stalked by a Tyrannosaurus Tippett s skill at creating go motion animated creatures led to the CBS animated documentary Dinosaur A year later Tippett was hired to work on the special effects team for RoboCop During filming in December Tippett recalled When Jon Davison and I were shooting the live action plates where ED falls down the stairs there was some kind of delay Peter Weller s shoes didn t fit so we had to wait for someone to get the right stunt shoes Frustrated by the delay Tippett suggested to Paul Verhoeven that they should produce a dinosaur picture That way according to Tippett w e wouldn t have to be held up by actors in robot outfits br Verhoeven was excited at the idea and suggested an approach inspired by Shane in which you follow a lead character through a number of situations and moving from a devastated landscape into a promised land Veteran screenwriter Walon Green was then brought on to write the script Verhoeven and Tippett had planned to use stop motion animation techniques such as puppets scale models and miniatures br The film was originally going to be much darker and violent in tone in a style akin to a nature documentary The film s original main protagonist was a Styracosaurus named Woot and the main antagonist was a Tyrannosaurus rex named Grozni with a small mammal named Suri as a supporting character After Woot defeats Grozni in a final fight the film would end with the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event which would ultimately result in the death of the dinosaurs Verhoeven then storyboarded two key sequences and calculated the project s preliminary budget to be million Verhoeven pitched the project to then Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg who gave a counteroffer of million because in Verhoeven s words Katzenberg felt there wasn t enough of an audience to justify that cost The budget disputes led to Verhoeven and Tippett s departure from the project br In before Verhoeven and Tippett had departed the project producer director Thomas G Smith became involved in the film but briefly became the director after they had left Reflecting on his tenure Smith said Jeanne Rosenberg was still writing the script but it was in trouble Disney wanted a cute story of dinosaurs talking and I didn t like the idea I thought it should be more like Jean Annaud s The Bear I wanted to have actual lemurs in it They actually existed at the time of dinosaurs We actually located a guy who trains them However Katzenberg called Smith to help on Honey I Blew Up the Kid in which he was replaced by David W Allen who had just finished directing Puppet Master II Multiple months were spent filming actual lemurs to portray Suri and creating visual development but Allen s version also fell into development hell Smith stated The thing that ultimately killed it is that Disney knew that Jurassic Park was coming along pretty well and they knew it was being done digitally They figured Well maybe we should wait until we can do it digitally br In late Walt Disney Feature Animation began development on the project and they began shooting various tests placing computer generated characters in miniature model backdrops The idea to use computer generated backgrounds was considered but rejected after the earliest proof of concept animation test was completed in March Ultimately the filmmakers decided to take the unprecedented route of combining live action scenery with computer generated character animation The filmmakers then approached then Disney CEO Michael Eisner about not knowing how much the project would cost or how long it would take to finish but that they could fully complete it Trusting the filmmakers Eisner decided to green light the project However at his insistence it was decided early on that the dinosaurs would talk during the film To accommodate this change Aladar would be given lips in contrast to actual Iguanodons who were duck billed br George Scribner was selected as the director and he was later teamed with Ralph Zondag as co director Storyboard artist Floyd Norman stated that Scribner envisioned the film to be more than just a struggle for survival He wanted this dinosaur movie to have elements of fun and humor Our director wanted to explore the fun elements of dinosaurs such as their size shape and texture George also knew that since dinosaurs come in all sizes what wacky relationships might I come up with What funny situations might plague a critter of such massive size br Scribner left the project to work at Walt Disney Imagineering and Eric Leighton was brought in as co director The new script had an Iguanodon named Noah as the protagonist wandering with his grandparents and a lemur companion named Adam and a group of Carnotaurus as well as a rival Iguanodon named Cain playing the antagonists The story dealt with Noah who had the ability to see visions of the future foreseeing the coming of an asteroid and struggling to guide a herd of other dinosaurs to safety Further into production Noah Cain and Adam were renamed Aladar Kron and Zini and certain aspects of the story were altered further into what was later seen in the final product br br br Animation br br On April the Walt Disney Company announced they had acquired the visual effects studio Dream Quest Images The studio was merged with the Feature Animation department s Computer Graphics Unit in order to form The Secret Lab Vision Crew Unlimited provided the live action visual effects At the time the Secret Lab s initial studio was reconstructed from a former Lockheed Martin former Lockheed building in Burbank California Most of the computers were used from Silicon Graphics and additional machines were installed to create a render farm in order to provide workstations for artists software engineers and technical directors The production team eventually re located to the Feature Animation s Northside building in January and animation officially began eight months later although some preliminary work had already begun br To ensure realistic CG animation D workbooks were created using Softimage D software animators worked on the film using computer processors to animate the film Having aspired to be a paleontologist David Krentz supervised the character design and visual development teams He had an orthographic view of the dinosaurs and his character designs were drawn on paper and scanned into the PowerAnimator software for the modelers to rig in the computers In the character animation department the dinosaur characters were first visualized in the computer in skeletal form The rough character animations were then transferred into three software programs to strengthen the visuals of the characters The programs were Fur Tool which was used for the lemurs and to create feathers and grass Body Builder which was used to create skin and muscles for the dinosaurs and Mug Shot a shape blender that works within Alias Maya for facial animation and lip synching br Headed by David Womersley live action photography units shot on actual jungle beach and desert locations including California Florida Hawaii Australia Jordan Venezuela and Samoa In total two live action film crews shot more than feet m of film although one scene which takes place inside a cave utilized a computer generated background In order to approximate a dinosaur s perspective visual effects supervisor Neil Krepela invented the Dino cam in which a camera was rigged on a cable suspended between two foot m tall towers The computer controlled camera allowed for panning and tilting on degrees and moved at up to miles km per hour across a span of feet m With the live action elements shot and the character animation reaching completion the footage was moved into the Scene Finaling department Under Jim Hillin the effects compositing team blended percent of the live action plates against the computer animated characters The lighting department then adjusted the final lighting of the shots by changing the lighting conditions and replacing the skies br br br Filming accident br On February while filming live action footage in Poison Canyon near Trona San Bernardino County California a crew member was killed and another seriously wounded when a camera boom struck a cross country power line Disney was sued by the surviving crew member and the deceased s family and the company was later fined for violating worker safety laws br br br Music br br The film s score was composed by James Newton Howard with choral directing by Lebo M who did vocals for The Lion King In September it was reported that pop singer songwriter Kate Bush had written and recorded a song for the film to be used in the scene in which Aladar and his family mourn the destruction of their island Reportedly preview audiences did not respond well to the song The producers recommended that Bush rewrite it but she refused Ultimately due to complications the track was not included on the soundtrack br The soundtrack album was released on May by Walt Disney Records Howard would later compose the scores for the Disney animated features Atlantis The Lost Empire Treasure Planet and Raya and the Last Dragon One track The Egg Travels was heard in many trailers following the film s release including Lilo Stitch The Wild Thornberrys Movie and Around the World in Days br While the film got mixed reviews from critics the film score received universally positive critical reception with critics singling out The Egg Travels in particular as one of the best For his work James Newton Howard was nominated for an Annie Award for Music in a Feature Production and Saturn Award for Best Music br br br Release br The film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on May In conjunction during its theatrical release the film was accompanied by an exclusive interactive dinosaur exhibit center adjacent to the El Capitan Theatre titled The Dinosaur Experience It received a PG rating from the Motion Picture Association of America due to intense images br br br Marketing br Similar to the promotional marketing of The Lion King Disney began the

video release of Tarzan and the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection DVD release of The Aristocats A second trailer was later released in March and attached to the theatrical release to DreamWorks Animation s The Road to El Dorado br To promote the release of Dinosaur the Animal Kingdom theme park ride Countdown to Extinction was renamed after the film and its plot which had always prominently featured a Carnotaurus and an Iguanodon was mildly altered so that the Iguanodon is specifically meant to be Aladar the film s protagonist and the plot of the ride is now about the riders traveling through time to a point just before the impact of the meteor that caused the extinction of the non avian dinosaurs to bring Aladar back to the present and save his life A Dinosaur Jubilee was held at

critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four praising the film s amazing visuals but criticizing the decision to make the animals talk which he felt canceled out the effort to make the film so realistic Ebert wrote An enormous effort had been spent on making these dinosaurs seem real and then an even greater effort was spent on undermining the illusion On the syndicated television series Roger Ebert the Movies the film received two thumbs up with guest host Michaela Pereira from ZDTV s Internet Tonight additionally praising the vocal performances for the characters Todd McCarthy of Variety called it an eye popping visual spectacle but later wrote somewhere around half way through you begin to get used to the film s pictorial wondrousness to take it for granted even and start to realize that the characters and story are exceedingly mundane unsurprising and pre programmed A O Scott reviewing for The New York Times praised the opening sequence as a visual and sonic extravaganza that the rest of the movie never quite lives up to Those scores of animators and technical advisers have conjured a teeming pre human world and the first minutes of the film present it in a swooping eye filling panorama Summarizing the review he later wrote that t he reason to see this movie is not to listen to the dinosaurs but to watch them move to marvel at their graceful necks and clumsy limbs and notice how convincingly they emerge into sunlight or get wet br Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film astonishes and disheartens as only the most elaborate most ambitious Hollywood products can A technical amazement that points computer generated animation toward the brightest of futures it s also cartoonish in the worst way the prisoner of pedestrian plot points and childish too cute dialogue Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune wrote The action is easy enough to follow and the screen is never dull But for a story that takes place some million years ago Dinosaur is awfully reliant on recent recycled parts Desson Howe reviewing for The Washington Post felt the movie was somewhat derivative and lacked a narrative arc and claimed it was too similar to The Land Before Time br br br Accolades br br br See also br List
