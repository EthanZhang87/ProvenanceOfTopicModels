additional voices br br br Production br A Goofy Movie is based on Goof Troop an animated Disney Afternoon show created by Robert Taylor and Michael Peraza Jr that centered around Goofy and his son Max When considering ideas for a TV special Disney decided to produce a theatrical film based on the show contracting Jymn Magon to write a feature length script starring Goofy The filmmakers chose to age up Max who was shown as a young child in Goof Troop setting the film several years later and putting him in high school The movie was the feature film directorial debut for Disney story artist and animator Kevin Lima who went on to direct the Disney films Tarzan Dalmatians and Enchanted In Lima said that Instead of just keeping Goofy one dimensional as he s been in the past we wanted to give an emotional side that would add to the emotional arc of the story We wanted the audience to see his feelings instead of just his antics Magon stated that the father son dynamic of the film was inspired by a story from then Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg in which he and his daughter with whom he had an estranged relationship at the time went on a road trip together during which they bonded and their relationship considerably improved br While the work was a Disney production it was considered far less essential than the studio s mainstream works at the time such as The Lion King and was given a far smaller budget compared to these films Thus A Goofy Movie was jointly produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation Walt Disney Television Animation and Disney MovieToons and with outsourcing to Walt Disney Animation France and Walt Disney Animation Australia along with additional Disney animation studios in Spain and Canada Pre production was done at the main Feature Animation studio in Burbank California starting as early as mid The animation work was done at Walt Disney Animation France in Paris supervised by Paul and Ga tan Brizzi with additional scenes animated at Disney s studio in Sydney Australia under the direction of Steve Moore and clean up work done at the main Burbank studio Additional clean up animation was done by Phoenix Animation Studios in Canada

Troop as the character s voice actor Alternatively Aaron Lohr did Max s singing voice Other cast members included Kellie Martin as Roxanne Jenna von O as Stacey and Pauly Shore as Bobby Zimuruski Farmer who spent days recording dialogue over the span of two and a half years was initially asked by Katzenberg to give Goofy a regular speaking voice as opposed to the character s signature cartoonish voice much to the confusion of Farmer who insisted that audiences wanted to hear the Goofy they were all familiar with After recording lines in this manner for a week and a half according to Farmer Michael Eisner and Roy E Disney told Farmer to speak in Goofy s original voice after which the dialogue was rerecorded as such Farmer stated that he used a mental image of his five year old son at the time in order to fully embrace his role as a loving father Magon named Principal Mazur after his own high school principal The character of Powerline was heavily inspired by real life pop stars including Michael Jackson Prince and Bobby Brown R B artist Tevin Campbell provided the singing voice for Powerline recording the songs Stand Out and I I Campbell recorded the songs in front of a green screen while performing his own choreography The film is dedicated to Pat Buttram who voiced the emcee at the possum park as he died after finishing his voice work for the film br br br Music

to rework his score rather than write a completely new one Burwell later wrote My score had relied somewhat on unusual instrumentation banjo percussion and choir for example and Disney wanted the sweeping scale and familiar affect of symphonic score Davis is credited with additional music on the movie and the soundtrack album The songs I I and Stand Out were performed by R B singer Tevin Campbell while After Today On the Open Road and Nobody Else But You were performed by Bill Farmer and Aaron Lohr The soundtrack album for A Goofy Movie was released by Walt Disney Records on March
