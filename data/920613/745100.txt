Disney Animation Studios in the early s Joe Ranft tried to convince the staff to produce a film based on Roald Dahl s James and the Giant Peach a book that enamored him with its liberating material ever since he first read it in third grade However Disney refused for reasons of a potentially expensive and difficult animation process and the source material s weird subject matter Among the animators exposed to the book by Ranft was Henry Selick while he enjoyed the book and thought about adapting it to screen for several years he understood the obstacles doing so such as the source material s dreamy nature episodic structure and the reputation of other Dahl books being so agitational some parts of the world banned them br Felicity Dahl Roald s widow and executor of his estate began offering film rights to the book in the summer in among those interested included Steven Spielberg and Danny DeVito br Walt Disney Pictures acquired the film rights to the book from the Dahl estate in Brian Rosen was hired as producer by Disney for his experience in animated projects like FernGully The Last Rainforest and live action films such as Mushrooms br Dennis Potter was hired to write a draft Rosen described it as slightly black and bizarre a tone Disney did not approve of particularly with the sharks being Nazis Once Potter died Karey Kirkpatrick and Bruce Joel Rubin came in to write separate drafts of which Kirkpatrick s was chosen Unlike the novel James s aunts are not killed by the rolling peach though his parents deaths occur as in the novel but follow him to New York The character Silkworm was removed to not overload on the amount of characters to animate in the book her purpose was limited to what Miss Spider did in the film which was to attach the peach to several seagulls during the shark chase br To write four songs for the movie Selick approached Elvis Costello who showed an interest in doing the film Unfortunately Disney s music division showed no interest in Costello Their alarms just went off and they said No that s too weird said Selick Disney suggested Randy Newman as an alternative I didn t want to use Randy said Selick only because John Lasseter was already using him for Toy Story Andy Partridge the main songwriter from the rock group XTC originally wrote four songs for the film All I Dream Of Is A Friend Don t Let Us Bug Ya Stinking Rich Song and Everything Will Be All Right one of which was very beautiful said Selick but was replaced by Randy Newman due to creative differences between Selick and Disney regarding the choice of soundtrack composer and the fact that Disney wanted to own the copyright to the songs for perpetuity br Before the start of production Disney and Selick debated on whether the film should be live action or stop motion animated the company skeptical of the stop motion solution Selick had originally planned James to be a live actor through the entire film then later considered doing the whole film in stop motion but ultimately settled on entirely live action and entirely stop motion sequences to keep lower costs The film begins with minutes of live action but becomes stop motion animation after James enters the peach and then live action again when James arrives in New York City although the arthropod characters remained in stop motion Like The Wizard of Oz the color palette changes when James enters the Peach to indicate he has entered a magical setting from greys and greens to vibrant colors br Filming began on November with the live action scenes wrapping on December of that year and the stop motion scenes continuing until January br br br Songs br br br Release br The film was theatrically released on April br Disney released the film worldwide except for a few countries
