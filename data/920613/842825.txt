The Iron Giant is a American animated science fiction film produced by Warner Bros Feature Animation and directed by Brad Bird in his directorial debut It is based on the novel The Iron Man by Ted Hughes which was published in the United States as The Iron Giant and was written by Tim McCanlies from a story treatment by Bird The film stars the voices of Jennifer Aniston Harry Connick Jr Vin Diesel James Gammon Cloris Leachman John Mahoney Eli Marienthal Christopher McDonald and M Emmet Walsh Set during the Cold War in the film centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes who discovers and befriends a giant alien robot With the help of a beatnik artist named Dean McCoppin Hogarth attempts to prevent the U S military and Kent Mansley a paranoid federal agent from finding and destroying the Giant br The film s development began in as a musical with the involvement of the Who s Pete Townshend though the project took root once Bird signed on as director and hired McCanlies to write the screenplay in The film was animated using traditional animation with computer generated imagery used to animate the Iron Giant and other effects The understaffed crew of the film completed it with half of the time and budget of other animated features Michael Kamen composed the film s score which was performed by the Czech Philharmonic br The Iron Giant premiered at Mann s Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on July and was released in the United States on August The film significantly underperformed at the box office grossing million worldwide against a production budget of million which was attributed to Warner Bros lack of marketing and skepticism towards animated film production following the box office failure of Quest for Camelot in the preceding year Despite this the film was praised for its story animation musical score characters the portrayal of the title character and the voice performances of Aniston Connick Diesel Mahoney Marienthal and McDonald The film was nominated for several awards winning nine Annie Awards out of nominations Through home video releases and television syndication the film gathered a cult following and is widely regarded as a modern animated classic and one of the greatest animated films ever made In an extended remastered version of the film was re released theatrically and on home video the following year br br In October during the Cold War an object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of Maine and then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell br The following night nine year old Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds the object a foot tall alien robot he runs away but then returns to save the robot when he gets electrocuted while trying to eat the transmission lines of an electrical substation Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant finding him docile and curious When he eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train the train collides with him and derails Hogarth leads the Giant away from the area discovering that he can self repair While there Hogarth shows the Giant comic books and compares him to the hero Superman br The incidents lead paranoid U S government agent Kent Mansley to Rockwell He suspects Hogarth s involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother Annie and rents a room in their house to keep an eye on him Hogarth evades Mansley and leads the Giant to a junkyard owned by beatnik artist Dean McCoppin who reluctantly agrees to keep him Hogarth enjoys his time with the Giant but is compelled to explain the concept of death to the Giant after he witnesses hunters killing a deer br Hogarth is interrogated by Mansley when he discovers evidence of the Giant after finding a photo of him next to Hogarth and summons a U S Army contingent led by General Shannon Rogard to the scrapyard to prove the Giant s existence but Dean having been warned by Hogarth earlier tricks them by pretending that the Giant is one of his art pieces Later while playing with a toy gun Hogarth inadvertently activates the Giant s defensive system firing a laser beam in the process Dean yells at him for nearly killing Hogarth and the saddened Giant runs away with Hogarth giving chase Dean realizes that the Giant was only acting in self defense and catches up to Hogarth as they follow the Giant br The Giant rescues two boys falling from a roof when he arrives winning over the townspeople Mansley spots the Giant in the town while leaving Rockwell and has the Army attack the Giant after he has picked up Hogarth forcing the two to flee They initially evade the military by using the Giant s flight system but the Giant is shot down and crashes to the ground br Hogarth is knocked unconscious but the Giant assumes that Hogarth is dead and in a fit of rage and grief transforms into a war machine and returns to Rockwell Mansley convinces Rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the USS Nautilus as conventional weapons prove to be ineffective Hogarth awakens and returns in time to calm the Giant while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard br Rogard is ready to stand down and order the Nautilus to deactivate its primed nuke but a panicked Mansley snatches Rogard s radio and orders the missile launch The missile is targeted to hit Rockwell where it will destroy the town upon impact in the resulting nuclear detonation Mansley attempts to escape but the Giant intervenes and Rogard has Mansley arrested To save the town the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile As he soars into the missile s path the Giant remembers Hogarth s words You are who you choose to be smiles contentedly and declares himself Superman as he collides with the weapon The missile explodes in the atmosphere saving Rockwell its population and the military forces nearby while the Giant is presumably destroyed leaving Hogarth Dean Annie and Rogard devastated br Months later Dean and Annie now a couple have a chat at a memorial of the Giant made by Dean standing in Rockwell Hogarth is given a package from Rogard containing a screw from the Giant which is the only remnant found That night Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and remembering the Giant s ability to self repair happily allows the screw to leave br The screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant s head on the Langj kull glacier in Iceland and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself br br Eli Marienthal as Hogarth Hughes an intelligent curious energetic and courageous year old boy with an active imagination Marienthal s performances were videotaped and given to animators to work with which helped develop expressions and acting for the character He is named after author Ted Hughes who wrote the book that inspired the film and artist Burne Hogarth br Jennifer Aniston as Annie Hughes Hogarth s mother the widow of a military pilot and a diner waitress br Harry Connick Jr as Dean McCoppin a beatnik artist and junkyard owner Bird felt it appropriate to make the character a member of the Beat Generation as they were viewed as mildly threatening to small town values during that time An outsider himself he is among the first to recognize the Giant as no threat br Vin Diesel as the Iron Giant a ft metal eating robot Of unknown origin and created for an unknown purpose the Giant involuntarily reacts defensively if he recognizes anything as a weapon immediately attempting to destroy it The Giant s voice was originally going to be electronically modulated but the filmmakers decided they needed a deep resonant and expressive voice to start with so they hired Diesel br James Gammon as Foreman Marv Loach a power station employee who follows the robot s trail after it destroys the station br Gammon also voices Floyd Turbeaux a farmer and friend of Earl Stutz br Cloris Leachman as Karen Tensedge Hogarth s fourth grade teacher at Redford Elementary School br Christopher McDonald as Kent Mansley a paranoid federal government agent sent to investigate sightings of the Iron Giant The logo on his official government car says he is from the Bureau of Unexplained Phenomena br John Mahoney as General Shannon Rogard an experienced and level headed military leader in Washington D C Mansley s superior at the Bureau of Unexplained Phenomena who goes from merely being annoyed and exasperated with Mansley to openly despising him br M Emmet Walsh as Earl Stutz a sailor and the first man to see the Giant br In addition Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas voice the train s engineers briefly seen near the start of the film Johnston and Thomas who were animators and members of Disney s Nine Old Men were cited by Bird as inspirations for his career which he honored by incorporating their voices likenesses and first names into the film br br The origins of the film lie in the book The Iron Man by poet Ted Hughes who wrote the novel for his children to comfort them in the wake of their mother Sylvia Plath s suicide In the s rock musician Pete Townshend chose to adapt the book for a concept album it was released as The Iron Man A Musical in In Richard Bazley who later became the film s lead animator pitched a version of The Iron Man to Don Bluth while working at his studio in Ireland He created a story outline and character designs but Bluth passed on the project After a stage musical was mounted in London Des McAnuff who had adapted Tommy with Townshend for the stage believed that The Iron Man could translate to the screen and the project was ultimately acquired by Warner Bros Entertainment br In late while developing the project on its way through the studio saw the film as a perfect vehicle for Brad Bird who at the time was working for Turner Feature Animation developing Ray Gunn Turner Broadcasting had recently merged with Warner Bros parent company Time Warner and Bird was allowed to transfer to the Warner Bros Animation studio to direct The Iron Giant After reading the original Iron Man book by Hughes Bird was impressed with the mythology of the story and in addition was given an unusual amount of creative control by Warner Bros This creative control involved introducing two new characters not present in the original book Dean and Kent setting the film in America and discarding Townshend s musical ambitions who did not care either way reportedly remarking Well whatever I got paid Bird would expand upon his desire to set the film in America in the s in a later interview br br The Maine setting looks Norman Rockwell idyllic on the outside but inside everything is just about to boil over everyone was scared of the bomb the Russians Sputnik even rock and roll This clenched Ward Cleaver smile masking fear which is really what the Kent character was all about It was the perfect environment to drop a foot tall robot into br Ted Hughes the original story s author died before the film s release His daughter Frieda Hughes saw the finished film on his behalf and loved it Townshend who stayed on as the film s executive producer enjoyed the final film as well br br Tim McCanlies was hired to write the script though Bird was somewhat displeased with having another writer on board as he wanted to write the screenplay himself He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies then unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions In Bird s original story treatment America and the USSR were at war at the end with the Giant dying McCanlies decided to have a brief scene displaying his survival stating You can t kill E T and then not bring him back McCanlies finished the script within two months McCanlies was given a three month schedule to complete a script and it was by way of the film s tight schedule that Warner Bros didn t have time to mess with us as McCanlies said The question of the Giant s backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements such as paranoid fifties sci fi movies with the innocence of something like The Yearling Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies script and sent a letter back saying how pleased he was with the version In the letter Hughes stated I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done He s made something all of a piece with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement He s made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he s developed The Iron Giant I can t stop thinking about it br Bird combined his knowledge from his years in television to direct his first feature He credited his time working on Family Dog as essential to team building and his tenure on The Simpsons as an example of working under strict deadlines He was open to others on his staff to help develop the film he would often ask crew members their opinions on scenes and change things accordingly One of his priorities was to emphasize softer character based moments as opposed to more frenetic scenes something Bird thought was a problem with modern filmmaking There has to be activity or sound effects or cuts or music blaring It s almost as if the audience has the remote and they re going to change channels he commented at the time Storyboard artist Teddy Newton played an important role in shaping the film s story Newton s first assignment on staff involved being asked by Bird to create a film within a film to reflect the hygiene type movies that everyone saw when the bomb scare was happening Newton came to the conclusion that a musical number would be the catchiest alternative and the Duck and Cover sequence came to become one of the crew members favorites of the film Nicknamed The X Factor by story department head Jeffery Lynch the producers gave him artistic freedom on various pieces of the film s script br br The financial failure of Warner s previous animated effort Quest for Camelot which made the studio reconsider animated films helped shape The Iron Giant s production considerably Three quarters of the animation team on that team helped craft The Iron Giant By the time it entered production Warner Bros informed the staff that there would be a smaller budget as well as time frame to get the film completed Although the production was watched closely Bird commented They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good Bird regarded the trade off as having one third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film and half of the production schedule but the payoff as having more creative freedom describing the film as fully made by the animation team I don t think any other studio can say that to the level that we can A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to Maine where they photographed and videotaped five small cities They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae we shot store fronts barns forests homes home interiors diners every detail we could including the bark on trees said production designer Mark Whiting br Bird stuck to elaborate scene planning such as detailed animatics to make sure there were no budgetary concerns The team initially worked with Macromedia s Director software before switching to Adobe After Effects full time Bird was eager to use the then nascent software as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves The software became essential to that team dubbed Macro early on to help the studio grasp story reels for the film These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective In the end he was proud of the way the film was developed noting that We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew who were unified in their mission to create a good film Bird cited his favorite moment of the film s production as occurring in the editing room when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is People in the room were spontaneously crying It was pivotal there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something he recalled br He opted to give the film s animators portions to animate entirely rather than the standard process of animating one character in a throwback to the way Disney s first features were created The exception were those responsible for creating the Giant himself who was created using computer generated imagery due to the difficulty of creating a metal object in a fluid like manner They had additional trouble with using the computer model to express emotion The Giant consist of parts the Battle Giant parts and was designed by filmmaker Joe Johnston and refined by production designer Mark Whiting and Steve Markowski head animator for the Giant Using software the team would animate the Giant on twos every other frame or twelve frames per second when interacting with other characters to make it less obvious it was a computer model Bird brought in students from CalArts to assist in minor animation work due to the film s busy schedule He made sure to spread out the work on scenes between experienced and younger animators noting You overburden your strongest people and underburden the others if you let your top talent monopolize the best assignments Hiroki Itokazu designed all of the film s CGI props and vehicles which were created in a variety of software including Alias Systems Corporation s Maya Alias PowerAnimator a modified version of Pixar s RenderMan Softimage D Cambridge Animation s Animo now part of Toon Boom Technologies Avid Elastic Reality and Adobe Photoshop br The art of Norman Rockwell Edward Hopper and N C Wyeth inspired the design Whiting strove for colors both evocative of the time period in which the film is set and also representative of its emotional tone for example Hogarth s room is designed to reflect his youth and sense of wonder That was blended with a style reminiscent of s illustration Animators studied Chuck Jones Hank Ketcham Al Hirschfeld and Disney films from that era such as Dalmatians for inspiration in the film s animation br br The score for the film was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen making it the only film directed by Bird not to be scored by his future collaborator Michael Giacchino Bird s original temp score a collection of Bernard Herrmann cues from s and s sci fi films initially scared Kamen Believing the sound of the orchestra is important to the feeling of the film Kamen decided to comb eastern Europe for an old fashioned sounding orchestra and went to Prague to hear Vladimir Ashkenazy conduct the Czech Philharmonic in Strauss s An Alpine Symphony Eventually the Czech Philharmonic was the orchestra used for the film s score with Bird describing the symphony orchestra as an amazing collection of musicians The score for The Iron Giant was recorded in a rather unconventional manner compared to most films recorded over one week at the Rudolfinum in Prague the music was recorded without conventional uses of syncing the music in a method Kamen described in a interview as being able to play the music as if it were a piece of classical repertoire Kamen s score for The Iron Giant won the Annie Award for Music in an Animated Feature Production on November br br Bird opted to produce The Iron Giant in widescreen specifically the wide CinemaScope aspect ratio but was warned against doing so by his advisers He felt it was appropriate to use the format as many films from the late s were produced in such widescreen formats He hoped to include the CinemaScope logo on a poster partially as a joke but th Century Fox owner of the trademark refused br Bird later recalled that he clashed with executives who wished to add characters such as a sidekick dog set the film in the present day and include a soundtrack of hip hop This was due to concerns that the film was not merchandisable to which Bird responded If they were interested in telling the story they should let it be what it wants to be The film was also initially going to be released under the Warner Bros Family Entertainment banner the logo which features mascot Bugs Bunny in a tuxedo eating a carrot as seen in the film s teaser trailer Bird was against this for a multitude of reasons mainly because he felt that the logo did not fit the tone of the movie and eventually got confirmation that executives Bob Daley and Terry Semel agreed Instead Bird and his team developed another version of the logo to resemble the classic studio logo in a circle famously employed in Looney Tunes shorts He credited executives Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Courtney Vallenti with helping him achieve his vision noting that they were open to his opinion br According to a report from the time of its release The Iron Giant cost million to produce with an additional million going towards marketing though Box Office Mojo later reported its budget as million It was regarded as a lower budget film in comparison to the films distributed by Walt Disney Pictures br br When he began work on the film Bird was in the midst of coping with the death of his sister Susan who was shot and killed by her estranged husband In researching its source material he learned that Hughes wrote The Iron Man as a means of comforting his children after his wife Sylvia Plath died by suicide specifically through the metaphor of the title character being able to re assemble itself after being damaged These experiences formed the basis of Bird s pitch to Warner Bros which was based around the idea What if a gun had a soul and didn t want to be a gun the completed film was also dedicated to Hughes and Susan McCanlies commented that at a certain point there are deciding moments when we pick who we want to be And that plays out for the rest of your life adding that films can provide viewers with a sense of right and wrong and expressed a wish that The Iron Giant would make us feel like we re all part of humanity which is something we need to feel When some critics compared the film to E T the Extra Terrestrial Bird responded by saying E T doesn t go kicking ass He doesn t make the Army pay Certainly you risk having your hip credentials taken away if you want to evoke anything sad or genuinely heartfelt br br The Iron Giant was a commercial failure during its theatrical release consensus among critics was that its failure was in part due to lack of promotion from Warner Bros This was largely attributable to the reception of Quest for Camelot after its release Warner would not give Bird and his team a release date for their film until April After wildly successful test screenings the studio was shocked by the response the test scores were their highest for a film in years according to Bird They had neglected to prepare a successful marketing strategy for the film such as cereal and fast food tie ins with little time left before its scheduled release Bird remembered that the studio produced one teaser poster for the film which became its eventual poster Brad Ball who had been assigned the role of marketing the film was candid after its release noting that the studio did not commit to a planned Burger King toy plan IGN stated that In a mis marketing campaign of epic proportions at the hands of Warner Bros they simply didn t realize what they had on their hands br The studio needed an million opening to ensure success but they were unable to properly promote it preceding the release They nearly delayed the film by several months to better prepare They said we should delay it and properly lead up to its release and I said you guys have had two and a half years to get ready for this recalled Bird Press outlets took note of its absence of marketing with some reporting that the studio had spent more money on marketing for the intended summer blockbuster Wild Wild West instead Warner Bros scheduled Sunday sneak preview screenings for the film prior to its release as well as a preview of the film on the online platform Webcastsneak br br After criticism that it mounted an ineffective marketing campaign for its theatrical release Warner Bros revamped its advertising strategy for the video release of the film including tie ins with Honey Nut Cheerios AOL and General Motors and secured the backing of three U S congressmen Ed Markey Mark Foley and Howard Berman Awareness of the film was increased by its February release as a pay per view title which also increased traffic to the film s website br The Iron Giant was released on VHS and DVD on November with a Laserdisc release following on December Warner Bros spent million to market the home video release of the film The VHS edition came in three versions pan and scan pan and scan with an affixed Giant toy to the clamshell case and a widescreen version All of the initial widescreen home video releases were in the incorrect aspect ratio for the film In television rights to the film were sold to Cartoon Network and TNT for million Cartoon Network showed the film continuously for consecutive hours in the early s for such holidays as the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving br The Special Edition DVD was released on November In Bird entered discussions with Warner Bros regarding the possibility of releasing The Iron Giant on Blu ray On April he wrote on Twitter that WB I have been talking But they want a bare bones disc I want better and encouraged fans to send tweets to Warner Home Video in favor of a Special Edition Blu ray of the film The film was ultimately released on Blu ray on September and included both the theatrical and Signature Edition cuts as well as a documentary entitled The Giant s Dream that covered the making of the film This version also received a DVD release months earlier on February with The Giant s Dream documentary removed This film became available on HBO Max on

calculated that of audiences that attended recommended the film br Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it straight arrow and subversive and made with simplicity as well as sophistication writing it feels like a classic even though it s just out of the box Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film out of stars and compared it both in story and animation to the works of Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki Like the new Japanese animated films The Iron Giant is happy to be a real movie in everything but live action There are no cute little animals and not a single musical number It s a story plain and simple It works as a lot of animation does to make you forget from time to time that these are moving drawings because the story and characters are so compelling He concluded that it was not just a cute romp but an involving story that has something to say The New Yorker reviewer Michael Sragow dubbed it a modern fairy tale writing The movie provides a master class in the use of scale and perspective and in its power to open up a viewer s heart and mind Time s Richard Schickel deemed it a smart live and let live parable full of glancing acute observations on all kinds of big subjects life death the military industrial complex Lawrence Van Gelder writing for The New York Times deemed it a smooth skilled example of animated filmmaking Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal felt it beautiful oh so beautiful as a work of coherent art noting be assured that the film is before anything else deliciously funny and deeply affecting br Both Hollywood trade publications were positive David Hunter of The Hollywood Reporter predicted it to be a sleeper hit and called it outstanding while Lael Loewenstein of Variety called it a visually appealing well crafted film an unalloyed success Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly commented I have long thought that I was born without the gene that would allow me to be emotionally drawn in by drawings That is until I saw The Iron Giant Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed that the storytelling was far superior to other animated films and cited the characters as plausible and noted the richness of moral themes Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle agreed with the basic techniques as well and concluded the voice cast excelled with a great script by Tim McCanlies The Washington Post s Stephen Hunter while giving the film out of stars opined The movie as beautifully drawn as sleek and engaging as it is has the annoyance of incredible smugness br br The Iron Giant opened at Mann s Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on July with a special ceremony preceding the screening in which a concrete slab bearing the title character s footprint was commemorated The film opened in Los Angeles and New York City on August with a wider national release occurring on August in the United States It opened in theaters in the U S ranking at number nine at the box office accumulating million over its opening weekend It was quick to drop out of the top ten by its fourth week it had accumulated only million far under its reported million budget According to Dave McNary of the Los Angeles Daily News Its weekend per theater average was only an average of or perhaps tickets per showing leading theater owners to quickly discard the film At the time Warner Bros was shaken by the resignations of executives Bob Daly and Terry Semel making the failure much worse T L Stanley of Brandweek cited it as an example of how media tie ins were now essential to guaranteeing a film s success br The film went on to gross million domestically and million internationally for a total of million worldwide Analysts deemed it a victim of poor timing and a severe miscalculation of how to attract an audience Lorenzo di Bonaventura president of Warner Bros at the time explained People always say to me Why don t you make smarter family movies The lesson is Every time you do you get slaughtered br br The Hugo Awards nominated The Iron Giant for Best Dramatic Presentation while the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America honored Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies with the Nebula Award nomination The

American Film Institute nominated The Iron Giant for its Top Animated Films list br br The film has gathered a cult following since its original release In when questioned over social media if there was ever a possibility of a sequel Bird stated that because the film was considered a financial failure a sequel was not likely to ever happen but he also stressed that he considered the story of The Iron Giant to be completely self contained in the film and saw no need for extending the story br The Cartoon Network series Mad did a parody of the movie as well as the film The Iron Lady for their
