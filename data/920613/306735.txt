The Plymouth Superbird is a highly modified short lived version of the Plymouth Road Runner with applied graphic images as well as a distinctive horn sound both referencing the popular Looney Tunes cartoon character Road Runner It was the factory s follow up stock car racing design for the season to the Dodge Charger Daytona of and incorporated many engineering changes and modifications both minor and major garnered from the Daytona s season in competition br The car s primary rivals were the Ford Torino Talladega and Mercury Cyclone a direct response to the Mopar aero car It has also been speculated that a motivating factor in the production of the car was to lure Richard Petty back to Plymouth Both of the Mopar aero cars famously featured a protruding aerodynamic nosecone a high mounted rear wing and unique to the Superbird a horn mimicking the Road Runner s signature beep beep br Superbirds equipped with the top of the line cu in L Hemi engine with a pair of four barrel Carter AFB carburetors x bbl producing hp kW could accelerate from to mph km h in seconds br br br History br Developed specifically for NASCAR the Superbird a modified Road Runner was Plymouth s follow on design to the Charger Daytona fielded by sister company Dodge in the previous season The Charger version that began the season was the first American car to be designed aerodynamically using a wind tunnel and computer analysis and later was modified into the Daytona version with nose and tail The Superbird s smoothed out body and nosecone were further refined from that of the Daytona and the street version s retractable headlights made of fiberglass added nineteen inches to the Road Runner s original length The rear wing was mounted on tall vertical struts that put it into less disturbed air thus increasing the efficiency of the downdraft that it placed upon the car s rear axle For nearly years the mathematic formula used to determine the exact height of the enormous wing was thought to be a highly guarded Chrysler secret In the s a retired Chrysler project engineer incorrectly claimed publicly that the height was determined in much simpler fashion he claimed it was designed to provide clearance for the trunk lid to open freely This is an urban myth The actual height was set to clear the roofline so it was in clean air The rear facing fender scoops were to hide cutouts On Daytonas the scoops were actually for ventilating trapped air from the wheel wells in order to reduce under fender air pressure and lift For standard road going Superbirds the covers or air extractors were a cosmetic enhancement Ground clearance was inches centimetres br NASCAR s homologation requirement demanded that vehicles to be raced must be available to the general public and sold through dealerships in specific minimum numbers For NASCAR raised the production requirement from examples to one for every two manufacturer s dealers in the United States in the case of Plymouth that meant having to build Superbirds Due to increasing emissions regulations combined with insurance spike for high performance cars and NASCAR s effective ban on the aero cars was its only production year br Superbird decals were placed on the outside edges of the spoiler vertical struts featuring a picture of the Road Runner cartoon character holding a racing helmet A smaller version of the decal appears on the driver s side headlight door Superbirds had three engine options the Hemi V engine producing bhp PS kW at rpm and lb ft N m at rpm of torque the Super Commando Six Barrel with X barrel carburetors producing hp kW and the hp kW Super Commando with a single barrel carburetor Only models were fitted with the Hemi As the was less expensive to produce the street version of the Hemi engine used in competition was homologated by producing the minimum number required br On the street the nose cone and wing were very distinctive but the aerodynamic improvements hardly made a difference there or on the drag strip In fact the Road Runner was actually quicker in the quarter mile and standard acceleration tests due to the increased downforce produced by the Superbird s nose and wing Only at speeds in excess of mph km h did the modifications begin to show any benefit br br br Production numbers br Chrysler memos of September show that the sales programming staff were preparing to handle winged Plymouths for but published figures say as many as were built The current figure generally accepted is SuperBirds built and shipped to United States dealers with some to allegedly shipped to Canada The engine option is also questioned although the most frequently seen numbers report Hemi SuperBirds and ci six barrel editions with the remainder powered by ci bbl motors It is believed that over Plymouth SuperBirds exist today br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br NASCAR br br In Autumn Richard Petty left the Plymouth NASCAR Racing Team for Ford s Charlie Grey director of the Ford stock car program felt that hiring Petty would send the message that money rules none However the Superbird was designed specifically to lure Petty back to Plymouth for the season Petty did reasonably well against strong Ford opposition on the NASCAR tracks that year winning eight races and placing well in many more br NASCAR s rules implemented for the season limited the aero cars to an engine displacement of no greater than cu in L or they had to carry much more weight compared to their competitors While they were still legal to race the power to weight consequences that would come with the smaller engine or the increased weight rendered the cars uncompetitive This was the start of a trend of rules slowing down NASCAR because the races were exceeding the technology of tires and safety over mph km h Ford in response also designed the Torino King Cobra with an aerodynamic superbird style nose but it was abandoned br br br Market impact br The Superbird s styling proved to be extreme for s tastes many customers preferred the regular Road Runner and as a consequence many of the examples built sat unsold on the back lots of dealerships as late as Some were converted into Road Runners to move them off the sales lot Some manufacturers produce Superbird conversion kits for Road Runners and Satellites Kits are also available for non produced and bodies for the Superbird More recently they have been very steadily rising in price regularly fetching from US to however this does vary based on the engine gearbox and other factory options on the car br The Superbird and the Dodge Charger Daytona were each built for one model year only and respectively br br br br br br External links br br The Richard Petty Museum
