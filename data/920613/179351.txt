Thunderbolt TV show Lucille Bliss performed the Kanine Krunchies jingle in a TV commercial br br br Production br br br Story development br The children s novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians by Dodie Smith had been published on November to an immediate success By February screenwriter Charles Brackett brought it to the attention of Walt Disney who acquired the film rights to the novel on November of that year after lengthy negotiations for The project was set to be Disney s next animated feature after Sleeping Beauty which was still in production at the time and was originally expected to be finished within two years Story artist Bill Peet was assigned to single handedly develop the story marking the first time a Disney animated film was written by one person Disney also tasked Peet to write a detailed screenplay first before storyboarding since Peet never learned to use a typewriter he wrote the initial draft by hand on legal paper The manuscript was completed and typed up within two months after which having received Disney s approval Peet began storyboarding and was charged with recording the voice over process br Peet closely followed the plot of Smith s novel but condensed some of its characters which included Cruella s husband and cat as well as Cadpig the female runt of Pongo and Missis puppies whose traits were transferred to Lucky in the final film He also merged two Dalmatian mothers birth mother Missis and adopted mother Perdita into one naming her after the latter likewise Nanny Cook and Nanny Butler from the novel were amalgamated into one character simply named Nanny The Colonel s cat assistant was re gendered from the female Pussy Willow into the male Sergeant Tibbs and Horace Badun was renamed from Saul Among other things Peet retained a scene from the original book in which Pongo and Perdita exchange wedding vows in unison with their owners who were also renamed from Mr and Mrs Dearly to Roger and Anita Radcliffe However after the censor board warned that it might offend certain religious audiences if the animals repeated the exact words of a solemn religious ceremony it was reworked to be less religious down to having Roger and Anita dressed in formal clothes Also the film s original ending involved the newly rich Roger selling his song about Cruella and buying the Hell Hall to turn it into a Dalmatian Plantation with Pongo and Perdita expecting another litter of puppies It was ultimately cut short and rewritten to have Dalmatians reunite with their owners after they escape from Cruella br Although Disney had not been as involved in the production of the animated films as frequently as in previous years he was always present at story meetings When Peet sent Dodie Smith some drawings of the characters she wrote back saying that he had improved her story and that the designs looked better than the illustrations in the book br br br Casting br The filmmakers deliberately cast actors with deeper voices for the roles of dogs so they would have more power than those of the human characters Rod Taylor who had extensive radio experience was one of the first actors cast in the film he got the role of Pongo Lisa Daniels was originally cast as Perdita and recorded about the third of her lines but then got married and moved to New York Cate Bauer replaced her for the rest of the film J Pat O Malley who was a regular voice actor for the studio and one of Disney s personal favorites got the roles of Jasper and Colonel and also voiced several minor characters in the film David Frankham was cast as Sergeant Tibbs in the spring of and finished his recording within three sessions from May to January he was also asked to record the part of Scottie the Skye Terrier who appears early in the Twilight Bark sequence br Disney originally had Lisa Davis read for the role of Cruella De Vil but she did not think that she was right for the part and wanted to try reading the role of Anita instead Disney agreed and after they read the script for a second time she landed the part Davis also provided live action reference for the character Betty Lou Gerson who was previously the narrator for Cinderella auditioned for the role of Cruella De Vil in front of Marc Davis the character s supervising animator and sequence director Wolfgang Reitherman and immediately landed it While searching for the right accent of the character she landed on a phony theatrical voice someone who s set sail from New York but hasn t quite reached England During the recording process Gerson was thought to be imitating Tallulah Bankhead but she later disputed that she didn t intentionally imitate her We both had phony English accents on top of our Southern accents and a great deal of flair So our voices came out that way Gerson finished her recording sessions in fourteen days br br br Animation br br br Art direction br After Sleeping Beauty disappointed at the box office Disney was losing money and there were discussions about closing down the animation department During the film s production Disney told animator Eric Larson I don t think we can continue it s too expensive Despite this he still had deep feelings towards animation because he had built the company upon it br Ub Iwerks in charge of special processes at the studio had been experimenting with Xerox photography to aid in animation By he used a Xerox camera to transfer drawings by animators directly to animation cels eliminating the inking process thus saving time and money while preserving the spontaneity of the penciled elements However because of its limitations the camera was unable to deviate from a black scratchy outline and lacked the fine lavish quality of hand inking Disney would first use the Xerox process for a thorn forest in Sleeping Beauty and the first production to make full use of the process was Goliath II For One Hundred and One Dalmatians one of the benefits of the process was that it was a great help towards animating the spotted dogs According to Chuck Jones Disney was able to complete the film for about half of what it would have cost if they had had to animate all the dogs and spots br Meanwhile Ken Anderson the studio s art director learned a television production studio Hurrell Productions was using Xerography to produce television commercials featuring Disney characters Inspired by the aesthetic Anderson experimented with a Xerox copier to directly transfer the animators drawings onto transparent cels thereby eliminating the inking process Anderson screened an animation test to Disney and the animators although Disney expressed concern at the graphic style he gave his approval stating Ah yeah yeah you can fool around all you want to For the stylized art direction Anderson took inspiration from British cartoonist Ronald Searle who once advised him to use a Mont Blanc pen and India ink for his artwork br In addition to the character animation Anderson also sought to use Xerography on the background painting because I was going to apply the same technique to the whole picture Along with color stylist Walt Peregoy the two had the line drawings be printed on a separate animation cel before being laid over the background which gave the appearance similar to the Xeroxed animation Disney disliked the artistic look of the film and felt he was losing the fantasy element of his animated films In a meeting with the animation staff concerning future films Disney angrily said We re never gonna have one of those goddamned things referring to the film s art direction he also stated Ken s never going to be an art director again br Anderson took this to heart but Disney eventually forgave him on his final trip to the studio in late As Anderson recalled in an interview br br He looked very sick I said Gee it s great to see you Walt and he said You know that thing you did on Dalmatians He didn t say anything else but he just gave me this look and I knew that all was forgiven and in his opinion maybe what I did on Dalmatians wasn t so bad That was the last time I ever saw him Then a few weeks later I learned he was gone br br br Character animation br Marc Davis was the sole animator on Cruella De Vil During production Davis claimed her character was partly inspired by Bette Davis no relation Rosalind Russell and Tallulah Bankhead He took further influence from her voice actress Betty Lou Gerson whose cheekbones he added to the character He later complimented t hat her voice was the greatest thing I ve ever had a chance to work with A voice like Betty Lou s gives you something to do You get a performance going there and if you don t take advantage of it you re off your rocker While her hair coloring originated from the illustrations in the novel Davis found its disheveled style by looking through old magazines for hairdos from till now Her coat was exaggerated to match her oversized personality and the lining was red because there s a devil image involved br As with the previous Disney films the actors provided live action reference as an aid to the animators before the animation process begun By January Mary Wickes who had played the maid Katie in The Mickey Mouse Club serial Annette was hired as a model for Cruella De Vil The live action reference for Nanny was provided by both Don Barclay and Barbara Luddy who had voiced Lady in Lady and the Tramp and Merryweather in Sleeping Beauty Helene Stanley who had been a model for the titular character in Cinderella and Princess Aurora in Sleeping Beauty performed the live action reference for Anita br br br Music br br To have music involved in the narrative Peet used an old theater trick by which the protagonist is a down and out songwriter However unlike the previous animated Disney films at the time the songs were not composed by a team but by Mel Leven who composed both lyrics and music Previously Leven had composed songs for the UPA animation studio in which animators who transferred to work at the Disney studios had recommended him to Walt Disney His first assignment was to compose Cruella De Vil of which Leven composed three versions The final version used in the film was composed as a bluesy number before a meeting with Walt in forty five minutes br The other two songs included in the film are Kanine Krunchies Jingle sung by Lucille Bliss who voiced Anastasia Tremaine in Disney s film Cinderella and Dalmatian Plantation in which Roger sings only two lines at its closure Leven had also written additional songs that were not included in the film The first song Don t Buy a Parrot from a Sailor a cockney chant was meant to be sung by Jasper and Horace at the De Vil Mansion A second song Cheerio Good Bye Toodle oo Hip Hip was to be sung by the dalmatian puppies as they make their way into London A third song titled March of the One Hundred and One was meant for the dogs to sing after escaping Cruella by van Different longer versions of Kanine Krunchies Jingle and Dalmatian Plantation appear on the Disneyland Records read along album based on the film br The Sherman Brothers wrote a title song One Hundred and One Dalmatians but it was not used in the film The song has been released on other Disney recordings however br br br Release br br br Original theatrical run br One Hundred and One Dalmatians premiered and was released in theaters on January accompanied by the documentary The Horse with the Flying Tail To promote the film an updated version of the Disneyland episode The Best Doggoned Dog in the World was aired on ABC on February featuring the footage from One Hundred and One Dalmatians instead of scenes from Old Yeller br During its initial theatrical run the film grossed million in the United States and Canada which generated million in distributor rentals It was the first animated feature to earn more than million on its initial release as well as the most popular film of the year in France with admissions of million ranking tenth on their all time list The box office success of One Hundred and One Dalmatians allowed to pull the studio s animation department out of the financial slump caused by the underperformance of Sleeping Beauty two years prior despite this it did nothing to rekindle Disney s fading interest in animation with him being more focused on working on Disneyland and producing live action films by then br br br Re releases br One Hundred and One Dalmatians was re released theatrically in the United States in and During its first re release in it

Dalmatians received acclaim from critics many of whom hailed it as the studio s best release since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and the closest to a real Disney film in many years Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote While the story moves steadily toward a stark melodramatic chase climax it remains enclosed in a typical Disney frame of warm family love human and canine However he later opined that the s ongs are scarce too A few more would have braced the final starkness Variety claimed that While not as indelibly enchanting or inspired as some of the studio s most unforgettable animated endeavors this is nonetheless a painstaking creative effort A review in Time magazine praised the film as the wittiest most charming least pretentious cartoon feature Walt Disney has ever made Harrison s Reports felt all children and adults will be highly entertained by Walt Disney s latest a semi sophisticated laugh provoking all cartoon feature lengther in Technicolor Dodie Smith also enjoyed the film where she particularly praised the animation and backgrounds of the film br Contemporary reviews have remained positive Reviewing the film during its re release Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times while giving the film three stars out of four asserted that it s an uneven film with moments of inspiration in a fairly conventional tale of kidnapping and rescue This is not one of the great Disney classics it s not in the same league with Snow White or Pinocchio but it s passable fun and will entertain its target family audiences Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel in his review also gave the film three stars out of four Ralph Novak of People wrote What it lacks in romantic extravagance and plush spectacle this Disney film makes up for in quiet charm and subtlety In fact if any movie with dogs cats and horses who talk can be said to belong in the realm of realistic drama this is it However the film did receive a few negative reviews In Craig Berman of MSNBC ranked it and its remake as two of the worst children s films of all time saying that The plot itself is a bit nutty Making a coat out of dogs Who does that But worse than Cruella de Vil s fashion sense is the fact that your children will definitely start asking for a Dalmatian of their own for their next birthday br On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews with an average score of The website s critics consensus reads With plenty of pooches and a memorable villain Cruella De Vil this is one of Disney s most enduring
