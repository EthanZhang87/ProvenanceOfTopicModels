more stripped down sound that showcased Newman s piano Ry Cooder s slide guitar and contributions from Byrds members Gene Parsons and Clarence White helped to give the album a much rootsier feel Songs was also critically acclaimed th best album of the seventies according to Rolling Stone critic Robert Christgau but again found little commercial success though Three Dog Night made a huge hit of his Mama Told Me Not to Come The following year Randy Newman Live cemented his cult following and became his first LP to appear in the Billboard charts at No Newman also made his first foray into music

Rednecks began with a description of segregationist Lester Maddox pitted against a smart ass New York Jew on a TV show this was a joke because the Jew was Dick Cavett in a song that criticizes both southern racism and the complacent bigotry of Americans outside of the south who stereotype all southerners as racist yet ignore racism in northern and midwestern states and large cities This ambiguity was also apparent on Kingfish and Every Man a King the former a paean to Huey Long the assassinated former Governor and United States Senator from Louisiana the other a campaign song written by Long himself An album that received lavish critical praise Good Old Boys also became a commercial breakthrough for Newman peaking at No on Billboard spending weeks there br Little Criminals contained the surprise hit Short People which also became a subject of controversy In September the English music magazine NME reported the following interview with Newman talking about his then new release There s one song about a child murderer Newman deadpans That s fairly optimistic Maybe There s one called Jolly Coppers on Parade which isn t an absolutely anti police song Maybe it s even a fascist song I didn t notice at the time There s also one about me as a cowboy called Rider in the Rain I think it s ridiculous The Eagles are on there That s what s good about it There s also this song Short People It s purely a joke I like other ones on the album better but the audiences go for that one The album proved Newman s most popular to date reaching No on the US Billboard chart Another somewhat controversial Randy Newman number recorded by both Harpers Bizarre and The Nashville Teens was The Biggest Night of Her Life a song about a schoolgirl who is too excited to sleep because she has promised to lose her virginity on her sixteenth birthday to a boy whom her parents like because his hair is always neat br s Born Again was relatively commercially and critically unsuccessful with reviews criticizing its cynicism and bad taste and Rolling Stone comparing it unfavorably to Sweeney Todd in a double review br His album Trouble in Paradise included the single I Love L A a song that has been interpreted as both praising and criticizing the city of Los Angeles This ambivalence is borne out by Newman s own comments on the song As he explained in a interview There s some kind of ignorance L A has that I m proud of The open car and the redhead the Beach Boys I can t think of anything a hell of a lot better than that The ABC network and Frank Gari Productions transformed I Love L A into a popular s TV promotional campaign retooling the lyrics and title to You ll Love It on ABC The song is played at home games for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Lakers as well as the Los Angeles Kings who use the song along with their goal horn In spite of its prominence however it failed to chart on the Billboard Hot br In Newman performed a set at

and was played heavily on a wide range of American radio and television stations in both Newman s original and Aaron Neville s cover version of the song The song addresses the deceitful manner in which New Orleans s municipal government managed a flood in during which as Newman asserts The guys who ran the Mardi Gras the bosses in New Orleans decided the course of that flood You know they cut a hole in the levee and it flooded the cotton fields In a related performance Newman contributed to the release of Goin Home A Tribute to Fats Domino Vanguard contributing his version of Fats Domino s Blue Monday Domino had been rescued from his New Orleans home after Hurricane Katrina initially having been feared dead br In October Newman released the song Putin The Washington Post wrote inspired by the Russian leader s penchant for bare chested photo ops and a geopolitical approach that s somewhat short of soft and cuddly Newman has crafted a song that tells Putin s story from multiple perspectives Newman explained that the song was from a new album that would be released in but he was putting out this song early because I think that people will lose interest after this surfeit of political talk and attention after the election I ve got the thing done I just want to see what happens I m curious to see how the thing is received The song earned Newman a Grammy Award for Best
