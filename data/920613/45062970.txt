affinity towards both the epic fantasy genre as well as Japanese culture in general br The art took inspiration from such Japanese media as ink wash painting and origami among others A particular influence came from the ukiyo e woodblock style with Laika intending to make the entire film to look and feel as if it s a moving woodblock print A second major influence on the film included the

interview director Travis Knight described Saito s work as being the touchstone and the one key visual artist that inspired the film Knight also describes being profoundly affected by the artist s interest in both eastern and western art styles and fusing them together in his works This artist s combination of different styles across cultures inspired Knight and his film crew in the creation of Kubo and the Two Strings br For the Skeleton monster the team created a giant ft m lb kg puppet which Laika claims is the record holder for largest stop motion puppet The idea to make such a massive puppet was born out of a fear that individual smaller parts meant to represent the larger monster would not work well on screen interacting with the other puppets The resulting puppet was built in two parts which were then attached together by magnets For movement Laika had to design a robot to easily manipulate it The team at one point purchased an industrial robot from eBay but found that it would not work with their setup br A small portion of the production was released on YouTube br br On December Art Parkinson Matthew McConaughey Charlize Theron Rooney Mara Ralph Fiennes and Brenda
