Wendie Malick Inspired by ancient Peruvian culture and set in an Incan empire The Emperor s New Groove follows young and self centered Emperor Kuzco voiced by Spade who is accidentally transformed into a llama by his ex advisor Yzma Kitt and her dim witted but affable henchman Kronk Warburton For the emperor to change back into a human he entrusts a village leader Pacha Goodman to escort him back to the palace before Yzma can track them down and finish him off br Development of The Emperor s New Groove began in when the film was conceived as a musical epic titled Kingdom of the Sun Following his directorial debut with The Lion King Roger Allers recruited English musician Sting to compose several songs for the film Because of the underwhelming box office performances of Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame Dindal was brought in as co director to make the film more comedic Because of poor test screenings creative differences with Dindal and production falling behind schedule Allers departed and the film became a lighthearted comedy in the vein of a Chuck Jones cartoon instead of a dramatic musical A documentary The Sweatbox details the production troubles that The Emperor s New Groove endured during its six years of development br The Emperor s New Groove premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on December and was released in theaters on December It received generally positive reviews from critics but performed disappointingly at the box office compared to Disney films released in the s grossing million on a million budget However the film found larger success when it was released for home media and became the best selling DVD of In the years since its release The Emperor s New Groove garnered a cult following among fans It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for the song My Funny Friend and Me performed by Sting that award went to Things Have Changed by Bob Dylan from Wonder Boys A direct to video

become incredibly conceited On the day before his th birthday Kuzco announces his plan to demolish a nearby village and have a lavish summer home constructed in its place despite the objections of its leader Pacha Kuzco also discovers his elderly advisor and alchemist Yzma usurping his duties and quietly fires her Yzma and her bumbling henchman Kronk plot to poison Kuzco s wine and take over the empire before the news of Yzma s termination becomes public However Kronk takes the wrong chemical vial from Yzma s laboratory accidentally turning Kuzco into a llama Yzma orders Kronk to knock Kuzco out take him outside the city and kill him An attack of conscience and a series of mishaps causes Kronk to drop the sack containing the unconscious Kuzco the sack lands on the back of Pacha s cart and Pacha leaves the city before Kronk can catch up to him Kuzco awakens in Pacha s backyard having lost some of his memory Believing Pacha transformed and kidnapped him Kuzco orders Pacha to take him home Pacha refuses to help unless Kuzco builds his summer home elsewhere br Kuzco rejects Pacha s proposition and ventures into the jungle alone despite Pacha s warnings Kuzco is pursued by jaguars but Pacha saves him Kuzco begrudgingly agrees to relocate the construction site of his summer home if Pacha takes him home On the way to the palace Kuzco tries to renege on his promise he and Pacha fight on a collapsing bridge before being forced to work together to escape some crocodiles and a crumbling cliff face Meanwhile Yzma discovers Kronk lost Kuzco and the duo set out to find him At a roadside diner Pacha and Kuzco arrive at the same time as Yzma and Kronk but neither party initially notices the other However Kronk nearly recognizes Pacha who overhears Yzma s plans to murder Kuzco He sneaks Kuzco out of the diner but Kuzco does not believe Pacha s warnings Kuzco and Pacha fight again and part ways Kuzco almost approaches Yzma and Kronk but overhears them discussing their plans to kill him they also remark that Kuzco s subjects were not grieved by his apparent death Kuzco flees into the jungle to apologize to Pacha but cannot find him br The next morning Kuzco resigns himself to living like a llama but finds Pacha and the duo reconcile Meanwhile Kronk remembers where he saw Pacha before and tells Yzma Kuzco and Pacha return to Pacha s village only to discover that Yzma and Kronk are in Pacha s house posing as distant relatives Pacha s family distracts Yzma to give Pacha and Kuzco a head start however Yzma and Kronk still manage to confront the duo in Yzma s lab Against Yzma s orders of dispatching the duo Kronk has another attack of conscience and Yzma repeatedly insults him and he tries to kill her instead Yzma drops Kronk through a trapdoor As Pacha and Kuzco flee from Yzma and her guards Kuzco tries several different potions without success After figuring out which vial is the human potion Kuzco Pacha and Yzma fight over it Yzma is turned into a cat by one of the other potions and Pacha nearly falls off the side of the palace this forces Kuzco to rescue Pacha allowing Yzma to take the vial With some teamwork and inadvertent assistance from Kronk the duo defeat Yzma and recover the vial After becoming human again Kuzco makes amends with the people he hurt and builds a much smaller summer home on an uninhabited hill near Pacha s village

the theatrical release of The Lion King Roger Allers was called into Thomas Schumacher s office to discuss his next project Inside his office Schumacher explained that Disney Feature Animation was interested in exploring ancient cultures for prospective film projects He held three pictures representative of the Inca Aztec and Mayan cultures Allers chose the Inca culture as he became intrigued with the visual possibilities of the Inca creation myth Allers would base his story on Anthony Hope s adventure novel The Prisoner of Zenda br Alongside co writer Matthew Jacobs Allers formulated the idea for Kingdom of the Sun in which development on the project began in Upon pitching the project to then Disney CEO and chairman Michael Eisner Allers recalled Eisner saying It has all of the elements of a classic Disney film and because of his directorial success on The Lion King that same year Eisner allowed Allers to have free rein with both the casting and the storyline In January Variety reported that Allers was working on an Inca themed original story In the production crew traveled to Machu Picchu in Peru to study Inca artifacts and architecture and the landscape this empire was created in br Kingdom of the Sun was to have been a tale of a greedy selfish emperor voiced by David Spade who finds a peasant voiced by Owen Wilson who looks just like him the emperor swaps places with the peasant to escape his boring life and have fun much as in author Mark Twain s archetypal novel The Prince and the Pauper However the villainous witch Yzma voiced by Eartha Kitt has plans to summon Supay the evil god of death and destroy the sun so that she may become young and beautiful forever the sun gives her wrinkles so she surmises that living in a world of darkness would prevent her from aging Discovering the switch between the prince and the peasant Yzma turns the real emperor into a llama and threatens to reveal the pauper s identity unless he obeys her During his time as the emperor and doing Yzma s orders the pauper falls in love with the emperor s soon to be fianc e Nina who thinks he is the emperor who has changed his ways Meanwhile the emperor llama learns humility in his new form and even comes to love a female llama herder named Mata voiced by Laura Prepon Together the girl and the llama set out to undo the witch s plans The book Reel Views says the film would have been a romantic comedy musical in the traditional Disney style br Following the underwhelming box office performances of Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame studio executives felt that the project was growing too ambitious and serious for audiences following test screenings and needed more comedy In early producer Randy Fullmer contacted and offered Mark Dindal who had just wrapped up work on Warner Bros Cats Don t Dance to be co director on Kingdom of the Sun Meanwhile Allers personally called Sting in the wake of Elton John s success with The Lion King s soundtrack to compose several songs for the film He agreed but on the condition that his filmmaker wife Trudie Styler could document the process of the production This film which was eventually entitled The Sweatbox was made by Xingu Films their production company Along with collaborator David Hartley Sting composed eight songs inextricably linked with the original plot and characters br In the summer of it was announced that Allers and Dindal would serve as the film s directors and Randy Fullmer as producer Spade and Kitt had been confirmed to voice the emperor Manco and the villainess while Carla Gugino was in talks for the role of Nina Harvey Fierstein was also cast as Huaca a year old rock who kept a sharp eye on the emperors who ruled before Manco br In the summer of it became apparent that Kingdom of the Sun was not far along enough in production to be released in the summer of as planned At this time one of the Disney executives reportedly walked into Fullmer s office and placing his thumb and index finger a quarter inch apart angrily stated Your film is this close to being shut down Fullmer approached Allers and informed him of the need to finish the film on time for its summer release as crucial promotional deals with McDonald s Coca Cola and other companies were already established and depended upon meeting that release date From screenings Allers vision of the film was recognized as having far too many elements Schumacher and Peter Schneider spoke to Allers and Dindal to try to work out a pared down film but the two had different ideas for which direction to take the film Schumacher and Schneider broke the staff into two small teams under Allers and Dindal and effectively had them run a bake off to decide which version to go While Allers altered some of the details of the original pitch Dindal proposed a complete tonal shift into a comedy that Schumacher and Schneider responded favorably to Allers allowed Dindal s version of the film to go forward and opted to step down from co director With this change in direction on September the project became dormant with production costs amounting to million and twenty five percent of the film animated br br Upset that Allers left the project Eisner gave Fullmer two weeks to salvage the project or production would be completely shut down In December Fullmer and Dindal halted production for six months to retool the project renaming it from Kingdom of the Sun to Kingdom in the Sun thus making it the first Disney animated feature to have an extensive overhaul since Pinocchio Meanwhile following Eric Goldberg s pitch for the Rhapsody in Blue segment for Fantasia the animators were reassigned to work on the segment br Story work on the revised film started when they knew what to retain from the original version namely David Spade as Manco and Eartha Kitt as Yzma with the remaining elements to be written around those characters Chris Williams who was a storyboard artist during Kingdom of the Sun came up with the idea of making Pacha an older character as opposed to the teenager that he was in the original version as to be the opposite of Manco Following up on the new idea former late night comedy writer David Reynolds stated I pitched a simple comedy that s basically a buddy road picture with two guys being chased in the style of a Chuck Jones toon but faster paced Disney said Give it a shot One of the new additions to the revised story was the scene stealing character of Yzma s sidekick Kronk Kronk was inspired by actor Rick Rossovich according to Williams and as they wrote for him Reynolds immediately thought of casting Patrick Warburton for the role based on his character Puddy from Seinfeld Meanwhile the name Manco was changed to Kuzco following Fullmer s discovery of the Japanese slang term manko which translates to cunt Due in part to the production shutdown Sting began to develop schedule conflicts with his songwriting duties interfering with his work on the next album he was planning to record in Italy I write the music and then they re supposed to animate it but there are constantly changes being made It s constantly in turnaround the singer songwriter admitted but I m enjoying it Because of the shutdown the animated film Dinosaur assumed the summer release date originally scheduled for Kingdom br Andreas Deja declined to return to the film after observing his more serious version of Yzma was incompatible with the new comedic tone of the film and moved to Orlando Florida to work on Lilo Stitch Animator Dale Baer would replace Deja as the supervising animator for Yzma Fullmer would inform Sting by telephone that his songs related to specific scenes and characters that were now gone had to be dropped Bitter about the removal of his songs the pop musician commented At first I was angry and perturbed Then I wanted some vengeance Disney eventually agreed to allow three of the six deleted songs as bonus tracks on the soundtrack album such as Yzma s villain song Snuff Out the Light the love song One Day She ll Love Me and the dance number Walk the Llama Llama The plot elements such as the romance between the llama herder Pacha and Manco s betrothed Nina the sun capturing villain scheme similarities to The Prince and the Pauper story and Inca mythology were dropped The character of Huaca was also dropped though he would make a cameo appearance as the candle holder during the dinner scene in the finished film Kuzco who was a supporting character in the original story became the protagonist br In the summer of cast members Owen Wilson Harvey Fierstein and Trudie Styler were dropped from the film Kitt and Spade remained in the cast Dindal commented a nd then John Goodman and Patrick Warburton came aboard After Sting s songs for Kingdom of the Sun were dropped from the new storyline Sting remained on the project though he was told by the studio that a ll we want is a beginning and an end song The song Perfect World was approached to open the movie with a big fun number that established the power of Kuzco and showed how he controlled the world according to then Feature Animation president Thomas Schumacher The filmmakers had asked Sting to perform the song for the film though Sting declined by telling them that he was too old to sing it and that they should find someone younger and hipper They instead went with Tom Jones who is eleven years older than Sting br In February the new film was announced as The Emperor s New Groove with its new story centering on a spoiled Inca Emperor voiced by Spade who through various twists and falls ends up learning the true meaning of friendship and happiness from a poor peasant voiced by Goodman The release date was shifted to December Despite the phrasing of the title the film was not related to Hans Christian Andersen s classic Danish fairy tale The Emperor s New Clothes although both stories involve an emperor being tricked However according to Mark V Moorhead of the Houston Press the film s plot does bear some resemblance to that of The Golden Ass by Lucius Apuleius wherein a man is turned into a donkey br Eisner worried that the new story was too close in tone to Hercules which had performed decently yet below expectations at the American box office Dindal and Fullmer assured him that The Emperor s New Groove as the film was now called would have a much smaller cast making it easier to attract audiences Towards the end of production the film s ending originally had Kuzco building his Kuzcotopia amusement park on another hill by destroying a rainforest near Pacha s home and inviting the former and his family to visit Horrified at the ending Sting commented I wrote them a letter and said You do this I m resigning because this is exactly the opposite of what I stand for I ve spent years trying to defend the rights of indigenous people and you re just marching over them to build a theme park I will not be party to this As a result the ending was rewritten in which Kuzco instead constructs a shack similar to Pacha s and spends his vacation among the villagers br br During the production of Kingdom of the Sun Deja was the initial supervising animator of Yzma and incorporated supermodel poses published in magazines to capture Yzma s sultry seductive persona Nik Ranieri was originally slated as the supervising animator for Yzma s rocky sidekick Hucua During the research trip to Peru in Ranieri acknowledged that he was researching for a character that looked like a rock so I was stuck drawing rocks for the whole trip Then when we got back they piled it into this story about ancient Incas Mark Pudleiner was to be the supervising animator of Kuzco s proposed maiden Nina In early David Pruiksma came on board to animate the llama Snowball According to Pruiksma Snowball was a silly vain and egotistical character rather the dumb blond of the llama set I really enjoyed developing the character and doing some early test animation on her as well Before I left the film and it was ultimately shelved I created model sheets for not only Snowball but for the rest of the herd of seven other llamas and for Kuzco as a Llama When the film was placed on production shutdown Pruiksma transferred to work on Atlantis The Lost Empire being developed concurrently and ultimately the llama characters were dropped from the storyline br Following the production overhaul and the studio s attempts for more cost efficient animated features Dindal urged for a simpler approach that emphasized the characters rather than overwhelming special effects or cinematic techniques Because of the subsequent departure of Deja animator Dale L Baer inherited the character of Yzma Using Kitt s gestures during recording sessions Baer commented She has a natural voice for animation and really got into the role She would gesture wildly and it was fun just to watch her She would come into each session almost serious and very professional and suddenly she would go wild and break up laughing Ranieri was later asked to serve as the supervising animator of Kuzco as a human and a llama though he would admit being reluctant at first until he discovered that Kuzco had a side to him there was a lot of comedy potential and as a character he went through an arc Pudleiner was also reassigned to work as an animator of the human version of Kuzco In addition to drawing inspiration from Spade during recording sessions the Kuzco animation team studied llamas at the zoo visited a llama farm watched nature documentaries and even observed the animals up close when they came for a visit to the studio For the rewritten version of Pacha animator Bruce W Smith observed that Pacha is probably the most human of all the characters and further added that he has more human mannerisms and realistic traits which serve as a contrast to the cartoony llama he hangs out with He is the earthy guy who brings everything back into focus Being a big fellow about six foot five and weighing about pounds we had to work hard to give him a sense of weight and believability in his movement br Actual animation began on May involving artists technicians and production personnel Outside of the Walt Disney Feature Animation studio building in Burbank California animators located at Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida and Walt Disney Feature Animation Paris assisted in the production of The Emperor s New Groove During the last eighteen months of production a crew of clean up artists would take the character animators drawings and place a new piece of paper over the existing drawing to draw a cleaner more refined image We re basically the final designers said clean up supervisor Vera Pacheco whose crew worked on more than drawings for the film The motion reference material for the film was extensive and included live action footage of the actors including Gustavo Rodr guez born in in Caracas Venezuela Delia Re tegui born Alonso Cano born and Gabriela Villalobos born as Kuzco Chicha and Chicha s slim children Tipo and Chaca respectively performing the scenes br br After the release date had shifted to December similarities were noted between the film and DreamWorks Animation s The Road to El Dorado Jeffrey Katzenberg had been at Disney while production began on Kingdom of the Sun but then left and started DreamWorks in and there is some speculation that The Road to El Dorado was based on what Katzenberg had seen at Disney Marc Lument a visual development artist in El Dorado claimed It really was a race and Katzenberg wanted ours out before theirs Lument also added We didn t know exactly what they were doing but we had the impression it was going to be very similar Whoever came out second would face the impression that they copied the other Fullmer and Dindal denied the similarities with the latter commenting This version The Emperor s New Groove was well in the works when that movie came out and further added Early on when our movie got to be very comic all of us felt that you can t be making this farce about a specific group of people unless we are going to poke fun at ourselves This didn t seem to be a proper choice about Incas or any group of people It was more of a fable br The marketing campaign for The Emperor s New Groove was relatively restrained as Disney opted to heavily promote the release of Dalmatians which was released during Thanksgiving Nevertheless the film was accompanied by six launcher toys of Kuzco Kuzco as a llama Pacha Yzma Yzma as a cat and Kronk accompanied by Happy Meals at McDonald s in North America McDonald s also released toys for the film in Europe Asia and Australia br The film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on December with Sting in attendance br br The film was released on VHS and DVD on May and September as well as a Disc Collector s Edition that included bonus features such as Sting s music video of My Funny Friend and Me a Rascal Flatts music video of Walk the Llama Llama from the soundtrack audio commentary with the filmmakers a multi skill level set top game with the voice cast and deleted scenes

Disney then digitally remastered and released The Emperor s New Groove on Blu ray on June bundled in a two movie collection combo pack with its sequel Kronk s New Groove On its first weekend it sold Blu ray units grossing br br Despite making back its budget The Emperor s New Groove was considered a box office disappointment grossing considerably less than any of Disney s animated films from the

Dalmatians which had been released just three weeks prior The film ultimately made million in the United States and an additional million worldwide for a total of million the lowest box office earnings for an animated Disney feature since the s In January the movie was re released in theaters and earned an additional br Because of its pre Columbian setting and Latin American flavor Disney spent in its marketing campaign towards the Latino market releasing dual English and Spanish language theatrical prints in multiplexes across heavily populated Latino areas in Los Angeles California in contrast to releasing dubbed or subtitled theatrical prints of their previous animated features in foreign markets By January days into its theatrical general release the Spanish dubbed prints were pulled from multiplexes as Hispanic Americans opted to watch the English language prints with its grossing averaging in comparison to for the former br br On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes The

fresh characters and big laughs make for a great time for the whole family On Metacritic the film has a score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Writing for Variety Robert Koehler commented the film may not match the groovy business of many of the studio s other kidpix but it will be remembered as the film that established a new attitude in the halls of Disney s animation unit Roger Ebert writing his review for Chicago Sun Times awarded the film out of stars distinguishing the film as a goofy slapstick cartoon with the attention span of Donald Duck that is separate from what s known as animated features Ebert would later add that it doesn t have the technical polish of a film like Tarzan but is a reminder that the classic cartoon look is a beloved style of its own Emma Cochrane of Empire gave the film a three out of five stars writing An attractive generally enjoyable concoction but never really hits its comedic or emotional targets full on Fun but quickly forgettable Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded the film a B describing it as a hip funny mostly nonmusical decidedly non epic family picture which turns out to be less of a hero s journey than a meeting of sitcom minds br The film was not without its detractors Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle gave the film stars out of noting that the film suffers from a persistent case of narrative backsliding that only serves to make older members of the audience long for the days of the dwarves beauties and poisoned apples of Disney yore and younger ones squirm in their seats Savlov also unfavorably compared the film s animation to that of Tarzan s writing it is also a minor letdown with none of the ecstatic visual tour de force Bob Strauss in his review for the Los Angeles Daily News acknowledged that the film is funny frantic and colorful enough to keep the small fry diverted for its short but strained minutes though except for some nice voice work a few impressive scale gags and interesting Inca inspired design elements there is very little here for the rest of the family to latch onto Strauss blamed the film s story overhaul during production as the main problem br br In The Emperor s New Groove was named the th best Disney animated film by IGN and the th by Rotten Tomatoes in November In it did not appear in lists of the best Disney movies between chosen by Harper s Bazaar and selected by Time Out br br The Sweatbox is a documentary that chronicled the tumultuous collaboration of Sting and David Hartley with the Disney studios to compose six songs for Kingdom of the Sun the film s working title The documentary featured interviews from directors Roger Allers and Mark Dindal producer Randy Fullmer Sting whose wife Trudie Styler created the documentary Disney story artists and the voice cast being dismayed by the new direction Disney was not believed to be opposed to Styler s documentary with Disney animation executive Thomas Schumacher who had seen footage commenting I think it s going to be great br The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival but has gone virtually unseen by the public ever since Disney owns the rights but has never officially released it In March a workprint of the documentary was leaked online and was uploaded onto YouTube by a United Kingdom cartoonist before it was ultimately pulled As of April some scenes from the documentary could be seen from the home media release including the behind the scenes and the making of My Funny Friend and Me br br The Emperor s New Groove was not as well received as Disney s other animated features at the time which were more focused on Broadway style musicals like Beauty and the Beast or heroic characters with comedy situations like Hercules and arrived just before films like Shrek and Ice Age that would launch a wave of animated comedy films The film as well as The Road to El Dorado have since gained appreciation as standalone works from that period as well written comedies in part due to the arrival of Internet culture and has since become something of a cult favorite among Disney fans at the time For The Emperor s New Groove the film has comedic timing and slapstick comedy that has been compared to classic Looney Tunes As a result numerous internet memes based on screenshots from the film have emerged via social media groups such as Llamaposting with content such as Pacha s just right gesture as an image macro representing perfection or during the Covid Pandemic a meme featuring Kronk documenting Apocalypse Bingo br br DisneyToon Studios produced a direct to video sequel titled Kronk s New Groove which was released on December followed by an animated television series on Disney Channel titled The Emperor s New School Patrick Warburton Eartha Kitt and Wendie Malick reprised their roles
