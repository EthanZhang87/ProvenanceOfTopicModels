Vivisteria flowers a species that can thrive in any environment which she was denied seeing in childhood With the station now flooded Gale provides Ember with an air bubble for safety while Wade pushes her underwater through the station Afterward Ember and Wade realize that they are able to touch without harming each other and share a dance but Ember remembers her duty to the Fireplace and her family s prejudice against water elements and breaks up with Wade While Ember is about the take over the Fireplace during a party Wade appears and declares his love for her while also accidentally

Alisha Mullally Fred Tatasciore Kari Wahlgren and Secunda Wood br br Peter Sohn who previously directed the short film Partly Cloudy and the feature film The Good Dinosaur pitched the concept of Elemental to Pixar based on the idea of whether fire and water could ever connect or not Sohn also said the idea for the film was inspired by his experiences as the son of immigrants in New York City in the s He stated My parents emigrated from Korea in the early s and built a bustling grocery store in the Bronx He also stated We were among many families who ventured to a new land with hopes and dreams all of us mixing into one big salad bowl of cultures languages and beautiful little neighborhoods That s what led me to Elemental br In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter Sohn says the film s seven year development period with Elemental is closely tied to his relationship with his family and the idea first started following the release of The Good Dinosaur He revealed that Ember was born in Element City but grew up in a fire town since the neighborhoods are split up He stated I am quite emotional about getting the characters and the story out for sure He also stated This movie is about thanking your parents and understanding their sacrifices My parents both passed away during the making of this thing And so it is hugely emotional and I m still processing a lot of it br Sohn stated at D The Official Disney Fan Club The concept of the city itself started off with Ember He also stated We thought What s the best city we can build to support Ember s journey of identity and belonging It started by thinking about a city that would be hard for fire and so we based it off of water The idea is that Water got to this area first and then Earth came so it became a delta Then they built a water infrastructure with water canals and elevated water channels everywhere making it even tougher for Ember Then Air came in after that and Fire was one of the last groups to come into the city Ember and Wade have chemistry despite the differences When Sohn first pitched the story and started developing it he asked himself What s fire Sohn also stated People can see it as a temper People can see it as passion As a practical thing fire burns and sparks but what does it mean to burn bright There are all these ingredients to what we already perceive as fire and that started to form Ember s personality It s the same thing for Wade Water can be transparent What does that mean He wears his emotions on his sleeve He goes with the flow That helped form these personalities that were already pretty opposite and then we had to find that Venn diagram of where they overlapped That s the hopeful magic I hope people can buy into the sparks the chemical reaction that could form a relationship br On May Pixar announced a new film titled Elemental with the anthropomorphic classical elements of fire water air and earth as its central theme with Sohn directing and Denise Ream producing Sohn and Ream reunite after having previously worked together on The Good Dinosaur On September during the D Expo Sohn Ream and Pete Docter presented a first look at the film Our story is based on the classic elements fire water land and air Some elements mix with each other and some don t Sohn stated What if these elements were alive Shortly after the unfinished animation footage a clip was screened showing Ember and Wade on a date walking through a park where Wade runs across water sliding and creating a rainbow br Production of the film was completed on March after the final frame was approved and seven years were spent on it both in the studio and at the filmmakers homes According to story artist Jason Katz the team finished the story while working remotely from home Sohn noted that he had tears in his eyes when the final frame was approved br The film is dedicated to Pixar animators Ralph Eggleston Thomas Gonzales Amber Martorelli and J Garrett Sheldrew all of whom died in As a tribute to Eggleston a sign reading Eat at Ralph s Two cents is seen in Element City br br Turning Red creative consultant Brenda Hsueh was hired to write the screenplay Ultimately John Hoberg and Kat Likkel and Hsueh received screenplay by credit while Sohn Hoberg and Likkel and Hsueh received story by credit br Sohn cited romantic films like Guess Who s Coming to Dinner Moonstruck You ve Got Mail Am lie My Big Fat Greek Wedding and The Big Sick as particular influences when he enjoyed leaning into the rom com as a storytelling genre Sohn used to doodle the periodic table in high school as an early form of expression with the movie s genesis saying There was this funny drawing that I remember discovering about like a fire and a water character and that triggering a whole lot of different ideas and I just couldn t stop drawing these new little things br David J Peterson who had constructed languages for Game of Thrones and Dune co created the Firish language br At one point Hoberg and Likkel suggested that the ending of the film depict Wade and Ember having had a baby made of steam a concept they fought for but ultimately did not include in early cuts of the film This was to ensure a more solid ending for the two leads and so that audiences would have something to look forward to in a potential future installment br br On September during the D Expo Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie were revealed to have been cast in the leading voice roles of Ember and Wade respectively When the full length trailer was released on March more cast members including Ronnie del Carmen Shila Ommi Wendi McLendon Covey Catherine O Hara Mason Wertheimer and Joe Pera were announced br When designing Ember and Wade Sohn knew that he wanted the characters voices to reflect their elements for Ember a smoky voice and Wade a cooler one Lewis was picked because of her role in The Half of It Sohn spoke on her performance in the feature saying that she could be hot tempered but still very appealing and stated She had a vulnerability in her voice that also she could straddle with being so sincere and authentic With Athie it was his role in the miniseries Oh Jerome No and his ability to cry that won over the director Sohn described a cry he made at a point in the series as sincere but hilarious and added Mamoudou has such a compassionate soul that when he was crying you just went with him in it br On May MotoGP driver Francesco Bagnaia was announced to be voicing a character named Pecco after his nickname This is the fifth Pixar film to feature a motorsports figure voicing a character after Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Jr in international dubs of Lightyear and numerous other NASCAR and Formula One drivers for the three films in the Cars franchise br br According to Variety at the Disney Content Showcase in Singapore on November Sohn says that some of the inspiration came from his real life family and marriage He showed a picture of him as a child with his parents saying Maybe it s because when I was a kid I really didn t appreciate or understand what it meant to be an immigrant to come to the U S and all the hard work that they did to give my brother and me our lives That was one big nugget that was just sitting with me On the other side I married someone that wasn t Korean and there was a lot of culture clash with that in my world And that brought to me to this idea of finding opposites And the question of what if fire fell in love with water came As an animator what could be a fun world to play with so the fire and water is one thing But then tying that to culture clash was part of that metaphor And then in that world all of a sudden this idea of sacrifice and understanding what our parents had given started to make the soup of what this film is He also talks about culture clash and diversity It has been the struggle of my life for sure understanding my place and what have I assimilated or my identity being a bifurcated identity It s always been there I assume that it ll be always a part of some amount of storytelling having that kind of that diversity Will it be a major thing I don t know But it s been a part of my life And I love trying to reflect what the teams that we ve worked with their lives and our lives into the work that we do br br Sohn also showed footage from the film at the Disney Content Showcase and stated that The film is about our differences that bring us together but it is a love story Hopefully the audiences will get a deeper understanding of the loss in their lives between the partners the friends or family Sohn stated that the portrayal of Element City was inspired by many earlier live action films such as Roman Holiday When addressed about similarities Sohn denied that Elemental is inspired by Avatar The Last Airbender despite their shared concept of personifying classical elements Sohn stated No it wasn t a touchstone but I love the show I saw it with my kids and it s great but we re so different from it There s no martial arts in our world There s not anything like that It s this city story with the romance and this family drama But I do appreciate the connection that people are making just cause they love that and hopefully they can love this too Sohn also stated Growing up I always saw my parents a certain way but then when I hit my s and got a real job versus working at my family shop I saw them as people That shift from parents to people affected me a great deal All the stories they told me of their journey here I took for granted until I was like Oh my God they did this without speaking the language They did this with no money My dad was a hotdog cart guy and he made all this I could never do that My empathy grew for them br br Element City was modeled after New York City as a series of immigrant neighborhoods composed of organic materials that would complement each element An example would be Fire Town which was constructed with ceramic metal and brick Production designer Don Shank says design ideas inspired new technology which inspired new design Sohn noted that he went into more detail about how the design and tech process went for designing Ember and Wade He believed personifying elements was a difficult challenge although he stated that air was not nearly as difficult to portray as fire and water having already personified clouds in Partly Cloudy The character Wade is incredibly complex with the biggest challenge being his transparency through creating visual effects In order to make him transparent enough the animators needed to find some middle ground for how to create the character br The set designers at the studio looked to cities like Venice and Amsterdam for inspiration The water canals and the buildings that surround cities have immense detail and thought put into them Due to the COVID pandemic during which most of the production took place the production team of the film was unable to travel to these cities for research so they spent many hours watching point of view city tours on YouTube to get inspiration for Element City To feel less like an alien version of real world cities production designer Don Shank and his team brainstormed the evolution of elemental beings and their civilization br For Elemental over cores were used across three large rooms on the Pixar campus a significant increase in computing power compared to previous Pixar films This required Pixar to upgrade and purchase additional computers for the film For context Toy Story employed cores Monsters Inc employed

irresistibly charming An official full length trailer was released on March set to Astral s High Five Charles Pulliam Moore of The Verge commented positively saying that the movie s visuals are as imaginative as they are delightful while noting that its tough to say whether Elemental s take on beats from Guess Who s Coming to Dinner will land with audiences especially considering how some of

sleeper hit br In the United States and Canada Elemental was released alongside The Flash and The Blackening and was originally projected to gross million from theaters in its opening weekend The film made million on its first day including million from Thursday night previews lowering estimates to million The film went on to debut to million finishing in second and marking the second lowest three day opening weekend for a Pixar film behind the million million with inflation opening of Toy Story in which sold significantly more tickets Deadline Hollywood and TheWrap attributed the reasons for the low opening being the film s marketing audiences getting used to waiting for Pixar films to be released on Disney instead of in theaters as a result of the COVID pandemic and competition from Spider Man Across the Spider Verse despite receiving positive word of mouth br In its second weekend the film made million finishing in second While the drop was noted as a good sign of future legs TheWrap noted it would take endurance of historical proportions for Elemental to make the comeback to profitability During Elemental s fourth weekend Variety wrote that while the film held well weeks

praising Pixar s unprecedented box office comeback upon the film grossing million worldwide Disney released an official statement in regards to the film s box office comeback with Tony Chambers Disney

said at the box office we re looking at now the film should do better than break even theatrically And then we have revenue from streaming theme parks and consumer products This will certainly be a profitable film for the Disney company The Hollywood Reporter noted that by the end of the summer box office season Elemental had grossed above million worldwide br Internationally Elemental did particularly well in South Korea which became the film s third largest market This was attributed to director Peter Sohn s Korean American background and the incorporation of elements that resonated

while PostTrak reported of filmgoers gave it a positive score with saying they would definitely recommend it br Following its premiere at Cannes early social media reactions to the film were reportedly positive while reviews from film critics were underwhelming ranking it among the studio s worst releases to date Critics generally praised the film s visuals but had a more divided reaction to its script Docter was surprised by the negative reviews and the overall mixed reception and believed that critics tendency to compare the film not only to other works but also to their own past successes led to pretty nasty reviews that overshadowed the film s merits According to some publications after its wider release the film started to get more positive reviews br James Berardinelli film critic for ReelViews awarded the film out of stars writing Every frame in Elemental is vivid and replete with detail In real time there s far too much going on to absorb The visuals from the amazing skyline shots to the less ostentatious presentations of the main characters are crisp and colorful Thomas Newman s score is nondescript but this isn t a musical so it obeys the cardinal rule of not being intrusive The voices are primarily provided by lesser known actors Catherine O Hara arguably being the highest profile name which enhances the viewer s immersion Ben Croll of TheWrap wrote With story beats and character turns that strain well beyond familiarity Elemental matches formal adventure with storytelling timidity Here is a new spin on the old formula livened up by advances in technology and delivered with real artistry Siddhant Adlakha of IndieWire gave the film a B and wrote in his review Despite its confused and overstuffed worldbuilding Elemental has enough charming moments to get by even if its meaning lies less in its ill conceived immigrant saga and more in the personal drama that lives a few layers beneath it Amy Nicholson of The New York Times called the film Oddly it s the most human rom com in years Leigh Paatsch of Herald Sun awarded the film out of stars writing The movie is great fun too landing in that hard to find yet easy to enjoy sweet spot where a relatable romantic comedy meets an exciting tale of both adventure and redemption br Dirk Libbey of CinemaBlend awarded the film out of stars writing People falling in love in animated films is certainly nothing new it happens all the time However we re never seen a major animation studio like Pixar produce such a purely romantic film as Elemental And yes you will cry Chris Bumbray of JoBlo com gave the film a out of stating At its heart Elemental is a rom com which oddly enough is a rare thing these days Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie who was great in the Netflix movie Uncorked have good chemistry and there s a sweetness to their tentative romance that hasn t been seen in a mainstream movie in too long Sometimes you almost forget you re watching animation as the two characters feel alive However at a certain point you realize this is a nice movie but perhaps not as resonant as their best work It s sweet and entertaining in the same way Onward is meaning it s second tier Pixar below the classics like Wall E and Up but far above any of the Cars movies Elio Lightyear etc Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media gave the film out of stars writing Elemental does touchingly delve into the challenges and triumphs of being the child of refugees and growing up immersed in a culturally homogenous community It shows both the comfort and strength of being around your own people br Jordan Mintzer from The Hollywood Reporter stated It may be the first work from Pixar to feel like it was generated entirely by AI Eileen Jones from Jacobin called the film so boring and unmemorable that it seems like a new low for the famed animation company Screen Daily s Tim Grierson noted that the film contains hints of the studio s wit and poignancy while lacking the inspired execution that once seemed so effortless Dan Kois from Slate praised the visuals of Element City but criticized the screenplay the chemistry between its two main characters and handling of different elemental groups within the film comparing the conflict between Ember and her family unfavorably to Turning Red Kois believed that Pixar known for its trademark humor earned plot twists and attention to detail needed to overhaul its formula to regain its former success David Fear of Rolling Stone criticized the film s heavy handed message writing The fact that Elemental can t seem to get past its own elevator pitch premise or avoid tripping over its teachable lessons much less wring laughs and sobs from an opposites attract love story is a bit of a shock It s so busy trying to pen an op ed that it forgets to give it a narrative structure and make it emotionally resonate That s just elementary br br Official website br Elemental at IMDb
