symbol In the same interview he still maintained that he does not believe in an afterlife stating I don t think there is life beyond death I don t But I do believe that we get this clarity in the last minute of our life The titles we achieved the honors we managed they all vanish You are left alone with you and your deeds and the things you didn t do And that moment of clarity gives you either peace or the most tremendous fear because you finally have no cover and you finally realize exactly who you are br In an interview for his book and exhibition Guillermo Del Toro at Home with Monsters he stated in A lot of Mexican Catholic dogma the way it s taught it s about existing in a state of grace which I found impossible to reconcile with the much darker view of the world and myself even as a child I couldn t make sense of impulses like rage or envy and when I was older more complex ones you know I felt there was a deep cleansing allowing for imperfection through the figure of a monster

watches three movies a day and lists Brazil Nosferatu Freaks and Bram Stoker s Dracula among his favourite films br Del Toro is also a fan of Japanese manga and anime having cited the Japanese anime
