U S Route or U S Highway US or Route was one of the original highways in the United States Numbered Highway System It was established on November with road signs erected the following year The highway which became one of the most famous roads in the United States ran from Chicago Illinois through Missouri Kansas Oklahoma Texas New Mexico and Arizona before terminating in Santa Monica in Los Angeles County California covering a total of miles km br It was recognized in popular culture by both the hit song Get Your Kicks on Route and the Route television series which aired on CBS from to It was also featured in the Disney Pixar animated feature film franchise Cars beginning in In John Steinbeck s novel The Grapes of Wrath the highway symbolizes escape loss and the hope of a new beginning Steinbeck dubbed it the Mother Road Other designations and nicknames include the Will Rogers Highway and the Main Street of America the latter nickname shared with U S Route br US was a primary route for those who migrated west especially during the Dust Bowl of the s and it supported the economies of the communities through which it passed People doing business along the route became prosperous and they later fought to keep it alive in the face of the growing threat of being bypassed by the more advanced controlled access highways of the Interstate Highway System in the s and s br US underwent many improvements and realignments over its lifetime but it was officially removed from the United States Highway System in after it was entirely replaced by segments of the Interstate Highway System Portions of the road that passed through Illinois Missouri Oklahoma New Mexico and Arizona have been communally designated a National Scenic Byway by the name Historic Route returning the name to some maps Several states have adopted significant bypassed sections of the former US into their state road networks as State Route and much of the former route within the San Bernardino County California is designated as County Route The corridor is also being redeveloped into U S Bicycle Route a part of the United States Bicycle Route System that was developed in the s br br In Lt Edward Fitzgerald Beale a naval officer in the service of the U S Army Corps of Topographical Engineers was ordered by the War Department to build a government funded wagon road along the th Parallel His secondary orders were to test the feasibility of the use of camels as pack animals in the southwestern desert This road became part of US br Parts of the original Route from prior to its official naming and commissioning can still be seen north of the Cajon Pass The paved road becomes a dirt road south of Cajon which was also the original Route br Before a nationwide network of numbered highways was adopted by the states auto trails were marked by private organizations The route that became US was covered by three highways br br The Lone Star Route passed through St Louis on its way from Chicago to Cameron Louisiana although US would take a shorter route through Bloomington rather than Peoria br The transcontinental National Old Trails Road led via St Louis to Los Angeles but was not followed until New Mexico Instead US used one of the main routes of the Ozark Trails system which ended at the National Old Trails Road just south of Las Vegas New Mexico Again a shorter route was taken here following the Postal Highway between Oklahoma City and Amarillo br The National Old Trails Road became the rest of the route to Los Angeles br Legislation for public highways first appeared in with revisions in but the government did not execute a national highway construction plan until Congress enacted an even more comprehensive version of the act in The original inspiration for a road between Chicago and Los Angeles was planned by entrepreneurs Cyrus Avery of Tulsa Oklahoma and John Woodruff of Springfield Missouri who lobbied the American Association of State Highway Officials AASHO for the creation of a route following the plans br From the outset public road planners intended US to connect the main streets of rural and urban communities along its course for the most practical of reasons Most small towns had no prior access to a major national thoroughfare br br The numerical designation was assigned to the Chicago to Los Angeles route on April in Springfield Missouri A placard in Park Central Square was dedicated to the city by the Route Association of Missouri and traces of the Mother Road are still visible in downtown Springfield along Kearney Street Glenstone Avenue College and St Louis streets and on Route to Halltown Missouri br Championed by Avery when the first talks about a national highway system began US was first signed into law in as one of the original U S Highways although it was not completely paved until Avery was adamant that the highway have a round number and had proposed number to identify it A controversy erupted over the number largely from delegates from Kentucky who wanted a Virginia Beach Los Angeles highway to be US and US between Chicago and Springfield Missouri Arguments and counterarguments continued throughout February including a proposal to split the proposed route through Kentucky into Route North to Chicago and Route South to Newport News The final conclusion was to have US run between Virginia Beach Virginia and Springfield Missouri and the Chicago L A route be US Avery and highway engineer John Page settled on which was unassigned despite the fact that in its entirety US was north of US br The state of Missouri released its state highway map with the highway labeled as US br After the new federal highway system was officially created Cyrus Avery called for the establishment of the U S Highway Association to promote the complete paving of the highway from end to end and to promote travel down the highway In in Tulsa the association was officially established with John T Woodruff of Springfield Missouri elected the first president In the association made its first attempt at publicity the Bunion Derby a footrace from Los Angeles to New York City of which the path from Los Angeles to Chicago would be on US br The publicity worked several dignitaries including Will Rogers greeted the runners at certain points on the route The race ended in Madison Square Garden where the first prize equal to in was awarded to Andy Hartley Payne a Cherokee runner from Oklahoma The U S Highway Association also placed its first advertisement in the July issue of the Saturday Evening Post The ad invited Americans to take US to the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles A U S Highway Association office in Oklahoma received hundreds of requests for information after the ad was published The association went on to serve as a voice for businesses along the highway until it disbanded in br Traffic grew on the highway because of the geography through which it passed Much of the highway was essentially flat and this made the highway a popular truck route The Dust Bowl of the s saw many farming families mainly from Oklahoma Arkansas Kansas and Texas heading west for agricultural jobs in California US became the main road of travel for these people often derogatorily called Okies or Arkies During the Depression it gave some relief to communities located on the highway The route passed through numerous small towns and with the growing traffic on the highway helped create the rise of mom and pop businesses such as service stations restaurants and motor courts all readily accessible to passing motorists br br Much of the early highway like all the other early highways was gravel or graded dirt Due to the efforts of the U S Highway Association US became the first highway to be completely paved in Several places were dangerous more than one part of the highway was nicknamed Bloody and gradually work was done to realign these segments to remove dangerous curves One section through the Black Mountains outside Oatman Arizona was fraught with hairpin turns and was the steepest along the entire route so much so that some early travellers too frightened at the prospect of driving such a potentially dangerous road hired locals to navigate the winding grade The section remained as US until and is still open to traffic today as the Oatman Highway Despite such hazards in some areas US continued to be a popular route br Notable buildings include the art deco styled U Drop Inn constructed in in Shamrock in Wheeler County east of Amarillo Texas listed on the National Register of Historic Places A restored Magnolia fuel station is also located in Shamrock as well as Vega in Oldham County west of Amarillo br During World War II more migration west occurred because of war related industries in California US already popular and fully paved became one of the main routes and also served for moving military equipment Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri was located near the highway which was locally upgraded quickly to a divided highway to help with military traffic When Richard Feynman was working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos he used to travel nearly miles km to visit his wife who was dying of tuberculosis in a sanatorium located on US in Albuquerque br In the s US became the main highway for vacationers heading to Los Angeles The road passed through the Painted Desert and near the Grand Canyon Meteor Crater in Arizona was another popular stop This sharp increase in tourism in turn gave rise to a burgeoning trade in all manner of roadside attractions including teepee shaped motels frozen custard stands Indian curio shops and reptile farms Meramec Caverns near St Louis began advertising on barns billing itself as the Jesse James hideout The Big Texan advertised a free ounce kg steak dinner to anyone who could consume the entire meal in one hour It also marked the birth of the fast food industry Red s Giant Hamburg in Springfield Missouri site of the first drive through restaurant and the first McDonald s in San Bernardino California Changes like these to the landscape further cemented s reputation as a near perfect microcosm of the culture of America now linked by the automobile br br Many sections of US underwent major realignments br In between the Illinois cities of Springfield and East St Louis US was shifted farther east to what is now roughly Interstate I The original alignment marked as Temporary followed the current Illinois Route IL br From downtown St Louis to Gray Summit Missouri US originally went down Market Street and Manchester Road which is largely Route In this route was changed and the original alignment was never viewed as anything more than temporary The planned route was down Watson Road which is now Route but Watson Road had not been completed yet br In Oklahoma from west of El Reno to Bridgeport US turned north to Calumet and then west to Geary then southwest across the South Canadian River over a suspension toll bridge into Bridgeport In a straighter cut off route was completed from west of El Reno to one mile km south of Bridgeport crossing over a span steel pony truss bridge over the South Canadian River bypassing Calumet and Geary by several miles br From west of Santa Rosa New Mexico to north of Los Lunas New Mexico the road originally turned north from current I along much of what is now US to near Las Vegas New Mexico followed roughly I then the decertified US through Santa Fe and Albuquerque to Los Lunas and then turned northwest along the present New Mexico State Road NM alignment to a point near Laguna In a straight line route was completed from west of Santa Rosa through Moriarty and east west through Albuquerque and west to Laguna This newer routing saved travelers as much as four hours of travel through New Mexico According to legend the rerouting was done at the behest of Democratic Governor Arthur T Hannett to punish the Republican Santa Fe Ring which had long dominated New Mexico out of Santa Fe br In the first freeway in Los Angeles was incorporated into US this was the Arroyo Seco Parkway later known as the Pasadena Freeway now again known as Arroyo Seco Parkway br br In the Oatman Highway through the Black Mountains was completely bypassed by a new route between Kingman Arizona and Needles California by the s Oatman Arizona was virtually abandoned as a ghost town br Since the s as Interstates were being constructed sections of US not only saw the traffic drain to them but often the route number itself was moved to the faster means of travel In some cases such as to the east of St Louis this was done as soon as the Interstate was finished to the next exit The displacement of US signage to the new freeways combined with restrictions in the Highway Beautification Act that often denied merchants on the old road access to signage on the freeway became factors in the closure of many established US businesses as travelers could no longer easily find or reach them br In US was extended from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica to end at US Alt today the intersection of Olympic and Lincoln Boulevards Even though there is a plaque dedicating US as the Will Rogers Highway placed at the intersection of Ocean Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard the highway never terminated there br US was rerouted around several larger cities via bypass or beltline routes to permit travelers to avoid city traffic congestion Some of those cities included Springfield Illinois St Louis Missouri Rolla Missouri Springfield Missouri Joplin Missouri and Oklahoma City Oklahoma The route was also a foundation for many chain stores back in the s sprouting up next to it to increase business and sales br br The beginning of the decline for US came in with the signing of the Interstate Highway Act by President Dwight D Eisenhower who was influenced by his experiences in as a young Army officer crossing the country in a truck convoy following the route of the Lincoln Highway and his appreciation of the Autobahn network as a necessary component of a national defense system br During its nearly year existence US was under constant change As highway engineering became more sophisticated engineers constantly sought more direct routes between cities and towns Increased traffic led to a number of major and minor realignments of US through the years particularly in the years immediately following World War II when Illinois began widening US to four lanes through virtually the entire state from Chicago to the Mississippi River just east of St Louis and included bypasses around virtually all of the towns By the early to mid s Missouri also upgraded its sections of US to four lanes complete with bypasses Most of the newer four lane paving in both states was upgraded to freeway status in later years br One notable remnant of US is Veterans Parkway signed as the Interstate Business route in Bloomington Illinois The sweeping curve on the southeast side of the city originally was intended to easily handle traffic at speeds up to miles per hour km h as part of an effort to make US an Autobahn equivalent for military transport br In the first major bypassing of US occurred in Oklahoma with the opening of the Turner Turnpike between Tulsa and Oklahoma City The new mile km toll road paralleled US for its entire length and bypassed each of the towns along US The Turner Turnpike was joined in by the new Will Rogers Turnpike which connected Tulsa with the Oklahoma Missouri border west of Joplin Missouri again paralleling US and bypassing the towns in northeastern Oklahoma in addition to its entire stretch through Kansas Both Oklahoma turnpikes were soon designated as I along with the US bypass at Tulsa that connected the city with both turnpikes br In some cases such as many areas in Illinois the new Interstate Highway not only paralleled the old US it actually used much of the same roadway A typical approach was to build one new set of lanes then move one direction of traffic to it while retaining the original set of lanes for traffic flowing in the opposite direction Then a second set of lanes for traffic flowing in the other direction would be constructed finally followed by abandoning the other old set of lanes or converting them into a frontage road br The same scenario was used in western Oklahoma when US was initially upgraded to a four lane highway such as from Sayre to Erick to the Texas border at Texola in and where the old paving was retained for westbound traffic and a new parallel lane built for eastbound traffic much of this section was entirely bypassed by I in and on two other sections from Canute to Elk City in and Hydro to Weatherford in both of which were upgraded with the construction of a new westbound lane in to bring the highway up to full interstate standards and demoting the old US paving to frontage road status In the initial process of constructing I across western Oklahoma the state also included projects to upgrade the through routes in El Reno Weatherford Clinton Canute Elk City Sayre Erick and Texola to four lane highways not only to provide seamless transitions from the rural sections of I from both ends of town but also to provide easy access to those cities in later years after the I bypasses were completed br br In New Mexico as in most other states rural sections of I were to be constructed first with bypasses around cities to come later However some business and civic leaders in cities along US were completely opposed to bypassing fearing loss of business and tax revenues In the New Mexico Legislature enacted legislation that banned the construction of interstate bypasses around cities by local request This legislation was short lived however due to pressures from Washington and threat of loss of federal highway funds so it was rescinded by br In Tucumcari and San Jon became the first cities in New Mexico to work out an agreement with state and federal officials in determining the locations of their I bypasses as close to their business areas as possible in order to permit easy access for highway travelers to their localities Other cities soon fell in line including Santa Rosa Moriarty Grants and Gallup although it wasn t until well into the s that most of those cities would be bypassed by I br br By the late s most of the rural sections of US had been replaced by I across New Mexico with the most notable exception being the mile km strip from the Texas border at Glenrio west through San Jon to Tucumcari which was becoming increasingly treacherous due to heavier and heavier traffic on the narrow two lane highway During and this section of US was often referred to by locals and travelers as Slaughter Lane due to numerous injury and fatal accidents on this stretch br Local and area business and civic leaders and news media called upon state and federal highway officials to get I built through the area Disputes over proposed highway routing in the vicinity of San Jon held up construction plans for several years as federal officials proposed that I run some five to six miles to km north of that city while local and state officials insisted on following a proposed route that touched the northern city limits of San Jon In November a truce was reached when federal highway officials agreed to build the I route just outside the city therefore providing local businesses dependent on highway traffic easy access to and from the freeway via the north south highway that crossed old US in San Jon I was completed from Glenrio to the east side of San Jon in and extended west to Tucumcari in including the bypasses around both cities br br Originally highway officials planned for the last section of US to be bypassed by interstates in Texas but as was the case in many places lawsuits held up construction of the new interstates The US Highway Association had become a voice for the people who feared the loss of their businesses Since the interstates only provided access via ramps at interchanges travelers could not pull directly off a highway into a business At first plans were laid out to allow mainly national chains to be placed in interstate medians Such lawsuits effectively prevented this on all but toll roads br Some towns in Missouri threatened to sue the state if the US designation was removed from the road though lawsuits never materialized Several businesses were well known to be on US and fear of losing the number resulted in the state of Missouri officially requesting the designation Interstate for the St Louis to Oklahoma City section of the route but it was denied In Arizona also saw its final stretch of highway decommissioned with the completion of I just north of Williams Arizona Finally with decertification of the highway by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials the following year US officially ceased to exist br With the decommissioning of US no single interstate route was designated to replace it with the route being covered by Interstate from Chicago to St Louis Interstate from St Louis to Oklahoma City Interstate from Oklahoma City to Barstow Interstate from Barstow to San Bernardino and a combination of California State Route I and State Route SR or I from San Bernardino across the Los Angeles metropolitan area to Santa Monica br br When the highway was decommissioned sections of the road were disposed of in various ways Within many cities the route became a business loop for the interstate Some sections became state roads local roads or private drives or were abandoned completely Although it is no longer possible to drive US uninterrupted all the way from Chicago to Los Angeles much of the original route and alternate alignments are still drivable with careful planning Some stretches are quite well preserved including one between Springfield Missouri and Tulsa Oklahoma Some sections of US still retain their historic foot wide m sidewalk highway form never having been resurfaced to make them into full width highways These old sections have a single paved lane concrete curbs to mark the edge of the lane and gravel shoulders for passing br Some states have kept the designation for parts of the highway albeit as state roads In Missouri Routes and are all original sections of the highway State Highway SH in Oklahoma remains as the alternate free route near its turnpikes Historic Route runs for a significant distance in and near Flagstaff Arizona Farther west a long segment of US in Arizona runs significantly north of I and much of it is designated as State Route SR This runs from Seligman to Kingman Arizona via Peach Springs A surface street stretch between San Bernardino and La Verne known as Foothill Boulevard to the east of Los Angeles retains its number as SR Several county roads and city streets at various places along the old route have also retained the number br br The first Route associations were founded in Arizona in and in Missouri incorporated in and Illinois Other groups in the other US states soon followed In the state of Missouri declared US in that state a State Historic Route The first Historic Route marker in Missouri was erected on Kearney Street at Glenstone Avenue in Springfield Missouri now replaced the original sign has been placed at Route State Park near Eureka Other historic markers now line at times sporadically the entire mile km length of road In many communities local groups have painted or stenciled the and U S Route shield or outline directly onto the road surface along with the state s name This is common in areas where conventional signage for Historic Route is a target of repeated theft by souvenir hunters br br Various sections of the road itself have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places The Arroyo Seco Parkway in the Los Angeles Area and US in New Mexico have been made into National Scenic Byways Williams Historic Business District and Urban Route Williams were added to the National Register of Historic Places in and respectively In the State of Missouri made the road a state scenic byway from Illinois to Kansas In the cities of Rancho Cucamonga Rialto and San Bernardino in California there are US signs erected along Foothill Boulevard and also on Huntington Drive in the city of Arcadia Historic Route signs may be found along the old route on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena and along Foothill Boulevard in San Dimas La Verne and Claremont California The city of Glendora California renamed Alosta Avenue its section of US by calling it Route Flagstaff Arizona renamed all but a few blocks of Santa Fe Avenue as Route Until when it was moved to the nearby Millennium Park the annual June Chicago Blues Festival was held each year in Grant Park and included a Route Roadhouse stage on Columbus Avenue a few yards north of old US Jackson Boulevard both closed to traffic for the festival and a block west of the route s former eastern terminus at US Lake Shore Drive Since Springfield Illinois has annually held its International Route Mother Road Festival in its downtown district surrounding the Old State Capitol br Many preservation groups have tried to save and even landmark the old motels and neon signs along the road in some states br In President Bill Clinton signed a National Route Preservation Bill that provided for million in matching fund grants for preserving and restoring the historic features along the route br In the World Monuments Fund added US to the World Monuments Watch as sites along the route such as gas stations motels caf s trading posts and drive in movie theaters are threatened by development in urban areas and by abandonment and decay in rural areas The National Park Service developed a Route Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary describing over one hundred individual historic sites As the popularity and mythical stature of US has continued to grow demands have begun to mount to improve signage return US to road atlases and revive its status as a continuous routing br The U S Route Recommissioning Initiative is a group that seeks to recertify US as a US Highway along a combination of historic and modern alignments The group s redesignation proposal does not enjoy universal support as requirements that the route meet modern US Highway system specifications could force upgrades that compromise its historic integrity or require US signage be moved to Interstate highways for some portions of the route br In the AASHTO designated the first sections of U S Bicycle Route part of the United States Bicycle Route System in Kansas and Missouri br br The National Museum of American History in Washington D C has a section on US in its America on the Move exhibition In the exhibit is a portion of pavement of the route taken from Bridgeport Oklahoma and a restored car and truck of the type that would have been driven on the road in the s Also on display is a Hamons Court neon sign that hung at a gas station and tourist cabins near Hydro Oklahoma a CABINS neon sign that pointed to Ring s Rest tourist cabins in Muirkirk Maryland as well as several post cards a traveler sent back to his future wife while touring the route br br Elk City Oklahoma has the National Route Transportation Museum which encompasses all eight states through which the Mother Road ran Clinton has the Oklahoma Route Museum designed to display the iconic ideas images and myths of the Mother Road A memorial museum to the Route s namesake Will Rogers is located in Claremore while his birthplace ranch is maintained in Oologah In Sapulpa the Heart of Route Auto Museum features a foot high m replica gas pump the world s tallest br Tulsa has multiple sites starting with the Cyrus Avery Centennial Plaza located at the east end of the historic th Street Bridge over which the route passed and which includes a giant sculpture weighing pounds kg called East Meets West The sculpture depicts the Avery family riding west in a Model T Ford meeting an eastbound horse drawn carriage In Avery Plaza Southwest opened at the west end of the bridge which features a neon park with replicas of the neon signs from Tulsa area Route motels of the era including the Tulsa Auto Court the Oil Capital Motel and the famous bucking bronco sign of the Will Rogers Motor Court Future plans for that site also include a Route Museum Also Tulsa has installed Route Rising a by foot by m sculpture on the road s former eastern approach to town at East Admiral Place and Mingo Road br On Tulsa s Southwest Boulevard between W rd and W th Streets there is a granite marker dedicated to Route as the Will Rogers Highway which features an image of namesake Will Rogers together with information on the route from Michael Wallis author of Route The Mother Road and at Howard Park just past W th Street three Indiana limestone pillars are dedicated to Route through Tulsa with Route devoted to Transportation Route devoted to Tulsa Industry and Native American Heritage and Route devoted to Art Deco Architecture and American Culture br At Southwest Blvd is the Route Historical Village which includes a tourism information center modeled after a s s gas station and other period appropriate artifacts such as the Frisco steam locomotive with train cars Elsewhere Tulsa has constructed twenty nine historical markers scattered along the mile route of the highway through Tulsa containing tourist oriented stories historical photos and a map showing the location of historical sites and the other markers The markers are mostly along the highway s post alignment down th Street with some along the road s path down Admiral Place br br The Route Association of Illinois maintains their Museum and Hall of Fame in Pontiac This free museum contains memorabilia and artifacts relating to Route particularly in Illinois as well as displays relating to the members of the Hall of Fame Among items on display are the VW Microbus and land yacht belonging to the late Bob Waldmire br br Over the years US received numerous nicknames Right after US was commissioned it was known as The Great Diagonal Way because the Chicago to Oklahoma City stretch ran northeast to southwest Later US was advertised by the U S Highway Association as The Main Street of America The title had also been claimed by supporters of US but the US group was more successful In the John Steinbeck novel The Grapes of Wrath the highway is called The Mother Road its prevailing title today Lastly US was unofficially named The Will Rogers Highway by the U S Highway Association in although a sign along the road with that name appeared in the John Ford film The Grapes of Wrath which was released in twelve years before the association gave the road that name A plaque dedicating the highway to Will Rogers is still located in Santa Monica California There are more plaques like this one can be found in Galena Kansas It was originally located on the Kansas Missouri state line but moved to the Howard Litch Memorial Park in br br US had its western terminus in California and covered miles km in the state The terminus was located at the Pacific Coast Highway then US Alternate and now SR in Santa Monica California The highway ran through major cities such as Santa Monica Los Angeles Pasadena and San Bernardino San Bernardino also contains one of the two surviving Wigwam Motels along US The highway had major intersections with US in Hollywood I in Los Angeles I and I in Barstow and US in Needles It also ran concurrent to I at California s very eastern end br br In Arizona the highway originally covered miles km in the state Along much of the way US paralleled I It entered across the Topock Gorge passing through Oatman along the way to Kingman Between Kingman and Seligman the route is still signed as SR Notably just between Seligman and Flagstaff Williams was the last point on US to be bypassed by an Interstate The route also passed through the once incorporated community of Winona Holbrook contains one of the two surviving Wigwam Motels on the route br br US covered miles km in the state and passed through many Indian reservations in the western half of New Mexico East of those reservations the highway passed through Albuquerque Santa Fe and Las Vegas As in Arizona in New Mexico U S paralleled I br br US covered miles km in the Texas Panhandle travelling in an east west line between Glenrio New Mexico and Texas and Texola Oklahoma Adrian in the western Panhandle was notable as the midpoint of the route East of there the highway passed through Amarillo famous for the Cadillac Ranch Conway Groom and Shamrock br br The highway covered miles km in Oklahoma Today it is marked by I west of Oklahoma City and SH east of there After entering at Texola US passed through Sayre Elk City and Clinton before entering Oklahoma City Beyond Oklahoma City the highway passed through Edmond on its way to Tulsa Past there US passed through Miami North Miami Commerce and Quapaw before entering Kansas where it covered only miles km Only three towns are located on the route in Kansas Galena Riverton and Baxter Springs br br US covered miles km in Missouri Upon entering from Galena Kansas the highway passed through Joplin From there it passed through Carthage Springfield where Red s Giant Hamburg the world s first drive thru stands Waynesville Devils Elbow Lebanon and Rolla before passing through St Louis br br US covered miles km in Illinois It entered Illinois in East St Louis after crossing the Mississippi River Near there it passed by Cahokia Mounds a UNESCO World Heritage Site The highway then passed through Hamel Springfield passing by the Illinois State Capitol Bloomington Normal Pontiac and Gardner It then entered the Chicago area originally through Joliet and later through Plainfield After passing through the suburbs U S entered Chicago itself where it terminated at Lake Shore Drive starting in
