The Lincoln Town Car is a model line of full size luxury sedans that was marketed by the Lincoln division of the American automaker Ford Motor Company Deriving its name from a limousine body style Lincoln marketed the Town Car from to with the nameplate previously serving as the flagship trim of the Lincoln Continental Produced across three generations for thirty model years the Town Car was marketed directly against luxury sedans from Cadillac and Chrysler br Marketed nearly exclusively as a four door sedan a two door sedan was offered for only many examples of the Town Car were used for fleet and livery limousine service From to its discontinuation the Town Car was the longest car produced by Ford worldwide becoming the longest mass production car sold in North America from to While not a direct successor of the Town Car the Lincoln MKS would become the longest American sedan until overtaken by the Cadillac CT br From until the Lincoln Town Car was assembled in Wixom Michigan Wixom Assembly alongside the Lincoln Continental LS and Mark VI VII and VIII After Wixom s closure Town Car production moved to Southwold Ontario St Thomas Assembly alongside the similar Ford Crown Victoria and the Mercury Grand Marquis The final Lincoln Town Car was produced on August br Within the Lincoln model line the Town Car was not directly replaced the nameplate was used from to to denote livery limousine hearse variants of the Lincoln MKT For the revived Continental replaced the MKS closely matching the Town Car in wheelbase and width br br br Background br br br Etymology br In the s a town car was a body design typically used for limousines The description originated from the horse drawn carriage that featured an open chauffeur s compartment with a fixed roof for the passengers During that era the fixed rear roof horse drawn carriage became a limousine and the term de Ville in French meant for town use In Edsel Ford purchased a custom built Lincoln L Series town car as a personal vehicle for his father Henry Ford br Later the sedan de Ville was used as a model name by Cadillac the primary rival to the Lincoln Continental from the s to the s br br br Continental Town Car br br br br br For Lincoln augmented its pre existing Continental lineup with the addition of two formal sedans known as the Town Car and Limousine Both new vehicles featured pillared construction and interiors of broadcloth and scotch grain leather as well as deep pile carpeting No options were offered all equipment including air conditioning being standard the Limousine came with a glass partition between the front and rear seats br In place of the reverse slant roofline used by all other Continentals including convertibles the Town Car Limousine was styled with a notchback roofline with a heavily padded vinyl top and an inset rear window In addition to the slightly restrained styling the change in the roofline was also functional To add rear seat legroom the rear seat was repositioned without any modification to the wheelbase In the years to follow both Imperial and Cadillac would redesign the rooflines on their own range topping vehicles the LeBaron and Fleetwood Sixty Special to appear more formal and limousine like br One of the rarest vehicles ever produced by Ford Motor Company Town Cars and Limousines were produced from until all were painted black br br br br For the Town Car name returned as a trim package option including leather seating surfaces and deeper cut pile carpeting For a limited edition produced Golden Anniversary Continental Town Car commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of Lincoln For the Town Car was introduced as a sub model of the Lincoln Continental model line On nearly all examples a vinyl top covered the rear half of the roof with a full length configuration optional A raised molding over the roof incorporated coach lamps on the B pillars For Lincoln introduced a two door variant of the Continental Town Car named the Town Coupe As with the Town Car the Town Coupe included a standard vinyl roof br As part of the redesign of the Lincoln roofline the Town Car adopted the oval opera windows of the Mark IV coupe with the Town Coupe given a large rectangular opera window br The Continental Town Car proved to be a success for the division becoming the most popular Lincoln vehicle of the s as the Mark IV and Mark V were not technically branded as Lincolns br br Lincoln Continental Town Cars br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br For the model year Lincoln became the final American brand to market downsized full size cars In its redesign the Lincoln Continental shifted from the largest production sedan in North America to a design with a smaller exterior footprint than Cadillac The Continental Town Car returned as the top trim for the Lincoln model range in its own downsizing the Mark series introduced the Continental Mark VI Though technically not badged a Lincoln the Mark VI shared its chassis and much of the body with the Continental to reduce development and production costs br While Lincoln had brought downsized model lines to production from a marketing standpoint the consolidation of the Continental Continental Town Car Town Coupe and the Mark VI proved catastrophic Following the early withdrawal of the slow selling Lincoln Versailles Lincoln Mercury dealers offered three highly similar vehicles across a wide price range in the same showroom The discontinuation of the Versailles also marked the return of Lincoln exclusively to the full size sedan segment leaving nothing to sell against European brand luxury vehicles br For the model year Lincoln underwent a revision to transition its full size model range from three nameplates to one commencing a multi year transition throughout all three Ford divisions For the Continental went on hiatus with Lincoln shifting the nameplate to a mid size sedan for The Mark VI ended its model cycle in for the Mark VII exited the full size segment shifting the Mark Series into a different market segment br br br First generation br br A model year removed from the extensive downsizing of its full size model range the Lincoln division underwent a revision of its nameplates Following the discontinuation of the compact Versailles sedan Lincoln was left marketing six nearly identical vehicles Continental Continental Town Car and Continental Mark VI all offered both as two door and four door sedans For the Lincoln Town Car was introduced consolidating the Continental and Continental Town Car into a single model line slotted below the Continental Mark VI br Identical to the Lincoln Continental the Lincoln Town Car was offered as a two door and four door sedan the Town Coupe nameplate was discontinued Largely overshadowed by its Continental Mark VI counterpart the Town Car two door was discontinued for As the Continental Mark VII was introduced for Lincoln pared its full size line down solely to the Town Car four door sedan br At the time of its launch the Town Car had been slated for replacement by front wheel drive model lines in anticipation of further volatility in fuel prices as fuel prices began to stabilize demand initially rose for the model line leading Lincoln Mercury to produce the Town Car through the s with few visible changes Over were sold in the highest ever for the model line However this increase was mostly due to an extended Town Car model year which ran from March to October instead of the usual month period Conversely the Town Car with its shortened model year only had sales of just over Although remaining Lincoln s top selling model calendar year sales declined each year for the Town Car between and This decline was mostly blamed on its aging design and the increased popularity of the Continental which had been fully redesigned for br br br Chassis br The Lincoln Continental Town Car utilized the Panther platform shared with Ford and Mercury Delayed to the model year due to engineering issues the Panther platform meant radically different exterior dimensions for the Lincoln models Although extended three inches in wheelbase over its Ford Mercury Mark VI coupe counterparts the versions would have the shortest wheelbase ever used for a full size Lincoln at the time inches shorter than its predecessor The Continental Town Car was the shortest Lincoln since the Versailles In the interest of fuel economy and handling the Panther chassis reduced weight by up to lb kg compared to the full size Lincolns As the lightest full size Lincoln in years the Continental Town Car came within less than pounds of the curb weight of the compact sized Versailles The new Panther platform meant reduced overall size better suspension geometry and upgraded power steering with a reduced turning diameter by over feet compared to the Lincoln Continental For gas pressurized shocks were added br To achieve better Corporate Average Fuel Economy CAFE results Ford discontinued the and big block V s in its full size cars For a hp kW PS L V the engine was marketed as a L V was standard A hp kW PS cu in L V was available as an option Following the introduction of the Lincoln Town Car in the cu in L V became the only available engine with the becoming an option for Ford and Mercury In Canada the V remained carbureted until In the V was revised to hp kW PS following a redesign of the fuel injection system with the introduction of sequential multi port fuel injection These engines are identifiable by their cast aluminum upper intake manifolds with a horizontal throttle body vertical throttle plate this replaced the traditional throttle body with a carburetor style top mounted air cleaner previously used Introduced in the Lincoln Continental for and marketed in all Panther platform vehicles in the Lincoln Town Car was equipped with the speed AOD automatic overdrive transmission the sole transmission of examples br All Town Cars from through were available with an optional trailer towing package that included dual exhausts a limited slip differential code K and an improved cooling package for the engine and transmission br br br Body br br br Exterior br During the late s the sales of the Lincoln Continental had held steady and the Continental Mark V would go on to outsell its Cadillac Eldorado counterpart In the development of the Lincoln Town Car the design themes of the Lincoln Continental and Mark V would both influence the exterior design of the Continental Town Car As with its predecessors the Town Car featured nearly flat body sides sharp edged fenders and a radiator style grille Hideaway headlamps gave way to exposed halogen headlamps the first on a full size Lincoln since Another first included fully framed door glass retractable vent windows were now standard in contrast to its Ford and Mercury counterparts the window frames were painted matte black While chrome trim remained around the headlamps and window frames in a break from Lincoln tradition it was deleted from the top of the fenders Though mechanically similar to the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis after the Lincoln Town Car shared visible body panels only with the Continental Mark VI In contrast to its Ford Mercury and Mark VI counterparts the rooflines of Town Cars feature a vertical quarter window in the C pillar br After only two door Town Cars were sold in the body style was discontinued for In the shift from rebadging the Continental to the Lincoln Town Car for Lincoln replaced the Continental badging above the headlights with Town Car which was removed in br A padded roof was standard equipment on all Town Cars with its design determined by trim level On standard trim Town Cars a leather grained vinyl full length covering with center pillar coach lamps was fitted For Signature Series and Cartier trims a padded vinyl coach roof covering the rear half of the roof with a frenched smaller rear window opening was fitted the coach roof was also an option on standard trim Town Cars On non Cartier Town Cars a full length cloth canvas roof was an option imitating the look of a convertible the design deleted the C pillar quarter windows br During the s the Lincoln Town Car would undergo several exterior revisions For the model was given a mid cycle facelift In addition to slightly improving its aerodynamics the design was intended to visually shorten the car though the length was essentially unchanged The front and rear bumpers were redesigned better integrating them into the bodywork The rear fascia was redesigned distinguished by redesigned taillamps and the trunk lid was better integrated with the rear fenders For to meet federal regulations a center brake light was added in the rear window For the grille was updated with a brushed metal panel between the taillamps which now featured the reverse lamps br models are distinguished by special trim features including satin black paint for grille blades trim between headlights and amber instead of clear front parking lamps The Lincoln front end badging is moved from above the left headlight onto the grille and changed to a large sans serif script In the rear the brushed metal panel was given a pinstripe finish and all badging was moved from the panel onto the trunk lid All models feature a landau roof with a smaller more formal frenched rear window All non Cartier models also include an embedded Lincoln star emblems in their opera windows br br br Interior br The interior of the Lincoln Town Car featured many advanced luxury options for its time Signature Series and Cartier models featured way power seats and manual seatback recliners for the driver and front passenger the Lincoln Town Car adopted a split front bench seat previously seen on the Mark coupes Several electronic features included an optional digital display trip computer showing the driver miles to empty and based on driver input an estimated time of arrival A keypad based keyless entry system unlocked the vehicle through a digit combination factory programmed or owner programmed Mounted above the driver s door handle the keypad allowed the driver to lock all four doors after entering the code the driver could unlock the doors or release the trunk lid Along with keyfob based systems the keypad system is still in use on Ford and Lincoln vehicles as of br As part of the update the Lincoln Town Car was the first Ford vehicle to feature a CD player as an option as part of a speaker JBL premium stereo system while was the final year for the option of track players and CB radios for the Town Car In a functional change the horn button was moved from the turn signal lever to the steering wheel hub The door trim was changed from wood to upholstery matching the seats br For the front seat head restraints were replaced with a taller way articulating design walnut burl trim replaced much of the satin black trim on the lower dash For the instrument cluster was updated for Town Cars with analog gauges the instrument panel was given round dials in square bezels In addition new wood trim was added to the dashboard and steering wheel br br Lincoln Town Car br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Trim br At its launch the Lincoln Town Car was offered in two trim levels a standard base trim and a Lincoln Town Car Signature Series a name shared with the Mark VI though with less exclusive features In Lincoln adopted the Mark Series tradition of Designer Series editions as the Cartier Edition was shifted from the Mark VI to the Town Car becoming the top trim level the Cartier Edition would remain part of the Town Car line through the model year br br br Special editions br Cartier Designer Edition br In in a trim level shift the Cartier Edition was moved from the Mark Series to the Lincoln Town Car As before the special edition package consisted of exclusively coordinated exterior colors and interior designs with the Cartier logo embroidered in place of the Lincoln star emblem on the seats For the package underwent a redesign with a new upholstery design and new two tone metallic beige platinum added alongside the traditional platinum silver and two tone arctic white br Sail America Commemorative EditionThis special edition Signature Series model came in white with a blue carriage roof and had a white leather interior with blue piping and special badging Ford Motor Company was one of the corporate sponsors of the Sail America Foundation syndicate and owner of the America s Cup winning yacht Stars Stripes br Special EditionThe Town Car Signature Series was available with a in Special Edition package which included a carriage roof giving the appearance of a convertible top wire spoke aluminum wheels JBL audio system leather wrapped steering wheel and leather upholstery with contrasting color piping This replaced a proposed Gucci edition Town Car that had been in the works br Gucci Edition Signature Series Gucci Edition had a special blue canvas roof with fluorescent B pillar light and a special blue badge on the C pillar with the word signature It was designated in the VIN as code br br br Marketing br For the model year the Cadillac DeVille and Fleetwood traditional competitors of the Lincoln Town Car shifted to front wheel drive platforms although the Fleetwood Brougham retained its rear drive platform and styling At the time Lincoln marketed the larger size of the Town Car as a selling point In response to the downsized Cadillacs Lincoln introduced a series of advertisements in late titled The Valet which depicted parking attendants having trouble distinguishing Cadillacs from lesser Buicks Electras and Oldsmobiles Ninety Eights with the question Is that a Cadillac answered by the response No it s an Oldsmobile or Buick At the end the owner of a Lincoln would appear with the line The Lincoln Town Car please The commercial campaign saw the emergence of a new advertising slogan for the brand Lincoln What a Luxury Car Should Be which was used into the s The marketing campaign was unable to turn around declining Town Car sales It was only after an all new redesigned Town Car was introduced in for the model year that sales temporarily rebounded br br br Production br br br Second generation FN br br After ten years on the market nine of them as the Town Car relatively unchanged the Lincoln Town Car was given an extensive redesign inside and out being launched on October as a model In a move to bring a new generation of buyers to the Lincoln brand the Town Car adopted a far more contemporary image bringing it in line with the Continental and Mark VII In addition the Town Car adopted a new range of safety and luxury features and would mark the debut of a powertrain that would see usage in a wide variety of Ford Motor Company vehicles The Town Car was named the Motor Trend Car of the Year br The Town Car s redesign gave the model a significant sales boost in helping Lincoln achieve record total sales that year The second generation Town Car became one of the best selling full size U S luxury sedans Town Car sales quickly declined again and would drop below in for the first time in over ten years This decline mirrored what had been going on in the luxury car market as buyers tastes shifted more towards nimbler performance oriented models and eventually SUVs br Following the discontinuation of the Cadillac Fleetwood by General Motors after the Lincoln Town Car became the longest length regular production sedan sold in the United States br br br Development br The second generation Town Car was developed from until under the codename FN at a cost of US million led by project manager John Jay Following its downsizing to the Panther platform in the Lincoln Town Car was originally slated to be discontinued by the middle of the decade and replaced by a smaller front wheel drive sedan after the fuel crisis gasoline prices were predicted to reach per gallon and Ford Motor Company had lost billion for However by full size Lincoln sales had rapidly increased with sales up over Instead of ending the product cycle of the Lincoln Town Car Ford product planners instead chose its front wheel drive mid size platform of the Ford Taurus to become the next generation Lincoln Continental br In August Ford designers began sketching and constructing clay models of competing designs under lead designer Gale Halderman and Ford Group Design Vice President Jack Telnack with a final design chosen in May two full scale proposals were reviewed by a four member design committee chaired by CEO Donald Petersen Jack Telnack Ford President Harold Poling and William Clay Ford vice chairman Various proposals were considered ranging from a conservative update of the existing Town Car to a European style body in the design language of the Lincoln Continental FN designed in br The final compromise of the committee sought to keep the identity of the Town Car while introducing a contemporary vehicle for the s In the interest of fuel economy the Lincoln Town Car was required to become more aerodynamic reducing wind noise but key parts of its design were integrated into its design with its radiator style grille chrome trim and opera windows In a major design constraint the design team was not to make any major reductions in size to the Town Car preserving its large interior and trunk space as key marketing points to buyers br In a second factor driving the design of the FN project was initiated as the United States government introduced regulations mandating passive restraints on vehicles produced after September along with automatic seat belts out of necessity automakers began to reconsider the use of airbags as passive restraints By dual airbags remained nearly unused in cars sold in the United States with the exception of the Mercedes S Class Mercedes Benz W and the Porsche To comply with the legislation Lincoln introduced the Continental with dual airbags becoming the first Ford Motor Company and first domestically produced vehicle with them standard As adding airbags to the Town Car would require a redesign of the steering column and entire dashboard dual airbag were moved to the FN project making them an intended standard feature br In March the design freeze for the project occurred with an intended production start of mid The second generation Lincoln Town Car would become the first domestic Ford vehicle engineered outside of the company and constructed by foreign suppliers with International Automotive Design of Worthing West Sussex England handling the engineering while Japan based Ogihara Iron Works supplying all of the Town Car body panels from its own factory near the Wixom plant To improve quality of prototypes project managers broke from automotive industry precedent requiring successive hand built prototypes to be built to production level quality to determine the locations and causes of specific issues of tooling and manufacturing From until the Town Car would go from over a year behind its production date to two weeks ahead of schedule br br br Chassis br To lower the development and production costs of the extensive redesign Ford Motor Company retained the Panther platform for the Lincoln Town Car continuing its use of rear wheel drive In a major change rear air suspension introduced as an option for all three Panther vehicles in became standard equipment on all Town Cars For the Town Car was produced with inch rear drum brakes identical to its predecessor for they were replaced by inch solid rotor disc brakes br Due to development delays in the Modular engine program the Lincoln Town Car was released with the same powertrain as its predecessor the hp kW PS cu in L small block V engine with a speed AOD overdrive automatic In October the marketed as L V was replaced by a hp kW PS L SOHC Modular V for models for the model year the optional hp dual exhaust version of the engine became standard Shared with the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis the SOHC version of the L Modular V would see use in a number of other Ford vehicles within the Ford light truck line remaining in production into For the AOD transmission was converted to electronic operation becoming the AOD E In along with a mid cycle refresh the Town Car received the higher torque R W from the Lincoln Mark VIII br br br Body br The second generation Lincoln Town Car was designed by Gale Halderman and Ford Group Design Vice President Jack Telnack br br br Exterior br In its redesign for the model year Lincoln stylists sought a completely new design for the Town Car Many traditional Lincoln styling cues were heavily reworked or abandoned completely Although the Town Car would keep its formal notchback sedan roofline the flat sided fenders and angular lines seen since the Continentals and Mark IIIs of the late s disappeared Stylists made the body more aerodynamic reducing the drag coefficient from to matching the Continental and besting the Mark VII The Town Car still retained several styling influences including its vertical taillights radiator style grille hood ornament alloy wheels and vertical C pillar window In a move to market the Town Car to buyers of contemporary vehicles several other changes were made Although two tone paint remained available featuring a lower body accent color in gray metallic monotone paint schemes would become increasingly standard In a major change a vinyl roof was no longer offered since vinyl roofs declined in popularity among many buyers Spoked aluminum wheels were dropped from the options list for while locking wire wheel discs remained through br In late the exterior was given a minor update with a new grille and slightly redesigned tail lamp lenses distinguished by a checkerboard pattern for models As with the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis the Town Car received a larger update for the model year in late as the FN This facelift is distinguished by the deletion of the fixed quarter glass in the rear doors along with the redesign of the side mirrors enlarged and changed to body color Although the bumper largely remained unchanged the front fascia was updated as the headlamp clusters are changed to a clear lens design and separated from the grille The grille was redesigned returning to the design in a surround fitting closer to the body The rear fascia saw the trim between the tail lamps redesigned featuring additional running lights while the reverse lamps were moved from the outer edges of the reflector panel to the center beneath the lid lock cover similar to the models br br br Interior br In a departure from the Lincoln Continental and Mark VII the use of the Panther platform necessitated a degree of component sharing with the Ford and Mercury counterparts Although fitted with its own seats and door panels the Town Car was fitted with essentially the same dashboard as the Mercury Grand Marquis versions with digital instruments retained the instrument panel layout from until In the wood trim was changed to an orange toned walnut Due to its popularity and to better separate the Town Car from its Ford Mercury counterparts the digital instrument panel was made standard as such the climate control system was converted to a digital display New for the model year was an integrated voice activated in car cellular telephone concealed in the center armrest which featured a speakerphone as well as a rearview mirror mounted microphone for hands free calling br As part of its Mid cycle refresh the interior saw a greater degree of change than the exterior To bring the design up to date and in line with the rest of the Lincoln line the dashboard and door panels featured a curved design while influenced by the Mark VIII the passenger design of the Town Car precluded the adoption of a center console in the interior To increase storage space the dual center armrests of the front seats on Signature and Cartier models were redesigned to include storage compartments to hold cassettes and the optional cellular telephone The dashboard design continued into the new door panels now with an illuminated power window and seat adjuster cluster and a back lit power door lock switch placed higher on the door Releases for the trunk and fuel door were moved from the dashboard onto the lower driver s door Redesigned seat patterns now offered an available driver and front passenger electric heat feature The radio antenna was integrated into the rear window Although the basic controls of the interior remained common across all Panther vehicles the Town Car gained a model specific instrument panel featuring italicized readouts br For the climate controls were again redesigned while Cartier Designer Editions featured genuine wood trim on the dashboard and door panels In a few changes were made the rear center armrest added a pair of cup holders while Cartier models gained rear seat vanity mirrors mounted in the headliner Also in the trim level badges were moved to the front fenders in place of the Town Car badges Subsequently the rear side opera windows no longer featured their trim level engravings br br Lincoln Town Car br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Trim br Upon its redesign in

way front power seats a four speed automatic overdrive transmission cloth seating surfaces fifteen inch tires dashboard clock and keyless entry with Ford s SecuriCode keyless entry keypad br The Signature Series added a digital vacuum fluorescent instrument cluster trip computer and standard alloy wheels The Cartier Edition was fitted with the same features as the Signature Series adding a JBL branded sound system with an amplifier a security system alloy spoked wheels and other details such as cloth and leather seats In a departure from tradition starting in Cartier Designer Edition Town Cars were no longer available in a single color combination yearly but in several different interior exterior combinations In addition aside from gray lower body trim offered as an option for Signature Series Town Cars Cartier Editions became the only two tone versions of the Town Car br br br Special editions br br In addition to the three standard trims of the Lincoln Town Car various special edition option packages were produced by Lincoln excluding dealer produced versions br Jack Nicklaus Signature Series The Jack Nicklaus Signature Series was a special edition option package for the Town Car Signature Series featured a green exterior with a white top the interior consisted of white leather with green accents Another version of the package was sold with a white exterior and a standard roof the interior trim was similar with white leather seats and green carpets and trim br Most Jack Nicklaus editions have ornaments and wording on the exterior trimmed in gold

Cartier Editions optional on Signature Series the memory seats featured an way adjustment for both seats and inflatable lumbar support While technically a carryover feature from the Electrochromic Dimming Mirror was redesigned for the much wider rear window of the new Town Car br A number of advances were made in the safety features available for the Lincoln Town Car with ABS becoming an optional feature in Following the return of wheel disc brakes to the Town Car in for the first time since ABS became standard in Initially the Town Car came with dual airbags as standard equipment However due to a March fire at the facility where the passenger airbag s propellant was produced the passenger airbag essentially became a delete option with a credit on the window sticker issued for the price of the missing airbag Upon the owner s request for the price of the issued credit the passenger airbag would be installed once supply became available By the beginning of the model year all

with the Lincoln Navigator the first SUV sold by the Lincoln division br Due to organizational restructuring the third generation Town Car marked several changes within Lincoln Mercury From to the Lincoln Mercury division became a brand of Premier Automotive Group a division of Ford created to manage its premium automotive brands acquired during the s following organizational difficulties leading to Lincoln once again falling behind Cadillac in sales by Lincoln Mercury was restored under its previous divisional structure during As part of The Way Forward the closure of Wixom Assembly Plant was announced initially putting the future of the Town Car at risk To continue the Town Car for the model year production was transferred to the St Thomas Assembly plant in Canada alongside the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis br br br Chassis Powertrain br Under the hood the L V received a power increase to hp on single exhaust versions and hp on dual exhaust versions In a functional change the coil packs were replaced by a coil on plug ignition system Also fail safe cooling was introduced it included a two speed electronic radiator fan Additionally the R W transmission was carried over and mandated the use of Ford s Mercon V fluid Visually several components were re located the coolant reservoir was moved from the passenger fender well and onto the radiator fan shroud while the power steering reservoir was moved from the driver side fender well to the front of the engine Notably the Town Car received an engine knock sensor its Ford and Mercury counterparts did not receive one until br In another change the frame was updated to a full perimeter unit To improve handling all Town Cars received a Watt s Linkage fitted to the rear suspension For better stopping power dual piston front calipers and larger brake rotors were introduced which necessitated the use of larger inch wheel designs br For the model year the L V received Performance Improved PI cylinder heads which increased horsepower to hp on single exhaust versions and hp on dual exhaust versions br br br Body br br br Exterior br While three inches shorter than its predecessor the Town Car gained two inches in width and an inch in height becoming the tallest Lincoln sedan in years In a major break from Lincoln styling tradition the Town Car abandoned many of the straight edged lines of its predecessor Adopting styling cues of the outgoing Mark VIII and the Continental the Town Car adopted a curved design scheme in place of the previous straight lined body While the radiator grille was retained its rectangular shape was changed to oval its waterfall pattern was adopted by the Lincoln Navigator introduced alongside it and the hood ornament was deleted In a reversal from the Town Car badging was returned to the front fenders trim badging was moved to the C pillar br The curved design scheme carried further to the rear of the Town Car in the C pillar losing its opera windows into the trunk lid To differentiate from its Mercury counterpart the Town Car switched to individual tail lamps deleting the filler panel on the trunk lid a large chrome surround was used on the trunk lid to mount the license plate br With the introduction of the Town Car L in the wheelbase was stretched by six inches To produce the variant at a lower cost the B pillar was widened on

year the Executive Series regained its rear seat center armrest initially deleted in a cost cutting move A new in vehicle telematics system called RESCU included a rearview mirror with integrated microphone and SOS and roadside assistance buttons and replaced the previous in car telephone with a portable Motorola Timeport cellular telephone that now featured voice recognition The system was discontinued after the model year br br Lincoln Town Car interior br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Update and Re engineering br Ford re engineered the Panther platform for with the Lincoln Town Car once again receiving the most extensive revisions of all Panther platform vehicles Despite these updates the Town Car remained as a third generation model until the end of production in br Extensive chassis updates were made which included a new frame it now utilized hydro formed frame rails an aluminum cross member and was also fully boxed According to Lincoln the new frame improved safety as well as chassis rigidity its resistance to vertical bending was increased by and overall rigidity by The long running recirculating ball steering setup was replaced by a speed sensitive rack and pinion setup it was lighter than the outgoing unit featured electronic variable assist and increased steering precision while also reducing service complexity For more precise handling aluminum front lower control arms new front upper control arms updated steering knuckles and coil over front shocks were all adopted Inverted mono tube rear shocks were also introduced they were also mounted to the outside of the frame rails Moreover improved brakes were introduced that featured a quiet EBD brake booster and mechanical panic assist they optimized front rear brake bias To add these revisions required that the Town Car use larger inch wheels with a high positive offset flat face design br Mechanically the Town Car also received several updates A slightly revised L V was now paired to dual exhaust on all Town Cars the exhaust system was also completely redesigned with exhaust hangers now mounted to the frame rails for a reduction in NVH These changes resulted in the Town Car producing hp and lb ft of torque this would be the final power increase for the Town Car For better off the line acceleration all Town Cars received a rear axle ratio shared with the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor To increase oil life the engine oil pan s capacity was enlarged to quarts Furthermore a variable speed electronic radiator fan replaced the outgoing two speed unit For improved carbon emissions the EGR system was updated and the fuel system was now return less Visually the updated engine could be distinguished from its predecessor by a new engine cover which featured a silver V emblem fan shroud mounted power steering reservoir formerly bolted to the engine passenger side oil fill cap was on the driver side passenger side engine fuse box was on the driver inner fender and an accessory belt guard br Until the end of production minor mechanical revisions would continue to be made For the Town Car adopted electronic throttle control the move necessitated that the cruise function be moved to the engine computer and also required further electronic controls for the transmission now renamed as the R E Furthermore the spline axle was replaced by an improved spline unit In a minor change the Town Car received a heated PCV valve br For the transmission received internal revisions once again and was renamed as the R E br As production was moved to St Thomas Assembly for the rear air suspension was permanently deleted in favor of a traditional coil spring setup br All Town Cars received Flex Fuel capability for enabling them to run on E gasoline or any mixture of both br br br Exterior br As part of the update the entire body of the Town Car was restyled in an evolutionary fashion To bring it in line with contemporary Lincoln vehicles the lower body was squared off and the oval grille was redesigned in the style of the Lincoln LS the hood ornament made its return after a year absence Additionally the extended wheelbase Town Car L received model specific widened rear door glass Also the long running Town Car badges were deleted from the front fenders Moreover while styled similarly to its predecessor the rear fascia was updated and the Town Car badge returned to the trunk lid for the first time since br br br Interior br Several revisions were also made to the interior for While the
