id: 19009060
Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human traits emotions or intentions to non human entities It is considered to be an innate tendency of human psychology Personification is the related attribution of human form and characteristics to abstract concepts such as nations emotions and natural forces such as seasons and weather Both have ancient roots as storytelling and artistic devices and most cultures have traditional fables with anthropomorphized animals as characters People have also routinely attributed human emotions and behavioral traits to wild as well as domesticated animals br br Anthropomorphism and anthropomorphization derive from the verb form anthropomorphize itself derived from the Greek nthr pos lit human and morph form It is first attested in originally in reference to the heresy of applying a human form to the Christian God br br From the beginnings of human behavioral modernity in the Upper Paleolithic about years ago examples of zoomorphic animal shaped works of art occur that may represent the earliest known evidence of anthropomorphism One of the oldest known is an ivory sculpture the L wenmensch figurine Germany a human shaped figurine with the head of a lioness or lion determined to be about years old br It is not possible to say what these prehistoric artworks represent A more recent example is The Sorcerer an enigmatic cave painting from the Trois Fr res Cave Ari ge France the figure s significance is unknown but it is usually interpreted as some kind of great spirit or master of the animals In either case there is an element of anthropomorphism br This anthropomorphic art has been linked by archaeologist Steven Mithen with the emergence of more systematic hunting practices in the Upper Palaeolithic He proposes that these are the product of a change in the architecture of the human mind an increasing fluidity between the natural history and social intelligences where anthropomorphism allowed hunters to identify empathetically with hunted animals and better predict their movements br br In religion and mythology anthropomorphism is the perception of a divine being or beings in human form or the recognition of human qualities in these beings br Ancient mythologies frequently represented the divine as deities with human forms and qualities They resemble human beings not only in appearance and personality they exhibited many human behaviors that were used to explain natural phenomena creation and historical events The deities fell in love married had children fought battles wielded weapons and rode horses and chariots They feasted on special foods and sometimes required sacrifices of food beverage and sacred objects to be made by human beings Some anthropomorphic deities represented specific human concepts such as love war fertility beauty or the seasons Anthropomorphic deities exhibited human qualities such as beauty wisdom and power and sometimes human weaknesses such as greed hatred jealousy and uncontrollable anger Greek deities such as Zeus and Apollo often were depicted in human form exhibiting both commendable and despicable human traits Anthropomorphism in this case is more specifically anthropotheism br From the perspective of adherents to religions in which humans were created in the form of the divine the phenomenon may be considered theomorphism or the giving of divine qualities to humans br Anthropomorphism has cropped up as a Christian heresy particularly prominently with Audianism in third century Syria but also fourth century Egypt and tenth century Italy This often was based on a literal interpretation of the Genesis creation myth So God created humankind in his image in the image of God he created them male and female he created them br Hindus do not reject the concept of a deity in the abstract unmanifested but note practical problems The Bhagavad Gita Chapter Verse states that it is much more difficult for people to focus on a deity that is unmanifested than one with form remarking on the usage of anthropomorphic icons murtis that adherents can perceive with their senses br br Some religions scholars and philosophers objected to anthropomorphic deities The earliest known criticism was that of the Greek philosopher Xenophanes BCE who observed that people model their gods after themselves He argued against the conception of deities as fundamentally anthropomorphic br br But if cattle and horses and lions had handsor could paint with their hands and create works such as men do horses like horses and cattle like cattlealso would depict the gods shapes and make their bodiesof such a sort as the form they themselves have Ethiopians say that their gods are snub nosed and blackThracians that they are pale and red haired Xenophanes said that the greatest god resembles man neither in form nor in mind br Both Judaism and Islam reject an anthropomorphic deity believing that God is beyond human comprehension Judaism s rejection of an anthropomorphic deity began with the prophets who explicitly rejected any likeness of God to humans Their rejection grew further after the Islamic Golden Age in the tenth century which Maimonides codified in the twelfth century in his thirteen principles of Jewish faith br In the Ismaili interpretation of Islam assigning attributes to God as well as negating any attributes from God via negativa both qualify as anthropomorphism and are rejected as God cannot be understood by either assigning attributes to Him or taking them away The th century Ismaili philosopher Abu Yaqub al Sijistani suggested the method of double negation for example God is not existent followed by God is not non existent This glorifies God from any understanding or human comprehension br In secular thought one of the most notable criticisms began in with Francis Bacon who argued against Aristotle s teleology which declared that everything behaves as it does in order to achieve some end in order to fulfill itself Bacon pointed out that achieving ends is a human activity and to attribute it to nature misconstrues it as humanlike Modern criticisms followed Bacon s ideas such as critiques of Baruch Spinoza and David Hume The latter for instance embedded his arguments in his wider criticism of human religions and specifically demonstrated in what he cited as their inconsistence where on one hand the Deity is painted in the most sublime colors but on the other is degraded to nearly human levels by giving him human infirmities passions and prejudices In Faces in the Clouds anthropologist Stewart Guthrie proposes that all religions are anthropomorphisms that originate in the brain s tendency to detect the presence or vestiges of other humans in natural phenomena br Some scholars argue that anthropomorphism overestimates the similarity of humans and nonhumans and therefore could not yield accurate accounts br br There are various examples of personification in both the Hebrew Bible and Christian New Testaments as well as in the texts of some other religions br br Anthropomorphism also referred to as personification is a well established literary device from ancient times The story of The Hawk and the Nightingale in Hesiod s Works and Days preceded Aesop s fables by centuries Collections of linked fables from India the Jataka Tales and Panchatantra also employ anthropomorphized animals to illustrate principles of life Many of the stereotypes of animals that are recognized today such as the wily fox and the proud lion can be found in these collections Aesop s anthropomorphisms were so familiar by the first century CE that they colored the thinking of at least one philosopher br br And there is another charm about him namely that he puts animals in a pleasing light and makes them interesting to mankind For after being brought up from childhood with these stories and after being as it were nursed by them from babyhood we acquire certain opinions of the several animals and think of some of them as royal animals of others as silly of others as witty and others as innocent br Apollonius noted that the fable was created to teach wisdom through fictions that are meant to be taken as fictions contrasting them favorably with the poets stories of the deities that are sometimes taken literally Aesop by announcing a story which everyone knows not to be true told the truth by the very fact that he did not claim to be relating real events The same consciousness of the fable as fiction is to be found in other examples across the world one example being a traditional Ashanti way of beginning tales of the anthropomorphic trickster spider Anansi We do not really mean we do not really mean that what we are about to say is true A story a story let it come let it go br br Anthropomorphic motifs have been common in fairy tales from the earliest ancient examples set in a mythological context to the great collections of the Brothers Grimm and Perrault The Tale of Two Brothers Egypt th century BCE features several talking cows and in Cupid and Psyche Rome nd century CE Zephyrus the west wind carries Psyche away Later an ant feels sorry for her and helps her in her quest br br Building on the popularity of fables and fairy tales children s literature began to emerge in the nineteenth century with works such as Alice s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi and The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling all employing anthropomorphic elements This continued in the twentieth century with many of the most popular titles having anthropomorphic characters examples being The Tale of Peter Rabbit and later books by Beatrix Potter The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame Winnie the Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner by A A Milne and The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and the subsequent books in The Chronicles of Narnia series by C S Lewis br In many of these stories the animals can be seen as representing facets of human personality and character As John Rowe Townsend remarks discussing The Jungle Book in which the boy Mowgli must rely on his new friends the bear Baloo and the black panther Bagheera The world of the jungle is in fact both itself and our world as well A notable work aimed at an adult audience is George Orwell s Animal Farm in which all the main characters are anthropomorphic animals Non animal examples include Rev W Awdry s Railway Series stories featuring Thomas the Tank Engine and other anthropomorphic locomotives br The fantasy genre developed from mythological fairy tale and Romance motifs sometimes have anthropomorphic animals as characters The best selling examples of the genre are The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings both by J R R Tolkien books peopled with talking creatures such as ravens spiders and the dragon Smaug and a multitude of anthropomorphic goblins and elves John D Rateliff calls this the Doctor Dolittle Theme in his book The History of the Hobbit and Tolkien saw this anthropomorphism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth The first men to talk of trees and stars saw things very differently To them the world was alive with mythological beings To them the whole of creation was myth woven and elf patterned br Richard Adams developed a distinctive take on anthropomorphic writing in the s his debut novel Watership Down featured rabbits that could talk with their own distinctive language Lapine and mythology and included a police state warren Efrafa Despite this Adams attempted to ensure his characters behavior mirrored that of wild rabbits engaging in fighting copulating and defecating drawing on Ronald Lockley s study The Private Life of the Rabbit as research Adams returned to anthropomorphic storytelling in his later novels The Plague Dogs novel and Traveller br By the st century the children s picture book market had expanded massively Perhaps a majority of picture books have some kind of anthropomorphism with popular examples being The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle and The Gruffalo by Julia Donaldson br Anthropomorphism in literature and other media led to a sub culture known as furry fandom which promotes and creates stories and artwork involving anthropomorphic animals and the examination and interpretation of humanity through anthropomorphism This can often be shortened in searches as anthro used by some as an alternative term to furry br Anthropomorphic characters have also been a staple of the comic book genre The most prominent one was Neil Gaiman s the Sandman which had a huge impact on how characters that are physical embodiments are written in the fantasy genre Other examples also include the mature Hellblazer personified political and moral ideas Fables and its spin off series Jack of Fables which was unique for having anthropomorphic representation of literary techniques and genres Various Japanese manga and anime have used anthropomorphism as the basis of their story Examples include Squid Girl anthropomorphized squid Hetalia Axis Powers personified countries Upotte personified guns Arpeggio of Blue Steel and Kancolle personified ships br br Some of the most notable examples are the Walt Disney characters the Magic Carpet from Disney s Aladdin franchise Mickey Mouse Donald Duck Goofy and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit the Looney Tunes characters Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck and Porky Pig and an array of others from the s to present day br In the Disney Pixar franchises Cars and Planes all the characters are anthropomorphic vehicles while in Toy Story they are anthropomorphic toys Other Pixar franchises like Monsters Inc features anthropomorphic monsters and Finding Nemo features anthropomorphic sea animals like fish sharks and whales Discussing anthropomorphic animals from DreamWorks franchise Madagascar Laurie suggests that social differences based on conflict and contradiction are naturalized and made less contestable through the classificatory matrix of human and nonhuman relations Other DreamWorks franchises like Shrek features fairy tale characters and Blue Sky Studios of th Century Fox franchises like Ice Age features anthropomorphic extinct animals Other characters in SpongeBob SquarePants franchise features anthropomorphic sea animals as well like sea sponges starfish octopus crabs whales puffer fish lobsters and zooplankton br All of the characters in Walt Disney Animation Studios Zootopia are anthropomorphic animals that is an entirely nonhuman civilization br The live action animated franchise Alvin and the Chipmunks by th Century Fox centers around anthropomorphic talkative and singing chipmunks The female singing chipmunks called The Chipettes are also centered in some of the franchise s films br br Since the s anthropomorphism has also been represented in various animated television shows such as Biker Mice From Mars and SWAT Kats The Radical Squadron Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles first aired in features four pizza loving anthropomorphic turtles with a great knowledge of ninjutsu led by their anthropomorphic rat sensei Master Splinter Nickelodeon s longest running animated TV series SpongeBob SquarePants present revolves around SpongeBob a yellow sea sponge living in the underwater town of Bikini Bottom with his anthropomorphic marine life friends Cartoon Network s animated series The Amazing World of Gumball are about anthropomorphic animals and inanimate objects All of the characters in Hasbro Studios TV series My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic are anthropomorphic fantasy creatures with most of them being ponies living in the pony inhabited land of Equestria The Netflix original series Centaurworld focuses on a warhorse who gets transported to a Dr Seuss like world full of centaurs who possess the bottom half of any animal as opposed to the traditional horse br In the American animated TV series Family Guy one of the show s main characters Brian is a dog Brian shows many human characteristics he walks upright talks smokes and drinks Martinis but also acts like a normal dog in other ways for example he cannot resist chasing a ball and barks at the mailman believing him to be a threat In a similar case BoJack Horseman an American Netflix adult animated black comedy series takes place in an alternate world where humans and anthropomorphic animals live side by side and centers around the life of BoJack Horseman a humanoid horse who was a one hit wonder on a popular s sitcom Horsin Around living off the show s residuals in present time Multiple main characters of the series are other animals who possess human body form and other human like traits and identity as well Mr Peanutbutter a humanoid dog lives a mostly human life he speaks American English walks upright owns a house drives a car is in a romantic relationship with a human woman in this series as animals and humans are seen as equal relationships like this are not seen as bestiality but seen as regular human sexuality Diane and has a successful career in television however also exhibits dog traits he sleeps in a human size dog bed gets arrested for having a drag race with the mailman and is once forced to wear a dog cone after he gets stitches in his arm br The PBS Kids animated series Let s Go Luna centers on an anthropomorphic female Moon who speaks sings and dances She comes down out of the sky to serve as a tutor of international culture to the three main characters a boy frog and wombat and a girl butterfly who are supposed to be preschool children traveling a world populated by anthropomorphic animals with a circus run by their parents br The French Belgian animated series Mush Mush the Mushables takes place in a world inhabited by Mushables which are anthropomrphic fungi along with other critters such as beetles snails and frogs br br Sonic the Hedgehog a video game franchise debuting in features a speedy blue hedgehog as the main protagonist This series characters are almost all anthropomorphic animals such as foxes cats and other hedgehogs who are able to speak and walk on their hind legs like normal humans As with most anthropomorphisms of animals clothing is of little or no importance where some characters may be fully clothed while some wear only shoes and gloves br Another popular example in video games is the Super Mario series debuting in with Super Mario Bros of which main antagonist includes a fictional species of anthropomorphic turtle like creatures known as Koopas Other games in the series as well as of other of its greater Mario franchise spawned similar characters such as Yoshi Donkey Kong and many others br br Claes Oldenburg s soft sculptures are commonly described as anthropomorphic Depicting common household objects Oldenburg s sculptures were considered Pop Art Reproducing these objects often at a greater size than the original Oldenburg created his sculptures out of soft materials The anthropomorphic qualities of the sculptures were mainly in their sagging and malleable exterior which mirrored the not so idealistic forms of the human body In Soft Light Switches Oldenburg creates a household light switch out of vinyl The two identical switches in a dulled orange insinuate nipples The soft vinyl references the aging process as the sculpture wrinkles and sinks with time br br In the essay Art and Objecthood Michael Fried makes the case that literalist art minimalism becomes theatrical by means of anthropomorphism The viewer engages the minimalist work not as an autonomous art object but as a theatrical interaction Fried references a conversation in which Tony Smith answers questions about his six foot cube Die br br Q Why didn t you make it larger so that it would loom over the observer br A I was not making a monument br Q Then why didn t you make it smaller so that the observer could see over the top br br A I was not making an object br Fried implies an anthropomorphic connection by means of a surrogate person that is a kind of statue br The minimalist decision of hollowness in much of their work was also considered by Fried to be blatantly anthropomorphic This hollowness contributes to the idea of a separate inside an idea mirrored in the human form Fried considers the Literalist art s hollowness to be biomorphic as it references a living organism br br Curator Lucy Lippard s Eccentric Abstraction show in sets up Briony Fer s writing of a post minimalist anthropomorphism Reacting to Fried s interpretation of minimalist art s looming presence of objects which appear as actors might on a stage Fer interprets the artists in Eccentric Abstraction to a new form of anthropomorphism She puts forth the thoughts of Surrealist writer Roger Caillois who speaks of the spacial lure of the subject the way in which the subject could inhabit their surroundings Caillous uses the example of an insect who through camouflage does so in order to become invisible and loses its distinctness For Fer the anthropomorphic qualities of imitation found in the erotic organic sculptures of artists Eva Hesse and Louise Bourgeois are not necessarily for strictly mimetic purposes Instead like the insect the work must come into being in the scopic field which we cannot view from outside br br For branding merchandising and representation figures known as mascots are now often employed to personify sports teams corporations and major events such as the World s Fair and the Olympics These personifications may be simple human or animal figures such as Ronald McDonald or the donkey that represents the United States s Democratic Party Other times they are anthropomorphic items such as Clippy or the Michelin Man Most often they are anthropomorphic animals such as the Energizer Bunny or the San Diego Chicken br The practice is particularly widespread in Japan where cities regions and companies all have mascots collectively known as yuru chara Two of the most popular are Kumamon a bear who represents Kumamoto Prefecture and Funassyi a pear who represents Funabashi a suburb of Tokyo br br Other examples of anthropomorphism include the attribution of human traits to animals especially domesticated pets such as dogs and cats Examples of this include thinking a dog is smiling simply because it is showing his teeth or a cat mourns for a dead owner Anthropomorphism may be beneficial to the welfare of animals A study by Butterfield et al found that utilizing anthropomorphic language when describing dogs created a greater willingness to help them in situations of distress Previous studies have shown that individuals who attribute human characteristics to animals are less willing to eat them and that the degree to which individuals perceive minds in other animals predicts the moral concern afforded to them It is possible that anthropomorphism leads humans to like non humans more when they have apparent human qualities since perceived similarity has been shown to increase prosocial behavior toward other humans A study of how animal behaviors were discussed on the television series Life found that the script very often used anthropomorphisms br br In science the use of anthropomorphic language that suggests animals have intentions and emotions has traditionally been deprecated as indicating a lack of objectivity Biologists have been warned to avoid assumptions that animals share any of the same mental social and emotional capacities of humans and to rely instead on strictly observable evidence In Ivan Pavlov wrote that animals should be considered without any need to resort to fantastic speculations as to the existence of any possible subjective states More recently The Oxford companion to animal behaviour advised that one is well advised to study the behaviour rather than attempting to get at any underlying emotion Some scientists like William M Wheeler writing apologetically of his use of anthropomorphism in have used anthropomorphic language in metaphor to make subjects more humanly comprehensible or memorable br Despite the impact of Charles Darwin s ideas in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals Konrad Lorenz in called him a patron saint of ethology ethology has generally focused on behavior not on emotion in animals br br Even insects play together as has been described by that excellent observer P Huber who saw ants chasing and pretending to bite each other like so many puppies br The study of great apes in their own environment and in captivity has changed attitudes to anthropomorphism In the s the three so called Leakey s Angels Jane Goodall studying chimpanzees Dian Fossey studying gorillas and Birut Galdikas studying orangutans were all accused of that worst of ethological sins anthropomorphism The charge was brought about by their descriptions of the great apes in the field it is now more widely accepted that empathy has an important part to play in research br De Waal has written To endow animals with human emotions has long been a scientific taboo But if we do not we risk missing something fundamental about both animals and us Alongside this has come increasing awareness of the linguistic abilities of the great apes and the recognition that they are tool makers and have individuality and culture br Writing of cats in veterinarian Bruce Fogle points to the fact that both humans and cats have identical neurochemicals and regions in the brain responsible for emotion as evidence that it is not anthropomorphic to credit cats with emotions such as jealousy br br In science fiction an artificially intelligent computer or robot even though it has not been programmed with human emotions often spontaneously experiences those emotions anyway for example Agent Smith in The Matrix was influenced by a disgust toward humanity This is an example of anthropomorphism in reality while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal if it is useful to do so it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever as portrayed in fiction br One example of anthropomorphism would be to believe that one s computer is angry at them because they insulted it another would be to believe that an intelligent robot would naturally find a woman attractive and be driven to mate with her Scholars sometimes disagree with each other about whether a particular prediction about an artificial intelligence s behavior is logical or whether the prediction constitutes illogical anthropomorphism An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism but is in fact a logical statement about an artificial intelligence s behavior would be the Dario Floreano experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for deception and tricked other robots into eating poison and dying here a trait deception ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines spontaneously evolves in a type of convergent evolution br The conscious use of anthropomorphic metaphor is not intrinsically unwise ascribing mental processes to the computer under the proper circumstances may serve the same purpose as it does when humans do it to other people it may help persons to understand what the computer will do how their actions will affect the computer how to compare computers with humans and conceivably how to design computer programs However inappropriate use of anthropomorphic metaphors can result in false beliefs about the behavior of computers for example by causing people to overestimate how flexible computers are According to Paul R Cohen and Edward Feigenbaum in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say exactly what they have in common and when we lack this knowledge to use the comparison to suggest theories of human thinking or computer thinking br Computers overturn the childhood hierarchical taxonomy of stones non living plants living animals conscious humans rational by introducing a non human actor that appears to regularly behave rationally Much of computing terminology derives from anthropomorphic metaphors computers can read write or catch a virus Information technology presents no clear correspondence with any other entities in the world besides humans the options are either to leverage an emotional imprecise human metaphor or to reject imprecise metaphor and make use of more precise domain specific technical terms br People often grant an unnecessary social role to computers during interactions The underlying causes are debated Youngme Moon and Clifford Nass propose that humans are emotionally intellectually and physiologically biased toward social activity and so when presented with even tiny social cues deeply infused social responses are triggered automatically This may allow incorporation of anthropomorphic features into computers robots to enable more familiar social interactions making them easier to use br Alleged examples of anthropomorphism toward AI have included Google engineer Blake Lemoine s widely derided claim that the Google LaMDA chatbot was sentient the granting of honorary Saudi Arabian citizenship to the robot Sophia and the reactions to the chatbot ELIZA in the s br br In psychology the first empirical study of anthropomorphism was conducted in by Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel In the first part of this experiment the researchers showed a and a half minute long animation of several shapes moving around on the screen in varying directions at various speeds When subjects were asked to describe what they saw they gave detailed accounts of the intentions and personalities of the shapes For instance the large triangle was characterized as a bully chasing the other two shapes until they could trick the large triangle and escape The researchers concluded that when people see objects making motions for which there is no obvious cause they view these objects as intentional agents individuals that deliberately make choices to achieve goals br Modern psychologists generally characterize anthropomorphism as a cognitive bias That is anthropomorphism is a cognitive process by which people use their schemas about other humans as a basis for inferring the properties of non human entities in order to make efficient judgements about the environment even if those inferences are not always accurate Schemas about humans are used as the basis because this knowledge is acquired early in life is more detailed than knowledge about non human entities and is more readily accessible in memory Anthropomorphism can also function as a strategy to cope with loneliness when other human connections are not available br br Since making inferences requires cognitive effort anthropomorphism is likely to be triggered only when certain aspects about a person and their environment are true Psychologist Adam Waytz and his colleagues created a three factor theory of anthropomorphism to describe these aspects and predict when people are most likely to anthropomorphize The three factors are br br Elicited agent knowledge or the amount of prior knowledge held about an object and the extent to which that knowledge is called to mind br Effectance or the drive to interact with and understand one s environment br Sociality the need to establish social connections br When elicited agent knowledge is low and effectance and sociality are high people are more likely to anthropomorphize Various dispositional situational developmental and cultural variables can affect these three factors such as need for cognition social disconnection cultural ideologies uncertainty avoidance etc br br Children appear to anthropomorphize and use egocentric reasoning from an early age and use it more frequently than adults Examples of this are describing a storm cloud as angry or drawing flowers with faces This penchant for anthropomorphism is likely because children have acquired vast amounts of socialization but not as much experience with specific non human entities so thus they have less developed alternative schemas for their environment In contrast autistic children may tend to describe anthropomorphized objects in purely mechanical terms that is in terms of what they do because they have difficulties with theory of mind ToM according to past research A study has shown that autistic people are more prone to object personification suggesting that autistic empathy and ToM may be not only more complex but also more all encompassing The double empathy problem challenges the notion that autistic people have difficulties with ToM br br Anthropomorphism can be used to assist learning Specifically anthropomorphized words and describing scientific concepts with intentionality can improve later recall of these concepts br br In people with depression social anxiety or other mental illnesses emotional support animals are a useful component of treatment partially because anthropomorphism of these animals can satisfy the patients need for social connection br br Anthropomorphism of inanimate objects can affect product buying behavior When products seem to resemble a human schema such as the front of a car resembling a face potential buyers evaluate that product more positively than if they do not anthropomorphize the object br People also tend to trust robots to do more complex tasks such as driving a car or childcare if the robot resembles humans in ways such as having a face voice and name mimicking human motions expressing emotion and displaying some variability in behavior br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Masson Jeffrey Moussaieff McCarthy Susan When Elephants Weep Emotional Lives of Animals Vintage p ISBN br br Baynes T S
