A coupe or coup also US is a passenger car with a sloping or truncated rear roofline and two doors br The term coup was first applied to horse drawn carriages for two passengers without rear facing seats It comes from the French past participle of couper cut br br br Etymology and pronunciation br Coup French pronunciation kupe is based on the past participle of the French verb couper to cut and thus indicates a car which has been cut or made shorter than standard It was first applied to horse drawn carriages for two passengers without rear facing seats These berlines coup s or carrosses coup s clipped carriages were eventually clipped to coup s br There are two common pronunciations in English br br koo PAY the anglicized version of the French pronunciation of coup br KOOP as a spelling pronunciation when the word is written without an accent This is the usual pronunciation and spelling in the United States with the pronunciation entering American vernacular no later than and featuring in the Beach Boys hit song Little Deuce Coupe br br br Definition br br A coupe is a fixed roof car with a sloping rear roofline and one or two rows of seats However there is some debate surrounding whether a coupe must have two doors for passenger egress or whether cars with four doors can also be considered coupes This debate has arisen since the early s when four door cars such as the Mazda RX and Mercedes Benz CLS Class have been marketed as four door coupes or quad coupes although the Rover P was a much earlier example with a variant introduced in having a lower sleeker roofline marketed as the Rover P Coup br In the s and s coupes were distinguished from sedans by their shorter roof area and sportier profile Similarly in more recent times when a model is sold in both coupe and sedan body styles generally the coupe is sportier and more compact br The version of International Standard ISO Road vehicles Types Terms and definitions defines a coupe as having two doors along with a fixed roof usually with limited rear volume at least two seats in at least one row and at least two side windows On the other hand the United States Society of Automotive Engineers publication J does not specify the number of doors instead defining a coupe as having a rear interior volume of less than cu ft L br The definition of coupe started to blur when manufacturers began to produce cars with a body style which have a sleek sloping roofline two doors and two functional seats up front plus two small seats in the back br Some manufacturers also blur the definition of a coupe by applying this description to models featuring a hatchback or a rear cargo area access door that opens upwards Most often also featuring a fold down back seat the hatchback or liftback layout of these cars improves their practicality and cargo room br br br Horse drawn carriages br br The coupe carriage body style originated from the berline horse drawn carriage The coupe version of the berline was introduced in the th century as a shortened cut version with no rear facing seat Normally a coupe had a fixed glass window in the front of the passenger compartment The coupe was considered an ideal vehicle for women to use to go shopping or to make social visits br br br History br The early coupe automobile s passenger compartment followed in general conception the design of horse drawn coupes with the driver in the open at the front and an enclosure behind him for two passengers on one bench seat The French variant for this word thus denoted a car with a small passenger compartment br By the s the term had evolved to denote a two door car with the driver and up to two passengers in an enclosure with a single bench seat The coup de ville or coupe chauffeur was an exception retaining the open driver s section at front br In the Society of Automobile Engineers suggested nomenclature for car bodies that included the following br br Coupe An enclosed car operated from the inside with seats for two or three and sometimes a backward facing fourth seat Coupelet A small car seating two or three with a folding top and full height doors with fully retractable windows Convertible coupe A roadster with a removable coupe roof br During the th century the term coupe was applied to various close coupled cars where the rear seat is located further forward than usual and the front seat further back than usual br Since the s the term coupe has generally referred to a two door car with a fixed roof br Since several models with four doors have been marketed as four door coupes however reactions are mixed about whether these models are actually sedans instead of coupes According to Edmunds an American automotive guide the four door coupe category doesn t really exist br br br Variations br br br Berlinetta br br A berlinetta is a lightweight sporty two door car typically with two seats but also including cars br br br Club coupe br A club coupe is a two door car with a larger rear seat passenger area compared with the smaller rear seat area in a body style Thus club coupes resemble coupes as both have two doors but feature a full width rear seat that is accessible by tilting forward the backs of the front seats br br br Hardtop coupe br A hardtop coupe is a two door car that lacks a structural pillar B pillar between the front and rear side windows When these windows are lowered the effect is like that of a convertible coupe with the windows down The hardtop body style was popular in the United States from the early s until the s It was also available in European and Japanese markets Safety regulations for roof structures to protect passengers in a rollover were proposed limiting the development of new models The hardtop body style went out of style with consumers while the automakers focused on cost reduction and increasing efficiencies br br br Combi coup br br Saab used the term combi coup for a car body similar to the liftback br br br Business coupe br A two door car with no rear seat or with a removable rear seat intended for traveling salespeople and other vendors carrying their wares with them American manufacturers developed this style of coupe in the late s br br br Four door coupe quad coupe br br The and LaFayette models were available in a variety of open and closed body styles that included a close coupled version featuring two center opening doors on each side that was marketed as a Four Door Coupe The Nash Advanced Six was available in four door coupe body style br More recently the description has been applied by marketers to describe four door cars with a coupe like roofline at the rear The low roof design reduces back seat passenger access and headroom The designation was used for the low roof model of the Rover P followed by the Nissan Leopard Infiniti J Recent examples include the Mercedes Benz CLS Audi A Volkswagen CC Volkswagen Arteon and BMW Series Gran Coupe br Similarly several cars with one or two small rear doors for rear seat passenger egress and no B pillar have been marketed as quad coupes For example the Saturn Ion the Mazda RX and the Hyundai Veloster br br br Three door coupe br Particularly popular in Europe many cars are designed with coupe styling but a three door hatchback liftback layout to improve practicality including cars such as the Jaguar E Type Mitsubishi GT Datsun Z Toyota Supra Mazda RX Alfa Romeo Brera Ford Mercury Cougar and Volkswagen Scirocco br br br Opera coupe br A two door car designed for driving to the opera with easy access to the rear seats Features sometimes included a folding front seat next to the driver or a compartment to store top hats br Often they would have solid rear quarter panels with small circular windows to enable the occupants to see out without being seen These opera windows were revived on many U S automobiles during the s and early s br br br Three window coupe br The three window coupe commonly just three window is a style of automobile characterized by two side windows and a backlight rear window The front windscreens are not counted The three window coupe has a distinct difference from the five window coupe which has an additional window on each side behind the front doors These two door cars typically have small sized bodies with only a front seat and an occasional small rear seat br The style was popular from the s until the beginning of World War II While many manufacturers produced three window coupes the Ford coupe is often considered the classic hot rod br br br Coupe SUV br br Some SUVs or crossovers with sloping rear rooflines are marketed as coupe crossover SUVs or coupe SUVs even though they have four side doors for passenger egress to the seats and rear hatches for cargo area access however only a car with doors and no B style are considered a true coupe br br br Positioning in model range br br In the United States some coupes are simply line extenders two door variants of family sedans while others have significant differences from their four door counterparts br The AMC Matador coupe has a shorter wheelbase with a distinct aerodynamic design and fastback styling sharing almost nothing with the conventional three box design and more conservative four door versions br Similarly the Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Stratus coupes and sedans late through s have little in common except their names The coupes were engineered by Mitsubishi and built in Illinois while the sedans were developed by Chrysler and built in Michigan Some coupes may share platforms with contemporary sedans br Coupes may also exist as model lines in their own right either closely related to other models but named differently such as the Alfa Romeo GT or Infiniti Q or have little engineering in common with other vehicles from the manufacturer such as the Toyota GT br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
