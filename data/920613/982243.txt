budget at million Eberts raised million from the Pearson company and clients of the merchant bank Lazard br Production of the film began in by a new animation studio formed in London by Rosen It was originally going to be directed by John Hubley who left after disagreements with the film s producer Martin Rosen His work can still be found in the film most notably in the fable scene He was replaced by Rosen who thereby made his directorial debut br The backgrounds and locations especially Efrafa and the nearby railway are based on the diagrams and maps in Richard Adams s original novel Most of the locations in the movie either exist or were based on real spots in Hampshire and surrounding areas br br br Music br The musical score was by Angela Morley and Malcolm Williamson Morley replacing Williamson after the composer had fallen behind and only composed the prelude and main title theme in sketch form A list of the musical cues for the film can be found on the composer s

and songwriter Mike Batt He also wrote other songs for the film which were not used The composer recorded three songs with vocals by Garfunkel but only Bright Eyes made it to the film The song When You re Losing Your Way in the Rain has a very similar feeling and arrangement and was recorded by the former Zombies vocalist Colin Blunstone in Garfunkel s version was heard years later on the Watership Down TV series soundtrack released in The song like many others which appeared on the TV soundtrack was never used in the show br br br Release and reception br Watership Down was first released to the UK on October and was later released in the United States on November where the movie was distributed by AVCO Embassy Pictures In British cinemas the film was preceded by the live action short film Tahere Tikitiki The Making of a M ori Canoe br br br Box office br The film was very successful at the box office According to financier Jake Eberts the investors who put up the development finance got their money back with interest plus an additional making a total of ten times their investment Other investors in the film reportedly received a return of on their investment br br br Awards br The film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in br br br Reception and legacy br Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were divided on their opinions of Watership Down on their show Sneak Previews Siskel thought that the film was too long but that otherwise he found most of it very effective due to the film s success at situating the audience in the rabbits point of view which put him in touch with the delicate and brutal balance of nature He also called the film more mature than what we usually expect or get from an animated feature film However Ebert felt that the realism of the story which he liked did not match with the style of animation which he described as soft edged cuddly and like a cartoon br Some critics commented on the film s success as an adaptation such as The Observer s Philip French who wrote that the novel s texture isn t there and the characters never take on strong pictorial identities Later in the review he elaborated that the rabbit characters are blandly drawn and concluded that the film as a whole is difficult to enthuse over In The Times David Robinson also criticised the film s translation to the screen as inaccessible for People who come to the film without the assistance of the book as they may well have a little difficulty with the special lore and language of Richard Adams rabbit civilisation and with the fictional Lapine language spoken by the rabbits Robinson nevertheless complimented the voice acting and the fresh and pleasant animation design The Globe and Mail s Jay Scott on the other hand described the animation backgrounds of the film as second rate shopping mall watercolor landscapes but praised the film s allegorical aspects drawing comparisons between the villain General Woundwort and Adolf Hitler the realistic and compassionate approach to its rabbit characters and the voice cast br The Daily Mail s Margaret Hinxman also praised the voice acting the delicious music and called the background landscapes superb but concluded that Watership Down is by no stretch of the imagination a Disney type animation feature film Sadly I have to say if it had been I might have enjoyed it more However other critics drew favourable comparisons with Disney notably Julian Fox in Films and Filming who called Watership Down far and away the most exciting and totally involving animated feature since Disney s peak years ie that period which ended with Pinocchio Dumbo and Bambi He praised in particular the aesthetics sound design and the film s way of humanising the rabbit characters without over anthropomorphising them The Guardian s Derek Malcolm also complimented Kehaar the seagull s most Disney like animation style even though he found the film as a whole to be old fashioned and the song Bright Eyes to be more than a trifle bland br In a joint review of Watership Down and Ralph Bakshi s The Lord of the Rings animation historian Michael Barrier described both films as very stupid movies of a special kind and that the films themselves show no sign that any intelligence was at work in making them due to their grim literalism in adapting their source texts He did describe Watership Down as the least offensive of the two but nevertheless characterised the animation style as graceless and expressed disappointment that the vision of the film s original director John Hubley was never fully realised Newsweek s David Ansen also drew comparisons with The Lord of the Rings but while he disliked Bakshi s film he was more effusive about Watership Down which he said has the relentless momentum of a good war movie and is swift of foot graced with wit and capable of touching the hearts of both children and adults br In a review of the DVD edition Film Freak Central s Walter Chaw praised the film for offering an unusually thoughtful alternative to Disney animated films of the era Watership Down arose in that extended lull between Disney s heyday and its late Eighties resurrection Watership Down points to the dwindled potential for American animation to evolve into what anime has become a mature medium for artistic expression of serious issues Chaw commended the film s frankness honesty and themes of friendship and loyalty concluding that in spite of the film s violent elements the picture may be more appropriate for young children than a legion of condescendingly sugarcoated Disney fare br br br Effects on children and BBFC classification br Watership Down has developed a reputation as a distressing children s text with Ed Power of The Independent describing the film in a th anniversary retrospective as a classic but which arguably traumatised an entire generation In the British broadcaster Channel faced criticism after broadcasting the film in a pre watershed slot on Easter Sunday which was seen to be in poor taste due to the film s representations of violence inflicted upon rabbits and with many people on social media expressing concern about child viewers being distressed though it is unclear whether any children were actually negatively affected Despite the criticism Channel broadcast Watership Down on Easter Sunday again the following year br Despite the film s reputation as traumatising regulators and critics in expressed little concern about the film s potentially negative effects on children When the film was first submitted to the British Board of Film Censors the BBFC passed the film with a U certificate suitable for all ages deciding that Animation removes the realistic gory horror in the occasional scenes of violence and bloodshed and we felt that while the film may move children emotionally during the film s duration it could not seriously trouble them once the spell of the story is broken and that a U certificate was therefore quite appropriate This choice has been quite controversial though and in the BBFC acknowledged that it had received complaints about the suitability of Watership Down at U almost every year since its classification In the BBFC re classified the film with a PG rating for mild violence threat brief bloody images language br Like the BBFC film critics in characterised Watership Down as suitable for children in spite of its potentially distressing aspects The Spectator s Ted Whitehead described it as a straightforward children s adventure story Scott in The Globe and Mail wrote that Parents are more apt to feel squeamish about this than their children there is nothing as devastating as the death of Bambi s mother In Watership Down some of the rabbits are unlucky and some live to old age When they do die the deaths are treated with sympathy but not morbidity The message is that life is hard and difficult but that it s fun and rewarding too Malcolm in The Guardian dismissed concerns about the film s suitability for children by stating that It is not true as had already been hinted at by some that the film is too violent and disturbing for children What pray about some of Grimms fairy tales Fox in Films and Filming was one of the few critics to express caution by saying that because of the graphic horror one could scarcely recommend the film to the very young br More recently film critics and scholars have defended Watership Down s potential value for child audiences Children s media scholar Catherine Lester argues that the violence is never without a specific narrative or moral purpose and that discussions of the film s effect upon children require greater nuance that acknowledges the complexity and variety of children as viewers and how they respond to films Gerard Jones in his essay on the film for the Criterion Collection admits that the film has troubled me ever since I first saw it at the age of twenty one but that he believes it is an important film for viewers of all ages because it asks us to spend time with those elements of existence that we will always find most troubling and haunting and moving and that we so rarely allow our children s culture or our own entertainment to dwell on He cites as an example the non violent death of Hazel from old age at the end of the film which he calls as joyous as it is poignant br br br Media br br br Picture book br A picture book adaptation was also produced titled The Watership Down Film Picture Book Two editions of the book were
