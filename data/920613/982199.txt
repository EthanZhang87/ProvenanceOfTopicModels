persuades Wendy to come to Never Land where she will never have to grow up and she and the boys fly there with the begrudging help of the pixie Tinker Bell br A ship of pirates is anchored off Never Land led by Captain Hook and his first mate Mr Smee Hook wants revenge on Peter for cutting off his hand but fears the crocodile which consumed the hand knowing it is eager to eat the rest of him When Pan and the Darlings arrive Hook shoots at them with a cannon and Peter sends the Darlings off to safety while he baits the pirates Tinker Bell who is jealous of Pan s attention to Wendy convinces the Lost Boys that Pan has ordered them to shoot down Wendy Tinker Bell s treachery is soon found out and Peter banishes her John and Michael set off with the Lost Boys to find the island s Natives

br br br Production br br br Early development br br Walt Disney was familiar with J M Barrie s play Peter Pan or the Boy Who Wouldn t Grow Up since childhood having seen a touring production starring Maude Adams at the Cater Opera House in Marceline Missouri in In he first expressed interest in adapting the play as his second animated feature film after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which was still in production at the time During his acquisition spree in Europe in April Roy O Disney went to London to acquire the rights from the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children but Paramount Pictures had already secured the live action screen rights The hospital unsuccessfully offered to have Disney and Paramount make an agreement however by October of that year Walt had purchased the animation rights from Paramount and commissioned Dorothy Ann Blank to develop the story In January Disney signed a contract with the hospital and by May of that year as the story work was in the preliminary stages he had several animators in mind for some of the characters Bill Tytla was considered for the pirates Norman Ferguson for Nana and Fred Moore for Tinker Bell br During this time many possible interpretations of the story were explored In the earliest treatment written by Blank on April the film would start by telling Peter Pan s backstory which was based on Barrie s book Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens However during a story meeting the following month Disney decided that they ought to get right into the story itself where Peter Pan comes to the house to get his shadow That s where the story picks up How Peter came to be is really another story Disney also explored the idea of opening the film in Never Land with Peter coming to Wendy s house to kidnap her as a mother for the Lost Boys Eventually it was decided that the kidnapping plot was too dark and Disney went back to Barrie s original play in which Peter comes to get his shadow back and Wendy herself is eager to see Never Land br By early David Hall who had also worked on Alice in Wonderland created first exploratory storyboards and concept art for Peter Pan Later that year Disney personally attempted to contact Maude Adams who by then had retired from acting and was teaching drama at Stephens College Disney notified her of his plans for an animated feature and requested for her to view an early reel of the film that the studio had produced for her approval He further affirmed that his studio would send the necessary screening equipment to Columbia College for the presentation and that it could be open to any Stephens College student or faculty member interested in attending Adams however rejected Disney s proposal In a studio memo to Kay Kamen he wrote She wouldn t even give me the courtesy of looking at our reel Her reasons were to the effect that Peter whom she created was to her real life and blood while another s creation of this character would only be a ghost to her It seems pretty silly and from my point of view I would say that Miss Adams is simply living in the past br br br Production delays br By the basic story structure of Peter Pan was completed but later that year following the bombing of Pearl Harbor the United States military took control of Walt Disney Productions It commissioned the studio to produce training and war propaganda films thus pre production work on Peter Pan as well as on Alice in Wonderland was suspended However the Bank of America allowed for production on Peter Pan along with The Wind in the Willows to continue during World War II After the war had ended pre production of the film resumed with Jack Kinney as director At the time Kinney had considered leaving Walt Disney Productions for the Metro Goldwyn Mayer cartoon studio but wartime restrictions prevented it Since he did not want Kinney to get out of his contract Disney appointed Kinney to direct Peter Pan br Impatient with the delays Disney asked Kinney to work on sequences consecutively rather than finishing the entire script before it was storyboarded so that a scene would be approved at a morning story meeting and then immediately put into development Six months later during a storyboard meeting Kinney presented a two and a half hour presentation during which Disney sat silently and then stated You know I ve been thinking about Cinderella br br br Return to actual production br By Walt Disney Productions financial health started to improve again Around this time Disney acknowledged the need for sound economic policies but emphasized to his financial backers that slashing production would be suicidal to the studio In order to restore the studio to profitability Disney expressed his desire to return to producing full length animated films By then three animated projects Cinderella Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan were in development Disney had felt the characters in Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan were too cold but because Cinderella contained similar elements when compared to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs he decided to greenlight Cinderella In May Variety reported that Peter Pan had been placed back into production br The scene in the nursery went through many alterations In one version it is Mrs Darling who finds Peter Pan s shadow and shows it to Mr Darling as in the original play In another version of the film Nana goes to Never Land with Pan and the Darling children the story being told through her eyes In another interpretation of the story John Darling is left behind for being too serious practical and boring but story artist Ralph Wright convinced Disney to have John go with the others to Never Land This adaptation also included Wendy bringing her Peter Pan picture book and Peter and the children eating an imaginary dinner At one point a party in Peter s hideout was conceived at which Tinker Bell becomes humiliated and in her rage tells Captain Hook the location of Peter Pan s hideout of her own free will However Disney felt that this story was contrary to Tinker Bell s character instead he had Captain Hook kidnapping Tinker Bell and persuading her to tell him In Barrie s play Captain Hook puts poison in Peter s dose of medicine and Tinker Bell saves Peter by drinking the poison herself only to be revived by the applause of the theater audience After much debate Disney discarded this story development fearing it would be difficult to achieve in a film br In earlier scripts there were more scenes involving the pirates and mermaids that were similar to those with the dwarfs in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Ultimately these scenes were cut for pacing reasons The film concept was also a bit darker at one point than that of the finished product for example there were scenes involving Captain Hook being eaten by the crocodile like in the original play the Darling family mourning over their lost children and Pan and the children discovering the pirates treasure loaded with booby traps br br br Casting br br Walt Disney originally wanted to cast Mary Martin as Peter Pan but Roy Disney disagreed finding Martin s voice too heavy matured and sophisticated Jean Arthur also approached Walt Disney to consider her for the role Bobby Driscoll who was Disney s first contract child actor and had previously starred in such films as Song of the South So Dear to My Heart and Treasure Island was ultimately cast This was the first time that a male actor was cast as Peter Pan breaking a tradition of women portraying him in both films and stage productions Driscoll also provided some of the live action reference for the character Peter Pan was Driscoll s last Disney film as his contract with the studio was abruptly terminated shortly after its release br For the role of Wendy Disney wanted a gentle and gracefully feminine voice which he found in Kathryn Beaumont who had previously voiced the title character in Alice in Wonderland and had just finished working on the film Disney initially offered the role of Captain Hook to Cary Grant which the latter was intrigued with but eventually Hans Conried was cast as both Hook and in keeping the tradition of the stage play George Darling br br br Animation br br br Live action reference br As with previous Disney animated features since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a live action version with the actors performing to a prerecorded dialogue track was filmed to serve as an aid to animators Margaret Kerry received a call to audition to serve as the live action reference for Tinker Bell For the live action reference Kerry said she had to hold out her arms and pretend to fly for all the scenes requiring it Additionally Kerry served as reference for one of the mermaids along with Connie Hilton and June Foray br At the same time the studio was looking for an actor to portray Peter Pan to which Kerry suggested her dancing teacher Roland Dupree He was interviewed and eventually won the role providing visual reference for the flying and action sequences Bobby Driscoll also served as the live action reference model for Peter Pan although he was mainly used for the close up scenes Kathryn Beaumont who was the voice of Wendy performed the live action reference footage for the character br Hans Conried completed the voice work over the course of a few days but served as the live action reference for two and a half years br br br Character animation br Milt Kahl wanted to animate Captain Hook but was instead assigned to animate Peter Pan and the Darling children he claimed he was outmaneuvered During production while animating Peter Pan Kahl claimed that the hardest thing to animate was a character floating in mid air While observing the animation of Peter Pan Disney complained that the animators had let too many of Bobby Driscoll s facial features find their way into the character design telling Kahl that t hey are too masculine too old There is something wrong there Kahl replied You want to know what s wrong What s wrong is that they don t have any talent in the place br The job of animating Captain Hook was assigned to Frank Thomas who faced conflicting visions of the character Story artist Ed Penner viewed Hook as a very foppish not strong dandy type who loved all the finery Kind of a con man Co director Gerry Geronimi saw him as an Ernest Torrence a mean heavy sort of character who used his hook menacingly When Disney saw Thomas first test scenes he said Well that last scene has something I like I think you re beginning to get him I think we better wait and let Frank go on a little further Because Thomas could not animate every scene of Hook certain sequences were given to Wolfgang Reitherman such as Hook trying to escape the crocodile at Skull Rock br Ollie Johnston animated Mr Smee To best capture his comedic yet fear ridden sycophantic personality Johnston used a variation of the Dwarf design from Snow White and had Mr Smee blink repeatedly Johnston s former mentor Fred Moore worked in his unit as a character animator for Smee s minor scenes Moore also animated the mermaids and the Lost Boys The film would be Moore s final work as he died in a traffic accident on November br br br Music br Frank Churchill wrote several songs for the film during the early s and Charles Walcott wrote additional songs in When work on Peter Pan resumed in Eliot Daniel composed songs for the film However this version of Peter Pan was shelved so the studio could complete Cinderella In April it was reported that Sammy Cahn and Sammy Fain were composing songs for Peter Pan br The incidental music score for the movie is composed by Oliver Wallace br br br Songs br The melody for The Second Star to the Right was originally written for Alice in Wonderland as part of a song to be entitled Beyond the Laughing Sky Some Disneyland issued compilations give the title as Second Star to the Right no The see for example Happy Years of Disney Favorites Disneyland Records STER Side II What Made the Red Man Red became controversial because of its stereotypical portrayal of Native Americans Never Smile at a Crocodile was cut from the movie

br Reception br br br Critical reaction br Peter Pan received generally positive reviews from critics upon release some of whom praised the animation but felt it veered too far from the play Bosley Crowther of The New York Times criticized the film s lack of faithfulness to the original play claiming it has the story but not the spirit of Peter Pan as it was plainly conceived by its author and is usually played on the stage Nevertheless he praised the colors are more exciting and the technical features of the job such as the synchronization of voices with the animation of lips are very good However Time magazine gave the film a highly favorable review writing it is a lively feature length Technicolor excursion into a world that glows with an exhilarating charm and a gentle joyousness Mae Tinee of The Chicago Tribune wrote The backgrounds are delightfully picturesque the music only so so The film is designed for broad effect with the accent of comedy I m sure the youngsters who grow up with cartoons will be right at home with all the characters Variety described the film as a feature cartoon of enchanting quality The music score is fine highlighting the constant buzz of action and comedy but the songs are less impressive than usually encountered in such a Disney presentation Harrison s Reports felt the film was another Walt Disney masterpiece It should prove a delight not only to children but also to every adult The animation is so good that the characters appear almost natural br Giving the film stars out of Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune noted the drawing of Tinkerbelle sic and the flamboyance of Captain Hook as well as the quality music mixed with appropriate animation were the film s major highlights Michael Jackson cited Peter Pan as his favorite film

t delve deeply into the darkness of J M Barrie s tale Peter Pan is a heartwarming exuberant film with some great tunes br br br Controversy br Peter Pan has been criticized in recent decades for its broadly stereotypical treatment of Native Americans br In Eric Goldberg director of that year s Disney animated romance Pocahontas expressed his belief that all the Indians in the film were caricatures br In particular the song What Made the Red Man Red has been removed from television airings of the film and widely described as racist since Its lyrics claim that Native American men are red due to the very first Injun prince blushing after kissing a maid It also contains usage of the word squaw gibberish utterances like ugg a wugg and a mocking explanation of the Lakota greeting h u The visuals include tipis drumming tobbacco ceremonial pipes and the Inuit eskimo kiss Multiple characters use the word squaw throughout the film in reference to two different Native women as well as protagonist Wendy br The Native American tribe was not included in the sequel Return to Never Land but they were included in a tie in video game and are referenced by a brief shot of Peter Pan flying by a totem pole br Animator Marc Davis was quoted in the audio commentary I m not sure we would have done the Indians if we were making this movie now And if we had we wouldn t do them the way we did
