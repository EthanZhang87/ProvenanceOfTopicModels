Lincoln and Mercury to two each with Mercury replacing the Eight with Monterey introduced in as a trim option lasting until br br br First generation br br The advertisements for this car declared it to be The car that truly dares to ask Why referring to the idea that a big car could not also be economical The Mercury two door sedan was listed at US in dollars several hundred dollars more than the Ford V several hundred less than the Lincoln Zephyr and about the same as the upper range Oldsmobile and Dodges Hudsons and the lower range Buicks and DeSotos sales from all of which it was hoped that customers would trade in their cars for the new Mercury Its engine was a hp version of the Ford flathead V engine its styling was inspired by the Zephyr and it had standard equipment hydraulic brakes using inch drums With a wheelbase of in mm and an overall length of in mm it was a good sized car which the Ford company advertised extensively together with its up to mpg performance few cars of any size can equal such economy Double sun visors became standard in br Although Eight script would not appear on the front of the hood until the model year sales literature prominently referred to the car as the Mercury Eight from the very beginning This is no doubt because the actual series names A in and A in were somewhat less enticing A A model has the words Mercury Eight in an emblem that runs from front to rear alongside the top hood lines on both sides It appears as chrome wording on top of a double red bar br By the end of Mercury could run with the headline It s made owners change cars br br br Second generation br br The Mercury Eight got all new styling and some engineering improvements The Mercury now shared its bodyshell with the Ford Super DeLuxe and the wheelbase was expanded by in mm to in mm There were many chassis refinements including improved spring lengths rates and deflections plus changes in shackling shocks and an improved stabilizer bar but the old fashioned transverse springs were still used The new body featured door bottoms that flared out over the running boards allowing for wider seats and interiors The car had in mm more headroom two piece front fenders three piece at first and more glass area The front pillars were made slimmer and the windshield was widened deepened and angled more steeply Parking lights were separate and set atop the

wing support bars rolled down with the windows The door convertible offered in was gone but a station wagon was added The woodie wagon s body behind the engine cowl was identical to Ford s and produced at the company s Iron Mountain plant in Michigan s Upper Peninsula The Eight script was moved to the rear of the hood Mercury Eights were sold in the model year br In the Mercury Eight s slender bullet parking lights were replaced with rectangular units placed high on the fenders inboard of the headlights Running boards were now completely concealed under flared door bottoms The instrument panel now features two identical circles for speedometer and clock with gauges to the left of the speedometer a glove compartment to the right of the clock and a large radio speaker cover in the center The grille looked more like that of the Lincoln Zephyr and Continental The Eight script was gone but an appeared at the top of the grille center Horsepower was increased to Mercury s biggest engineering news for was Liquamatic Ford s first semiautomatic transmission It wasn t much of a success and Mercury wouldn t have another automatic transmission until Merc O Matic appeared in which was a true automatic Mercury production for the short model year totaled only Output was halted in February as American auto plants were converted to the exclusive production of war material br Although Mercury s prewar history was short the Mercury Eight had already earned for itself the image of being a fine performer in mph as well as mpg this hot car image quite in keeping with its name chosen by Edsel Ford that of the fleet footed messenger of the gods of Roman mythology The Mercury Eight was strongly identified as an upmarket Ford during this period In the Lincoln Mercury division would be established to change that br A new grille was the most noticeable difference between the and Mercurys It had thin vertical bars surrounded by a trim piece painted the same color as the car An Eight script now appeared down its center The Liquimatic automatic transmission option was eliminated The most distinctive new Mercury was the Sportsman convertible It featured wood body panels Only examples of it were produced and it was discontinued the following model year Mercury Eight sales totaled br Styling changes were slight in The Mercury name was placed on the side of the hood Different hubcaps were used The border around the grille was chrome plated The Eight script still ran down its center There was also new trunk trim More chrome was used on the interior and the dash dial faces were redesigned The convertible and station wagon came with leather upholstery The other body styles used fabric The wood paneled Sportsman convertible was gone Mercury Eights were sold br For all practical purposes the Mercury Eights were identical to the s The major changes consisted of different dial faces and no steering column lock Mercury Eights were sold br br br Australian coupe utility and panel van variants br A unique coupe utility variant of the Mercury was produced in Australia from to Marketed as the Mercury Club Coupe Utility it was built on a inch wheelbase and had a carrying capacity rated at cwt The version was coded as the Model S A and the and variants as the Model M br A panel van model was also offered br br br Third generation br br For Mercury introduced its first postwar model line The first Mercury of the combined Lincoln Mercury Division the Mercury Eight now shared its body with the Lincoln instead of the Ford Keeping its inch wheelbase the Mercury was sized between its two divisional counterparts In place of the updated prewar body Mercury adopted a pontoon body ending the use of running boards entirely along with separate fenders The Flathead V was carried over producing more power than in its Ford counterpart br In a change to the model line the four door station wagon was replaced by a two door model the design of the wagon body structure had shifted to steel relegating wood to body paneling still manufactured at the Ford Iron Mountain Plant An tube AM radio was introduced as an option full instrumentation was added to the dashboard A new overdrive system was optional activated by a handle under the dash br The shift of the Mercury to the Lincoln body proved successful alongside its Ford counterpart Mercury broke sales records for br For the Monterey name made its first appearance as Mercury introduced a high end two door coupe similar to the Ford Crestliner Lincoln Lido and Lincoln Cosmopolitan Capri the Monterey was intended to compete against the two door hardtop coupes introduced by General Motors in The front suspension was independent with stabilizer bars br For as Mercury redesigned its model line the Monterey was established as a stand alone nameplate with Mercury renaming the Eight as the Mercury Custom br br br Custom car legacy br br Within its era and beyond the third generation Mercury Eight was popular with customizers In Sam Barris built the first lead sled from a Mercury Eight the Eight became the definitive lead sled much as the Ford V as the deuce was becoming the definitive hot rod The Eights were among the first models to receive an aftermarket OHV engine swap since Oldsmobile and Cadillac developed the first high compression OHV V engines in whereas Ford was still using a sidevalve engine br Sam and George Barris also used the body style to build the most famous custom car ever the Hirohata Merc for customer Bob Hirohata in Setting a style and an attitude it had a momentous effect on custom car builders appeared in several magazines at the time and reappeared numerous times since earning an honorable mention on Rod Custom s Twenty Best of All Time list in br The Eight remains a very popular subject for car modellers In Mattel Hot Wheels created a model of Mercury with a chopped top It is called Purple Passion Fiberglass replicas of the Eight inspired by
