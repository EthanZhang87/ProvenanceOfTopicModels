Day Night is a American animated short film written and directed by Teddy Newton in his directorial debut and produced by Pixar It was shown in theaters before Toy Story and has been released to purchase on iTunes in the United States Unlike most other Pixar shorts the animation style combines D and D elements and Up production designer Don Shank says it is unlike anything Pixar has produced before br br br Plot br Day Night follows two characters Day and Night Inside Day is a day scene with a sun in the center and inside Night is a night scene with a moon in the center Whatever goes on inside of Day or Night expresses normal events that typically occur within a day or night respectively and these events often correspond with actions or emotions that Day or Night express or receive For example when Day is happy he will have a rainbow inside him and when Night is happy he will have fireworks inside him br Day and Night meet and at first they are uneasy about each other They are dismissive of each other because each perceives the other as being different and their prejudices result in a physical altercation between the two However as the characters discover the many fascinating events that occur in each other they learn to appreciate them and learn to like one another At the end of the film the Sun descends in Day and rises in Night so that when the Sun is at the same height above the horizon in each both characters appear to be identical As the Sun continues its course Day becomes Night and Night becomes Day br br br Production br The short uses a novel effect of combining D and D animation The outlines of both characters are hand drawn and animated in D while the scenes inside their silhouettes are rendered in D the use of a masking technique allows the D characters to be windows into a D world inside them The Day Night is Pixar s second short film to be partially animated in D after Your Friend the Rat br The voice used in the short is from Dr Wayne Dyer and was taken from a lecture he gave in the s The director of the movie incorporated the ideas taken from Dyer s lecture to show that the unknown can be mysterious and beautiful and need not be something to fear which is echoed by a similar speech by Albert Einstein who said The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious Pixar honored Dyer by providing him with a private screening of the film br br Fear of the unknown They are afraid of new ideas They are loaded with prejudices not based upon anything in reality but based on if something is new I reject it immediately because it s frightening to me What they do instead is just stay with the familiar You know to me the most beautiful things in all the universe are the most mysterious br br The score was created by composer Michael Giacchino br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br The short has been critically acclaimed The Wall Street Journal described Day Night as a sensationally original short and said it looks like nothing you ve ever seen and plays like a dream of glories to come Antagony Ecstasy gave the film writing Newton s ability to finesse a remarkably difficult conceptual hook into a supremely easy cartoon is proof enough that he has storytelling skills much the equal of anybody working at Pixar Yet this is also possibly the least of the film s achievements it is technically formally and thematically a work of great accomplishment and merely being able to tell a weird story coherently is just cake at that point br The Projection Booth rated the film out of writing Still superior to the feature film Toy Story is the preceding short Day Night directed by Teddy Newton a morally and politically charged look at our perception of reality and each other and easily the best of Pixar s shorts to date Cinema Crazed said the short is ultimately very evocative of the classic Warner and MGM animated experiments that appealed to all audiences and didn t talk down to its respective theater going crowd NOLA com described it as an artful snatch of D whimsy br br br Awards and nominations br br Day Night was nominated for the Best Animated Short Film at the rd Annual Academy Awards br It won the award for Best Short Film at the th Annie Awards br The Visual Effects Society also gave Day Night an award for the Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Short br br br See also br La Luna film br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Day Night at Pixar website br Day Night at IMDb br Day Night at Filmaffinity
