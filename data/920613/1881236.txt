Shenandoah lead singer Marty Raybon to this day is the finest country singer on the planet Shenandoah had a huge impact on me Of course George Jones and Earl Thomas Conley just the tone of their voices and songs they ve recorded Keith Whitley and Stevie Wonder too Stevie is one of the best singers on the planet Rooney said Being a guitar player people like Eric Clapton I love Jeff Beck s playing and Chet Atkins and Vince Gill those styles I love technical players like Steve Vai and Larry Carlton I am a huge Brent Mason fan Dann Huff is one of my heroes too He always has been He can do it all the rock stuff he can blues it up too and he can do some country chicken pickin which I think is incredible DeMarcus said Some of my biggest commercial musical influences would be people like Merle Haggard George Jones of course Johnny Cash People that wrote and sang their own stuff I really admired I was an s child so I grew up loving all kinds of s rock I like R B too br Among the
