Folha de S Paulo sometimes spelled Folha de S o Paulo also known as simply Folha Portuguese pronunciation fo Sheet is a Brazilian daily newspaper founded in under the name Folha da Noite and published in S o Paulo by the Folha da Manh company br The newspaper is the centerpiece for Grupo Folha a conglomerate that also controls UOL Universo Online the leading Internet portal in Brazil polling institute Datafolha publishing house Publifolha book imprint Tr s Estrelas printing company Plural and in a joint venture with the Globo group the business daily Valor among other enterprises br It has gone through several phases and has targeted different audiences such as urban middle classes rural landowners and the civil society but political independence has always been one of its editorial cornerstones br Ever since Folha has had the biggest circulation among the largest Brazilian newspapers according to data by IVC Instituto Verificador de Circula o in January circulation was copies on weekdays and on Sundays In company with O Estado de S Paulo and O Globo Folha is regarded as a newspaper of record in Brazil Among daily newspapers Folha has also the news website with the largest number of visitors br br br History br br Folha was founded on February by a group of journalists led by Olival Costa and Pedro Cunha under the name Folha da Noite It was an evening newspaper with a project that privileged shorter clearer articles focusing more on news than on opinion and a positioning closer to the themes that affected the daily life of the paulistanos S o Paulo city dwellers particularly the working classes The paper was competing against O Estado de S Paulo the leading newspaper in the city which represented rural moneyed interests and took on a conservative traditional and rigid posture Folha was always more responsive to societal needs br Business flourished and the controlling partners decided to buy a building to serve as headquarters a printing press and then in to create a second newspaper Folha da Manh Also in Folha da Manh premiered Juca Pato a cartoon character drawn by Benedito Carneiro Bastos Barreto better known as Belmonte Juca Pato was supposed to represent the Average Joe and served as a vehicle for ironic criticism of political and economic problems always repeating the tagline it could have been worse br The two Folha newspapers criticized mainly the Republican parties that monopolized power back then the newspapers campaigned for social improvement The company was involved in founding the Democratic Party an opposition group However in Olival Costa by then sole proprietor of the Folhas mended his fences with the S o Paulo Republicans and broke his links to opposition groups connected to Get lio Vargas and his Alian a Liberal br In October when Vargas led a victorious revolution newspapers that opposed him were attacked by Alian a Liberal supporters Folha s premises were destroyed and Costa sold the company to Octaviano Alves de Lima a businessman whose main activity was coffee production and trade br br br Defense of rural landowners and opposition to Vargas br Alves de Lima s initial goal when he took over the newspapers in was defending the agricultural interests meaning rural landowners But important events elsewhere became the focus for news organizations the constitutionalist revolution when S o Paulo tried to recover the power lost to Vargas the World War II to and the Estado Novo the Vargas dictatorial period that extended from to br Alves de Lima had no news experience and so he charged poet Guilherme de Almeida with directing the company and chose Rubens do Amaral as newsroom head Amaral led a newsroom staffed by journalists hostile to Vargas Herm nio Saccheta a Trotskyite who was briefly a political prisoner under Estado Novo became an executive news editor as soon as he left jail br The dictatorial administration put political pressure onto news organs and in S o Paulo it took as its main target the daily O Estado de S Paulo a major supporter for the revolution The newspaper s director J lio de Mesquita Filho was arrested three times and forced into exile and Estado was under intervention by the authorities from to With its main rival muzzled Folha da Manh took a leading role in voicing opposition to Vargas dictatorship br This critical stance is one of reasons offered to explain a change in ownership during According to Jo o Baptista Ramos brother of Jo o Nabantino Ramos one of the company s new controlling partners with Cl vis Queiroga and Alcides Ribeiro Meirelles buying the Folhas was a maneuver Get lio Vargas engineered to get rid of the oppositionist viewpoint Rubens do Amaral a sworn enemy of getulismo gave to the paper s news coverage br Queiroga on his part represented Count Francisco Matarazzo J nior barred from owning press outlets in Brazil because he was born in Italy Matarazzo financed the purchase of new modern printing presses and saw the investment as a way to respond to the attacks he suffered from newspapers owned by his business rival Assis Chateaubriand br One of the weapons he developed for this battle was reducing the sales price of the Folhas in order to suffocate the business of Di rios Associados Chateaubriand s company However the ploy backfired Nabantino Ramos balanced those losses against the Count s initial financing and some months later declared that the company s debt to Matarazzo was fully paid and took over editorial control of the papers br br br The middle classes newspaper and civil activism br br Nabantino Ramos who was an attorney was very interested in modern managerial techniques and during the s and s adopted several innovations competitive examinations for new hires journalism courses performance bonuses fact checking He wrote a newsroom manual and editorial policy guidelines br In Ramos started a third newspaper Folha da Tarde and sponsored dozens of civic campaigns against corruption and organized crime for the defense of water sources infrastructure improvements city works and plenty more br However organized as an executive Ramos lacked business acumen and was not flexible enough to negotiate credit lines and balance budgets In the early s the company was suffering due to a rise in the prices of printing paper The three newspapers were merged under a new title Folha de S Paulo in but initially the morning afternoon and evening editions were kept However with a worsening financial situation only the morning edition survived br Things deteriorated further in after the news staff organized a strike that forced the company to pay higher wages and grant them additional benefits That meant additional costs for the paper On August the company was sold to entrepreneurs Octavio Frias de Oliveira and Carlos Caldeira Filho br br br Pluralism and leadership br Frias and Caldeira became respectively CEO and COO of the company and started their tenure by seeking to balance the newspaper s financial position Frias chose scientist Jos Reis one of the leading lights in the Brazilian Association for the Advancement of Science SBPC as newsroom head and also hired Cl udio Abramo the journalist credited with the successful updating of rival O Estado de S Paulo Abramo would take Reis place and form a productive working partnership with Frias that extended for more than years In Folha de S Paulo supported the coup that overthrew President Jo o Goulart and his replacement by a military junta the military role would be only temporary or so at least it was thought br After the financial and business hardships were left behind the new management started to concentrate on industrial modernization and in creating a distribution network that would facilitate the circulation leaps that would follow The company bought new printing presses and equipment in the United States In Folha became the first Latin American newspaper to adopt the offset printing system In it pioneered a new innovation lead typesetting was replaced by cold composition The newspaper s circulation was improving and its share in the advertising market was growing br Late in the s Frias even formed the nucleus of a national TV network adding to TV Excelsior which led in audience in S o Paulo and he acquired in three other stations in Rio de Janeiro Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul However Caldeira didn t like the TV business and the partners sold their TV companies in br The early s were a turbulent period for Folha Accused by guerrilla groups of lending vehicles to the military regime repressive apparatus Folha became a target for guerrilla action Guerrilla groups intercepted and burned three of Folha s delivery vans two in September and one in October and made death threats against the newspaper owner br Octavio Frias de Oliveira responded with a first page editorial entitled Banditry and stated that he wouldn t accept the aggressions or threats That was followed by an article on the news bulletin of ALN a guerrilla group in which Frias was classified as an enemy of the organization and Brazil br The bad blood between the newspaper and the left wing groups deepened and reached a climax with the editorial Political Prisoners published in in which the newspaper challenged the notion that there were people jailed for their political ideas in Brazil The editorial was also a response to rival O Estado for its defense of a special jail regime for political prisoners The editorial claimed It is well known that those criminals whom the daily Estado wrongly qualifies as political prisoners are just bank robbers kidnappers thieves arsonists and murderers acting sometimes with more exquisite perversity than those other lowly common criminals that the media outlet in question thinks deserving of all promiscuity br The episode has also caused an internal crisis One week later the newspaper suspended its editorials Later that same year Cl udio Abramo lost his position as newsroom head and Folha would only claim back a more avowedly political stance instead of the uncritical neutrality adopted when editorials were suspended late in br More innovative than its competitor Folha started to gain hold of the middle classes that were growing under the Brazilian economic miracle and became the newspaper of choice for young people and women At the same time it put effort into news areas that were not well covered in Brazil up to that time like business news sports education and services Folha supported the concept of a political opening and opened its pages to all opinion trends and its news coverage adopted a more critical stance br Frias believed in an editorial policy nonpartisan and pluralistic able to offer the widest range of views about any subject and he found a skilled collaborator in Cl udio Abramo the newspaper s editorial director from to followed by Ruy Lopes and Boris Casoy br Abramo took over once again in but then a crisis caused by an attempted military coup against President Ernesto Geisel led Frias to bring back Casoy Abramo reformulated the newspaper and led the first of many graphic reforms that would follow in he hired columnists such as Janio de Freitas Paulo Francis Tarso de Castro Glauber Rocha Flavio Rangel Alberto Dines Mino Carta Osvaldo Peralva Luiz Alberto Bahia and Fernando Henrique Cardoso Folha became one of the main forums for public debate in Brazil Contrary to some expectations this editorial posture was preserved and developed by Casoy during his tenure In Folha was the main bastion for the Diretas J movement an attempt to change the voting system adopted for presidential selection from a Congressional vote to direct popular voting br In Otavio Frias Filho became the editorial director systematizing and developing the newspaper s experiences during the political opening and Diretas J A series of documents circulated periodically defining the newspaper s editorial project as part of the so called Projeto Folha implemented in the newsroom under the supervision of Carlos Eduardo Lins da Silva and Caio T lio Costa The guidelines for Projeto Folha require critical nonpartisan and pluralistic news coverage Those principles also guide the Newsroom Manual first released in and updated several times later on More than a style guide it serves as a guide to the rules and commitments Folha works under It was the first publication of its kind to be made available to the general public br The guidelines stipulate that Folha s journalism should be descriptive and accurate but that themes that cause controversy can admit to more than one viewpoint and require a pluralistic treatment Folha also became known for its highly diverse selection of columnists At the same time checks and balances were instituted through internal controls the Manual the daily Corrections section adopted in a rule stating that objections to any article expressed by readers or for people mentioned in the news should be published and above all the ombudsman position created in this position entails job security for its holder whose aim is to criticize Folha and deal with complaints by readers and people mentioned in the news br From the midpoint of the Brazilian military rule Folha kept a critical stance towards several succeeding administrations Ernesto Geisel Jo o Figueiredo Jos Sarney Fernando Collor Itamar Franco Otavio Frias Filho was sued with three of Folha s reporters by then President Fernando Collor br Although Folha expressed support for Collor s liberalizing economic views it was the first publication to appeal for his impeachment which finally came in The newspaper s coverage about the administrations of Fernando Henrique Cardoso PSDB and Luiz In cio Lula da Silva PT led to accusations of anti governmental bias in both cases though the two Presidents belong to rival parties br Beginning with the exposure of a massive fraud on the Norte Sul railway and through the Mensal o scandal Folha kept revealing abuses and misrule br In Folha became the newspaper with the largest circulation among big Brazilian dailies and it still leads today In one year after reaching the landmark of one million copies for its Sunday edition the company put into operation its new printing center seen as the most technologically advanced in Latin America The company s circulation and sales record was set in with the launch of the Atlas Folha The New York Times copies for the Sunday edition br Currently Folha extended its range of communication activities with newspapers databanks a polling institute a newswire a real time news and entertainment service a printing company for magazines and a delivery company br In all shares of Empresa Folha da Manh then belonging to Carlos Caldeira Filho were transferred to Octavio Frias de Oliveira Folha s publisher until his death in Folha s executive editors since have been journalists Matinas Suzuki Eleonora de Lucena and S rgio D vila from March br br br Technology and innovation br In Folha adopted full color offset presses becoming the first large circulation publication to do so in Brazil In the newspaper replaced lead typesetting with the first cold composition system in Brazil In when its first computer terminals were installed it became the first computerized newsroom in South America br In Folha launched its first newsroom manual those books would in time become valuable reference works for students and journalists The manual was updated in new editions launched in and br In Folha became the first Brazilian media vehicle to appoint an ombudsman charged with receiving evaluating and forwarding complaints by the readers and to present critical comments both about Folha and other media vehicles Nine journalists have occupied this position since then Caio T lio Costa Mario Vitor Santos Junia Nogueira de S Marcelo Leite Renata Lo Prete Bernardo Ajzenberg Marcelo Beraba M rio Magalh es and Carlos Eduardo Lins da Silva In February Suzana Singer was appointed to the position br In when the Folha Printing and Technology Center started operations in Tambor near S o Paulo this modern printing plant built at a cost of US million allowed Folha to circulate with most of its pages in full color br br br Sections desks and supplements br In the first half of Folha carried the

br br br Foreign correspondents br In early Folha had correspondents either full time or research fellows in the following cities br br Washington United States br New York United States br Buenos Aires Argentina br London United Kingdom br Jerusalem Israel br Tehran Iran br Beijing China br br br Controversies br br br Ditabranda br br On February in an editorial criticizing the Hugo Ch vez administration in Venezuela Folha defined the earlier Brazilian military dictatorship as a ditabranda meaning soft dictatorship as follows However if the ditabrandas such as the one Brazil had from to started with an institutional breakdown then later on either preserved or created controlled forms of political expression and access to Justice the new Latin American authoritarianism pioneered by Peru s Fujimori goes the opposite way A leader democratically elected works from within to undermine the institutions the checks and balances step by step br There was an immediate and strong reaction to the use of ditabranda a word coined in Spain during the s when General Damaso Berenguer replaced General Primo de Rivera and governed through decrees revoking some of the decisions adopted by the preceding dictator That period is commonly referred to as Berenguer s dictablanda and the word was used later on in different contexts in Chile Mexico Uruguay and Colombia br Folha published letters about the editorial of which criticized the word choice Among them were letters by Maria Victoria Benevides and F bio Konder Comparato both of them professors at the University of S o Paulo In his letter Comparato wrote that the editorialist and the executive editor that approved the text should be sentenced to public penance getting down on their knees on a public square to beg forgiveness to the Brazilian public br The newspaper answered by defining the professors indignation as cynical and untrue and claiming that both of them were well respected figures and did not express similar disdain regarding left wing dictatorships such as Cuba s Editorial note Folha respects the opinion of readers who disagree with the expression used to qualify Brazilian military rule in our recent editorial and is printing some of their complaints above As regards Professors Comparato and Benevides well known figures that up until today expressed no repudiation to left wing dictatorships such as Cuba s their indignation is clearly cynical and untrue br The use of the word ditabranda led to Folha being the target of criticism on Internet discussion boards and other media vehicles particularly those closer to left wing thinking such as the magazines F rum Caros Amigos that ran a cover story about the case and Carta Capital br On March there was a protest in front of Folha s headquarters in Central S o Paulo against the use of the word ditabranda and to express solidarity to Maria Victoria Benevides e F bio Konder Comparato who did not take part in the act br The protest gathered around people and was organized by the Movimento dos Sem M dia an activist group created by blogger Eduardo Guimar es Most of the participants were relatives of people victimized by the Brazilian dictatorship and union activists connected to labor organization CUT br On the same day Otavio Frias Filho Folha s editorial director stated br Using the word ditabranda in our February editorial was a mistake It is a frivolous term inappropriate to such grave matters All dictatorships are equally abominable br However from a historical standpoint it is still a fact that the Brazilian dictatorship however brutal was less repressive than similar regimes in Argentina Uruguay and Chile or than the left wing Cuban dictatorship The note we printed to accompany the letters by Professors Comparato and Benevides on February was a sharp worded response to a sharp worded rebuke the claim that those responsible for the editorial should apologize on their knees In order to impeach the democratic credentials of others those so called democrats should first show their rejection and with the same venom of the methods adopted by left wing dictatorships towards which they are partial br The note led the professors to request by way of their lawyers the right to publish additional considerations labeled as right to response To take more than two weeks to recognize a grave editorial misstep labeling the Brazilian military regime as a ditabranda and to shift the blame for the incident onto the tenor of our criticism does not seem a behavior compatible with the ethics of journalism We have always claimed with no need of righteous lessons from no one else that the victims of arbitrary regimes both here and elsewhere deserve the same protection and respect no matter our ideological biases or personal preferences br The professors response was printed accompanied by a new editorial note Folha s treatment of the situation created by the use of the word ditabranda in an editorial dated February with the printing of several critical messages and our acknowledgement that the word was used frivolously is an example of editorial fairness The episode was supposedly closed but Professors Comparato e Benevides are intent on extracting the maximum gain from it Their opinions were always depicted faithfully by the newspaper through several articles with no need of lawyer intervention The response above was printed based on Act a decree adopted by the military regime so that the victims of regimes so cautiously described as arbitrary and conveniently located elsewhere can benefit from this shamefaced solidarity br The protests were taken advantage of by Rede Record a TV network controlled by bishop Edir Macedo owner of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God as an excuse to air several attacks on Folha as part of the Domingo Espetacular TV show Record had already attacked Folha for news reports that pointed at the church s business activities and irregularities br For minutes Record aired testimonials by victims of the Brazilian military dictatorship and criticized repeatedly the use of the word ditabranda The TV show also stated that Folha da Tarde a currently discontinued newspaper then ran by Grupo Folha was supportive of the governmental repression of left wing guerrillas in the early s br br br Dilma Rousseff s criminal file br On April Folha ran an article about a supposed plan by guerrilla group Vanguarda Armada Revolucion ria Palmares to kidnap Antonio Delfim Netto who was the Finance minister during the military rule in the early s and alongside printed a criminal file about Dilma Rousseff who was already the Brazilian President The authenticity of the police record was contested br On April of the same year the newspaper stated in a report that it was impossible to guarantee that Rousseff s police record was authentic Folha was twice mistaken on its April issue when reproducing a supposed police record that tracked Minister Rousseff s chief of staff to the President participation in plotting or carrying out armed actions against the military dictatorship br The first mistake was claiming in a first page article that the police record was part of the Dops archive Actually Folha received it as part of an e mail message The second mistake was to consider as authentic a police record that cannot be verified or disproven with the information currently available br Ombudsman Carlos Eduardo Lins da Silva wrote about the case stating in his Folha column that after the Minister contested the authenticity of the police record the newspaper admitted to not having verified its accuracy I found insufficient the justifications offered to explain this error and suggested that an independent panel should be empowered to find out what happened and recommend new procedures to avoid any repetition However the newsroom officials decided that there was no need for further inquiry br The police record is available on the Website of the radical Ternuma group and is not included in the S o Paulo State Archives that hold all files pertaining to the former Department for Social and Political Order br br br Rape accusation against Lula br On November Folha published an article by former Workers Party member C sar Benjamin accusing president Luiz In cio Lula da Silva of having told Benjamin during a meeting for Lula s presidential campaign that Lula had attempted to rape another inmate while he was being held as a political prisoner in S o Paulo According to filmmaker S lvio Tendler who was at the meeting Lula s account was merely a joke Advertiser Paulo de Tarso Santos also present at the meeting stated that he does not remember such talk ever taking place The accusation was also denied by Jos Maria de Almeida who had been incarcerated alongside Lula in He declared to have reasons to attack Lula His government is a tragedy for the working class But what was written never happened The allegedly raped inmate later declared to Veja that he would not speak to the press and that whoever made the accusation should prove it Folha was criticized by media analysts notably Alberto Dines for publishing the article without checking its factuality first br br br World Cup ad br On June Folha mistakenly published an ad by Extra Hipermercados owned by Grupo P o de A car one of the sponsors of the Brazil national football team which read A I qembu le sizwe sai do Mundial N o do cora o da gente The I qembu le sizwe leaves the Cup But not our hearts The ad suggested Brazil was out of the World Cup when it had actually defeated Chile and advanced to the next stage According to Folha there was a mistake during the selection of the material to be published br br br elections br In September Folha ombudsman Suzana Singer strongly criticized the paper s election coverage According to her Folha was digging recklessly through the life and work of presidential candidate Dilma Rousseff PT and reporting about it in a biased way She also commented the reactions of readers on Twitter where the hash tag DilmaFactsByFolha that held jokes about and criticism of Folha by users of the microblogging service reached the top of the list among the most commented topics br A survey by the Institute for Social and Political Studies Rio de Janeiro State University however found out that among the mainstream media vehicles Folha presented the most critical coverage about both main contenders and that its coverage of candidate Jos Serra PSDB was even more critical than its posture towards Rousseff The survey carried out in September and October shows that in contrasting positive negative and neutral reports Folha held a positive balance of three percent In the presidential election Folha also had the more balanced and less biased coverage among daily newspapers and was the vehicle that expressed more diversified opinions according to Doxa the Public Opinion and Political Communication Lab IUPERJ br Those surveys notwithstanding Folha was criticized for its false impartiality by website Falha de S Paulo created to spoof the newspaper for its supposedly biased coverage that favored Jos Serra and opposed the Lula administration Folha went to court appealing for closure of the Website claiming that its usage of a logo identical to the newspaper s with the change of just one letter in the name was not only confusing readers but also represented a trademark violation The legal issue was to determine whether free speech should get higher protection than the rights of property br On September a judge in S o Paulo granted an injunction that blocked Website Falha de S Paulo Independent media bloggers and the website owners saw the injunction was a form of censorship However the judge in charge of the case claimed that his decision was not due to the satirical aspect which our current laws would allow but to the use of a brand extremely similar to the plaintiff s Folha thus accepting the newspaper s argument br The case was highlighted in the website of the American technology magazine Wired It was also commented by Julian Assange founder of WikiLeaks during an interview to Folha s main competitor O Estado de S Paulo on December The blog is not intended to be the newspaper and I think it must be released he said The case was also highlighted by Andrew Downie in a Financial Times blog According to him Folha s response to Falha is in keeping with its reputation as somewhat humorless adding that the case has cost a damage to its reputation as one of the progressive forces in Brazilian journalism br br br See also br br Grupo Folha br br br Notes br According to the ad itself I qembu le sizwe means selection in
