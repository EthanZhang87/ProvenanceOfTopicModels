on genre that s as back lot savvy as it is light in the saddle Frank Lovece of Film Journal International noting the nervous but improvising hero s resemblance to the Don Knotts character in The Shakiest Gun in the West echoed this saying that with healthy doses of Carlos Castaneda Sergio Leone Chuck Jones and Chinatown this is the kid movie equivalent of a Quentin Tarantino picture There s no gory violence or swearing of course but there sure is a film buff s parade of great movie moments Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film four out of four stars calling the film some

dramatic but more like a succession of picturesque notions that might have flowed from DreamWorks or Pixar while their story departments were out to lunch br In one of the more negative reviews Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune acknowledged its considerable care and craft but called it completely soulless and that watching it with a big suburban preview audience was instructive Not
