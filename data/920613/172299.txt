does indeed take off a second time He and Timothy return to the circus with plans to surprise the audience br During the clowns fire act Dumbo jumps off the platform and prepares to fly He drops the

illustrations by Helen Durney The children s book was first brought to the attention of Walt Disney in late by Kay Kamen the studio s head of merchandise licensing who showed a prototype of the Roll A Book that included Dumbo Disney immediately grasped its possibilities and heartwarming story and purchased the rights to it br Originally intended as a short film Disney soon realized a decent book adaption needed a feature length film At the time the foreign markets in Europe had been curtailed due to World War II which caused Pinocchio and Fantasia to fail at the box office With the film s modest budget Dumbo was intended to be a low budget feature designed to bring revenue to the studio Story artists Dick Huemer and Joe Grant were assigned to develop the plot into a feature length film From January to March they wrote a page script outline in chapters much like a book an unusual way of writing a film script They conceived the stork delivery and the pink elephants sequences and had Dumbo s mother renamed from Mother Ella to Mrs Jumbo They riffed on elephants fear of mice by replacing a wise robin named Red found in the original story with the wisecracking mouse character Timothy They also added a rusty black crow which was later expanded into five Regardless of this very little was changed from the original draft In March a story team headed by Otto Englander translated the outline into story sketches br br br Animation br From Disney s perspective Dumbo required none of the special effects that had slowed down production and grew the budgets of Pinocchio Fantasia and Bambi When the film went into production in early supervising director Ben Sharpsteen was given orders to keep the film simple and inexpensive As a result the character designs are simpler background paintings are less detailed and a number of held cels or frames were used in the character animation Although the film is more cartoony than previous Disney films the animators brought elephants and other animals into the studio to study their movement br Watercolor paint was used to render the backgrounds Dumbo is one of the few Disney features to use the technique which was also used for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and regularly employed for the various Disney cartoon shorts The other Disney features used oil paint and gouache s Lilo Stitch which drew influences from Dumbo also made use of watercolor backgrounds br br br Disney animators strike br br During a story meeting for Bambi on February Disney observed that Dumbo was an obvious straight cartoon and that the animators that were assigned on Bambi were not appropriate for the look of Dumbo Animators such as Art Babbitt and Ward Kimball were considered for the film For that reason less experienced animators were brought on to animate the characters Kimball recalled that Disney approached him in a parking lot about Dumbo and summarized the entire story in five minutes And listening to him tell that story Kimball noted I could tell that the picture was going to work Because everything sounded right It had a great plot In spite of this Bill Tytla who was one of the studio s top animators animated the title character but admitted that it was in the nature of the film to go very fast and get it out in a hurry To speed up production Disney used photostats of story sketches instead of full layout artwork for the film and had experienced animators to supervise the younger less experienced animators assigned on the film br Production on the film was interrupted on May when much of the Disney animation staff went on strike Kimball chose to not to strike but his close friend Walt Kelly who was an assistant animator helping him on the crow sequence left the studios shortly after for reasons unrelated to the strike br Some have interpretied the clowns requests to get a raise from their boss being a reference to the Disney animators that went on strike in during the creation of the film demanding higher pay from Walt himself Animator and strike organizer Art Babbitt denied this saying he had been assigned to animate the sequence before the strike People attached political significance to what happened there You know Let s go on strike and so on We weren t thinking strike at the time In fact there never would have been a strike if it hadn t been forced on us br br br Music br Frank Churchill and Oliver

principles the animal kingdom that happy land where Disney workers turn into artists where their imagination playfulness ingenuity daring flourish freest where in short they re home br Bosley Crowther reviewing for The New York Times wrote that the film was the most genial the most endearing the most completely precious cartoon feature film ever to emerge from the magical brushes of Walt Disney s wonder working artists Time wrote Like story and characters Dumbo s coloring is soft and subdued free from picture postcard colors and confusing detail a significant technical advance But the charm of Dumbo is that it again brings to life that almost human animal kingdom where Walter Elias Disney is king of them all Harrison s Reports praised the film as one of Walt Disney s most delightful offerings Technically it is excellent the color is exceptionally good The story itself is pleasing it combines comedy with human appeal The only fault is that occasionally the action slows down br

music you d expect from a Disney classic Metacritic has assigned a weighted score of out of for Dumbo based on reviews indicating universal acclaim br br br Depiction of black people br The film has been criticized for its stereotypical depiction of black people The Encyclopedia of Racism in American Films notes that All of the circus laborers are African American the only time that blacks are seen in any great number in the entire movie Film scholar Richard Schickel in his book The Disney Version argued that the group of crows in the film were African American stereotypes The lead crow voiced by white actor Cliff Edwards in an imitation of Southern African American dialect was named Jim Crow after the pre Civil War minstrel character The term had become a pejorative term for African Americans and commonly referred to racial segregation laws and the character s name was changed in the s to Dandy Crow in attempt to avoid controversy The other crows were voiced by African American actors and singers of the popular all black Hall Johnson Choir including actors James Baskett Song of the South and Nick Stewart The Amos n Andy Show Ward Kimball the chief animator of the crows used famous African American dancers Freddie and Eugene Jackson as live action reference for the characters The personalities and mannerisms of the crows specifically their fast paced back and forth dialogue were inspired by the backchat found on the band records of Cab Calloway and Louis Armstrong Karina Longworth exploring the history of Song of the South in her podcast You Must Remember This discussed the basis of the crows in minstrel show culture as part of a wider use of minstrel culture by Walt Disney br The crow characters have been praised by a number of critical sources The animation historian John Canemaker felt that the crows were amongst the very few characters in the film that sympathize and are empathetic with Dumbo s plight Being a marginalized ethnic group themselves they can relate to Dumbo as a fellow outcast Canemaker further added that the crows are the most intelligent the happiest the freest spirited characters in the whole film In film critic Michael Wilmington referred to the crows as father figures self assured individuals who are obvious parodies of proletarian blacks but comments The crows are the snappiest liveliest most together characters in the film They are tough and generous They bow down to no one And of course it is they who teach Dumbo to fly br In Whoopi Goldberg expressed the desire for the crow characters to be more merchandised by Disney because those crows sing the song in Dumbo that everybody remembers In Floyd Norman the first African American animator hired at Walt Disney Productions during the s defended the crows in an article entitled Black Crows and Other PC Nonsense br The crows and Timothy Q Mouse were not included in the live action CGI remake of Dumbo In it was reported that an edited version of the animated film without the crows would be featured on the forthcoming Disney service The movie streams on Disney uncensored with an advisory in the synopsis warning it may contain outdated cultural depictions In the film was one of several that Disney limited to viewers years and older on their service Disney citing similarity of the crows depictions to racist minstrel shows br br br
