and revives when an hourglass empties cautioning that the more he dies the more time he will spend in the afterlife br After returning to Earth Pinocchio decides to earn money for Geppetto by

that Volpe has been lying to him about sending half their profits to Geppetto Hearing this Volpe viciously beats Spazzatura as a result upsetting Pinocchio who performs a song ridiculing Benito

a peg leg who explains to Geppetto and Sebastian about the Dogfish br br In Guillermo del Toro announced that his next project a darker adaptation of the Italian novel The Adventures of Pinocchio was in development He has called Pinocchio his passion project stating No art form has influenced my life and my work more than animation and no single character in history has had as deep of a personal connection to me as Pinocchio and I ve wanted to make this movie for as long as I can remember When he was a child del Toro saw and liked Walt Disney s animated film adaptation in Guadalajara Mexico partially because he felt it was like a horror movie in its own way due to a few intense moments it included Since his teen years he had longed to make his own version of the story In del Toro discovered Gris Grimly s illustrations for the edition of Carlo Collodi s book portraying Pinocchio as a puppet with a long pointed nose and spindly limbs with gestures that del Toro felt captured the energy of an unruly but otherwise goodhearted puppet He concluded that Grimly s illustrations reflected the setting he had in mind for his own more somber version of Collodi s tale When del Toro asked Grimly why Pinocchio looked the way he did Grimly said it was because Geppetto was drunk when he made him This thought evolved into an important part of Geppetto s backstory br On February it was announced that Grimly and Mark Gustafson would co direct a stop motion animated Pinocchio film written by del Toro and his long time collaborator Matthew Robbins and that it would be visually based on Grimly s designs Del Toro would produce the film along with The Jim Henson Company and Path Grimly devised Pinocchio s look for the film depicting him as unfinished wood Though Grimly was initially set to direct the film and del Toro was set to produce it on May del Toro took over as director He then teamed up with Gustafson a stop motion veteran who had experience in similar stop motion features like Fantastic Mr Fox to assist him in achieving his ambitious vision for the project In February del Toro released some concept art of Pinocchio Geppetto the Talking Cricket Mangiafuoco and the Fox and the Cat On July it was announced that the film would be produced and animated by ShadowMachine It was originally scheduled to be released in or but went into development hell with no further information forthcoming about it for years br On January Over the Garden Wall creator Patrick McHale was announced to co write the script with del Toro On August del Toro told IndieWire at the th Venice International Film Festival that the film would need a budget increase of million or it would be cancelled On November he reported that the project was not happening because no studios were willing to finance it At one point Matthew Robbins considered making a D animated version of the film with French artist Joann Sfar to bring the costs down but del Toro decided that it had to be stop motion even if the higher budget made it harder to get it greenlit On October it was announced that the film had been revived with Netflix acquiring it and Path no longer involved br Almost all the years of development were spent by del Toro and Gustafson defining the designs for the principal characters basing them on either Grimly s designs or letting del Toro s frequent collaborator Guy Davis who joined the project as co production designer with The Boxtrolls and Isle of Dogs art director Curt Enderle to design them They then gave the animation models to England s Mackinnon Saunders stop motion puppet firm which is considered by del Toro to be the best in the world and they fabricated the designs of Pinocchio Geppetto Sebastian J Cricket Count Volpe and Spazzatura the Monkey Most of the key characters have mechanical heads to create facial expressions but for Pinocchio a metal D printed puppet replacement faces were used br The antagonist Count Volpe is a combination of Mangiafuoco and the Fox from the original story Mangiafuoco was originally supposed to appear in the movie as an antagonist but he was removed halfway through production as del Toro disliked the character and thought he was a clich as a character model had already been made for Mangiafuoco to not waste the model Mangiafuoco s original design was used as a background character for Volpe s circus as a strongman The Cat who was shown in a concept art was replaced by Spazzatura while the Land of Toys was replaced with an Italian kids training camp At first the fairy with blue hair was a dead girl from the same cemetery where Carlo was buried This was changed into two angel like beings which ended up as the two sisters of life and death and Carlo was no longer buried in a cemetery br br Guillermo del Toro was intrigued by similarities between Collodi s The Adventures of Pinocchio and Mary Shelley s Frankenstein Both tell of a childlike figure brought to life and thrown into the world by a father figure who expects him to discover on his own the qualities that make us human such as love and the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong These themes reminded del Toro of his childhood Frankenstein partly inspired del Toro to give his Pinocchio a gothic direction but the film was still crafted to be family friendly He sought to make connections across generations and convey compassion a value del Toro feels is essential for children faced with the tremendous complexity of today s world br In del Toro s Pinocchio the wood used to construct the puppet is carved from a tree that grows over the grave of Carlo Geppetto s son Pinocchio s arrival provides his grief blinded father another opportunity for fatherhood However Pinocchio is rowdy exuberant and wild in contrast to the well behaved and docile Carlo The characterization of Sebastian J Cricket the talking cricket is also changed Sebastian somewhat ponderously takes on the role of Pinocchio s conscience His self importance annoys Pinocchio causing him to escape Sebastian s supervision The cricket comes to see that Pinocchio must discover certain things for himself such as love humility and how to behave As in the original book Sebastian is killed a number of times over the duration of the film but always comes back in order to fulfill his character arc Del Toro did not wish to overly rely upon magical creatures in the film Desiring more realism he reworked the Fox into a human naming him Count Volpe and having him replace Mangiafuoco as an homage to and amalgamation of both characters The Cat was omitted and the Land of Toys was transformed into an Italian children s training camp In the donkey subplot the Coachman is replaced by the Podest a fascist official who realizing that Pinocchio cannot be killed strives to recruit him into Italy s military Candlewick is changed into a bully who eventually redeems himself br Most versions of the story take place in a fairy tale environment Del Toro s film resituates the story in Fascist Italy between World War I and World War II during the rise of Benito Mussolini Pinocchio thus awakens in a society of people who behave like obedient puppets By contrast Pinocchio is independent and irrepressible He cannot bring himself to abide by the rules or submit to authority figures even when he encounters Mussolini himself and then the spirit of Death in limbo Gustafson was drawn to this characterization of Pinocchio newly born arriving in the world fresh and unaware of consequences Over the course of the narrative Pinocchio awakens to his latent humanity and in the end chooses to become mortal in order to save the life of Geppetto Del Toro chose to move away the original book s apparent agenda which can be interpreted as a moral tale that seeks to repress the spirits of children encouraging blind obedience to parents and other authority figures Del Toro however saw the development of Pinocchio s autonomy as a virtue Del Toro s film is oriented around self discovery and moral agency Del Toro s sought to explore aspects of father son relationships such as Geppetto s initial inability to accept Pinocchio as his own being more than just Carlo s replacement Geppetto struggles with guilt about the disruptiveness of the freakish monster that the town rejects initially Some themes of this work may seen in previous works such as The Devil s Backbone Pan s Labyrinth and The Shape of Water These three films also explore the humanity of those like Pinocchio who are perceived as different br Most previous renditions of this story feature the necessity of physical transmutation from wooden puppet to flesh and blood Del Toro explicitly rejects this concept that Pinocchio must physically change in order to be loved by his father and find happiness The film asserts that the essence of humanity lies in the feelings of interiority and the expressions of exteriority especially as behavior Pinocchio is therefore unconcerned with whether or not he turns into a real boy The basis of the transformation is instead Geppetto s journey to accepting and loving Pinocchio for who he is In the end he loves him as fiercely as he did Carlo This reminded del Toro of his relationship with his father Federico br br In assembling the film s voice cast del Toro and Gustafson selected multiple Academy Award winners and gifted performers with past creative ties with the former Daniel Radcliffe Tom Waits and Christopher Walken were originally considered to star in the film Waits was reportedly considered to voice Geppetto and del Toro was reported by Film to be floating up casting Walken as the Fox though he was also considering Donald Sutherland for that part Radcliffe would later instead remain as executive producer of the film Early on during the film s development del Toro first approached John Hurt with whom he had worked on Hellboy and Hellboy II The Golden Army to voice Geppetto but Hurt eventually died in long before any recordings for the film could begin br On January it was announced Ron Perlman Tilda Swinton Ewan McGregor Christoph Waltz and David Bradley had joined the cast of the film Bradley was chiefly cast due to his previous collaborations with del Toro on the television series The Strain and Trollhunters Tales of Arcadia He considered his role as Geppetto to be a real emotion rollercoaster of a part feeling it to resemble more King Lear than the Pinocchio story he had heard as a child Perlman was originally cast to voice Mangiafuoco but once del Toro decided to remove the character in favor of Count Volpe Perlman was recast as the Podest while Waltz was cast as Volpe who del Toro regards as the film s closest character to the Devil a more over the top character than the Fox and the Cat and a comically evil man who seems like taken out from the cartoonish and fantastical tone of the original book br On August Gregory Mann Cate Blanchett Tim Blake Nelson Finn Wolfhard John Turturro and Burn Gorman were added to the cast For Pinocchio del Toro sought a child actor who sounded like an ordinary boy instead of a cute one which led him to cast Mann for his phenomenal vocal range that made him sound like a natural child yet one absolutely emotional Mann s vocal performance provided a silly and sunny personality for the titular character who longs to learn about the world and meet everyone but given how he was created with the wood of the tree next to Carlo s grave his roots are somewhat sad Wolfhard who is not particularly fond of voice acting due to feeling himself not as proficient as professional voice actors was nevertheless relaxed enough to record some of his lines as Candlewick together with Mann as he felt that he performs voice over better with people around instead of alone in a recording booth crediting del Toro and Gustafson for allowing him that Blanchett approached del Toro about joining the film as they worked together on Nightmare Alley he told her that all roles had already been cast minus that of Spazzatura the Monkey which Blanchett gladly accepted as long as she could work with del Toro again She also suggested that the monkey was her spirit animal as del Toro prepared to commence production of Pinocchio to ensure her casting Blanchett recorded her voice over shot by shot instead of making different emotion sounds to be edited later on like it is usually done in other productions br br Filming commenced at the Portland Oregon offices of ShadowMachine by January Production continued through early summer with some select sequences being handled by del Toro s own Centro Internacional de Animaci n CIA local studio settled on Guadalajara Mexico since to foster local talent from Mexico All sets props and character costumes were crafted to the same historical and realistic standards del Toro s live action work has often contained hence the production s decision to not overly stylize buildings through methods like stylizing them in a curvy stretched and leaning way leading to a mix of stop motion and live action styles that support the film s themes Animators were also encouraged to achieve naturalistic performances from the puppets by making them commit mistakes like itching sneezing or looking away if embarrassed or scared in order to shoot the characters thinking and listening traits not usually shot in animation For Count Volpe s carnival Davis and Enderle drew from the reference material library collected for del Toro s previous film Nightmare Alley which prominently starred a s carnival and in which Davis had previously worked as a concept artist even though that film s carnival was one settled in the American Midwest rather than in Europe so despite the great overlap between American and European carnivals the filmmakers developed looks for both carnivals that were similarly downtrodden and threadbare Some Nightmare Alley early shots featuring Bradley Cooper s Stanton Carlisle arriving at the carnival inspired the sequence that establishes Volpe s carnival The afterlife sequences and the end credits scene were animated by studio El Taller de Chucho in Guadalajara Mexico br br The film s production quality was formed through the ornate detail of the sets and characters with their own textures in order to reinterpret Collodi s work in a way that differed from the Disney animated version Del Toro told Vanity Fair I have been very vocal about my admiration and my great great love for Disney all my life but that is an impulse that actually makes me move away from that version I think it is a pinnacle of Disney animation It s done in the most beautiful hand drawn D animation He saw as beautiful the idea of using puppets to create a movie about a puppet while pushing the boundaries of stop motion as much as possible to create a heartfelt movie any audience could watch Moving Picture Company worked on the visual effects with Bot VFX and Mist VFX br br On January Alexandre Desplat started composing the film s score and original songs It is Desplat s and del Toro s second collaboration after The Shape of Water Roeban Katz was the lyricist On August Nick Cave was attached to compose the score but he was replaced by Desplat eight years later br br In November Netflix set the film s release date for In January Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos
