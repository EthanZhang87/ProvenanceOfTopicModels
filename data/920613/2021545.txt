Open matte is a filming technique that involves matting out the top and bottom of the film frame in the movie projector known as a soft matte for the widescreen theatrical release and then scanning the film without a matte at Academy ratio for a full screen home video release It is roughly equivalent to an uncropped version of the film br Open matte can be used with non anamorphic films presented in or but it isn t used as often mainly because it adds too much additional headroom depending upon how well the framing was protected or for aesthetic purposes Instead those films will employ either pan and scan or reframing using either the well protected areas or the areas of interest Films shot anamorphically use the entire mm frame except for the soundtrack area so they must use pan and scan as a result br br br History br The rise of television and home media saw the use of a narrow aspect ratio of To avoid letterboxing for broadcast releases films were therefore reframed and cropped shot by shot to fit appropriately the full screen with the aspect with a process called pan and scan Hence only a cropped small portion of the theatrical frame was broadcast br Many films over the years have used the open matte technique for home video releases and television broadcasts the most prominent of which include the Back to the Future trilogy the Jurassic Park trilogy Schindler s List Titanic Top Gun Willy Wonka the Chocolate Factory The Fugitive Silverado and Predator as well as many films that have been specially formatted for the IMAX expanded aspect ratio of and Stanley Kubrick also used this technique for his last three films The Shining Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut br Films such as James Cameron s Terminator Judgment Day Michael Bay s The Rock and Steven Spielberg s Minority Report all of which were shot in Super also utilize the open matte technique but this is mixed with Pan and scan due to the visual effects being rendered in a wider aspect ratio br br br Open matte and pan and scan br Pan and scan is an important process to optimise the film presentation for home viewing and television For HDTV a combination of zooming and cropping is done to a portion of a frame usually in accordance to the most important details in a shot Pan and scan can be done on a Scope master for a film or even the Open Matte version br Open matte helps in the pan and scan process as there is more image to work with and use the extra image on the top and bottom to fill a display for HDTV broadcasts Additionally filmmakers may choose to release the open matte version for a film s widescreen home video release such as with James Cameron s Avatar and the Blu ray D release of Titanic br br br Usage br Usually non anamorphic perf films are filmed directly on the entire full frame silent aperture gate When a married print is created this frame is slightly re cropped by the frame line and optical soundtrack down to Academy ratio The movie projector then uses an aperture mask to soft matte the academy frame to the intended aspect ratio or When the full screen video master is created many filmmakers may prefer to use the full Academy frame open matte instead of creating a pan and scan version from within the framing Because the framing is increased vertically in the open matte process the decision to use it needs to be made prior to shooting so that the camera operator can frame for and protect for otherwise unintended objects such as boom microphones cables and light stands may appear in the open matte frame thus requiring some amount of pan and scan in some or all scenes Additionally the un matted version may often throw off an otherwise tightly framed shot and add an inordinate amount of headroom above actors particularly with depending upon how well the framing was protected or for aesthetic purposes With high definition television now in common usage with its standardized aspect ratio the need to reformat movies for television viewing has virtually evaporated although television broadcasts still reformat movies by means of using open matte or pan and scan For films with wider aspect ratios for example the matting bars will appear on the top and bottom of the screen of the broadcast image thus preserving each director s framing intent br br br See also br Shoot and protect br br br
