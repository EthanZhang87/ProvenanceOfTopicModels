feel like that this was the missing piece emotionally for the first movie Now I ve stopped saying never for anything because there are a lot of new characters that get introduced and we ve broadened the universe for this movie And again I m very used to seeing that world continue to open up from the Toy Story movies so I ve learned to just say to my knowledge I think everything that was born of the first movie is wrapped up But we ll see With any of the other sequels we strive to try and make it seem like it was inevitable like it was meant to be that all these extended stories and journeys with these characters were part of the whole canon And that s really hard but it s so satisfying for me when I m experiencing that whether it s a great second season of a TV show or another book in a series It s a small club when it s done successfully Regardless of how much people may vocalize that they don t enjoy or wish that there weren t extensions sometimes it s really nice to go back and spend more time with these characters if they evolve if they grow if they expand So that I m very happy with I feel like it was just as hard if not harder on Finding Dory to get it to feel inevitable and preordained and that it was always of the larger piece br In May Pixar CCO Pete Docter suggested that the studio is considering making a third installment in the Finding Nemo franchise He stated
