Richard Haydn Sterling Holloway Jerry Colonna and Kathryn Beaumont in her film debut the film follows a young girl Alice who falls down a rabbit hole and enters a nonsensical world Wonderland which is ruled by the Queen of Hearts while encountering strange creatures including the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat br Walt Disney was supposed to make his first film Alice which was supposed to star Mary Pickford as Alice but he chose not to do the film and instead did Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs However the idea was eventually revived in the s following the success of Snow White The film was originally intended to be a live action animated film but Disney decided it would be a fully animated feature film During its production many sequences adapted from Carroll s books were later omitted such as Jabberwocky the White Knight the Duchess Mock Turtle and the Gryphon br Alice in Wonderland premiered at the Leicester Square Theatre in London on July and was released in New York City on July The film was also shown on television as one of the first episodes of Disneyland It was initially considered a box office bomb grossing million domestically and received generally negative reviews from critics However its re release in theaters proved to be much more successful leading to subsequent re releases merchandising and home video releases it has been more positively reviewed over the years being regarded as one of Disney s best animated films today br br br Plot br In a park in England a young girl named Alice with her cat Dinah listens distractedly to her sister s history lesson and begins daydreaming of a nonsensical world She spots a passing White Rabbit in a waistcoat who panics of being late Alice follows him into a burrow and plummets down a deep rabbit hole Upon landing in a place called Wonderland she finds herself facing a tiny door whose handle advises drinking from a bottle on a nearby table She shrinks to an appropriate height but has forgotten the key on the table She then eats a cookie that causes her to grow excessively Exasperated by these changes of state she begins to cry and floods the room with her tears She takes another sip from the bottle to shrink again and rides the empty bottle through the keyhole As Alice continues to follow the Rabbit after encountering a Caucus Race she encounters numerous characters including Tweedledum and Tweedledee who recount the tale of The Walrus and the Carpenter Alice tracks the Rabbit to his house he mistakes her for his housemaid Mary Ann and sends her inside to retrieve his gloves While searching for the gloves Alice finds and eats another cookie and grows giant getting stuck in the house Thinking her a monster the Rabbit asks the Dodo to help expel her When the Dodo decides to burn the house down Alice escapes by eating a carrot from the Rabbit s garden which causes her to shrink to three inches tall br Continuing to follow the Rabbit Alice meets a garden of talking flowers who initially welcome her with a song but then banish her believing that humans are a type of weed Alice then encounters a Caterpillar smoking who becomes enraged at Alice after she laments her small size which is the same as the Caterpillar s after which the Caterpillar turns into a butterfly and flies away Before leaving the Caterpillar advises Alice to eat a piece from different sides of a mushroom to alter her size Following a period of trial and error she returns to her original height and keeps the remaining pieces in her pocket In the woods Alice gets stuck between multiple paths and encounters the mischievous Cheshire Cat who suggests questioning the Mad Hatter or the March Hare to learn the Rabbit s location but is unhelpful in giving directions Taking her own path Alice encounters both along with the Dormouse in the midst of an unbirthday tea party celebration The Hatter and the Hare ask Alice to explain her predicament to which Alice tries but becomes frustrated by their interruptions and absurd logic As she prepares to leave the Rabbit appears and the Hatter attempts to repair his pocket watch which results in its destruction Alice attempts to follow the Rabbit after he is ejected from the premises but decides to go home instead Unfortunately her surroundings completely change leaving her lost in the forest and she begins to cry along with many forest creatures which vanish br The Cheshire Cat reappears to the despondent Alice and offers a path to the hot headed Queen of Hearts the only one in Wonderland who can take her home In the Queen s labyrinthine garden Alice witnesses the Queen whom the Rabbit serves as a chamberlain sentencing a trio of playing cards to beheading for painting mistakenly planted white rosebushes red The Queen invites a reluctant Alice to play against her in a croquet match in which live flamingos card guards and hedgehogs are used as equipment The equipment rig the game in favor of the Queen The Cat appears again and plays a trick on the Queen setting up Alice to be framed Before the Queen can sentence her to execution the King suggests a formal trial At Alice s trial the Cat invokes more chaos by having Alice point him out causing one of the witnesses the Dormouse to panic As the Queen sentences Alice to execution Alice eats the mushroom pieces to grow large momentarily intimidating the court However the mushroom s effect is short lived forcing Alice to flee through the deteriorating realm with a large crowd in pursuit When Alice reaches the small door she encountered she sees herself sleeping through the keyhole Alice emerges from her dream and returns home for tea with her sister br br br Voice cast br br Kathryn Beaumont as Alice a curious and imaginative girl who gets

br br br Production br br br Early development br Walt Disney was familiar with Lewis Carroll s Alice books Alice s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass having read them as a schoolboy In while working at the Laugh O Gram Studio in Kansas City he produced a short film titled Alice s Wonderland which was loosely inspired by the Alice books and featured a live action girl Virginia Davis interacting with an animated world Faced with business problems the Laugh O Gram Studio went bankrupt in July of that year and the film was never released to the general public However when Disney left for Hollywood he used Alice s Wonderland to show to potential distributors By October Margaret J Winkler of Winkler Pictures agreed to distribute the Alice Comedies series and Disney partnered with his older brother Roy to form the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio which was later re branded Walt Disney Productions he also re hired his Kansas City co workers including Ub Iwerks Rudolph Ising Friz Freleng Walker and Hugh Harman to work on the series Alice Comedies began in before being retired in br By June Roy Disney was first interested in acquiring the film rights to the Alice books which as he learned were in the public domain In March Mary Pickford approached Walt with a proposal for a feature length adaptation of Alice in Wonderland which would combine Pickford s live action performance of the title role with an animated Wonderland supplied by the Disney studio Disney was hesitant about the idea and the project was quickly scrapped after Paramount Pictures secured the film rights for their own live action version In Disney produced the Mickey Mouse short film Thru the Mirror which was based on Carroll s second Alice novel Through the Looking Glass featuring Mickey Mouse going through a mirror into a world where all the items in his house become alive br br After the enormous success of his first full length animated feature Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Disney acquired the film rights to the Alice books with John Tenniel s illustrations from the Macmillan Company by May and officially registered the title with the Motion Picture Association of America He then hired storyboard artist Al Perkins to develop the story on September Perkins compiled a detailed page analysis of Carroll s book which included preliminary ideas of the story treatment and summarized descriptions for each scene On March British illustrator David Hall joined the Disney studio and was immediately assigned to create the concept artwork for the film A leica reel featuring Hall s paintings was completed on September but Disney was not pleased he felt that Hall s drawings resembled Tenniel s illustrations too closely making them too difficult to animate and that the overall tone of Perkins script was too grotesque and dark Disney also expressed a bit of disinterest in the project stating that there would be any harm in letting this thing sit for a while Everyone is stale now You ll look at it again and maybe have another idea on it That s the way it works for me I still feel that we can stick close to Alice in Wonderland and make it look like it and feel like it you know By February the project was still in the development albeit slowly with an additional story meeting held on April of that year After finishing his work on Fantasia concept artist Gordon Legg created new inspirational sketches for the film but eventually left the studio the following year By the fall of the animation work on Alice in Wonderland was planned to be completed within the next two years but Disney himself was rather unenthusiastic about the project br Disney brought up Alice in Wonderland again at a meeting on April offering to produce it as an animated film starring a live action actress similar to his earlier Alice Comedies series at the same meeting Gloria Jean was suggested for the role of Alice br In October of that year given the box office underperformance of Pinocchio and Fantasia as well as the World War II cutting off the foreign cinema market Joseph Rosenberg of the Bank of America issued an ultimatum ordering Disney to restrict himself to producing animated shorts and to finish features already in production no other feature film would begin work until they had been released and earned back their costs In response the production of Alice in Wonderland was heavily scaled back and eventually shelved br br br Return to production br Disney first attempted to revive Alice in Wonderland in mid new storyboards were developed throughout much of that year but the project did not move forward Ginger Rogers was briefly considered to portray the role of Alice on a live action animated feature but she only voiced the character for a record album of the story which was released by Decca Records on October In the fall of Disney hired British author Aldous Huxley to work on a live action animated feature titled Alice and the Mysterious Mr Carroll which would revolve around Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddell who was the inspiration for Alice Huxley delivered a fourteen page treatment on November followed by the first draft of the script written on December of that year He devised a story in which Carroll and Liddell were misunderstood and persecuted following the publication of Alice in Wonderland while stage actress Ellen Terry was sympathetic to both Carroll and Liddell and Queen Victoria served as the deus ex machina validating Carroll due to her appreciation for the book Disney considered child actress Margaret O Brien for the title role but felt that Huxley s version was too literal an adaptation of Carroll s book Background artist Mary Blair submitted some concept drawings for Alice in Wonderland Blair s paintings moved away from Tenniel s detailed illustrations by taking a modernist stance using bold and unreal colors Walt liked Blair s designs and the script was re written to focus on comedy music and the whimsical side of Carroll s books Lisa Davis who later voiced Anita Radcliffe in One Hundred and One Dalmatians and Luana Patten were also considered for the role of Alice br However Disney soon realized that he could only do justice to the book by making an all animated feature and in work began on Alice in Wonderland With the film tentatively scheduled for release in animation crews on Alice in Wonderland and Cinderella effectively competed against each other to see which film would finish first By early Cinderella had progressed further than Alice in Wonderland br A legal dispute with Dallas Bower s film version was also under way Disney sued to prevent release of the British version in the U S and the case was extensively covered in Time magazine The company that released the British version accused Disney of trying to exploit their film by releasing its version at virtually the same time br br br Writing br The first story meetings on Alice in Wonderland were held as early as in December Through various drafts of the script many sequences that were present in Carroll s book drifted in and out of the story However Disney insisted that the scenes themselves keep close to those in the novel since most of its humor is in the writing br One omitted scene from the treatment of the film occurred outside the Duchess manor where the Fish Footman is giving a message to the Frog Footman to take to the Duchess saying that she is invited to play croquet with the Queen of Hearts Alice overhears this and sneaks into the kitchen of the manor where she finds the Duchess Cook maniacally cooking and the Duchess nursing her baby The cook is spraying pepper all over the room causing the Duchess and Alice to sneeze and the baby to cry After a quick conversation between Alice and the Duchess the hot tempered Cook starts throwing pots and pans at the noisy baby Alice rescues the baby but as she leaves the house the baby turns into a pig and runs away The scene was scrapped for pacing reasons br br Another scene that was deleted from a later draft occurred in Tulgey Wood where Alice encountered what appeared to be a sinister looking Jabberwocky hiding in the dark before revealing himself as a comical looking dragon like beast with bells and factory whistles on his head A song Beware the Jabberwock was also written but the scene was scrapped in favor of The Walrus and the Carpenter poem Out of a desire to keep the Jabberwocky poem in the film it was made to replace an original song for the Cheshire Cat I m Odd br Another deleted scene in Tulgey Wood shows Alice consulting with The White Knight who was meant to be somewhat a caricature of Walt Disney Although Disney liked the scene he felt it was better if Alice learned her lesson by herself hence the song Very Good Advice The Trial scene at the end of the film was edited with Alice being accused of teasing the Queen during a game of croquet rather than the Knave of Hearts being accused for stealing tarts the Queen made br Other characters such as Mock Turtle and the Gryphon were discarded for pacing reasons though they would later appear alongside Alice in some commercials br br br Music br In an effort to retain some of Carroll s imaginative poems Disney commissioned top songwriters to compose songs built around them for use in the film Over potential songs were written and many of them were included in the film some for only a few seconds the greatest number of songs of any Disney film In Frank Churchill was assigned to compose songs and they were accompanied by a story reel featuring artwork from David S Hall Although none of his songs were used in the finished film the melody for Lobster Quadrille was used for the song Never Smile at a Crocodile in Peter Pan which came out two years after film s release When work on Alice resumed in Tin Pan Alley songwriters Mack David Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston began composing songs for it after working on Cinderella However the only song by the trio that made it into the film was The Unbirthday Song br While he was composing songs in New York Sammy Fain had heard that the Disney studios wanted him to compose songs for Alice in Wonderland He also suggested lyricist Bob Hilliard as his collaborator The two wrote two unused songs for the film Beyond the Laughing Sky and I m Odd The music for the former song was kept but the lyrics were changed and it later became the title song for Peter Pan The Second Star to the Right By April Fain and Hilliard had finished composing songs for the film br The title song composed by Sammy Fain has become a jazz standard adapted by jazz pianist Dave Brubeck in and included on his Columbia album Dave Digs Disney The song In a World of My Own is included on the orange disc of Classic Disney Years of Musical Magic br br br Soundtrack and Camarata version br There was no soundtrack album available when the film was released in RCA Victor released a story album and single records with Kathryn Beaumont and several cast members that re created the story but it was not the soundtrack In Decca Records had released a Ginger Rogers dramatization of Lewis Carroll s book with Disney cover art perhaps tying in with earlier discussions of her being cast as a live action Disney Alice Decca did indeed license the rights to release the Alice soundtrack from Disney but later decided against it and never produced one When Disney started its own record company Disneyland Records in Spring it was found to be economically unfeasible at the time to take on the fees and other costs to produce a soundtrack album br In Tutti Camarata arranged and conducted an elaborate original production of the Alice score with Darlene Gillespie who had shown great promise among the Mickey Mouse Club cast as a singer Camarata assembled a new orchestra and chorus possibly with the cooperation of Norman Luboff as Betty Mulliner Luboff and choir member Thurl Ravenscroft can be heard in the Capitol studios in Hollywood The resulting album became one of the most influential and acclaimed studio versions of a score garnering praise from within the industry as well as the public The original issue WDL depicting Alice seated in a tree with characters beneath her is highly collectible The album was so popular it was reissued in and with different covers including story albums with books and single records all featuring music from this album as well as translated versions of the Camarata Alice music for international recordings br Selections from this album are still heard in the queue for the Alice In Wonderland dark ride at Disneyland in California and during the Storybook Land Canal Boats ride Tokyo Disneyland incorporated musical arrangements from the Camarata version for live shows and CD releases br To date the only soundtrack material ever made available on vinyl records was released outside the United States In the late nineties over years after the film s original release a soundtrack album of Alice in Wonderland was finally released in the U S on Audio CD by Walt Disney Records br br br Songs br Original songs performed in the film include br br Songs

Wonderland aired as the second episode of the Walt Disney s Disneyland television series on ABC on November in a severely edited version cut down to less than an hour br Beginning in the film was screened in several sold out venues at college campuses becoming the most rented film in some cities Then in Disney gave Alice in Wonderland its first theatrical re release The company even promoted it as a film in tune with the psychedelic times using radio commercials featuring the song White Rabbit performed by Jefferson Airplane This release was so successful that it warranted a subsequent re release in It was re released in the UK on December and on July br br br Marketing br Disney sought to use the new medium of television to help advertise Alice in Wonderland In March he spoke to his brother Roy about launching a television program featuring the studio s animated shorts Roy agreed and later that summer they spoke to the Coca Cola Company about sponsoring an hour long Christmas broadcast featuring Disney hosting several cartoons and a scene from the upcoming film The program became One Hour in Wonderland which was aired on NBC on Christmas Day At the same time a ten minute

s production budget of million the studio wrote off a million dollar loss During its theatrical re release in the film grossed million in domestic rentals br br br Critical reaction br Despite being regarded as one of Disney s best animated films today the initial reviews for Alice in Wonderland were negative Bosley Crowther reviewing for The New York Times complimented that if you are not too particular about the images of Carroll and Tenniel if you are high on Disney whimsey and if you ll take a somewhat slow uneven pace you should find this picture entertaining Especially should it be for the kids who are not so demanding of fidelity as are their moms and dads A few of the episodes are dandy such as the mad tea party and the caucus race the music is tuneful and sugary and the color is excellent Variety wrote that the film has an earnest charm and a chimerical beauty that best shows off the Carroll fantasy However it has not been able to add any real heart or warmth ingredients missing from the two tomes and which have always been an integral part of the previous Disney feature cartoons br Mae Tinee of the Chicago Tribune wrote that While the Disney figures do resemble John Tenniel s famous sketches they abound in energy but are utterly lacking in enchantment and seem more closely related to Pluto the clumsy pup than the products of Carroll s imagination Youngsters probably will find it a likable cartoon full of lively characters with Alice s dream bedecked with just a touch of nightmare those who cherish the old story as I have probably will be distinctly disappointed Time stated that Judged simply as the latest in the long popular line of Disney cartoons Alice lacks a developed story line which the studio s continuity experts for all their freedom with scissors and paste have been unable to put together out of the episodic books Much of it is familiar stuff Carroll s garden of live flowers prompts Disney to revive the style of his Silly Symphonies Yet there is plenty to delight youngsters and there are flashes of cartooning ingenuity that should appeal to grownups Writing for Film Miyako Pleines says Unlike the other Disney princesses before her Alice seemed to have no real purpose even if that purpose is simply to be a damsel in distress People saw her as lacking ambition and drive a lazy girl who daydreamed during her studies and wandered into a magical world br Alice in Wonderland was met with great criticism from Carroll fans as well as from British film and literary critics who accused Disney of Americanizing a great work of English literature Walt Disney was not surprised by the critical reception to Alice in Wonderland as his version of Alice was intended for large family audiences not literary critics Additionally the film was met with a lukewarm response at the box office Additionally he remarked that the film failed because it lacked heart In The Disney Films Leonard Maltin says that animator Ward Kimball felt the film failed because it suffered from too many cooks directors Here was a case of five directors each trying to top the other guy and make his sequence the biggest and craziest in the show This had a self canceling effect on the final product br On the film aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes Alice in Wonderland received an approval rating of from critical reviews with an average rating of The consensus states A good introduction to Lewis Carroll s classic Alice in Wonderland boasts some of the Disney canon s most surreal and twisted images Another film review
