that design work for new characters in the film had begun by November with comic book artist Kris Anka later revealing that he was serving as a character designer on the film On June the film s lead animator Nick Kondo announced that production had started The different universes visited in the film were designed to look like they were each drawn by a different artist Having learned new animation tools after working on The Mitchells vs the Machines following the first Spider Verse film Lord and Miller ambitiously employed them to develop six different animation styles The intent was to amaze the audience whenever the characters cross into a new environment so the film can accurately reflect its plot and the styles can generate various emotional backdrops Earth the home of Gwen Stacy was designed to look like impressionistic watercolor paintings The animation team created a simulator to generate this style and used a visual palette that reflects Gwen s emotions like a three dimensional mood ring According to co director Justin K Thompson the reflection of her emotions through colors is inspired by a scene in s Cinderella where her dress gets torn and the environment reacts to that trauma This style was also intended by Miller to remind the audience about the covers of the Spider Gwen comic books One of the two alternate Earths seen in the trailer was Earth which the crew nicknamed Mumbattan after Mumbai and Manhattan due to that world being based on the one from Gotham Entertainment Group s Spider Man India comic book series To give the character Pavitr Prabhakar unique motion and fighting style the creative team researched the year old Indian martial arts Kalaripayattu from the state of Kerala The other universe was Nueva York the futuristic New York City from the Marvel world was heavily influenced by Syd Mead s neo futurist illustrations which has an unfinished look Also the works of artists Ron Cobb John Bell John Berkey John Harris and Ralph McQuarrie were inspirations for the city s design in addition to the architecture of Oscar Niemeyer The city was created as a highly controlled environment reflecting Miguel s personality and has an authoritarian brutalist and minimalist style of design meant to represent a clean strong unified front facing ideology But when going underground one realizes that it s a world that can t really be controlled br While the cast and crew were being interviewed for Empire in March codirector Joaquim Dos Santos revealed that another universe would be the punky New London inhabited by Daniel Kaluuya s Spider Punk with a final dimension being kept tightly under wraps for now later revealed to be Earth the world the spider that bit Miles came from and where he has become that world s version of the Prowler Spider Punk s animation style took two to three years to develop and is inspired by collage imagery of s punk rock album covers posters and zines emulating the look of Xerox prints colored papers and images appropriated from magazines and newsprints and has a general grayed out quality due to copy machines not having toner in them Also the animators experimented with different frame rates to reflect DIY punk visuals and Spider Punk s anarchic personality and tendency of inconsistency His body is animated on s or s or images his guitar on s images and his outline on s or s or images unlike rest of the characters that are predominantly animated on s In May Jake Johnson revealed in an interview that a Lego universe would be featured in the film The Lego sequence was done by year old Canadian animator Preston Mutanga and was added late in the movie after the filmmakers were so impressed by his fan made Lego recreation of the film s first teaser that they tracked him down and recruited him br Miles design was updated for the sequel to show him having gone through a growth spurt while Gwen was given a new haircut and an updated costume Rick Leonardi the co creator of Spider Man was brought on to adapt his own designs for the film while comic book artist Brian Stelfreeze was chosen to shape the visual development of Jess Drew inspired both by the white comic book Spider Woman Jessica Drew and the black live action television Spider Woman Valerie the Librarian portrayed by Hattie Winston in Spidey Super Stories The Spot s design which was influenced by Austrian artist Egon Schiele evolves throughout the film as he gains more confidence and control of his abilities beginning with a style that looks like an unfinished sketch with blue construction lines that evoke a comic book artist s rough drawing before the work goes to an inker The Spot s portals were intended to look like living ink that had spilled or splattered on the comic artist s drawing which created new challenges for the animation team The Vulture was given a Renaissance era design inspired by the artwork of Leonardo da Vinci s workbooks Thompson also revealed that the design of the spider in the Go Home Machine is influenced by the spider in the movie Krull which is also named Ynyr after a character from the film Gwen Stacy s hair received a redesign in the movie incorporating Gwenpool s pink highlights in a reference to Marvel Rising This was credited by Across the Spider Verse production designer Patrick O Keefe to artist Peter Chan in January as having been based on Gurihiru s work on The Unbelievable Gwenpool Beyond the Fourth Wall with the design of Gwen Stacy s bedroom also taking influence from the color palette of Gwenpool s hospital gown br br br Post production br In May Powers revealed that the film would end on a cliffhanger and co director Dos Santos compared it to the Star Wars original trilogy film The Empire Strikes Back Powers explained br br Across The Spider Verse is a movie on its own but it definitely ends on a bit of a cliffhanger I think it s a good cliffhanger We hope that it s a satisfying tee up for what s coming in the third film because you want people to be excited about what s coming next And it helps that we knew going in that this was part two of a three part story Since you already know that that third story is guaranteed you can tackle it a bit differently That being said there s a lot of key characters in this film and there s a story in this film that has an arc of its own that we needed to complete br In the same month Powers also stated that the film would not be tied to the Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU In the film Miguel makes a direct reference to the events of Spider Man No Way Home telling Gwen to not get him started on Doctor Strange and that little nerd back on Earth referring to the Doctor Strange and Spider Man of the MCU while attributing the events of No Way Home to the collider explosion from Into the Spider Verse The quote is meant as a throwaway line that Lord and Miller came up with Additionally Donald Glover reprises his role as an alternate version of Aaron Davis Prowler from the MCU film Spider Man Homecoming in a live action cameo depicted as a prisoner of the Spider Society displaced from his home reality Production on Across the Spider Verse was completed on May days before the U S release date With a runtime of minutes it is the longest animated film ever produced by an American studio surpassing Consuming Spirits br br br Allegations of poor working conditions br On June Vulture reported that four people who worked on the film alleged that production had faced difficulties due to numerous requests from Lord for changes to already finished animation as well as the need for him to approve animation layouts early in production Lord s directions were said to take precedence over the decisions of the film s directing team and led to numerous weeks of long overtime as the animators drastically revised portions of the film several times They further stated that difficult working conditions caused by the constant revisions caused over artists to leave the project before its completion and that both Into the Spider Verse and The Mitchells vs the Machines two earlier movies that Lord and Miller co produced for Sony suffered from similar production issues One artist said that production on Beyond the Spider Verse the film s sequel had not progressed and that there was no way that it would be completed in time for its scheduled March release window Sony denied the allegations concerning Across the Spider Verse s production troubles while declining to comment on the possibility of the sequel being delayed and producer Amy Pascal called the process of heavy revision normal br br br Music br br Daniel Pemberton confirmed in December that he would return to compose the sequel s score In December Lord and Miller confirmed

track was removed On June it was announced that the track was added into some versions of Fike s second studio album Sunburn which was released on July br Though external to the film s score and soundtrack Daniel Kaluuya also incorporated musical elements into his vocal performance as Spider Punk Hobie Brown Kaluuya elaborated that he searched for the word Spider Punk on Spotify hoping to find fan made playlists He stated that after finding some he would just listen to them be like vibing out helping him with the process of gauging the character s energy Kaluuya further noted that he wanted the character s voice to feel like a song and that a take in which he portrayed the character as rapping but in a punk style would be the one used in the film br br br Marketing br In May Sony entered into a promotional partnership with Hyundai Motor Company to showcase their new models and technologies in the film A prologue for the film was released at Comic Con Experience in December

antagonistic and that Miles family was in more danger than in the first film Meanwhile Abid Rahman from The Hollywood Reporter compared Miles introduction to the Spider People in the trailer to the vibe of Citadel of Ricks and highlighted the reference to the Spider Man pointing meme Commentators also noted that the trailer posited that Miles could potentially have to choose between saving the

of them The film s associate editor Andy Leviton confirmed the reports br br br Transgender iconography and censorship br br The film s release initially was delayed in the MENA region until June but later withdrawn from cinemas across the region because the film briefly features transgender iconography such as a transgender flag in two scenes including on a banner seen hanging in Gwen Stacy s bedroom with the words Protect Trans Kids The flag s appearance led to speculation that Gwen supports her universe s transgender rights movement and led some to interpret Gwen as being transgender herself Although she is not identified as transgender in the film viewers and critics who supported this interpretation additionally pointed to the use of the flag s colors light pink light blue and white elsewhere in scenes involving Gwen and her universe and the perceived parallels to coming out in her character arc within the film However others have noted that the blue and white colors were already used by the comics version of Spider Woman Gwen Stacy and thus were not necessarily proof that the film version of the character is trans br br br Home media br Spider Man Across the Spider Verse was released on digital download by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on August and on Ultra HD Blu ray Blu ray and DVD on September The digital release of the film featured additional

already been submitted for the finished version with other members of the team such as in the sound department also suggesting alternate ideas stating Because it s a multiverse movie it s like there s

PostTrak gave it a overall positive score with saying they would definitely recommend it br Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert com gave the film out of stars writing Like the work of a young artist who refuses to be restrained by the borders of the frame Across the Spider Verse is loaded with incredible imagery and fascinating ideas It is a smart thrilling piece of work that reminded me of other great part twos like The Dark Knight and The Empire Strikes Back Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film stars calling it an extravagant very cool love letter to graphic design executed with superb draftsmanship and giddy infectious joy Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times also gave it out of stars writing It s a bit too much at times but it s also pretty great and it ll be a huge surprise if the third chapter in the trilogy isn t equally entertaining Kevin Maher of The Times gave the film out of stars writing It rarely draws breath between set pieces and creates distinct and spectacular environments for each separate spider verse br David Fear of Rolling Stone said that the film completely recaptures the panel to panel thrill of discovering your respective era s teen angsty Marvel icon The thrill of the multiversal new is gone Everything else however is extra webbed for your pleasure Alison Willmore of Vulture wrote Across the Spider Verse looks incredible even better than the groundbreaking first installment but what s truly impressive about it is how willing it is to entrust its storytelling to its animation The Atlantic s David Sims wrote that the film avoids seeming like a physics lesson because its visuals are consistently thrilling the most static bits of dialogue still pop because of how daring the animation is Kyle Smith of The Wall Street Journal described the film as being visually hypercaffeinated but with a slow plot in the first half of the film plotlines being a hectic series of clashes action sequences that were jumpy but not especially engaging and too many long monologues Jake Wilson of The Age gave the film out of stars writing Typically for Lord and Miller the upshot is both adventurous and conformist an outwardly bold
