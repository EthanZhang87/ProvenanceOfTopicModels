br br Production br br br Development br By The Rescuers had become one of Disney s most successful recent animated films earning million in worldwide box office rentals Under the new studio management of then CEO Michael Eisner and studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg it was decided that a feature length sequel should be produced Shortly after the success of Crocodile Dundee had enhanced the appeal of Australian culture to a mainstream American audience The new sequel would be set in Australia for which writing began in br When Oliver Company was nearly complete Peter Schneider then president of Walt Disney Feature Animation asked supervising animator Mike Gabriel if he would consider directing At the time Gabriel declined the offer stating Well after watching George Scribner it doesn t look like it would be much fun A few months later Schneider called Gabriel into his office and asked him if he would direct The Rescuers Down Under to which Gabriel accepted After animating the character Tito on Oliver Company which was met with praise from general audiences Hendel Butoy was added as the film s co director Meanwhile Schneider recruited Thomas Schumacher who had worked at the Mark Taper Forum to serve as producer on the film br As the film s producer Schumacher selected storyboard artist Joe Ranft to serve as story supervisor believing he had the ability to change and transform through excellence of idea Throughout the storyboarding process Ranft constantly bolstered the creative morale of his crew but he rarely drew storyboard sequences himself Ranft also had creative disagreements with the studio s management and marketing executives including one where he and the story team advocated for an Aboriginal Australian child actor to voice Cody According to storyboard artist Brenda Chapman Katzenberg overrode this idea casting a little white blonde kid and giving Cody a matching design br Because of the rising popularity of Australian themed action films and with Americans becoming more environmentally conscious the filmmakers decided to abandon the musical format from the original film They had decided that the placement of songs would slow down the pacing for the new film Instead they decided to market it as the studio s first action adventure film with Butoy and Gabriel taking inspiration from live action films by Orson Welles Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean It would also be the studio s first animated film since Bambi to have an animal rights and environmental message In December original cast members Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor were confirmed to be reprising their roles However Jim Jordan who had voiced Orville in the original film died earlier that same year in April following a fall at his home In acknowledgment of Jordan s death Roy E Disney suggested that the character of Wilbur be written as Orville s brother to serve as his replacement Intentionally the names were in reference to the Wright brothers br br br Animation and design br Members of the production team including art director Maurice Hunt and six of his animators spent several days in Australia to study settings and animals found in the Australian Outback to observe take photographs and draw sketches to properly illustrate the Outback on film They ventured through the Uluru Katherine Gorge and the Kakadu national parks the inspiration for Hunt s initial designs emphasizing the spectrum of scale between the sweeping vistas and the film s protagonists br Serving as the supervising animator on the eagle character Marahute Glen Keane studied six eagles residing at the Peregrine Fund in Boise Idaho as well as a stuffed American eagle loaned from the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History and an eagle skeleton To animate the eagle Keane and his animation crew enlarged the bird shrank its head elongated its neck and wings and puffed out its chest Additionally Keane had to slow the bird s wing movements to about percent of an eagle s flight speed Because of the excessive details on Marahute who carried feathers the character appeared for only seven minutes altogether during the opening and ending sequences br Furthermore in order to have the film finished on time Schumacher enlisted the support of Disney MGM Studios which was originally envisioned to produce independent cartoon shorts and featurettes On their first assignment on a Disney animated feature film artists contributed ten minutes of screen time including supervising animator Mark Henn As one of the film s ten supervising animators Henn animated several scenes of Bernard Miss Bianca and Percival C McLeach For the mice characters Henn studied the mannerisms of Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor during voice recording sessions and looked to George C Scott s performance in Dr Strangelove for inspiration while animating McLeach To create believable realism for the Australian animals additional animators traveled to the San Diego Zoo to observe kangaroos kookaburras and snakes while an iguana from Walt Disney World s Discovery Island was brought into the studio for the animators drawing Joanna br The Rescuers Down Under is notable for Disney as its first traditionally animated film using only the new computerized CAPS process CAPS Computer Animation Production System was a computer based production system used for digital ink and paint and compositing allowing for more efficient and sophisticated post production of the Disney animated films and making the traditional practice of hand painting cels obsolete The animators drawings and the background paintings were scanned into computer systems instead where the animation drawings were inked and painted by digital artists The drawings were later composited with the scanned backgrounds in software to allow for digital compositing like camera positioning camera movements multiplane effects and other camera techniques Those digital files would then be recorded onto film stock br The film also uses CGI elements throughout such as the field of flowers in the opening sequence McLeach s truck and perspective shots of Wilbur flying above Sydney Opera House and New York City The CAPS project was the first of Disney s collaborations with computer graphics company Pixar which would eventually become a feature animation production studio making computer generated animated films for Disney before being acquired in As a result The Rescuers Down Under was the first animated film for which the entire final film elements were assembled and completed within a digital environment as well as the first fully digital feature film However the film s marketing approach did not call attention to the use of the CAPS process br br br Music br br The score for the film was composed and conducted by Bruce Broughton Unlike the vast majority of Disney animated features the film had no songs written for it although Message Montage includes a quotation from Rescue Aid Society by Sammy Fain Carol Connors and Ayn Robbins the only musical reference to the first film This was the second Disney film not to include any songs the first one being The Black Cauldron br The score received positive critical reception with critics singling out Cody s Flight for its sense of majesty excitement and freedom AllMusic gave the soundtrack out of stars br In Walt Disney Records reissued the album on compact disc including the Shelby Flint songs The Journey Someone s Waiting for You and Tomorrow Is Another Day from The Rescuers In Intrada Records released the complete Broughton score including material in italics not used in the movie br br br Release br During the film s theatrical release the film was released as a double feature with the new Mickey Mouse featurette The Prince and the Pauper br br br Home media br The Rescuers Down Under was released in the Walt Disney Classics video series on September while The Rescuers was released on VHS a year

approval rating of based on reviews with an average score of The website s critical consensus reads Though its story is second rate The Rescuers Down Under redeems itself with some remarkable production values particularly its flight scenes Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews br Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times awarded the film out of stars and wrote Animation can give us the glory of sights and experiences that are impossible in the real world and one of those sights in The Rescuers Down Under is of a little boy clinging to the back of a soaring eagle The flight sequence and many of the other action scenes in this new Disney animated feature create an exhilaration and freedom that are liberating And the rest of the story is fun too Likewise giving it three stars out of four Gene Siskel of The Chicago Tribune summarized the film as a bold rousing but sometimes needlessly intense Disney animated feature where good fun is provided by a goofy albatross voiced by John Candy one in a long line of silly Disney birds Janet Maslin reviewing for The New York Times praised the animation and the action sequences though she remained critical of the storyline labeling it a trifle dark and un involving for very small children Maslin acknowledged that its slightly more grown up adventurous approach may be the reason it does not include the expected musical interludes but they would have been welcome A review in Variety felt the film carried such a mediocre story that adults may duck but nevertheless wrote that The Rescuers Down Under boasts reasonably solid production values and fine character voices br Rita Kempley of The Washington Post praised the film as a gorgeously drawn myth made for plucky children and very brave mice Halliwell s Film Guide gave it two stars out of four saying This slick lively and enjoyable animated feature is an improvement on the original TV Guide gave the film two stars out of four saying Three years in the making it was obviously conceived during the height of this country s fascination with Australia brought on by Paul Hogan s fabulously successful Crocodile Dundee By the mania had long since subsided and this film s Australian setting did nothing to enhance its box office appeal Further the film doesn t make particularly imaginative use of the location Take away the accents and the obligatory kangaroos and koalas and the story could have taken place anywhere br In a review Josh Spiegel wrote The Rescuers Down Under is not the great undiscovered Disney movie mind you The film was done in by bad contextual timing and poor scheduling and marketing and fans of animation would likely enjoy it for its somewhat large scope and setpieces However this is just a decent movie one that feels as tiny as its leads Conversely Ellen MacKay of Common Sense Media gave the film four out of five stars writing A rare sequel that improves on the original br br br Legacy br Like other Disney animated characters the characters of the film have recurring cameo appearances in the television series House of Mouse br Along with
