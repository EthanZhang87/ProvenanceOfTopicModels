ambitious to say As is normally the case they kind of throw darts out into the future and wherever they land they call that a release date until we start talking about it in practical terms and then it s like Uh yeah that s not enough time So knowing that they take three years from this moment from outlining and writing the screenplay through to the final lighting of it it s just a process of building models and doing tests and animating storyboarding the whole thing just adds up to about three years br In January the release date was pushed back a year from June to June following

including the age of dragons must come to an end He later went on to applaud the CGI lauding the arresting visuals and stating that The animation itself is striking an early sequence in which the sky is filled with dragons is an early sign of the visual treats to come and ends up being the film s highlight Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times gave a positive review of the characters and emotional

obligatory ending with Movie Crypt concluding that Fans will enjoy seeing their characters grown and progressing as story arcs are closed but the final resolution rings hollow Ultimately none of it appeared necessary other than a need to say goodbye the dragons and their champions certainly earned a better conclusion than that Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic says that The plot is thin and holey and the characters are mostly just a single gag set on repeat and calls it a lazy effort br br A live action reboot of the first film was announced to be in development It will be produced by
