sketched the family during an uncertain point in his film career Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life During this time Bird had signed a production deal with Warner Bros Feature Animation and was in the process of directing his first feature The Iron Giant Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life He stated Consciously this was just a funny movie about superheroes But I think that what was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie After the box office failure of The Iron Giant Bird gravitated toward his superhero story br He imagined it as a homage to the s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a D cel animation When The Iron Giant became a box office bomb he reconnected with old friend John Lasseter at Pixar in March and pitched his story idea to him Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at CalArts in the s Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar where the film would be done in computer animation The studio announced a multi film contract with Bird on May The Incredibles was written and directed solely by Brad Bird a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters with a history of working for the company In addition it would be the studio s first film in which all characters are human br br Bird came to Pixar with the lineup of the story s family members worked out a mom and dad both suffering through the dad s midlife crisis a shy teenage girl a cocky ten year old boy and a baby Bird had based their powers on family archetypes During production Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli visited Pixar and saw the film s story reels When Bird asked if the reels made any sense or if they were just American nonsense Miyazaki replied through an interpreter I think it s a very adventurous thing you are trying to do in an American film br Syndrome was originally written as a minor character who assaults Bob and Helen at the beginning of the movie only to die in an explosion that destroys the Parrs house in this version the Smiths but he was made the main antagonist because the filmmakers liked him more than the character of Xerek who was intended to fulfill that role The Snug character that Helen talks to at the phone in the final film was intended to fly Helen to Nomanisan Island and to die but he was removed from that position when Lasseter suggested having Helen pilot the plane herself Syndrome was based on Brad Bird himself br br br Casting br Holly Hunter cast as Helen Parr Elastigirl never voiced an animated character before and saw the role as an exciting opportunity to expand her repertoire She was also drawn to the film by its unique and unconventional story about family and human dynamics Bird considered Hunter one of the finest actresses in the world capable of playing a sensitive character who also has a very sturdy center Spencer Fox was cast as Dash Parr which was also his feature film debut Brad Bird wanted to give Dash a realistic out of breath voice in certain scenes such as the jungle scene so he made Fox run four laps around the Pixar studio until he got tired Samuel L Jackson was cast as Lucius Best Frozone Bird cast him because he stated that he wanted the character to have the coolest voice Lily Tomlin was originally considered for the role of Edna Mode but later turned it down After several failed attempts to cast Edna Mode Bird took on her voice role himself It was an extension of the Pixar custom of tapping in house staff whose voices came across particularly well on scratch dialogue tracks Sarah Vowell was offered the role of Violet unexpectedly Bird wanted to cast Vowell as Violet after hearing her voice on the National Public Radio program This American Life Bird stated that she was perfect for the part and immediately called her to offer her the role br br br Animation br Upon Pixar s acceptance of the project Brad Bird was asked to bring in his own team for the production He brought up a core group of people he worked with on The Iron Giant Because of this many D artists had to make the shift to D including Bird himself Bird found working with CGI wonderfully malleable in a way that traditional animation is not calling the camera s ability to easily switch angles in a given scene marvelously adaptable He found working in computer animation difficult in a different way than working traditionally finding the software sophisticated and not particularly friendly Bird wrote the script without knowing the limitations or concerns that went hand in hand with the medium of computer animation As a result this was to be the most complex film yet for Pixar The film s characters were designed by Tony Fucile and Teddy Newton whom Bird had brought with him from Warner Bros Like most computer animated films The Incredibles had a year long period of building the film from the inside out modeling the exterior and understanding controls that would work the face and the body the articulation of the character before animation could even begin Bird and Fucile tried to emphasize the graphic quality of good D animation to the Pixar team who had only worked primarily in CGI Bird attempted to incorporate teaching from Disney s Nine Old Men that the crew at Pixar had never really emphasized br For the technical crew members the film s human characters posed a difficult set of challenges Bird s story was filled with elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then Humans are widely considered to be the most difficult things to execute in animation Pixar s animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion Creating an all human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy clothing and realistic skin and hair Although the technical team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters Inc the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar up until this point Moreover Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity Where the technical team on Monsters Inc had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate the character Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face in fact this was integral to her character Violet s long hair which was extremely difficult to animate was only successfully animated toward the end of production In addition animators had to adapt to having hair both underwater and blowing through the wind Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues thinking that a live action film would be preferable but Lasseter denied this br br Not only did The Incredibles cope with the difficulty of animating CGI humans but also many other complications The story was bigger than any prior story at the studio was longer in running time and had four times the number of locations Supervising technical director Rick Sayre noted that the hardest thing about the film was that there was no hardest thing alluding to the amount of new technical challenges fire water air smoke steam and explosions were all additional to the new difficulty of working with humans The film s organizational structure could not be mapped out like previous Pixar features and it became a running joke to the team Sayre said the team adopted Alpha Omega where one team was concerned with building modeling shading and layout while another dealt with final camera lighting and effects Another team dubbed the character team digitally sculpted rigged and shaded all of the characters and a simulation team was responsible for developing simulation technology for hair and clothing There were at least visual effects shots in the film and they were quite often visual gags such as the window shattering when Bob angrily shuts the car door Additionally the effects team improved their modeling of clouds using volumetric rendering for the first time br The skin of the characters gained a new level of realism from a technology to mimic subsurface scattering The challenges did not stop with modeling humans Bird decided that in a shot near the film s end baby Jack Jack would have to undergo a series of transformations and in one of the five planned he would turn himself into a kind of goo Technical directors who anticipated spending two months or even longer to work out the goo effect stealing precious hours from production that had already entered its final and most critical stages petitioned the film s producer John Walker for help Bird who had himself brought Walker over from Warner Bros to work on the project was at first immovable but after arguing with Walker in several invective laced meetings over the course of two months Bird finally conceded Bird also insisted that the storyboards define the blocking of characters motions lighting and camera movements which had previously been left to other departments rather than storyboarded br Bird admitted that he had the knees of the studio trembling under the weight of The Incredibles but called the film a testament to the talent of the animators at Pixar who were admiring the challenges the film provoked He recalled Basically I came into a wonderful studio frightened a lot of people with how many presents I wanted for Christmas and then got almost everything I asked for br br br Music br br The Incredibles is the first Pixar film to be scored by Michael Giacchino Brad Bird was looking for a specific sound as inspired by the film s retrofuturistic design the future as seen from the s John Barry was the first choice to do the film s score with a trailer of the film given a rerecording of Barry s theme to On Her Majesty s Secret Service However Barry did not wish to duplicate the sound of some of his earlier soundtracks the assignment was instead given to Giacchino Giacchino noted that recording in the s was largely different from modern day recording and Dan Wallin the recording engineer said that Bird wanted an old feel and as such the score was recorded on analog tapes Wallin noted that brass instruments which are at the forefront of the film s score sound better on analog equipment rather than digital Wallin came from an era in which music was recorded according to Giacchino the right way which consists of everyone in the same room playing against each other and feeding off each other s energy Many of Giacchino s future soundtracks followed suit with this style of mixing Tim Simonec was the conductor orchestrator for the score s recording br The film s orchestral score was released on November by Walt Disney Records three days before the film opened in theaters It won numerous awards for best score including Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award BMI Film TV Award ASCAP Film and Television Music Award Annie Award Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award and Online Film Critics Society Award and was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media Satellite Award and Broadcast Film Critics Association Award br br br Themes br Several film reviewers drew precise parallels between the film and certain superhero comic books like Powers Watchmen Fantastic Four Justice League and The Avengers The producers of the adaptation of Fantastic Four were forced to make significant script changes and add more special effects because of similarities to The Incredibles Bird was not surprised that comparisons arose due to superheroes being the most well trod turf on the planet but noted that he had not been inspired by any comic books specifically only having heard of Watchmen He did comment that it was nice to be compared to it since if you re going to be compared to something it s nice if it s something good br Some commentators took Bob s frustration with celebrating mediocrity and Syndrome s comment that when everyone s super no one will be as a reflection of views shared by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche or an extension of Russian American novelist Ayn Rand s Objectivism philosophy which Bird felt was ridiculous He stated that a large portion of the audience understood the message as he intended whereas two percent thought I was doing The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged Some purported that The Incredibles exhibited a right wing bias which Bird also scoffed at I think that s as silly of an analysis as saying The Iron Giant was left wing I m definitely a centrist and feel like both parties can be absurd br The film also explored Bird s dislike for the tendency of the children s comics and Saturday morning cartoons of his youth to portray villains as unrealistic ineffectual and non threatening In the film Dash and Violet have to deal with villains who are perfectly willing to use deadly force against children On another level both Dash and Violet display no emotion or regret at the deaths of those who are trying to kill them such as when Dash outruns pursuers who crash their vehicles while chasing him or when both of them witness their parents destroy several attacking vehicles with people inside in such a manner that the deaths of those piloting them is undeniable Despite disagreeing with some analysis Bird felt it gratifying for his work to be considered on many different levels which was his intention The fact that it was written about in the op ed section of The New York Times several times was really gratifying to me Look it s a mainstream animated movie and how often are those considered thought provoking br br br Release br br br Marketing br A teaser trailer of The Incredibles premiered on May and was attached to the screenings of Finding Nemo
