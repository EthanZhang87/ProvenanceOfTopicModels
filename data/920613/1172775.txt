The Chevrolet Monte Carlo is a two door coupe that was manufactured and marketed by the Chevrolet division of General Motors Deriving its name from the city in Monaco the Monte Carlo was marketed as the first personal luxury car of the Chevrolet brand Introduced for the model year the model line was produced across six generations through the model year with a hiatus from until The Monte Carlo was a variant of the Pontiac Grand Prix throughout its production br From until the Monte Carlo rode on the unique A Special platform with the Grand Prix shifting to the standard A body intermediate chassis from the through model years For the Monte Carlo line underwent downsizing but was still considered a midsized coupe The rear wheel drive A body platform of this generation of Monte Carlo was redesignated as the G body when GM s front wheel drive A body cars were introduced for the model year After an abbreviated model year the Monte Carlo was replaced by the two door Chevrolet Lumina br For the model year the Monte Carlo was revived replacing the two door Lumina It shared the front wheel drive W platform with the two door Grand Prix and was the largest coupe in the Chevrolet lineup After the model year the Grand Prix coupe was discontinued the Monte Carlo became the largest two door model produced by an American auto manufacturer br In response to declining sales of the model line Chevrolet discontinued the Monte Carlo after the model year During much of its production the Monte Carlo represented the Chevrolet brand in stock car racing During the s the Monte Carlo SS was introduced featuring aerodynamically enhanced styling as part of its revival the Monte Carlo again represented Chevrolet in stock car racing from through its discontinuation br br For the model year GM instituted a split wheelbase policy for its A platform intermediate sized cars Two door models would have a in mm wheelbase in mm for sedans and in mm for station wagons In GM introduced the Pontiac Grand Prix a two door that used the A platform layout that was stretched ahead of the firewall to make it inch mm long This gave the design an unusually long hood design helping the new Grand Prix to outsell its larger B body predecessor despite higher prices The new layout was first known as the A body Special but would evolve into its own class known as the G platform br The Monte Carlo began as Chevrolet s version of the Pontiac Grand Prix as conceived by Elliot M Pete Estes general manager of Chevrolet and Chevrolet s chief stylist David Holls giving Chevrolet and Pontiac an alternative to the E body Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado They modeled the styling on the contemporary Cadillac Eldorado However much of the body and structure were shared with the Chevrolet Chevelle firewall windshield decklid and rear window were the same New exterior coke bottle styling featured concealed windshield wipers A fiber optic exterior light monitoring system was optional br A mid s article in the magazine Chevrolet High Performance stated that the first generation Monte Carlo was known to Chevrolet management under the working name Concours The usual practice at the time was that all Chevrolet model development names started with a C At one point the proposal called for a formal coupe sedan and convertible It has been noted that the sedan resembled a full size Oldsmobile before the use of the GM G platform with at least one photograph showing the pull up door handles that would be introduced on the Camaro and then on Vegas and full sized Chevys Monte Carlos received this design on the second generation model The Monte Carlo was available only as a two door hardtop br The Monte Carlo was developed at Chevrolet under the leadership of Pete Estes it was formally introduced in September by John Z DeLorean who succeeded Estes as Chevrolet s general manager earlier in the year after previously heading the Pontiac division where he led the development of the Series Grand Prix br br The styling of the model year Monte Carlo is distinguished by its chromed rectangular grille having a fine grid pattern of small squares with two horizontal dividers and centered in it was a chrome and red crest emblem adorned by a Corinthian helmet commonly referred to as the knight s crest a thin hood spear with no vertical hood ornament round headlamps with rounded chrome bezels which appeared on a prototype Chevelle front end proposal which was rejected for the four headlight design circular parking lamps inset into the front bumper directly below the headlamps and taillights with chrome trim around the perimeter of the lens only br The standard powertrain was the cu in L Chevrolet Turbo Fire small block V with a two barrel carburetor rated at hp kW PS gross at rpm and lb ft N m of torque at rpm mated to a column mounted speed Synchro Mesh manual transmission Front disc brakes were standard equipment The dashboard was identical to the Chevelle except for simulated wood veneer trim according to Holls a photographic reproduction of the elm trim used by Rolls Royce and higher grade nylon or vinyl upholstery and deep twist carpeting were used Base priced at US the Monte Carlo cost more than a comparable Chevelle Malibu yet lower than a Chevrolet Caprice Sport Coupe br br Various options were available A two speed Powerglide automatic transmission on cu in L engines only three speed Turbo Hydramatic or a four speed manual most Monte Carlos were built with the Turbo Hydramatic Variable ratio power steering power windows air conditioning power seats rally wheels bucket seats center console full instrumentation rear wheel fender skirts and other accessories were also available bringing the price of a fully equipped Monte Carlo to more than br Optional engines included the four barrel carbureted Turbo Fire cu in L small block V rated at hp kW PS at rpm and lb ft N m at rpm the Turbo Fire cu in L with a two barrel carburetor rated at hp kW PS at rpm and lb ft N m at rpm and the Turbo Jet cu in L with a four barrel carburetor rated at hp kW PS at rpm and lb ft N m at rpm br The sporty and most powerful option was the Monte Carlo SS package Priced at it included a standard Turbo Jet cu in L with a four barrel carburetor rated at hp kW PS at rpm It also included heavy duty suspension wider wheels and tires SS badging and an automatic load leveling rear suspension The Turbo Hydra Matic three speed automatic was the only transmission available for this package The rear axle came standard with a ratio with and available for extra Total SS s production was for the year br A labor strike at Chevrolet s Flint Michigan assembly plant where most Monte Carlo production was scheduled during the early months of the model year immediately following the car s introduction on September limited overall model year sales to short of the projected During those early months Monte Carlos were in short supply with full production not achieved until February br Popular Mechanics reported that of readers who bought a Monte Carlo got one for the styling However of readers disliked the amount of rear legroom br br The model saw minor styling changes mostly cosmetic The headlamp bezels were more of a squircle shape with rectangular front parking lamps The grille had no horizontal divider and the openings were rectangular The hood spear included a stand up ornament with Chevrolet script lettering The grill emblem featured the year in Roman numerals The trunk lock keyhole had the Monte Carlo crest surrounding it The taillights now had two horizontal and one vertical chrome strip The SS model featured new European symbol control knobs and a four spoke steering wheel became optional AM FM stereo radios with track tape players were also optional Mechanically it was largely unchanged although the small block Turbo Fire two barrel engine was dropped Other engines had compression ratios lowered to allow the use of regular leaded low lead or unleaded gasoline per a GM corporate edict Engine ratings fell to hp kW PS for the base Turbo Fire cu in L two barrel hp kW PS for the Turbo Fire V and hp kW PS for the Turbo Jet The SS engine was raised to a nominal hp kW PS rating despite the reduction in compression ratio This increase in horsepower resulted from the engine using the more aggressive camshaft compared to the previous hp kW PS rating in the Chevrolet Corvette and full sized sedans br Chevrolet listed both gross and SAE net horsepower figures in with the impending change to SAE net ratings in The ratings compared as follows br br After this year the SS package would be discontinued after the production of units but the CID V engine would remain optional in Monte Carlos through The reason for discontinuing the SS was that the Monte Carlo was marketed as a luxury vehicle instead of a muscle car br The Monte Carlo was considered the best suited Chevrolet model for stock car racing by most NASCAR teams due to its in mm wheelbase only one inch above NASCAR s minimum requirements at that time the Chevelle two door body style had a shorter inch wheelbase and long hood design which placed the engine further back in the chassis than most other vehicles for better weight distribution Thus the Monte Carlo became Chevy s standard bearer for NASCAR from until br Production of the Monte Carlo started slowly due to a day corporate wide walkout labor strike that coincided with the introduction of the models in September This left dealerships with only a small shipment of models built before the strike in stock until the strike was settled in mid November and then slow going in reaching normal production levels until around January Model year production ended at including SS models br A total of twelve Monte Carlos were shipped to Australia in and converted to RH drive four of these were SS models from the produced br br A Cadillac like egg crate grille similar to the Chevrolet Caprice rectangular front parking lamps moved to the left and right edges of the grille a wider hood spear without stand up ornament and a metal rear trim molding highlighted the changes to the Monte Carlo the final year for the first generation design The SS was dropped but a new Monte Carlo Custom option appeared as a one year only offering that included a unique suspension and other items previously included with the SS option Unlike the departed SS package it was available with any engine on the roster The Monte Carlo Custom badging was similar to the Impala Custom br The engines were essentially unchanged but an industry wide switch to SAE net hp numbers reduced the rated power of all Chevrolet engines Chevrolet did not list gross horsepower figures for Compared to the model year output only the and had a decrease in power The new ratings for the Monte Carlo were br br In California which had emissions standards more stringent than federal law the barrel carbureted was the standard and only available engine Also the only transmission offered in California was the Turbo Hydramatic br br For the four speed manual transmission was discontinued from the option list as a line in the Monte Carlo brochure describing its market position as a personal luxury car stated Sorry no four on the floor The standard three speed manual and optional two speed Powerglide automatic transmissions were offered only with the base CID two barrel engine with the three speed Turbo Hydramatic also available with this engine and a mandatory option with each of the optional engines br Mechanically the most significant change was that variable ratio power steering became standard equipment for the first time br Interior trim was relatively unchanged from other than the availability of all vinyl upholstery with the standard bench seat and the optional Strato bucket seats Cloth interiors were available with the bench or bucket seats The model year s production increased to to set a new record in the final year for the first generation A body Monte Carlo and other Chevrolet models were promoted as part of a new ad campaign The cars in print and broadcast ads were pictured at domestic tourist attractions and sites with the tagline Chevrolet Building a Better Way To See The USA br br A redesigned Monte Carlo was introduced alongside other GM intermediates Like other GM mid size cars the Monte Carlo was no longer a hardtop but a pillared Colonnade coupe with rear side opera windows and frameless door glass Prominent styling included an egg crate grille a Monte Carlo emblem and vertical taillights above the bumper The front bumper was a large federally mandated mph km h bumper that was among the required federal safety standards for all passenger cars sold in the U S with the mph km h requirement extended to rear bumpers on models Also new was a double shell roof for improved noise reduction and rollover protection along with the flush mounted pull up exterior door handles first introduced on the Camaro and full sized Chevrolets and Vegas br br The separate body on frame construction carried over for along with the basic all coil suspension The standard Monte Carlo with manual transmission retained traditional steering and bias ply tires but the radial tuned system was included when the automatic transmission was ordered earning the Monte Carlo S label Optional were radial ply tires Pliacell shock absorbers internal plastic membranes that separate the hydraulic fluid from the gas high caster steering and front and rear anti roll bars previously offered only with the SS package br A new model for was the Monte Carlo Landau an S with a rear quarter Landau vinyl roof Turbine II wheels and driver and passenger side sports mirrors The interior of the Monte Carlo featured an all new wraparound cockpit style instrument panel similar to that found in some contemporary Pontiacs Oldsmobiles and Buicks in which gauges and various instruments were centered within easy reach of the driver The simulated burl elm trim was retained A split bench seat was standard but Strato Bucket seats of a new design were optional along with a floor console featuring an equally new shifter with knob and button similar to Pontiac s Rally Sports Shifter replacing the Buick like horseshoe shifter of previous years and storage compartment The bucket seats were of a one piece high back design with built in headrests and could swivel almost degrees to permit the driver and front passenger easier entry and exit a feature previously offered on the Chrysler H Cloth and vinyl trims were offered for bench and bucket seats br The standard engine was a hp kW cu in L Turbo Fire V Optional engines included a hp kW cu in L with a four barrel carburetor and a four barrel carbureted cu in L Turbo Jet V rated at hp kW br The Monte Carlo was named Car of the Year by Motor Trend based on its new styling and emphasis on Euro style ride and handling The Monte Carlo set a new sales record for Chevrolet with nearly sold for the model year The success of the Monte Carlo and Pontiac s similar Grand Prix led to several new personal luxury cars from competitors including a revised Mercury Cougar the Ford Gran Torino Elite the Chrysler Cordoba and restyled Dodge Charger as well as high line versions of the AMC Matador that introduced a new coupe design for br br The Monte Carlo received minor detail changes from its predecessor most notably a revised egg crate grille in the front flush mount taillights no longer recessed with horizontal chrome bars a shorter trunk deck that housed the relocated license plate and the trunk lock mechanism In the trunk lock was below the trunk deck and above the rear bumper in a space that no longer existed in the versions A larger mph km h rear bumper was added The driver and passenger door map pockets were no longer available br The base Monte Carlo with a manual transmission standard suspension and bias ply tires was discontinued leaving only the S and Landau models equipped with radial ply tires upgraded suspensions and standard power steering and front disc brakes br A three speed manual transmission was listed as standard equipment on S and Landau models equipped with the standard cu in L and an automatic transmission was a required option with the larger and CID V s However some sources indicate that Chevrolet built almost all Monte Carlos with the Turbo Hydra Matic transmission br The standard cu in L Turbo Fire V was again rated at hp kW with a two barrel carburetor in states For Californians the standard engine was a Turbo Fire V with a four barrel carburetor rated at hp kW that was not offered in the other states Reappearing on the options list for the first time since was a cu in L Turbo Fire small block V rated at hp kW with a two barrel carburetor not offered in California or hp kW with a four barrel carburetor The top engine was again the cu in L Turbo Jet big block V rated at hp kW br Despite the Arab Oil Embargo of late and early that significantly cut into sales of standard and intermediate sized cars in favor of smaller compacts and imported subcompacts the Monte Carlo went the other way on the sales charts by setting a new sales record this year of over units despite the long lines at gas stations and record high gasoline prices The Monte Carlo continued to lead in intermediate personal luxury car sales with the Grand Prix placing second and the arrival of new competitors this year including an upsized Mercury Cougar Ford Gran Torino Elite and AMC s Matador coupe Chrysler would introduce its entries in this field for including the Chrysler Cordoba and redesigned Dodge Charger br Interior Dimensions br br The Monte Carlo received only minor styling changes from the model including a new grille with the Monte Carlo emblem moved to the center section and new vertically shaped taillights with horizontal louvers All models received catalytic converters to meet Federal and California emission requirements including bonuses such as improved fuel economy and drivability extended spark plug and muffler life but required lower octane unleaded gasoline br Engines were a carryover from except for the addition of GM s High Energy electronic ignition which was made standard equipment Power ratings for all engines were decreased due to the addition of the catalytic converter The cu in L V was no longer offered on California cars leaving the cu in L four barrel the top engine in that market The base cu in L two barrel was rated at hp kW standard in states the CID barrel was rated at hp kW available only in California the CID barrel hp kW and the CID barrel hp kW now equipped with
