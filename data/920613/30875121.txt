The Nissan Silvia Japanese Hepburn Nissan Shirubia is the series of small sports cars produced by Nissan Versions of the Silvia have been marketed as the SX or SX for export with some export versions being sold under the Datsun brand br The name Silvia is derived from Sylvia the name of the nymph who served Diana the Roman goddess of the hunt The name also means forest in Latin br br br CSP br br In Albrecht Graf von Goertz was working as a consultant for BMW having created the BMW and saw the potential of Japanese manufacturers Yamaha had created the Technical Research Institute to develop their own sports car in and had built the YX sports car As Yamaha had a working relationship with Nissan work began on project A X but at some point the project fell apart and work was cancelled Kazuo Kimura and Fumio Yoshida were both working on Project A X and when the professional relationship between Nissan and Goertz ended in the work on the project contributed to the Silvia br The Nissan Silvia CSP made its public debut at the Tokyo Motor Show in September as the Datsun Coup The introductory model was a hand built coup based on the Fairlady platform The CSP was powered by the PS kW L Nissan R series engine The engine was equipped with twin SU carburetors Due to being nearly entirely hand made only were produced mainly in before production stopped in Most of the vehicles remained in Japan however examples were exported to Australia and another went to other countries were also developed with a LHD interior for export to Europe where they were displayed at events and shows br In December Nissan provided the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department with CSP Silvias for highway patrol use These were modified from the production model to include standard police lights sirens police radio overbumpers as well as upgraded suspension to better cope with high speed patrol however the engine remained standard The CSP patrol car was the first Japanese high performance patrol car chosen due to being the fastest production car in Japan at the time with a top speed of km h mph and due to its disc brakes giving it good stopping power br There was a convertible prototype CSP developed however it was never produced br br br S br br The S was the first mass produced Silvia built on the all new S platform intended as Nissan s compact rear wheel drive sporty car platform Japanese versions were exclusive to Nissan Japanese dealerships called Nissan Prince Store along with the larger C Skyline The S featured less traditional lines than similar offerings from rivals Toyota and Mazda sharing a common appearance with the larger Skyline Initially the S was intended to be powered by a rotary engine however this idea was scrapped due to the oil crises of the s The S was based on the Datsun Sunny Coupe br br br Japan br In Japan the S officially named New Silvia was initially fitted with a L L S straight four engine which it shared with the Datsun Bluebird B The Japanese version featured Nissan NAPS emission control technology at its introduction In the S received its first upgrade which included a new trim level Type LSE which got a new L E engine which had an electronic fuel injection intake instead of the carburetor This upgrade also included a change to the model name from S to S In the S received upgrades including interior upgrades a body colored front grille new wheels new hubcaps new rubber bumper corners a new trim level Type G and more optional parts and colors br br br North America br The S was exported in to the North American market as the Datsun SX incorporating the larger displacement L L B This model in North America was affixed with the mandated mph km h bumpers a new fascia and a LHD interior The Datsun SX was initially sold with an MSRP of US equivalent to US today making it a relatively cheap car for the time There are official photos of a trim level called the Datsun SX E which had window louvers stripes and a bodykit however it appears to have never been produced br Its success in both markets was limited most buyers opting for the Celica over what was considered the more mundane S Chassis The car had a drivetrain similar to the popular but with leaf springs fitted at the rear rather than the s independent suspension During the year lifespan of the S over units were produced until production stopped in br Even though the standard car had poor handling Paul Newman built and raced a Datsun SX in the IMSA Class C where it won out of races br br br S br br This iteration of the Silvia sold in United States and Canada as the Datsun SX and in Mexico as the Datsun Sakura Japanese for cherry blossom available as a door hardtop coupe and a new bodystyle door hatchback The Japanese market version of the hatchback was called the Gazelle and was exclusive to Nissan Store locations sold alongside the Fairlady Z while the coupe body style Silvia remained exclusive to Nissan Prince Store locations alongside the Skyline Its sharp edged styling was shared with the new Nissan Leopard sedan and coup also exclusive to Nissan Store br Like the previous generation the S Silvia was uniquely progressive in that it was originally intended to feature a rotary engine designed and built by Nissan The resulting unit was fairly unreliable and forestalled production Coincidentally this Silvia shares its chassis code with the Mazda Cosmo the first Japanese production car to feature a rotary engine The chassis was shared with the B Nissan Sunny and the larger A Nissan Violet platform br The car was redesigned shortly before it was released and the stillborn Wankel power plant was replaced by a line of twin plug conventional piston engines from the new Z series range These included the Z and the turbocharged and later the fuel injected Z ET although the latter of the two was only available to the Japanese domestic market and after the mid life facelift This took place in late May and included new bumpers and a reworked front design Albeit a sporting design the PS kW Turbo model received largely the same chassis as regular models and did not have any kind of turbocharger boost indicator At the time of the facelift the DOHC FJ engined RS model was also introduced br br br Gazelle br Nissan rebadged the Silvia as the Gazelle coup and hatchback so that Nissan s different dealership networks in Japan could all carry their own variants of the model There are minor cosmetic differences between the two cars such as grille pattern and taillight lenses Gazelle was treated as a more exclusive model while the Silvia was the base and sporty models br br br North America br The Silvia continued to be sold as the SX in North America with either the two door coup or the three door liftback bodywork It was originally powered by the L inline four L B engine although in California market cars received the twin plug Z NAPS Z inline four of the same displacement From the model year this became the only engine available to the SX Power is hp kW PS channeled through a five speed manual or a three speed automatic and coupled with the H rear axle For the SX was facelifted and gained the liter Z E engine coupled with the sturdier H rear axle This model produces hp kW SAE at rpm There were no significant changes for and these were sold well into the model year as the S did not appear until February br The top model was the luxurious SL which received a remote opening hood trunk and gas tank lid more adjustable seats and a removable glass skyroof The hatchback model received sportier trim while the notchback coup focused more on luxury br br br RS br br This generation saw the introduction of the Nissan RS BS a coupe fitted with the liter DOHC FJ engine About road going examples were built between and for homologation purposes its production extending the end of the S itself The resulting machine became Nissan s official rally car in the World Rally Championship from to with its best result a second place finish in the New Zealand Rally br br br Chief Kogure s Gazelle br As part of their sponsorship of the series Nissan provided several of their vehicles for the production of the police drama Seibu Keisatsu including a one off S Gazelle convertible driven by Chief Kogure br br br S br br The S was produced from August to with revisions to the exterior trim in referred to as Mark II It used retractable pop up headlights and was sold in two configurations a coup often called a notchback due to the side profile view of its rear window section and a hatchback version which bore heavy resemblance to the liftback versions of the Toyota Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno AE br A number of different engines were equipped in the S chassis depending on geographic market br and production year also a change in available engines again with the Mk revision The NAPS system was carried over on the CA E which replaced the Z engines of the S in North America A CA ET l turbo engine with ECCS was added for SE trims Certain US trims had the S equipped with an optional VG E V engine also shared by the ZX Z The FJ was replaced with the CA DET in the Mk revision in markets where it was offered br br br Japan br br As with the S the S chassis in Japan was badged as both a Silvia and a Gazelle The S Silvia in Japan was available in a hatchback as a basic model only or as a coup notchback in base RS and RS X trims and exclusive to Nissan Prince Store Japanese dealerships as a junior companion to the Nissan Skyline The S Gazelle was strictly a hatchback available in regular RS and RS X variants and exclusive to Nissan Store locations as a junior companion to the Fairlady ZX The RS was equipped with the litre DOHC FJ engine FJ E while the RS X was equipped with a turbocharged version of the same engine FJ ET In Nissan discontinued the FJ Series engine in the S and replaced it with the CA DET Also with dual cams but a bigger turbocharger the CA DET Japanese spec Gazelle models came with many options like voice command fog lights and a variety of different engine options FJ E FJ ET CA DE CA E CA DET The RS X model also came with different factory alloy wheels When the S Silvia was introduced in in Japan the Gazelle nameplate was replaced with the Nissan SX as a junior companion to the ZX In Australia there would not be a replacement until the introduction of the Silvia based Nissan SX in br br br North America br br The S series was badged as a Nissan SX in North America It was introduced in February four months behind the rest of Nissan s models For fear that the North American market would not be as profitable as other markets throughout Nissan executives only scheduled the manufacturing of of each trim package engine options in the final two years before the halt of production for the United States which was in br The S XE notchback coup was only available with a litre SOHC non turbo engine and made available with either a speed manual or speed automatic gearbox CA E The hatchback received both the L SOHC engine and a L SOHC Turbo non intercooled engine CA ET For in the United States Nissan discontinued the Turbo model and created the SE model which had a L SOHC VG E V engine generating hp kW and lbf ft N m of torque This was similar to the engine offered in the non turbo Z ZX for that generation This model received the RVS model code For the SE model received a hp kW gain from using the later W series revisions of the VG E with a total output of hp kW while torque remained the same at lbf ft N m br br br Europe br br The S chassis in Europe was badged as a Silvia with a notable exception of Sweden where it was sold as the ZX ZX is traditionally associated with the Nissan Z cars the name change was done to avoid giving the car the same name as the Queen of Sweden The ZX name was also used because Nissan s Swedish importer decided to stop carrying the Z ZX when the naturally aspirated version was discontinued for Europe the Silvia acted as a partial replacement for the Z car in that region br The European S was available only in the hatchback configuration few were equipped with a rally package that included a rally foot brace for the navigator headlamp guards headlamp dust cleaners with the same L SOHC Turbo CA ET used in North America and in some areas the L DOHC FJ engine FJ E These models equipped with the rally package were dubbed Rally Spec The FJ engine series was originally designed for the DR Nissan Skyline chassis in both turbocharged and naturally aspirated versions The CA ET was also available catalyzed producing PS kW br br br Australia br br The S chassis in Australia released in October was badged as a Gazelle The Australian Gazelle was available in both hatchback and coup variants It was equipped with the same litre SOHC CA E engine found in North America producing kW hp at rpm and N m lb ft of torque at rpm This engine was mated to either a five speed manual gearbox or a four speed automatic br Trim levels comprised the GL hatchback basic and the luxury oriented SGL coup br According to the May brochure the coup added alloy wheels mudflaps electric windows mirrors antenna a six speaker sound system over four time delay interior lighting variable intermittent wipers an armrest carpet kickpads and cloth headlining sunvisors door trims over vinyl An option pack for the coup added air conditioning power steering and power sunroof The hatchback s option pack added air conditioning power steering and power sunroof br By the time of the August brochure the coup s option pack had been deleted but the standard SGL coup added power steering and a manual sunroof a power sunroof was no longer offered Air conditioning remained as an option while power steering was added to the hatchback s option pack The alloy wheel design was also changed br The facelifted Mark II models were released to Australia in circa br br br Revisions br br The S chassis in is referred to as Mark I with Mark II as a revision in Below lists the description of both br br br Mark I br br The first trim of the S chassis Bumpers featured matte finish raised surfaces and sides featured half inch rubstripping Cars featured a honeycomb radiator grille and long corner lights The RS X trim in Japan and Europe received a hood bulge accent to accommodate the oversized dimensions of the FJ E ET engine and featured a faux front vent with monogram either FJ DOHC or TURBO In North America the Turbo came with a TURBO monogrammed hood bulge accent although all subsequent North American Mark I hoods were flat regardless of trim In some markets the and could be had with a foam rubber deck spoiler In the foam rubber deck spoiler was changed for a fiberglass version with an integrated third brake light Some hatchbacks and all Turbo models came with ground effects as did the RS X coup s These had a combination of plastic mudflaps monogrammed as either NISSAN or SILVIA in applicable markets and accommodating foam rubber sideskirts as well as a foam rubber lower deflection lip year foam rubber sideskirts featured the NISSAN monogram br br br Mark II br br In the bumpers were updated and the matte finished surfaces were eliminated for a more uniform surface Rubstripping was increased to inch height w scribe detailing The honeycomb radiator grille was replaced with a slatted version that spanned the entire front end previous was shorter and cornerlights were shortened The SE model and the Turbo Canada Europe came with new fiberglass ground effects and mudflaps painted in the color of the car and a new and more pronounced lower deflection lip in the front All Mark II S s received a new reverse cowl hood bulge design to accommodate clearance for the new litre V Optional rear mudflap accents were available br br br Drivetrain rear wheel drive br br br Engine br br br Special Editions br br In Europe a limited run units version of the S was produced and sold as the Silvia Grand Prix model Based on a Mark I chassis it was powered by the FJ E with a few known to be sold with the CA DET and featured molded in fiberglass wide body fenders and quarter sections and special edition wheels br The exterior takes design cues from popular European rally cars of the time although Nissan s choice of the FJ E over the FJ ET suggests this was more of a rally inspired car rather than a serious performance trim The Silvia Grand Prix holds the distinction as one of the rarest incarnations of the S along with the CA DET engined RS X in Japan br In Japan a special anniversary model was produced and sold as the th Anniversary Version with the CA DET Between and units were sold It came with a white and gold two tone decals and interior gold wheels an electronic instrument cluster and navigation system a voice warning system gold badges and gold keys br br br Motorsports br br The elimination of Group B from the World Rally Championship signified the end of Nissan s FJ powered RS The FJ ET powered Silvia RS X of would have been Nissan s first choice however there was an insufficient number of that exact trim sold in Japan to meet the WRC s Homologation requirements minimum units Therefore Nissan had to quickly find a car to replace the RS br The North American SX SE V was chosen and competed in as a SX Nissan s creation and choice of this car ensured they could sell cars required for WRC Homologation The S SE trim s V held the only real appeal to the North American market allowing Nissan to sell right at cars to a single specification The V was a very unusual choice as the WRC was dominated by cylinder L turbocharged engines although for similar reasons Toyota entered WRC with the cylinder Supra at the same time The SX achieved a first place in the Ivory Coast Rally and second place for two years running in the very challenging Safari Rally and Safari Rally br Mark Skaife won the Australian Litre Touring Car Championship driving a Nissan Gazelle entered by the Nissan Motor Company br br br Motorsports in Japan br br The Silvia S competed in the JSS Japan Supersports Series throughout the s when many of the top tuners got their start They featured x J wheels under the Fisco wide body kit The JSS S s made between PS to PS from the FJ ET and CA DET from The HKS World Trade Silvia sponsored and engineered by tuners HKS and Tomei ran in this series br br br S br br The S Silvia was introduced in mid Upon its introduction it became immensely popular in Japan and won the Car of the Year Japan Award The Silvia was no longer exported however rebadged SXs were instead sold in most markets European versions of this car were still known as the SX while in North America the S with the SX front in all three different body styles was known as the SX The SX nameplate was on hiatus in that region but would return on a door coup version of the B Nissan Sunny Sentra itself based on the Japan only door Nissan Lucino Following industry trends the S Silvia switched to relampable fixed headlights Projector optics were offered as an option br br In Japan Nissan renamed the Gazelle as the Nissan SX which was exported to North America primarily under the name Nissan SX The SX served as the junior companion to the Fairlady ZX at Nissan Bluebird Store Japanese dealerships As before the Silvia was exclusive to Japanese dealerships called Nissan Prince Store next to the Skyline br The S Silvia coup was made from to overlapping with the S Silvia introduced in The Nissan Silvia used fixed headlights whereas the SX simply a hatchback version of the Silvia introduced at the same time used pop up headlights The hatchback version called the SX replaced the Gazelle name in Japan and remained in production until br The S was one of the first uses of Nissan s multi link rear suspension the technology of which was previewed in concept cars in previous years such as the Nissan MID It also offered a four wheel steering system for the first time known as HICAS II In HICAS II was updated and renamed as Super HICAS The S also saw the introduction of a viscous type limited slip differential for some models br S Silvias were initially powered by the CA DE and CA DET engines carried over from the end of S production with an intercooler added to the CA DET for a slight increase in stability and power The naturally aspirated engine was offered in the J s and Q s model while the turbocharged engine came in the K s In mid for the model year the SR DE and SR DET engines debuted offering improvements across the board in power and torque due to increased displacement and a more efficient turbocharger than was offered on the previous cars One of the other simple changes that were made between the CA generation and the SR generation was the switch to a single colour paint job instead of the two tone colour sets that were previously offered with only a few two tone colour options available On top of this the SR motor later debuted another variant of the platform known simply as the blacktop Identifiable by its black and silver rocker cover as opposed to the traditional red silver cover it featured a number of minor changes which resulted in little performance gains It is vastly different from the more powerful notch top used in the S and S variants br In the U S the S was replaced after the model year by the new S design It lived on until in Japan with a major facelift the SX Aero Type X Type S Type R This is known as the Kouki generation while the previous or middle generation was referred to as Chuki Sold alongside the then current S models these Kouki models featured newly designed tail lights and a redesigned aero body kit along with being outfitted with an airbag br br In the S Silvia was resurrected in part by a variant produced by Japanese tuning company Kid s Heart for Nissan called the Sileighty which featured the SX hatchback body with the front end of the Silvia About units of the Sileighty made by Kid s Heart were produced The Sileighty was originally created by Japanese enthusiasts for their own SXs and is currently a common modification for both the SX and SX fastback A Sileighty appears in the Japanese manga and anime series Initial D based around the Japanese motorsports of touge and drifting where it was featured in one of the first battles in the manga as well as in one of the last battles in First Stage a nickname for the first season of the anime br The creation of the Sileighty was then followed by another version of the Silvia known as the Onevia Based on the chassis of the S the front end of the Silvia would be removed and replaced with the front end of a SX The Onevia was never retailed as a complete car in Japan though it was in North America the coup version of the SX used the same body shell as the Silvia but with the SX SX nose br The Mitsuoka Le Seyde was a retro styled car built in a very limited series in the early s based on the S Silvia It uses the S Silvia s centre portion engine and underpinnings br br br Convertible br br A Silvia convertible was briefly offered soon after the start of production and sold in limited numbers Demand was low at the time due to high cost million Yen in heavier curb weight and chassis flex The Silvia convertibles were a conversion done by Autech Japan Inc and the production was entrusted to Takada Kogyo with a manufacture date of July A total of Autech convertibles were produced in the following colour codes TH velvet blue G green two tone lime H warm two tone white AH cranberry red and DH dark green The other three were made to order for Nissan and the colours are unknown They came equipped with K s trim grade which included the turbocharged CA DET engine All of the publicly available cars were sold with a speed automatic transmission br It was unrelated to the SX convertible offered in North America in which was a local conversion done by ASC br br br Trim level designations br br The S Silvia was the first S series car to use the J s Q s and K s designations for the different trim packages These names are references to the face cards of English playing cards br The J s was the base model The Q s model offered a slightly more refined experience and received electric options and an available LSD The K s grade received the turbocharged CA DET or SR DET depending on the year of manufacture in addition to the options offered on the Q s br On top of the K s and Q s models the Club and Diamond Selection packages came with specific options bundled together For example all K s Club Selections came with projector headlamps a rear spoiler and aluminum wheels while all Q s models came out with automatic climate control br Late in the S Silvia s production a new base model trim known as the A s Almighty or Ace trim was introduced in late to replace the previous J s base model trim and according to some sources had a limited manufacturing run of fewer than Trim wise the Almighty offered options not available on the J s such as the alloy wheels but also not including all the standard features of the Q s power windows and sunroof The only available powertrain was the naturally aspirated SR DE with a five speed manual transmission the same as on the Q s br There were a number of different headlight options over the years including triple projectors dual projectors and square projectors usually referred to as bricks br br br Engine br br br S br br The S Silvia debuted in Japan towards the end of It was lower and wider than the S New rounded styling contributed to the illusion of a greater increase in size than actually occurred Wheelbase and track were both increased leading to slightly improved handling Unlike export markets where sales of the S chassis variants faltered the Silvia remained popular in Japan However the width dimension exceeded mm in which pushed this generation out of the compact class tax bracket and made Japanese buyers liable for higher road taxes Sales of the S also faltered because specialty car buyers at the time were moving to RVs and SUVs The fastback and convertible bodystyles were discontinued internationally leaving only the coup in production br Trim level designations were similar to the S however the Club Selection package was dropped Aero variants of the Q s and K s were offered that featured large rear wings and mild ground effects br The S Silvia K s received a new version of the SR DET with a slight bump in power due to the implementation of Nissan s variable cam timing system known as N VCT on the intake cam and a larger T turbocharger The engine now produced PS kW hp at rpm and N m lb ft of torque at rpm br br There was a mild styling update to the S during which added aggressive looking projector headlamps and tinted taillights to all models The older version is known as the zenki literally prior period Fascias and other exterior trim pieces were also revised The turbocharger now used a more efficient ball bearing center section This updated version is also known as the kouki literally later period S or by enthusiasts as the S A It was sold as the second generation SX in North America from to equipped with the non turbo KA DE engine The final model year of S production in all markets was called the Touring Model which had a better engine block pistons and better acceleration in lower gears br br br Nismo R br br The R is a limited edition version of the S developed by Nissan Motorsports produced only in The vehicle was built on the S chassis but had many enhancements over the Silvia The is in reference to the horsepower of the car as opposed to the displacement of the engine The R featured a vented hood with a front mounted intercooler Nismo Edge Aero kit heavy duty clutch way limited slip differential NISMO logo front and rear seats among other upgrades All the s were painted Black with Nismo R badging above the rear wheels and a product numbered plaque in the glove compartment Only Rs were built br br br Autech Version K s MF T br br Tuning company Autech built a tuned adaption of the CS King s variant It includes an Aero style HUD with white displays and gauges for oil pressure boost and voltage in the centre console along with a MOMO steering wheel and leather gear knob The interior trim is also revised br br Its powered by an Autech tuned SR DET that produces kW hp PS An IHI ball bearing turbo VN was fitted in favour of the Garrett T for slightly quicker response and flow Larger cc injectors found in the later S Spec R s were also fitted as well as a thicker mm intercooler also found in S s To help expel exhaust a higher flowing Fujitsubo Giken FGK exhaust was fitted Handling improvements include multi link suspension firmer shocks and springs front strut brace and a rear sway bar A large F style rear spoiler and aero bodykit with Autech indicators are also fitted An Autech Version K s MF T badge and sticker can be found on the boot br br br S br br In Japan saw a new version of the Silvia the S now producing PS bhp kW at rpm and N m lbf ft kg m of torque at rpm from its SR DET inline four engine thanks to a ball bearing turbocharger upgrade as well as an improved engine management system The non turbo SR DE produces PS bhp kW br The S Silvia included aggressive styling inside and out updating the previous Silvia styling in line with modern car design trends The body dimensions were reduced from the previous generation so that it would comply with Japanese Government compact class which had an effect on sales of the previous model br The S Silvia model lineup was initially simplified to just Spec S and Spec R with both models offering an Aero variant with a large rear wing side skirts valances and front bumper br This generation of the Silvia was only sold new in Japan Australia and New Zealand In Australia and New Zealand the car was sold as the Nissan SX br Production of the Silvia ended amidst Nissan s efforts to reduce its myriad of platforms Nissan stopped producing the S platform in August with the S series Nissan Silvia being the final variant The S Silvia was therefore the last car to use the Silvia name as well as being the last sports car by Nissan to use a true FR layout Nissan s current worldwide sports car platform is the front midship FM platform which underpins the Z Fairlady Z the Z outside Japan sports car and the V Nissan Skyline the Infiniti G in North America luxury sport sedan and coup br br br Variants br br br Spec R br br The Spec R was fitted with a turbocharged SR DET engine and differed from previous Silvia models by featuring a speed manual gearbox as well as a speed automatic transmission The Spec R also included extensive chassis and suspension strengthening via the use of larger anti roll bars and strut bracing The S featured the same piston front brake calipers that were found in the Z ZX but included a larger brake booster br One of the biggest changes to the S model of the Silvia fitted with the speed manual transmission built by Aisin Seiki was the implementation of a helical limited slip differential The result was a safer more track suited drive in some contrast to its drifting heritage and subsequent media attention All other versions of the Silvia S S Spec S JDM came with the viscous limited slip differential br HICAS High Capacity Active Steering four wheel steering was available as an option br br br Spec S br The Spec S was fitted with a naturally aspirated SR DE engine and featured a speed manual transmission in addition to a speed automatic available on both the Spec S and the Spec R It lacked the additional chassis support of the Spec R featured piston front brake calipers and a slightly smaller brake booster The Spec S came only with an open differential with an optional LSD Australian delivered Spec S models featured the same helical differential chassis bracing and speed manual transmission as the Australian market Spec R models br The S line was later expanded to include various luxury and upgrade option packages for both the Spec S and Spec R Autech a specialty car developer also offered several tuned versions of the S one with body and interior trim modeled after the Ferrari called the style A available in both Spec S and Spec R based trims and a second tuned version was based on the Spec S trim level with the engine output increased to hp kW through the use of increased compression more aggressive camshafts and free breathing intake and exhaust tracts along with ECU tuning and upgrades to the chassis and suspension This version also included the speed transmission and other upgrades normally found only in the Spec R br br br Silvia Varietta br br In Japan Nissan offered a retractable hardtop variant of the Silvia called the Varietta The Varietta was built by Autech and was based on the Spec S model featuring the same naturally aspirated engine with a choice of the speed manual transmission or the speed automatic transmission Only cars were produced br br br New Le Seyde br Mitsuoka produced an updated version of their Mitsuoka Le Seyde also known as the New Le Seyde based on the S Silvia built in limited quantities in As with the original Le Seyde it used the S Silvia s centre portion engine and underpinnings br br br Australian and New Zealand versions br The Australian and New Zealand versions of the Silvia S were sold as the Nissan SX with the two regions having differences between each other These models were never officially sold with the option of a naturally aspirated SR DE in those regions especially with the Australian spec Spec S model br br br New Zealand version br The New Zealand market received the S Silvia in May These were official models from Nissan unlike with the Australian S Silvia that came out a year later They came offered with the SR DET engine The New Zealand S s were Japan spec from the factory and modified by New Zealand vehicle dealerships to meet New Zealand road requirements These modifications included an antenna on the rear right quarter panel an optional spoke spoiler New Zealand spec brochures and SX badges which are located on the rear bumper instead of the boot lid To comply with New Zealand s road regulations the New Zealand S s had a JN VIN on a metal plaque placed over the JDM VIN on the firewall br In total SXs were sold in New Zealand from July to August which included S models This does not include the few S s from May to July as they weren t included in the official Nissan databases The reasons for these exclusions are unknown br br br Australian version br The Australian market received the S Silvia in October Unlike with the New Zealand spec S Silvia that came about a year prior these were not official models from Nissan and was built to different specs from the factory featuring a unique digit VIN instead of the Japanese S XXXXXX one It was offered in the Spec R and Spec S trims all with the SR DET engine The main difference between the two was that the Spec R was offered from the factory with a sunroof The engine was de tuned to meet Australian fuel regulations power outputs decreased from bhp to bhp The car also received various other changes from Japanese models to lower costs some of which being the removal of the rear window wiper sun visor mirrors A pillar boost gauge auto climate control and electric folding mirrors The steering wheel was changed to the one found in the R Nissan Skyline GT Turbo GT T however the Australian market did receive a km h speedometer instead of the km h speedometer in the Japanese version br Available at the end of SX production for Australia was the GT edition available on both the Spec S and Spec R This featured the L Package interior and the Aero Wing of the Japanese models All GTs received darker colour wheels and GT badges taken from the Nissan Skyline GT R located on the fenders Additionally chrome interior door handles chrome gear selector surround sports metal pedal sets were standard on the GT br In total Australian SXs were produced making up just over percent of S production br br br Motorsport br br The S chassis is a popular drift car and time attack car especially the S through S vehicles This is due to the extreme versatility and huge aftermarket for the S chassis many professional racing cars have been built with off the shelf suspension and engine components The car has enjoyed success having won D Grand Prix championships with different drivers driving the S Nobuteru Taniguchi Ryuji Miki Yasuyuki Kazama Masato Kawabata Youichi Imamura Masashi Yokoi Masanori Kohashi Naoki Nakamura Odi Bakchis a

overall in Formula Drift for the past years In and Formula Drift driver James Deane campaigned and won the PRO championship in the Worthouse Drift Team S br In Europe the S has also been very popular with pro level drifters especially in countries like the United Kingdom Poland France Germany Sweden Norway Russia and Ukraine While some have opted to keep the SR DET engine most drivers swap this for the more powerful RB DET unit or even the Toyota Supra derived JZ like Pawel Trela from Poland br Silvias were raced successfully in the All Japan GT Championship now Super GT and its predecessors The S and S generations of the Silvia won the GT class championship in and respectively In the late eighties when Group B was banned S and S Silvias also saw limited success in rallying mainly on endurance rallies During the S s production there was a one make series in Japan The S s were also successful in racing in the IMSA GTU class during the s br The Silvia S of Under Suzuki has dominated
