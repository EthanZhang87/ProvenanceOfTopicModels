an extended passage of bizarre laughter several dazzling flights of digital fancy a succession of striking images and Jim Carrey s voicing of Scrooge plus half a dozen other roles The Daily Telegraph reviewer Tim Robey wrote How much is gained by the half real visual style for this story is open to question the early scenes are laborious and never quite alive and the explosion of jollity at the end lacks the virtue of being funny Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian also criticized the technology The hi tech sheen is impressive but in an unexciting way I wanted to see real human faces convey real human emotions Time Out London praised the film for sticking to Dickens original dialogue but also questioned the technology by saying To an extent this Christmas Carol is a case of style and stylisation overwhelming substance br br br Awards and nominations br br br See also br List of Christmas films br List of ghost films br Adaptations of A Christmas Carol br br br br br br External
