and Lafayette losing his hat sidecar umbrella shoes and the basket before escaping The cats are left stranded in the countryside while Madame Adelaide Roquefort the mouse and Frou Frou the horse

On December Walt Disney suggested that Harry Tytle and Tom McGowan find some animal stories to adapt as a two part live action episode for the Wonderful World of Color television program By New Year s McGowan had found several stories including a children s book about a mother cat and her kittens set in New York City However Tytle felt that the London setting had added a significant element to One Hundred and One Dalmatians and suggested setting the story of the cats in Paris Following a rough storyline the story became about two servants a butler and a maid who were in line to inherit a fortune of an eccentric mistress after the pet cats died and focused on their feeble and foolish attempts to eliminate the felines Boris Karloff and Fran oise Rosay were in mind to portray the butler and the distressed Madame A subplot centered around a mother cat hiding her kittens to keep them out of danger in a variety of different homes and locales around Paris During the filming of Escapade in Florence McGowan brought Tytle the story that had been written by Tom Rowe an American writer who was living in Paris br br By August they sent the completed story treatment to Burbank where it was returned as rejected by the Disney studios McGowan upset at the rejection suggested selling the treatment elsewhere but later learned Disney was staying at the Connaught in London McGowan then slipped the treatment into an envelope for Disney to read at the hotel desk Disney contacted McGowan stating he had liked the treatment and would meet with Tytle in Lisbon Portugal On August during their flight back to London Disney told Tytle to purchase the story for a live action theatrical film with McGowan as director Disney also recommended further story revisions one of which was eliminating one of the kitten characters br The script revisions were later made in January and February In June Rowe had written a letter to Disney addressing his displeasure of the script revisions in which Tytle responded to Rowe that the changes Disney approved of would be kept However the project was temporarily shelved and in August Tytle suggested that The Aristocats should be reworked into an animated feature to which Disney agreed At Disney s recommendation Tytle presented the project to Wolfgang Reitherman who was directing The Jungle Book who agreed it would work as an animated film For that reason Disney temporarily shelved the project as the animation department was occupied with The Jungle Book In April story artist Otto Englander was assigned to work on the project In November during a story meeting Disney felt the cats should talk amongst themselves but never in front of the humans in a similar approach as in One Hundred and One Dalmatians Because of the production delays studio producer Bill Anderson advised Tytle to centralize his efforts on live action projects and he was subsequently replaced by Winston Hibler br In Disney assigned Ken Anderson to determine whether The Aristocats would be suitable for an animated feature With occasional guidance from Reitherman Anderson worked from scratch and simplified the two stories into a story that focused more on the cats Disney saw the preliminary sketches and approved the project shortly before his death After The Jungle Book was completed the animation department began work on The Aristocats Reitherman assumed the producing duties and later tossed out the more emotional story of Duchess s obsession to find human adopters befitting of her kittens talents Instead the film would be retooled as an adventure comedy in the vein of One Hundred and One Dalmatians Furthermore the character Elvira the maid who was intended to be voiced by Elsa Lanchester was removed from the story placing Edgar as the central villain in order to better simplify the storyline br br br Casting br As with The Jungle Book the characters were patterned on the personalities of the voice actors In Disney contacted Phil Harris to improvise the script and shortly after he was cast to voice Thomas O Malley To differentiate the character from Baloo Reitherman noted O Malley was more based on Clark Gable than Wallace Beery who was partly the model for Baloo Furthermore Reitherman cast Eva Gabor as Duchess remarking she had the freshest femme voice we ve ever had and Sterling Holloway as Roquefort Louis Armstrong was initially reported to voice Scat Cat but he had to back out of the project due to illness Out of desperation Scatman Crothers was hired to voice the character under the direction to imitate Armstrong Pat Buttram and George Lindsey were cast as the farm dogs which proved to be popular with the filmmakers that another scene was included to have the dogs when Edgar returns to the farm to retrieve his displaced hat and umbrella br br br Animation br Ken Anderson spent eighteen months developing the design of the characters Five of Disney s legendary Nine Old Men worked on it including the Disney crew that had been working years on average Originally O Malley was going to be drawn with stripes to have him resemble a tabby cat but this was dropped after Reitherman remembered the difficulty in animating Shere Khan in The Jungle Book br br br Music br The Aristocats was the last Disney animated feature Robert and Richard Sherman worked on as staff songwriters growing frustrated by the studio s management following Disney s death While employed the Sherman Brothers completed their work on the film but they would not return to Disney until they were asked to compose songs for The Tigger Movie br br The Sherman Brothers composed multiple songs but only the title song and Scales and Arpeggios were included in the film Desiring to capture the essence of France the Sherman Brothers composed the song The Aristocats Disney film producer Bill Anderson suggested Maurice Chevalier should sing the title song Following the suggestion Richard Sherman imitated Chevalier s voice as he performed a demo for the song Chevalier received the demo and was brought out of retirement to sing the song Deleted songs that were intended for the film included Pourquoi sung by Hermione Baddeley as Madame Bonfamille its reprise and She Never Felt Alone sung by Robie Lester as Duchess br For the show stopping musical number the Sherman Brothers composed Le Jazz Hot but Ev rybody Wants to Be a Cat composed by Floyd Huddleston and Al Rinker was used instead Lastly a villainous song was envisioned to be sung by Edgar and his assistant Elvira as a romantic duet but the song was dropped when Elvira was removed from the story Another deleted song was for Thomas O Malley titled My Way s The Highway but the filmmakers had Terry Gilkyson compose the eponymous song Thomas O Malley Cat Gilkyson explained It was the same song but they orchestrated it twice They used the simpler one because they may have thought the other too elaborate or too hot It was a jazz version with a full orchestra br The instrumental music was composed by George Bruns who drew from his background with jazz bands in the s and decided to feature the accordion like musette for French flavor br On Classic Disney Years of Musical Magic this includes Thomas O Malley Cat on the purple disc and Ev rybody Wants to Be a Cat on the orange disc On Disney s Greatest Hits this includes Ev rybody Wants to Be a Cat on the red

and topped with one of the funniest jam sessions ever by a bunch of scraggly Bohemians headed by one Scat Cat Roger Ebert writing for the Chicago Sun Times awarded the film three stars out of four summarizing The Aristocats as light and pleasant and funny the characterization is strong and the voices of Phil Harris O Malley the Alley Cat and Eva Gabor Duchess the mother cat are charming in their absolute rightness Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film has a gentle good natured charm which will delight the small fry and their elders alike He praised the animation but remarked that the film lacks a certain kind of vigor boldness and dash a kind of a hard focused emphasis which you would say was a Disney trademark Arthur D Murphy of Variety praised the film writing the film is h elped immeasurably by the voices of Phil Harris Eva Gabor Sterling Holloway Scatman Crothers and others plus some outstanding animation songs sentiment some excellent dialog and even a touch of psychedelia Stefan Kanfer reviewing for Time magazine noted that t he melodies in Disney s earlier efforts have been richer But for integration of music comedy and plot The Aristocats has no rivals br Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune felt the film s artwork and story do not compare to the truly great Disney films Snow White Pinocchio Bambi and Dumbo but there is enough juvenile humor to keep the children in their seats for the minutes For its re release animation historian Charles Solomon expressed criticism for its episodic plot anachronisms and borrowed plot elements from earlier Disney animated features but nevertheless wrote b ut even at their least original the Disney artists provide better animation and more entertainment than the recent animated features hawking The Care Bears Rainbow Brite and Transformers Writing in his book The Disney Films Disney historian and film critic Leonard Maltin wrote that t he worst that one could say of The AristoCats is that it is unmemorable It s smoothly executed of course and enjoyable but neither its superficial story nor its characters have any resonance Additionally in his book Of Mice and Magic Maltin criticized the film for re using Phil Harris to replicate The Jungle Book s Baloo dismissing the character Thomas O Malley as essentially the same character dictated by the same voice personality br On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes of critics gave the film a positive review with an average rating of earning it a score of Fresh The website s consensus states Though The Aristocats is a mostly middling effort for Disney it is redeemed by terrific work from its voice cast and some jazzy tunes On Metacritic the film holds a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating generally
