third short of Pixar s SparkShorts program which consists in Pixar giving employees six months and limited budgets to produce animated short films The short was directed and written by Rosana Sullivan Sullivan described the SparkShorts program as a huge game changer since the studio had started investing in the unconventional unknown and diverse voices Kitbull was produced by Kathryn Hendrickson and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Domee Shi director of the Academy Award winning short film Bao Peter Sohn director of the feature film The Good Dinosaur and Kristen Lester director of the short film Purl were part of Sullivan s story trust on Kitbull The short was edited by Katie Schaefer Bishop br Sullivan said that a cat video had initiated the idea behind the short mentioning that she enjoyed looking at cat videos whenever she felt stressed According to Sullivan she started sketching this little black kitten in while working on a feature film project at the time at Pixar One of her colleagues showed her a video of a cat arching its back and trying to act tough then promptly falling off a counter Sullivan was so entertained by the difference between the cat s self perception and the reality which prompted her desire to draw a tiny kitten who embodied this contrast She stated that she had just wanted to draw a little kitten doing something silly and very very cat like She had initially wished to depict something that appealed to her and was enjoyable but it evolved into something more personal to her in the end Sullivan started to crave something more with the story eventually turning into one about a lonely cat and a dog forming a connection Sullivan said she had always had a deep love for animals which made her wish to tell a story through the lens of animal welfare br Sullivan first encountered pit bulls while working in shelters during college and felt they were sweet awesome dogs at the same time she started learning that there was a negative reputation around them Sullivan commented that all frames are hand drawn and hand painted adding that while the creators had used computers when drawing everything was directly from the artists hands onto the screen Sullivan said that she had always wanted to do a D animated short since she had grown up watching hand drawn animation She stated that she had always enjoyed the charm of a hand drawn image mentioning that every artist has their own way of drawing Sullivan commented that the kitten could not have been done without the hand drawn quality since the kitten s character itself is unpredictable and spastic According to her the kitten s frenetic energy could best be captured through hand drawn animation especially within the creators limited resources and six month production timeline br Sullivan stated that the creators of the short had invented their own pipeline Arjun Rihan who had been the director of photography while working on the short presented all the shots When it came to the backgrounds Sullivan worked closely with production designer Tim Evatt and Bill Cone The creators selected a mix between impressionistic kind of loose fast painting but also still kind of grungy and gritty they wished to prevent the short from being so heavy by keeping a sense of levity and to make the background loose enough to maintain focus on the characters The creators walked around the Mission with a selfie stick held low to the ground in order to see the neighborhood from the kitten s point of view Sullivan said that she had walked around Valencia Street looking for abandoned lots taking pictures of little cardboard boxes in the weeds to imagine if a kitten would actually live in there The kitten chooses to be alone and manages to remain unnoticed with the help of background elements such as shadows and road signs According to Sullivan Bernal Hill was always the goal and represented the conclusion of the relationship between the kitten and the pit bull with this being the place where they rise above the fray Sullivan said that the short had been inspired in a way by her relationship with her husband and her other close relationships stating that she would always climb alongside her husband on the Bernal Hill br The characters are not excessively detailed Animation supervisor Guillaume Chartier and character designer Zaruhi Galastian s love of D helped craft the final look and design of the characters Sullivan described the kitten as very cartoony and almost abstract in some ways She said just drawing the kitten had been really satisfying and entertaining to her mentioning that the animators who had become part of the crew shared her point of view The most gratifying facet of this process for her was collaborating with others to create something better than what she could have achieved alone She enjoyed working with trustful people that could amaze her According to Sullivan the themes of isolation empathy and vulnerability always resonated with her growing up as a shy kid She said that since she had been very timid and had difficulty in forming friendships during her childhood she identified with the kitten who instead of creating a connection preferred to remain in his comfort zone where he was not vulnerable the story centers on this idea She commented that the kitten had always been her access point to the story Sullivan wished to give a voice to the voiceless through Kitbull and she hoped that the relationship between the kitten and the pit bull can inspire empathy and compassion regardless of how scary it may be to step outside of our comfort zone to be vulnerable and connect br According to Hendrickson she and Sullivan partnered and began collaborating on the idea for Kitbull outside of work hours this had happened a few years before the SparkShorts program was created They were planning on making the short on their own but when the SparkShorts program was born and Sullivan was given the opportunity to direct Kitbull found its home at the studio Hendrickson said that she and Sullivan are both big animal lovers and she stated that viewing videos with kittens just became a real outlet for Sullivan Hendrickson commented that depicting the actual behavior of cats and dogs had been one of the creators main goals in animation because of their love for them She said that Sullivan had built a YouTube playlist with hundreds of cat and dog videos during the pre production phase that had been used as reference since so much charm and appeal can be found in an animal s nuanced movements Hendrickson stated that Guillaume Chartier had done an incredible job of guiding the animation team through that journey She hoped that besides being moved by the friendship between the kitten and the pit bull viewers would also be reminded that friendships come in all shapes and sizes and can be found in the most unexpected places she added that as the kitten experienced vulnerability and trust are the foundation of the deepest friendships br Kitbull is dissimilar to the usual technique of Pixar because it is animated in D style Hendrickson said that since the short was hand drawn there were many challenges at the beginning including trying to figure out how to tell the story with the resources within the studio and then taking this D project and getting it to fit back into the normal D process at Pixar During the layout phase of the project the creators had positioned the camera and decided on the staging and the framing for all of the shots Hendrickson said that when Rihan had finished laying out the shots they would take those shots and render them all out after which those renders became the templates for their background painters The animators drew the characters on a layer and the backgrounds were all painted on a layer the compositor then had to stitch those two together Hendrickson said that the action of Kitbull takes place in the Mission District San Francisco which is a very important location for Sullivan who had lived there after moving to San Francisco According to Hendrickson the sound designer even layered in some ambient noises from the Bay Area Rapid Transit in the short s background Hendrickson enjoyed seeing how every crew member had an influence on the short br br br Music br Andrew Jimenez who co directed
