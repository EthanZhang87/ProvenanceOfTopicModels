The VHS Video Home System is a standard for consumer level analog video recording on tape cassettes introduced in by the Victor Company of Japan JVC It was the dominant home video format throughout the tape media period in the late s s and s br Magnetic tape video recording was adopted by the television industry in the s in the form of the first commercialized video tape recorders VTRs but the devices were expensive and used only in professional environments In the s videotape technology became affordable for home use and widespread adoption of videocassette recorders VCRs began the VHS became the most popular media format for VCRs as it would win the format war against Betamax backed by Sony and a number of other competing tape standards br The cassettes themselves use a inch magnetic tape between two spools and typically offer a capacity of at least two hours The popularity of VHS was intertwined with the rise of the video rental market with films being released on pre recorded videotapes for home viewing Newer improved tape formats such as S VHS were later developed as well as the earliest optical disc format LaserDisc the lack of global adoption of these formats increased VHS s lifetime which eventually peaked and started to decline in the late s after the introduction of DVD a digital optical disc format VHS rentals were surpassed by DVD in the United States in which eventually became the preferred low end method of movie distribution For home recording purposes VHS and VCRs were surpassed by typically hard disk based digital video recorders DVR in the s br br br History br br br Before VHS br br In after several attempts by other companies the first commercially successful VTR the Ampex VRX was introduced by Ampex Corporation At a price of US in equivalent to in and US equivalent to in for a minute reel of tape it was intended only for the professional market br Kenjiro Takayanagi a television broadcasting pioneer then working for JVC as its vice president saw the need for his company to produce VTRs for the Japanese market at a more affordable price In JVC developed a two head video tape recorder and by a color version for professional broadcasting In JVC released the DV which would be the company s standard VTR until the mid s br In JVC collaborated with Sony Corporation and Matsushita Electric Matsushita was the majority stockholder of JVC until to build a video recording standard for the Japanese consumer The effort produced the U matic format in which was the first cassette format to become a unified standard for different companies It was preceded by the reel to reel EIAJ format br The U matic format was successful in businesses and some broadcast television applications such as electronic news gathering and was produced by all three companies until the late s but because of cost and limited recording time very few of the machines were sold for home use Therefore soon after the U Matic release all three companies started working on new consumer grade video recording formats of their own Sony started working on Betamax Matsushita started working on VX and JVC released the CR in based on the U matic format br br br VHS development br In JVC engineers Yuma Shiraishi and Shizuo Takano put together a team to develop a VTR for consumers br By the end of they created an internal diagram VHS Development Matrix which established twelve objectives for JVC s new VTR br br The system must be compatible with any ordinary television set br Picture quality must be similar to a normal air broadcast br The tape must have at least a two hour recording capacity br Tapes must be interchangeable between machines br The overall system should be versatile meaning it can be scaled and expanded such as connecting a video camera or dubbing between two recorders br Recorders should be affordable easy to operate and have low maintenance costs br Recorders must be capable of being produced in high volume their parts must be interchangeable and they must be easy to service br In early the commercial video recording industry in Japan took a financial hit JVC cut its budgets and restructured its video division shelving the VHS project However despite the lack of funding Takano and Shiraishi continued to work on the project in secret By the two engineers had produced a functional prototype br br br Competition with Betamax br In the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry MITI desiring to avoid consumer confusion attempted to force the Japanese video industry to standardize on just one home video recording format Later Sony had a functional prototype of the Betamax format and was very close to releasing a finished product With this prototype Sony persuaded the MITI to adopt Betamax as the standard and allow it to license the technology to other companies br JVC believed that an open standard with the format shared among competitors without licensing the technology was better for the consumer To prevent the MITI from adopting Betamax JVC worked to convince other companies in particular Matsushita Japan s largest electronics manufacturer at the time marketing its products under the National brand in most territories and the Panasonic brand in North America and JVC s majority stockholder to accept VHS and thereby work against Sony and the MITI Matsushita agreed primarily out of concern that Sony might become the leader in the field if its proprietary Betamax format was the only one allowed to be manufactured Matsushita also regarded Betamax s one hour recording time limit as a disadvantage br Matsushita s backing of JVC persuaded Hitachi Mitsubishi and Sharp to back the VHS standard as well Sony s release of its Betamax unit to the Japanese market in placed further pressure on the MITI to side with the company However the collaboration of JVC and its partners was much stronger which eventually led the MITI to drop its push for an industry standard JVC released the first VHS machines in Japan in late and in the United States in mid br Sony s Betamax competed with VHS throughout the late s and into the s see Videotape format war Betamax s major advantages were its smaller cassette size theoretical higher video quality and earlier availability but its shorter recording time proved to be a major shortcoming br Originally Beta I machines using the NTSC television standard were able to record one hour of programming at their standard tape speed of inches per second ips The first VHS machines could record for two hours due to both a slightly slower tape speed ips and significantly longer tape Betamax s smaller cassette limited the size of the reel of tape and could not compete with VHS s two hour capability by extending the tape length Instead Sony had to slow the tape down to ips Beta II in order to achieve two hours of recording in the same cassette size Sony eventually created a Beta III speed of ips which allowed NTSC Betamax to break the two hour limit but by then VHS had already won the format battle br Additionally VHS had a far less complex tape transport mechanism than Betamax and VHS machines were faster at rewinding and fast forwarding than their Sony counterparts br VHS eventually won the war gaining of the North American market by br br br Initial releases of VHS based devices br br The first VCR to use VHS was the Victor HR and was introduced by the president of JVC in Japan on September JVC started selling the HR in Akihabara Tokyo Japan on October Region specific versions of the JVC HR were also distributed later on such as the HR U in the United States and the HR EK in the United Kingdom The United States received its first VHS based VCR the RCA VBT on August The RCA unit was designed by Matsushita and was the first VHS based VCR manufactured by a company other than JVC It was also capable of recording four hours in LP long play mode The UK received its first VHS based VCR the Victor HR EK in br Quasar and General Electric followed up with VHS based VCRs all designed by Matsushita By Matsushita alone produced just over half of all Japanese VCRs TV VCR combos combining a TV set with a VHS mechanism were also once available for purchase Combo units containing both a VHS mechanism and a DVD player were introduced in the late s and at least one combo unit the Panasonic DMP BD V included a Blu ray player br br br Technical details br VHS has been standardized in IEC br br br Cassette and tape design br br The VHS cassette is a mm wide mm deep and mm thick inch plastic shell held together with five Phillips head screws The flip up cover which allows players and recorders to access the tape has a latch on the right side with a push in toggle to release it bottom view image The cassette has an anti despooling mechanism consisting of several plastic parts between the spools near the front of the cassette white and black in the top view The spool latches are released by a push in lever within a mm inch hole at the bottom of the cassette mm inch in from the edge label The tapes are made pre recorded and inserted into the cassettes in cleanrooms to ensure quality and to keep dust from getting embedded in the tape and interfering with recording both of which could cause signal dropouts br There is a clear tape leader at both ends of the tape to provide an optical auto stop for the VCR transport mechanism In the VCR a light source is inserted into the cassette through the circular hole in the center of the underside and two photodiodes are on the left and right sides of where the tape exits the cassette When the clear tape reaches one of these enough light will pass through the tape to the photodiode to trigger the stop function some VCRs automatically rewind the tape when the trailing end is detected Early VCRs used an incandescent bulb as the light source when the bulb failed the VCR would act as if a tape were present when the machine was empty or would detect the blown bulb and completely stop functioning Later designs use an infrared LED which has a much longer life br The recording medium is a Mylar magnetic tape mm inch wide coated with metal oxide and wound on two spools br The tape speed for Standard Play mode see below is cm s ips for NTSC cm s ips for PAL or just over and metres ft in and ft in per minute respectively The tape length for a T VHS cassette is metres ft br br br Tape loading technique br br As with almost all cassette based videotape systems VHS machines pull the tape out of the cassette shell and wrap it around the inclined head drum which rotates at rpm in NTSC machines and at rpm for PAL one complete rotation of the head corresponding to one video frame VHS uses an M loading system also known as M lacing where the tape is drawn out by two threading posts and wrapped around more than degrees of the head drum and also other tape transport components in a shape roughly approximating the letter M The heads in the rotating drum get their signal wirelessly using a rotary transformer br br br Recording capacity br br A VHS cassette holds a maximum of about m ft of tape at the lowest acceptable tape thickness giving a maximum playing time of about four hours in a T DF for NTSC and five hours in an E for PAL at standard play SP quality More frequently however VHS tapes are thicker than the required minimum to avoid complications such as jams or tears in the tape Other speeds include long play LP extended play EP or super long play SLP standard on NTSC rarely found on PAL machines For NTSC LP and EP SLP double and triple the recording time accordingly but these speed reductions cause a reduction in horizontal resolution from the normal equivalent of vertical lines in SP to the equivalent of in LP and even less in EP SLP br Due to the nature of recording diagonally from a spinning drum the actual write speed of the video heads does not get slower when the tape speed is reduced Instead the video tracks become narrower and are packed closer together This results in noisier playback that can be more difficult to track correctly The effect of subtle misalignment is magnified by the narrower tracks The heads for linear audio are not on the spinning drum so for them the tape speed from one reel to the other is the same as the speed of the heads across the tape This speed is quite slow for SP it is about s that of an audio cassette and for EP it is slower than the slowest microcassette speed This is widely considered inadequate for anything but basic voice playback and was a major liability for VHS C camcorders that encouraged the use of the EP speed Color depth deteriorates significantly at lower speeds in PAL often a color image on a PAL tape recorded at low speed is displayed only in monochrome or with intermittent color when playback is paused br br br Tape lengths br br VHS cassettes for NTSC and PAL SECAM systems are physically identical although the signals recorded on the tape are incompatible The tape speeds are different too so the playing time for any given cassette will vary between the systems To avoid confusion manufacturers indicate the playing time in minutes that can be expected for the market the tape is sold in E XXX indicates playing time in minutes for PAL or SECAM T XXX indicates playing time in minutes for NTSC or PAL M br To calculate the playing time for a T XXX tape in a PAL machine this formula is used br br PAL SECAM recording time T XXX in minutes br To calculate the playing time for an E XXX tape in an NTSC machine this formula is used br br NTSC recording time E XXX in minutes br Since the recording playback time for PAL SECAM is roughly longer than the recording playback time for NTSC some tape manufacturers label their cassettes with both T XXX and E XXX marks like T E T E and T E br SP is standard play LP is long play speed equal to recording time in DVHS HS mode EP SLP is extended super long play speed which was primarily released into the NTSC market br br br Copy protection br br As VHS was designed to facilitate recording from various sources including television broadcasts or other VCR units content producers quickly found that home users were able to use the devices to copy videos from one tape to another Despite generation loss in quality when a tape was copied this practice was regarded as a widespread problem which members of the Motion Picture Association of America MPAA claimed caused them great financial losses In response several companies developed technologies to protect copyrighted VHS tapes from casual duplication by home users The most popular method was Analog Protection System better known simply as Macrovision produced by a company of the same name According to Macrovision The technology is applied to over million videocassettes annually and is used by every MPAA movie studio on some or all of their videocassette releases Over commercial duplication facilities around the world are equipped to supply Macrovision videocassette copy protection to rights owners The study found that over of VCR households admit to having unauthorized copies and that the total annual revenue loss due to copying is estimated at annually br The system was first used in copyrighted movies beginning with the film The Cotton Club br Macrovision copy protection saw refinement throughout its years but has always worked by essentially introducing deliberate errors into a protected VHS tape s output video stream These errors in the output video stream are ignored by most televisions but will interfere with re recording of programming by a second VCR The first version of Macrovision introduces high signal levels during the vertical blanking interval which occurs between the video fields These high levels confuse the automatic gain control circuit in most VHS VCRs leading to varying brightness levels in an output video but are ignored by the TV as they are out of the frame display period Level II Macrovision uses a process called colorstriping which inverts the analog signal s colorburst period and causes off color bands to appear in the picture Level III protection added additional colorstriping techniques to further degrade the image br These protection methods worked well to defeat analog to analog copying by VCRs of the time Consumer products capable of digital video recording are mandated by law to include features which detect Macrovision encoding of input analog streams and disrupt copying of the video Both intentional and false positive detection of Macrovision protection has frustrated archivists who wish to copy now fragile VHS tapes to a digital format for preservation As of the s modern software decoding ignores macrovison as software is not limited to the fixed standards that macrovision was intended to disrupt in hardware based systems br br br Recording process br br The recording process in VHS consists of the following steps in this order br br The tape is pulled from the supply reel by a capstan and pinch roller similar to those used in audio tape recorders br The tape passes across the erase head which wipes any existing recording from the tape br The tape is wrapped around the head drum using a little more than degrees of the drum br One of the heads on the spinning drum records one field of video onto the tape in one diagonally oriented track br The tape passes across the audio and control head which records the control track and the linear audio tracks br The tape is wound onto the take up reel due to torque applied to the reel by the machine br br br Erase head br br The erase head is fed by a high level high frequency AC signal that overwrites any previous recording on the tape Without this step the new recording cannot be guaranteed to completely replace any old recording that might have been on the tape br br br Video recording br br The tape path then carries the tape around the spinning video head drum wrapping it around a little more than degrees called the omega transport system in a helical fashion assisted by the slanted tape guides The head rotates constantly at rpm in NTSC machines exactly in PAL each complete rotation corresponding to one frame of video br Two tape heads are mounted on the cylindrical surface of the drum degrees apart from each other so that the two heads take turns in recording The rotation of the inclined head drum combined with the relatively slow movement of the tape results in each head recording a track oriented at a diagonal with respect to the length of the tape with the heads moving across the tape at speeds higher than what would otherwise be possible This is referred to as helical scan recording A tape speed of inches per second corresponds to the heads on the drum moving across the tape at a writing speed of or meters per second br To maximize the use of the tape the video tracks are recorded very close together To reduce crosstalk between adjacent tracks on playback an azimuth recording method is used The gaps of the two heads are not aligned exactly with the track path Instead one head is angled at plus six degrees from the track and the other at minus six degrees This results during playback in destructive interference of the signal from the tracks on either side of the one being played br Each of the diagonal angled tracks is a complete TV picture field lasting of a second on PAL on the display One tape head records an entire picture field The adjacent track recorded by the second tape head is another or of a second TV picture field and so on Thus one complete head rotation records an entire NTSC or PAL frame of two fields br The original VHS specification had only two video heads When the EP recording speed was introduced the thickness of these heads was reduced to accommodate the narrower tracks However this subtly reduced the quality of the SP speed and dramatically lowered the quality of freeze frame and high speed search Later models implemented both wide and narrow heads and could use all four during pause and shuttle modes to further improve quality although machines later combined both pairs into one In machines supporting VHS HiFi described later yet another pair of heads was added to handle the VHS HiFi signal Camcorders using the miniaturized drum required twice as many heads to complete any given task This almost always meant four heads on the miniaturized drum with performance similar to a two head VCR with a full sized drum No attempt was made to record Hi Fi audio with such devices as this would require an additional four heads to work W VHS decks could have up to heads in the head drum of which were active and one was a dummy used for balancing the head drum br The high tape to head speed created by the rotating head results in a far higher bandwidth than could be practically achieved with a stationary head br VHS machines record up to MHz of baseband video bandwidth and kHz of baseband chroma bandwidth The luminance black and white portion of the video is frequency modulated and combined with a down converted color under chroma color signal that is encoded using quadrature amplitude modulation Including side bands the signal on a VHS tape can use up to MHz of RF bandwidth br VHS horizontal resolution is TVL or about lines across a scan line The vertical resolution number of scan lines is the same as the respective analog TV standard for PAL or for NTSC somewhat fewer scan lines are actually visible due to overscan and the VBI In modern day digital terminology NTSC VHS resolution is roughly equivalent to pixels for luma and pixels for chroma pixels or MP of a megapixel PAL VHS resolution is roughly pixels for luma and pixels for chroma although when decoded PAL and SECAM half the vertical color resolution br JVC countered s SuperBeta with VHS HQ or High Quality The frequency modulation of the VHS luminance signal is limited to megahertz which makes higher resolutions technically impossible even with the highest quality recording heads and tape materials but an HQ branded deck includes luminance noise reduction chroma noise reduction white clip extension and improved sharpness circuitry The effect was to increase the apparent horizontal resolution of a VHS recording from to analog equivalent to pixels from left to right in digital terminology The major VHS OEMs resisted HQ due to cost concerns eventually resulting in JVC reducing the requirements for the HQ brand to white clip extension plus one other improvement br In JVC introduced a new format called Super VHS often known as S VHS which extended the bandwidth to over megahertz yielding analog horizontal pixels left to right Most Super VHS recorders can play back standard VHS tapes but not vice versa S VHS was designed for higher resolution but failed to gain popularity outside Japan because of the high costs of the machines and tapes Because of the limited user base Super VHS was never picked up to any significant degree by manufacturers of pre recorded tapes although it was used extensively in the low end professional market for filming and editing br br br Audio recording br After leaving the head drum the tape passes over the stationary audio and control head This records a control track at the bottom edge of the tape and one or two linear audio tracks along the top edge br br br Original linear audio system br In the original VHS specification audio was recorded as baseband in a single linear track at the upper edge of the tape similar to how an audio compact cassette operates The recorded frequency range was dependent on the linear tape speed For the VHS SP mode which already uses a lower tape speed than the compact cassette this resulted in a mediocre frequency response of roughly Hz to kHz for NTSC frequency response for PAL VHS with its lower standard tape speed was somewhat worse of about Hz to kHz The signal to noise ratio SNR was an acceptable dB for NTSC and dB for PAL Both parameters degraded significantly with VHS s longer play modes with EP NTSC frequency response peaking at kHz S VHS tapes can give better audio and video quality because the tapes are designed to have almost twice the bandwidth of VHS at the same speed br Sound cannot be recorded on a VHS tape without recording a video signal because the video signal is used to generate the control track pulses which effectively regulate the tape speed on playback Even in the audio dubbing mode a valid video recording control track signal must be present on the tape for audio to be correctly recorded If there is no video signal to the VCR input during recording most later VCRs will record black video and generate a control track while the sound is being recorded Some early VCRs record audio without a control track signal this is of little use because the absence of a signal from the control track means that the linear tape speed is irregular during playback br More sophisticated VCRs offer stereo audio recording and playback Linear stereo fits two independent channels in the same space as the original mono audiotrack While this approach preserves acceptable backward compatibility with monoaural audio heads the splitting of the audio track degrades the audio s signal to noise ratio causing objectionable tape hiss at normal listening volume To counteract the hiss linear stereo VHS VCRs use Dolby B noise reduction for recording and playback This dynamically boosts the high frequencies of the audio program on the recorded medium improving its signal strength relative to the tape s background noise floor then attenuates the high frequencies during playback Dolby encoded program material exhibits a high frequency emphasis when played on non Hi Fi VCRs that are not equipped with the matching Dolby Noise Reduction decoder although this may actually improve the sound quality of non Hi Fi VCRs especially at the slower recording speeds br High end consumer recorders take advantage of the linear nature of the audio track as the audio track could be erased and recorded without disturbing the video portion of the recorded signal Hence audio dubbing and video dubbing where either the audio or video is re recorded on tape without disturbing the other were supported features on prosumer linear video editing decks Without dubbing capability an audio or video edit could not be done in place on master cassette and requires the editing output be captured to another tape incurring generational loss br Studio film releases began to emerge with linear stereo audiotracks in From that point nearly every home video release by Hollywood featured a Dolby encoded linear stereo audiotrack However linear stereo was never popular with equipment makers or consumers br br br Tracking adjustment and index marking br Another linear control track at the tape s lower edge holds pulses that mark the beginning of every frame of video these are used to fine tune the tape speed during playback so that the high speed rotating heads remained exactly on their helical tracks rather than somewhere between two adjacent tracks known as tracking Since good tracking depends on precise distances between the rotating drum and the fixed control audio head reading the linear tracks which usually varies by a couple of micrometers between machines due to manufacturing tolerances most VCRs offer tracking adjustment either manual or automatic to correct such mismatches br The control track is also used to hold index marks which were normally written at the beginning of each recording session and can be found using the VCR s index search function this will fast wind forward or backward to the nth specified index mark and resume playback from there At times higher end VCRs provided functions for the user to manually add and remove these marks br By the late s some high end VCRs offered more sophisticated indexing For example Panasonic s Tape Library system assigned an ID number to each cassette and logged recording information channel date time and optional program title entered by the user both on the cassette and in the VCR s memory for up to recordings with titles br br br Hi Fi audio system br Around JVC added Hi Fi audio to VHS model HR D U in response to Betamax s introduction of Beta Hi Fi Both VHS Hi Fi and Betamax Hi Fi delivered flat full range frequency response Hz to kHz excellent dB signal to noise ratio in consumer space second only to the compact disc dynamic range of dB and professional audio grade channel separation more than dB VHS Hi Fi audio is achieved by using audio frequency modulation AFM modulating the two stereo channels L R on two different frequency modulated carriers and embedding the combined modulated audio signal pair into the video signal To avoid crosstalk and interference from the primary video carrier VHS s implementation of AFM relied on a form of magnetic recording called depth multiplexing The modulated audio carrier pair was placed in the hitherto unused frequency range between the luminance and the color carrier below MHz and recorded first Subsequently the video head erases and re records the video signal combined luminance and color signal over the same tape surface but the video signal s higher center frequency results in a shallower magnetization of the tape allowing both the video and residual AFM audio signal to coexist on tape PAL versions of Beta Hi Fi use this same technique During playback VHS Hi Fi recovers the depth recorded AFM signal by subtracting the audio head s signal which contains the AFM signal contaminated by a weak image of the video signal from the video head s signal which contains only the video signal then demodulates the left and right audio channels from their respective frequency carriers The result of the complex process was audio of high fidelity which was uniformly solid across all tape speeds EP LP or SP Since JVC had gone through the complexity of ensuring Hi Fi s backward compatibility with non Hi Fi VCRs virtually all studio home video releases produced after this time contained Hi Fi audio tracks in addition to the linear audio track Under normal circumstances all Hi Fi VHS VCRs will record Hi Fi and linear audio simultaneously to ensure compatibility with VCRs without Hi Fi playback though only early high end Hi Fi machines provided linear stereo compatibility br The sound quality of Hi Fi VHS stereo is comparable to some extent to the quality of CD audio particularly when recordings were made on high end or professional VHS machines that have a manual audio recording level control This high quality compared to other consumer audio recording formats such as compact cassette attracted the attention of amateur and hobbyist recording artists Home recording enthusiasts occasionally recorded high quality stereo mixdowns and master recordings from multitrack audio tape onto consumer level Hi Fi VCRs However because the VHS Hi Fi recording process is intertwined with the VCR s video recording function advanced editing functions such as audio only or video only dubbing are impossible A short lived alternative to the hifi feature for recording mixdowns of hobbyist audio only projects was a PCM adaptor so that high bandwidth digital video could use a grid of black and white dots on an analog video carrier to give pro grade digital sounds though DAT tapes made this obsolete br Some VHS decks also had a simulcast switch allowing users to record an external audio input along with off air pictures Some televised concerts offered a stereo simulcast soundtrack on FM radio and as such events like Live Aid were recorded by thousands of people with a full stereo soundtrack despite the fact that stereo TV broadcasts were some years off especially in regions that adopted NICAM Other examples of this included network television shows such as Friday Night Videos and MTV for its first few years in existence Likewise some countries most notably South Africa provided alternate language audio tracks for TV programming through an FM radio simulcast br The considerable complexity and additional hardware limited VHS Hi Fi to high end decks for many years While linear stereo all but disappeared from home VHS decks it was not until the s that Hi Fi became a more common feature on VHS decks Even then most customers were unaware of its significance and merely enjoyed the better audio performance of the newer decks VHS Hi Fi audio has been standardized in IEC br br br Issues with Hi Fi audio br Due to the path followed by the video and Hi Fi audio heads being striped and discontinuous unlike that of the linear audio track head switching is required to provide a continuous audio signal While the video signal can easily hide the head switching point in the invisible vertical retrace section of the signal so that the exact switching point is not very important the same is obviously not possible with a continuous audio signal that has no inaudible sections Hi Fi audio is thus dependent on a much more exact alignment of the head switching point than is required for non HiFi VHS machines Misalignments may lead to imperfect joining of the signal resulting in low pitched buzzing The problem is known as head chatter and tends to increase as the audio heads wear down br Another issue that made VHS Hi Fi imperfect for music is the inaccurate reproduction of levels softer and louder which are not re created as the original source br br br Variations br br br Super VHS ADAT SVHS ET br br Several improved versions of VHS exist most notably Super VHS S VHS an analog video standard with improved video bandwidth S VHS improved the horizontal luminance resolution to lines versus for VHS Beta and for DVD The audio system both linear and AFM is the same S VHS made little impact on the home market but gained dominance in the camcorder market due to its superior picture quality br The ADAT format provides the ability to record multitrack digital audio using S VHS media JVC also developed SVHS ET technology for its Super VHS camcorders and VCRs which simply allows them to record Super VHS signals onto lower priced VHS tapes albeit with a slight blurring of the image Nearly all later JVC Super VHS camcorders and VCRs have SVHS ET ability br br br VHS C Super VHS C br br Another variant is VHS Compact VHS C originally developed for portable VCRs in but ultimately finding success in palm sized camcorders The longest tape available for NTSC holds minutes in SP mode and minutes in EP mode Since VHS C tapes are based on the same magnetic tape as full size tapes they can be played back in standard VHS players using a mechanical adapter without the need of any kind of signal conversion The magnetic tape on VHS C cassettes is wound on one main spool and uses a gear wheel to advance the tape br The adapter is mechanical although early examples were motorized with a battery It has an internal hub to engage with the VCR mechanism in the location of a normal full size tape hub driving the gearing on the VHS C cassette Also when a VHS C cassette is inserted into the adapter a small swing arm pulls the tape out of the miniature cassette to span the standard tape path distance between the guide rollers of a full size tape This allows the tape from the miniature cassette to use the same loading mechanism as that from the standard cassette br Super VHS C or S VHS Compact was developed by JVC in S VHS provided an improved luminance and chrominance quality yet S VHS recorders were compatible with VHS tapes br Sony was unable to shrink its Betamax form any further so instead developed Video Hi which was in direct competition with the VHS C S VHS C format throughout the s s and s Ultimately neither format won and both have been superseded by digital high definition equipment br br br W VHS Digital VHS high definition br br W VHS allowed recording of MUSE Hi Vision analog high definition television which was broadcast in Japan from until The other improved standard called Digital VHS D VHS records digital high definition video onto a VHS form factor tape D VHS can record up to hours of ATSC digital television in p or i formats using the fastest record mode equivalent to VHS SP and up to hours of lower definition video at slower speeds br br br D br br There is also a JVC designed component digital professional production format known as Digital S or officially under the name D that uses a VHS form factor tape and essentially the same mechanical tape handling techniques as an S VHS recorder This format is the least expensive format to support a Sel Sync pre read for video editing This format competed with Sony s Digital Betacam in the professional and broadcast market although in that area Sony s Betacam family ruled supreme in contrast to the outcome of the VHS Betamax domestic format war It has now been superseded by high definition formats br br br V Lite br In the late s there was a disposable promotional variation of the VHS format called V Lite It was a cassette constructed largely with polystyrene with only the rotating components like the tape reels being of hard plastic with glued casings without standard features like a protective cover for the exposed tape Its purpose was to be as lightweight as possible for minimized mass delivery costs for the purpose of a media company s promotional campaign and intended for only a few viewings with a runtime of typically to minutes One such production so promoted was the A E Network s adaptation of The Great Gatsby The format arose concurrently and then rendered obsolete with the rise of the DVD video format which eventually supplanted VHS being lighter and less expensive still to mass distribute while video streaming would later supplant the use of physical media for video promotion br br br Accessories br br Shortly after the introduction of the VHS format VHS tape rewinders were developed These devices served the sole purpose of rewinding VHS tapes Proponents of the rewinders argued that the use of the rewind function on the standard VHS player would lead to wear and tear of the transport mechanism The rewinder would rewind the tapes smoothly and also normally do so at a faster rate than the standard rewind function on VHS players However some rewinder brands did have some frequent abrupt stops which occasionally led to tape damage br Some devices were marketed which allowed a personal computer to use a VHS recorder as a data backup device The most notable of these was ArVid widely used in Russia and CIS states Similar systems were manufactured in the United States by Corvus and Alpha Microsystems and in the UK by Backer from Danmere Ltd The Backer system could store up to GB of data with a transfer rate of MB per minute br br br Signal standards br VHS can record and play back all varieties of analog television signals in existence at the time VHS was devised However a machine must be designed to record a given standard Typically a VHS machine can only handle signals using the same standard as the country it was sold in This is because some parameters of analog broadcast TV are not applicable to VHS recordings the number of VHS tape recording format variations is smaller than the number of broadcast TV signal variations for example analog TVs and VHS machines except multistandard devices are not interchangeable between the UK and Germany but VHS tapes are The following tape recording formats exist in conventional VHS listed in the form of standard lines frames br br SECAM SECAM French variety br MESECAM most other SECAM countries notably the former Soviet Union and Middle East br NTSC Most parts of Americas Japan South Korea br PAL i e PAL M Brazil br PAL most of Western Europe Australia New Zealand many parts of Asia such as China and India some parts of South America such as Argentina Uruguay and the Falklands and Africa br PAL VCRs allow playback of SECAM and MESECAM tapes with a monochrome picture and vice versa as the line standard is the same br Since the s dual and multi standard VHS machines able to handle a variety of VHS supported video standards became more common For example VHS machines sold in Australia and Europe could typically handle PAL MESECAM for record and playback and NTSC for playback only on suitable TVs Dedicated multi standard machines can usually handle all standards listed and some high end models could convert the content of a tape from one standard to another on the fly during playback by using a built in standards converter br S VHS is only implemented as such in PAL and NTSC S VHS machines sold in SECAM markets record internally in PAL and convert between PAL and SECAM during recording and playback S VHS machines for the Brazilian market record in NTSC and convert between it and PAL M br A small number of VHS decks are able to decode closed captions on video cassettes before sending the full signal to the set with the captions A smaller number still are able additionally to record subtitles transmitted with world standard teletext signals on pre digital services simultaneously with the associated program S VHS has a sufficient resolution to record teletext signals with relatively few errors although for some years now it has been possible to recover teletext pages and even complete page carousels from regular VHS recordings using non real time computer processing br br br Uses in marketing br VHS was popular for long form content such as feature films or documentaries as well as short play content such as music videos in store videos teaching videos distribution of lectures and talks and demonstrations VHS instruction tapes were sometimes included with various products and services including exercise equipment kitchen appliances and computer software br br br Comparison to Betamax br br VHS was the winner of a protracted and somewhat bitter format war during the late s and early s against Sony s Betamax format as well as other formats of the time br Betamax was widely perceived at the time as the better format as the cassette was smaller in size and Betamax offered slightly better video quality than VHS it had lower video noise less luma chroma crosstalk and was marketed as providing pictures superior to those of VHS However the sticking point for both consumers and potential licensing partners of Betamax was the total recording time To overcome the recording limitation Beta II speed two hour mode NTSC regions only was released in order to compete with VHS s two hour SP mode thereby reducing Betamax s horizontal resolution to lines vs lines In turn the extension of VHS to VHS HQ produced lines vs lines so that overall a typical Betamax VHS user could expect virtually identical resolution Very high end Betamax machines still supported recording in the Beta I mode and some in an even higher resolution Beta Is Beta I Super HiBand mode but at a maximum single cassette run time of with an L cassette br Because Betamax was released more than a year before VHS it held an early lead in the format war However by United States Betamax sales had dipped to only percent of all sales There was debate between experts over the cause of Betamax s loss Some including Sony s founder Akio Morita say that it was due to Sony s licensing strategy with other manufacturers which consistently kept the overall cost for a unit higher than a VHS unit and that JVC allowed other manufacturers to produce VHS units license free thereby keeping costs lower Others say that VHS had better marketing since the much larger electronics companies at the time Matsushita for example supported VHS Sony would make its first

native countries in VHS format br Although VHS has been discontinued in the United States VHS recorders and blank tapes were still sold at stores in other developed countries prior to digital television transitions As an acknowledgement of the continued use of VHS Panasonic announced the world s first dual deck VHS Blu ray player in The last standalone JVC VHS only unit was produced October JVC and other manufacturers continued to make combination DVD VHS units even after the decline of VHS Countries like South Korea released films on VHS until December with Inception being the last Hollywood film to be released on VHS in the country br A market for pre recorded VHS tapes has continued and some online retailers such as Amazon still sell new and used pre recorded VHS cassettes of movies and television programs None of the major Hollywood studios generally issues releases on VHS The last major studio film to be released in the format in the United States and Canada

disc Though occasionally showing compression artifacts and color banding that are common discrepancies in digital media the durability and longevity of a VCD depends on the production quality of the disc and its handling The data stored digitally on a VCD theoretically does not degrade in the analog sense like tape In the disc player there is no physical contact made with either the data or label sides When handled properly a VCD will last a long time br Since a VCD can hold only minutes of video a movie exceeding that mark has to be divided into two or more discs br br br DVD br br The DVD Video format was introduced first on November in Japan to the United States on March test marketed and mid to late in Europe and Australia br While the DVD was highly successful in the pre recorded retail market it failed to displace VHS for in home recording of video content e g broadcast or cable television A number of factors hindered the commercial success of the DVD in this regard including br br A reputation for being temperamental and unreliable as well as the risk of scratches and hairline cracks br Incompatibilities in playing discs recorded on a different manufacturer s machines to that of the original recording machine br Compression artifacts MPEG video compression can result in visible artifacts such as macroblocking mosquito noise and ringing which become accentuated in extended recording modes more than three hours on a DVD disc Standard VHS will not suffer from any of these problems all of which are characteristic of certain digital video compression systems see Discrete cosine transform but VHS will result in reduced luminance and chroma resolution which makes the picture look horizontally blurred resolution decreases further with LP and EP recording modes VHS also adds considerable noise to both the luminance and chroma channels br br br High capacity digital recording technologies br br High capacity digital recording systems are also gaining in
