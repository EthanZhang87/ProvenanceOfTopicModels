threaten to drown it Sally refuses to let him take care of the puppy so he takes it to Uncle Remus Uncle Remus takes the dog in and delights Johnny and his friends with the fable of Br er Rabbit and the Tar Baby stressing that people should not get involved with something they have no business with in the first place Johnny imitates Br er Rabbit s use of reverse psychology from the tale and begs the Favers brothers not to tell their mother about the dog The trick works and the boys get in trouble after telling their mother In an act of revenge they tell Sally about the dog Sally becomes upset

Johnny sings with Ginny and Toby while Johnny s returned puppy runs alongside them Nearby Uncle Remus is shocked when Br er Rabbit and several of the other characters from his stories appear in front of them and interact with the children Uncle Remus rushes to join the group and together they all walk into the sunset br br In the aftermath of World War II Walt Disney Studios faced financial difficulties due to a lack of foreign markets for animated films during wartime The studio produced few theatrical animated shorts then focusing instead on military training films that broke even but produced no profit The studio only profited in and by reissuing Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio and still had to lay off half of its employees in With additional financial difficulties due to a union strike in Disney sought to produce live action films to generate additional revenue While Disney s contract with RKO was for animated films films that mixed live action with animation fell under the contract allowing the studio to lower production costs on Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros Additionally Disney owned the rights to several properties purchased after the success of Snow White which could be made into family films br In Walt Disney became interested in the Joel Chandler Harris Uncle Remus storybook claiming to remember hearing the stories as a child and prepared two research reports to determine if it was possible to film the stories dated April and He purchased the rights to the stories in paying Harris s family equivalent to in By the film based on the stories Song of the South had earned million br Beginning in Disney began developing Uncle Remus as an entirely animated feature The stories were also considered as two reel animated shorts Stories considered for the production included Br er Rabbit Rides the Fox in which Br er Rabbit tricks Br er Fox into riding him like a horse to a party and De Wuller De Wust in which Br er Rabbit pretends to be a ghost to scare Br er Bear In another treatment Uncle Remus gathers the critters together for a prayer meeting and to encourage them to build a church that would bring peace between predators and prey Also proposed was a storyline in which Br er Rabbit s addiction to gambling would be at the root of the troubles that led to the film s adventures br Disney first began to negotiate with Harris s family for the rights in and by late summer of that year he already had one of his storyboard artists summarize the more promising tales and draw up four boards worth of story sketches In November Disney visited the Harris s home in Atlanta He told Variety that he wanted to get an authentic feeling of Uncle Remus country so we can do as faithful a job as possible to these stories Disney s brother Roy had misgivings about the project doubting that it was big enough in caliber and natural draft to warrant a budget over million and more than twenty five minutes of animation Disney planned to produce a series of Uncle Remus films if the first one was successful each with the same live action cast but different animated shorts Ultimately the studio decided that only a third of the film would be animated and the rest would be live action br Disney was initially going to have the screenplay written by the studio animators but later sought professional writers In June Disney hired Southern born writer Dalton Reymond to write the screenplay and he met frequently with King Vidor whom he was trying to interest in directing the live action sequences br Dalton Reymond delivered a page outline on May The Hays Office reviewed Reymond s outline and demanded that some terminology such as characters referring to Remus as an old darkie be removed from Reymond s treatment br Disney hired African American performer and writer Clarence Muse to be consulted on the screenplay but Muse quit when Reymond ignored Muse s suggestions to portray African American characters in a way that would be perceived as being dignified and more than Southern stereotypes Muse subsequently wrote letters to the editors of black publications to criticize the depiction of African Americans in Reymond s script Disney claimed that Muse attacked the film because Disney did not choose Muse to play the part of Uncle Remus which Muse had lobbied for br In addition to concerns about his racial stereotyping Reymond had never written a screenplay before nor would he write another Maurice Rapf who had been writing live action features at the time was asked by Walt Disney Productions to work with Reymond and co writer Callum Webb to turn the treatment into a shootable screenplay According to Neal Gabler one of the reasons Disney had hired Rapf to work with Reymond was to temper what Disney feared would be Reymond s white Southern slant br Reymond s treatment included the phrases massa in reference to white characters and darkey in reference to plantation workers prominently Rapf removed the offending phrase and added dialogue to make it clear that the film was set after slavery had ended one character in Rapf s script states in reference to the Black plantation workers We gotta pay these people They re not slaves Uncle Remus also states after being told that he cannot read any more stories to Johnny I m a free man I don t have to take this br Rapf saw the animal stories as metaphors for slave resistance and intended to portray Br er Rabbit as a smaller less powerful Black man and in place of the oppressive whites would be Br er Fox Br er Bear and the deleted character Br er Coon br br Rapf was a minority a Jew and an outspoken left winger and he himself feared that the film would inevitably be Uncle Tomish That s exactly why I want you to work on it Walt told him because I know that you don t think I should make the movie You re against Uncle Tomism and you re a radical br Rapf initially hesitated but when he found out that most of the film would be live action and that he could make extensive changes he accepted the offer Rapf worked on Uncle Remus for about seven weeks When he got into a personal dispute with Reymond Rapf was taken off the project According to Rapf Disney ended every conference by saying Well I think we ve really licked it now Then he d call you the next morning and say I ve got a new idea And he d have one Sometimes the ideas were good sometimes they were terrible but you could never really satisfy him Morton Grant was assigned to the project Disney sent out the script for comment both within the studio and outside the studio br On May the title was changed from Uncle Remus to Song of the South br br In February Disney talked with Paul Robeson about him playing Uncle Remus and the two remained in talks about the project for several years but ultimately he was not cast It is speculated that Robeson s politics made him too controversial for the role Other actors considered included Rex Ingram Clarence Muse lobbied for the role of Uncle Remus while consulting on the screenplay but left the project due to Dalton Reymond s depiction of African Americans in the original treatment br James Baskett was cast as Uncle Remus after responding to an ad for providing the voice of a talking butterfly Baskett is quoted as saying I thought that maybe they d try me out to furnish the voice for one of Uncle Remus s animals Upon review of his voice Disney wanted to meet Baskett personally and had him tested for the role of Uncle Remus In addition to the role of Uncle Remus Baskett also received the voice roles of the butterfly and Br er Fox Baskett also filled in as the voice of Br er Rabbit for Johnny Lee in the Laughing Place sequence after Lee was called away to do a USO tour Disney told Baskett s sister Ruth that Baskett was the best actor I believe to be discovered in years After the film s release Disney maintained contact with him Disney also campaigned for Baskett to be given an Academy Award for his performance saying that he had worked almost wholly without direction and had devised the characterization of Remus himself Baskett won an honorary Oscar in After Baskett s death his widow wrote Disney and told him that he had been a friend indeed and we certainly have been in need br Also cast in the production were child actors Bobby Driscoll Luana Patten and Glenn Leedy his only credited screen appearance Driscoll was the first actor to be under a personal contract with the Disney studio Patten had been a professional model since age three and caught the attention of Disney when she appeared on the cover of Woman s Home Companion Leedy was discovered on the playground of the Booker T Washington school in Phoenix Arizona by a talent scout from the Disney studio Ruth Warrick and Erik Rolf cast as Johnny s mother and father had actually been married during filming but divorced in Hattie McDaniel also appeared in the role of Aunt Tempe br br Production started under the title Uncle Remus The budget was originally million The animated segments of the film were directed by Wilfred Jackson while the live action segments were directed by Harve Foster Filming began in December in Phoenix Arizona where the studio had constructed a plantation and cotton fields for outdoor scenes and Disney left for the location to oversee what he called atmospheric shots Back in Hollywood the live action scenes were filmed at the Samuel Goldwyn Studio br On the final day of shooting Jackson discovered that the scene in which Uncle Remus sings the film s signature song Zip a Dee Doo Dah had not been properly blocked According to Jackson We all sat there in a circle with the dollars running out and nobody came up with anything Then Walt suggested that they shoot Baskett in close up cover the lights with cardboard save for a sliver of blue sky behind his head and then remove the cardboard from the lights when he began singing so that he would seem to be entering a bright new world of animation Like Walt s idea for Bambi on ice it made for one of the most memorable scenes in the film br br There are three animated segments in the film they total minutes The last few minutes of the film also combines animation with live action The three sequences were later shown as stand alone cartoon features on television br br Br er Rabbit Runs Away minutes Based on Br er Rabbit Earns a Dollar a Minute Includes the song Zip a Dee Doo Dah br Br er Rabbit and the Tar Baby minutes Based on Tar Baby The segment is interrupted with a short live action scene about two thirds through It features the song How Do You Do br Br er Rabbit s Laughing Place minutes Based on The Laughing Place The song Everybody s Got a Laughing Place is featured br br Nine

Foster And The Rise Of American Popular Culture believes that Zip a Dee Doo Dah is influenced by the chorus of the pre Civil War folk song Zip Coon which is today considered racist for its use of an African American stereotype br br The film premiered on November at the Fox Theater in Atlanta Walt Disney made introductory remarks introduced the cast then quietly left for his room at the Georgian Terrace Hotel across the street he had previously stated that unexpected audience reactions upset him and he was better off not seeing the film with an audience James Baskett was unable to attend the film s premiere because he would not have been allowed to participate in any of the festivities as Atlanta was then a racially segregated city br Song of the South was re released in theaters several times after its original premiere each time through Buena Vista Pictures in for the th anniversary in for the th anniversary of Walt Disney Productions in as the second half of a double bill with The Aristocats in for the th anniversary of Harris s classic stories and in for the film s own th anniversary and in promotion of the upcoming Splash Mountain attraction at Disneyland br br As had been done earlier with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Pinocchio and Bambi Disney produced a Sunday comic strip titled Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br er Rabbit to give the film pre release publicity The strip was launched by King Features on October more than a year before the film was released The previous comic strip adaptations of Disney films lasted for four or five months but the Uncle Remus strip continued for almost thirty years telling new stories of Br er Rabbit and friends until the strip was discontinued on December Apart from the newspaper strips Disney Br er Rabbit comics were also produced for comic books the first such stories appeared in late Produced both by Western Publishing and European publishers such as Egmont they continue to appear br In a Giant Golden Book entitled Walt Disney s Uncle Remus Stories was published by Simon Schuster It featured illustrated stories of Br er Rabbit s escapades all told in a Southern dialect based on the original Joel Chandler Harris stories br In Floyd Norman wrote A Zip A Dee Doo Dah Christmas featuring Uncle Remus and Br er Rabbit as that year s annual Disney Christmas Story newspaper comic strip When the Christmas Story strips were reprinted in the collection Disney s Christmas Classics this story was omitted the only deletion in an otherwise complete run of the strip br br Disney has not released a complete version of the film in the United States on home video given the film s controversial reputation Over the years Disney has made a variety of statements about whether and when the film would be re released From to CEO Michael Eisner stated that the film would not receive a home video release in the United States due to not wanting to have a disclaimer and fearing backlash and accusations of racism At Eisner s request Uncle Remus was not featured in the Splash Mountain attraction instead being replaced as the narrator by Br er Frog in the Tokyo Disneyland and Magic Kingdom versions of the ride In March Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that there were no plans to release the film on DVD calling the film antiquated and fairly offensive In November Disney creative director Dave Bossert stated in an interview I can say there s been a lot of internal discussion about Song of the South And at some point we re going to do something about it I don t know when but we will We know we want people to see Song of the South because we realize it s a big piece of company history and we want to do it the right way Film critic Roger Ebert who normally disdained any attempt to keep films from any audience supported the non release of the film arguing that Disney films become a part of the consciousness of American children who take films more literally than do adults br Audio from the film both the musical soundtrack and dialogue was commonly used in home media tie ins through the late s In particular many book and record sets were released featuring the animated portions of the film or summaries of the film as a whole The Walt Disney Company has also included key portions of the film in VHS and DVD compilations in the United States as well as on the long running Walt Disney

translates to The Stories of Uncle Tom and the Norwegian title Onkel Remus forteller translates to Storyteller Uncle Remus br In after being inaugurated as a Disney Legend Whoopi Goldberg expressed a desire for Song of the South to be re released publicly to American audiences and stated I m trying to find a way to get people to start having conversations about bringing Song of the South back so we can talk about what it was and where it came from and why it came out br Song of the South has never been available on Disney s streaming service Disney which launched in the United States in In Iger affirmed during a shareholders meeting that the film would not be getting a release on the service even with an outdated cultural depictions disclaimer stating that the film is not appropriate in today s world br br Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times More and more Walt Disney s craftsmen have been loading their feature films with so called live action in place of their animated whimsies of the past and by just those proportions has the magic of these Disney films decreased citing the ratio of live action to animation at two to one concluding that is approximately the ratio of its mediocrity to its charm A review in Variety felt the film overall was sometimes sentimental slow and overlong Nevertheless the review felt the songs were above average with one Zip adee do da sic likely to be one of the season s favorites and the animated sequences as great stuff They also praised Driscoll and Patten as two of the most natural and appealing youngsters and Baskett s performance was as warming a portrait as has been seen in a long time A review in Time magazine praised the animated sequences as topnotch Disney and delightful but cautioned that it was bound to land its maker in hot water because the character of Uncle Remus was bound to enrage all educated Negroes and a number of damyankees br Harrison s Reports praised Driscoll and Baskett s performances particularly the latter writing his tender understanding of the child s problems gives the picture many appealing moments Overall the review felt the film had a simple but sensitive and pathetic story filled with deep human interest and fine clean comedy situations and it has an air of wholesomeness that comes as a pleasant relief from the general run of pictures nowadays Dorothy Masters of the New York Daily News wrote Although plot is practically ignored Disney has worked a lot of magic with brilliant animation effective and wonderful music besides having made the very best possible choice for Uncle Remus James Baskett who portrays the sagacious dean of plantation workers has both the benign appearance and mellifluous voice to make him the perfect spinner of tales It s largely through his philosophical whimsy that Song of the South is so delightfully charming Columnist Hedda Hopper also praised Baskett s performance and advocated for him to receive an Academy Award br Criticism in the black press however was more politically divided Richard B Dier in The Afro American was thoroughly disgusted by the film for being as vicious a piece of propaganda for white supremacy as Hollywood ever produced Herman Hill in The Pittsburgh Courier felt that Song of the South would prove of inestimable goodwill in the furthering of interracial relations and considered criticisms of the film to be unadulterated hogwash symptomatic of the unfortunate racial neurosis that seems to be gripping so many of our humorless brethren these days br Charles Solomon reviewing the film in the Los Angeles Times during its re release praised the film as essentially a nostalgic valentine to a past that never existed and within those limits it offers a pleasant family diversion for holiday afternoons when the children get restless The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes has a rating of based on reviews with an average score of On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews br br By January the film had grossed million in distributor rentals from the United States and Canada netting the studio a profit of million in dollars

nominated in the Scoring of a Musical Picture category and Zip a Dee Doo Dah written by Allie Wrubel and Ray Gilbert won the award for Best Original Song at the th Academy Awards on March A special Academy Award was given to Baskett for his able and heart warming characterization of Uncle Remus friend and story teller to the children of the world in Walt Disney s Song of the South For their portrayals of the children Johnny and Ginny Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten were also discussed for Academy Juvenile Awards but in it was decided not to present such awards at all br The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists br br AFI s Years Songs br Zip a Dee Doo Dah br AFI s Greatest Movie Musicals Nominated br br The film has sparked significant controversy for its handling of race Cultural historian Jason Sperb describes the film as one of Hollywood s most resiliently offensive racist texts Sperb Neal Gabler and other critics have noted the film s release as being in the wake of the Double V campaign a campaign in the United States during World War II to promote victory over racism in the United States and its armed forces and victory over fascism abroad Early in the film s production there was concern that the material would encounter controversy Disney publicist Vern Caldwell wrote to producer Perce Pearce that the negro situation is a dangerous one Between the negro haters and the negro lovers there are many chances to run afoul of situations that could run the gamut all the way from the nasty to the controversial br The Disney Company has stated that like Harris s book the film takes place after the American Civil War and that all the African American characters in the movie are no longer slaves The Hays Office had asked Disney to be certain that the frontispiece of the book mentioned establishes the date in the s however the final film carried no such statement br Adam Clayton Powell Jr a congressman from Harlem branded the film an insult to American minorities and everything that America as a whole stands for The National Negro Congress set up picket lines in theaters in the big cities where the film played with its protesters holding signs that read Song of the South is an insult to the Negro people and lampooning Jingle Bells chanted Disney tells Disney tells lies about the South On April a group of protesters marched around Oakland California s Paramount Theatre with picket signs reading We want films on Democracy not Slavery and Don t prejudice children s minds with films like this The National Jewish Post scorned the fact that the film s lead was not allowed to attend its premiere in Atlanta because of his race br Criticisms in the black press largely objected to the reinforcement of stereotypes such as the subservient status of black characters costuming the exaggerated dialect and other archaic depictions of black people br br According to Valarie Stewart daughter of Nick Stewart voice of Br er Bear in the film NAACP executive secretary Walter Francis White disliked actress Hattie McDaniel White a light skinned black man with blonde hair and blue eyes according to Valarie Stewart launched campaigns against McDaniel s films because McDaniel was dark skinned and she alleged that Song of the South was targeted because of White s prejudice against McDaniel br Disney historian Jim Korkis in his book Who s Afraid of Song of the South alleged that White and June Blythe the director of the American Council on Race Relations were denied requests to see a treatment for the film When the film was first released White telegraphed major newspapers around the country with the following statement erroneously claiming that the film depicted an antebellum setting br br The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People recognizes in Song of the South remarkable artistic merit in the music and in the combination of living actors and the cartoon technique It regrets however that in an effort neither to offend audiences in the north or south the production helps to perpetuate a dangerously glorified picture of slavery Making use of the beautiful Uncle Remus folklore Song of the South unfortunately gives the impression of an idyllic master slave relationship which is a distortion of the facts br White had not seen the film his statement was allegedly based on memos he received from two NAACP staff members Norma Jensen and Hope Spingarn who attended a press screening on November Jensen had written the film was so artistically beautiful that it is difficult to be provoked over the clich s but said it contained all the clich s in the book Spingarn listed several things she found objectionable from the film including the use of African American English Jim Hill Media stated that both Jensen and Spingarn were confused by the film s Reconstruction setting writing it was something that also confused other reviewers who from the tone of the film and the type of similar recent Hollywood movies assumed it must also be set during the time of slavery Based on the Jensen and Spingarn memos White released the official position of the NAACP in a telegram that was widely quoted in newspapers Bosley Crowther of The New York Times made a similar assumption writing that the movie was a travesty on the antebellum South br br As early as October a newspaper strip called Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br er Rabbit appeared in the United States and this production continued until There have also been episodes for the series produced for the Disney comic books worldwide in the U S Denmark and the Netherlands from the s up to Br er Fox and Br er Bear also appeared frequently in Disney s Big Bad Wolf stories although here Br er Bear was usually cast as an honest farmer and family man instead of an antagonist in his original appearances br The Splash Mountain log flume ride which opened at Disneyland in and at Tokyo Disneyland and Magic Kingdom in is based on the animated portions of Song of the South As with the film the ride had drawn controversy over the years due to the racial issues associated with the work Amid the George Floyd protests in Disney announced that they would retool the ride in Disneyland and Magic Kingdom to remove the Song of the South elements and replace them with a concept based on Disney s film The Princess and the Frog Disney stated that development of the project began in The New York Times reported that Disney executives had privately discussed removing the attraction s Song of the South theme for at least five years before putting into development the Princess and the Frog theme In July Disney announced that the new ride would be called
