May shortly before the novel won the Dutton Animal Book Award it was reported that Walt Disney Productions had obtained the film rights to it In spring development began on the project after Wolfgang Reitherman had read the original novel and decided that it would make for a good animated feature as one of his sons had once owned a pet fox years before The title was initially reported as The Fox and the Hounds but the filmmakers dropped the plural as the story began to focus more and more on the two leads Reitherman was the film s original director along with Art Stevens as codirector A power struggle between the two directors and coproducer Ron Miller broke out over key sections of the film with Miller supporting the younger Stevens Miller instructed Reitherman to surrender reins over to the junior personnel but Reitherman resisted due to a lack of trust in the young animators br In an earlier version of the film Chief was slated to die as he did in the novel However the scene was modified to have him survive with a broken leg Animator Ron Clements who had briefly transitioned into the story department protested Chief has to die The picture doesn t work if he just breaks his leg Copper doesn t have motivation to hate the fox Likewise younger members of the story team pleaded with Stevens to have him killed He countered Geez we never killed a main character in a Disney film and we re not starting now The younger crew members took the problem to upper management who would also back Stevens Ollie Johnston s test animation of Chief stomping around the house with his leg in a cast was eventually kept and Randy Cartwright reanimated the scene where Copper finds his body and had him animate his eyes opening and closing so the audience knew that he was not dead br Another fight erupted when Reitherman in thinking the film lacked a strong second act decided to add a musical sequence of two swooping cranes voiced by Phil Harris and Charo These characters would sing a silly song titled Scoobie Doobie Doobie Doo Let Your Body Turn to Goo to Tod after he was dropped in the forest Charo had recorded the song and several voice tracks which were storyboarded and live action reference footage was shot of her wearing a sweaty pink leotard However the scene was strongly disliked by studio personnel who felt the song was a distraction from the main plot with Stevens stating We can t let that sequence in the movie It s totally out of place He notified studio management and after many story conferences the scene was removed Reitherman later walked into his office slumped in a chair and said I dunno Art maybe this is a young man s medium He later moved on to undeveloped projects such as Catfish Bend br br br Animation br br By late Frank Thomas Ollie Johnston and Cliff Nordberg had completed their animation Thomas had animated scenes of Tod and Copper using dialogue Larry Clemmons had written and recorded with the child actors The film would mark the last one to have the involvement of Disney s Nine Old Men who had retired early during production and animation was turned over to the next generation of directors and animators which included John Lasseter John Musker Ron Clements Glen Keane Tim Burton Brad Bird Henry Selick Chris Buck Mike Gabriel and Mark Dindal all of whom would finalize the animation and complete the film s production These animators had moved through the in house animation training program and would play an important role in the Disney Renaissance of the s and s br However the transition between the old guard and the new resulted in arguments over how to handle the film Reitherman had his own ideas on the designs and layouts that should be used but the newer team backed Stevens Animator Don Bluth animated several scenes including of Widow Tweed milking her cow Abigail while his team worked on the rest of the sequence and when she fires at Amos automobile Nevertheless Bluth and the new animators felt that Reitherman was too stern and out of touch and on his nd birthday September Bluth along with Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy entered Ron Miller s office and they turned in their resignations Soon after more animators followed suit in turning in their resignations Though Bluth and his team had animated substantial scenes they asked not to receive screen credit br With those animators now gone Miller ordered all of the resigning animators off the studio lot by noon of that same day and would later push the film s release from Christmas to summer New animators were hired and promoted to fill the ranks To compensate for the lack of experience of the new animators much of the quality control would rely upon a network of veteran assistant animators Four years after production started the film was finished with approximately drawings painted cels and painted backgrounds making up the finished product A total of people including animators worked on the film br br br Casting br Early into production the principal characters such as Young Tod Young Copper Big Mama and Amos Slade had already been cast The supporting roles were filled by Disney voice regulars including Pat Buttram as

br br br Critical reception br br br Initial reviews br Vincent Canby of The New York Times claimed that the film breaks no new ground whatsoever while describing it as a pretty relentlessly cheery old fashioned sort of Disney cartoon feature chock full of bouncy songs of an upbeatness that is stickier than Krazy Glue and played by animals more anthropomorphic than the humans that occasionally appear He further commented that the film is rather overstuffed with whimsy and folksy dialogue It also possesses a climax that could very well scare the daylights out of the smaller tykes in the audience though all ends well Parents who don t relish chaperoning their tykes to see the movie but find they must anyway can take heart in the knowledge that the running time is minutes That s about as short as you can get these days Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times praised the animation but criticized the story for playing it too safe She acknowledged that the writers were protecting us from important stuff from rage from pain from loss By these lies done for our own good of course they also limit the growth that is possible David Ansen of Newsweek stated Adults may wince at some of the sticky sweet songs but the movie is not intended for grownups br Richard Corliss of Time magazine praised the film for its intelligent story about prejudice He argued that it shows that biased attitudes can poison even the deepest relationships and its bittersweet ending delivers a powerful and important moral message to audiences Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times also praised it saying For all of its familiar qualities this movie marks something of a departure for the Disney studio and its movement is in an interesting direction The Fox and the Hound is one of those relatively rare Disney animated features that contains a useful lesson for its younger audiences It s not just cute animals and frightening adventures and a happy ending it s also a rather thoughtful meditation on how society determines our behavior br br br Retrospective reviews br TV Guide gave the film four out of five stars saying The animation here is better than average veteran Disney animators Wolfgang Reitherman and Art Stevens supervised the talents of a new crop of artists that developed during a year program at the studio though not quite up to the quality of Disney Studios in its heyday Still this film has a lot of heart and is wonderful entertainment for both kids and their parents Listen for a number of favorites among the voices Michael Scheinfeld of Common Sense Media gave its quality a rating of out of stars stating It develops into a thoughtful examination of friendship and includes some mature themes especially loss br In The Animated Movie Guide Jerry Beck considered the film average though he praises the voice work of Pearl Bailey as Big Mama and the extreme dedication to detail shown by animator Glen Keane in crafting the fight scene between Copper Tod and the bear In his book The Disney Films Leonard Maltin also notes that that scene received great praise in the animation world However he felt the film relied too much on formula cuteness formula comedy relief and even formula characterizations Overall he considered it charming stating that it is warm and brimming with personable characters and that it approaches the old Disney magic at times Craig Butler from All Movie Guide stated that it was a warm and amusing if slightly dull entry in the Disney animated canon He also called it conventional and generally predictable with problems in pacing However he praised its climax and animation as well as the ending His final remark is that Two of the directors Richard Rich and Ted Berman would next direct The Black Cauldron a less successful but more ambitious project br Rob Humanick of Slant Magazine gave the film out of five stars noting that it was the transition point between the remaining original animators since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to the new generation saying that the results culled the best qualities of both groups and that The result is a work of both learned assured poise and triumphant freshman determination not far away in style or quality from other benchmark status works like the aforementioned Snow White or Pixar s Toy Story RL Shaffer of IGN wrote a rather mixed review claiming that it is just not as impressive as Disney s early work or their late s early s pictures James Kendrick of Q Network Film Desk stated that it is not one of the studio s best efforts but nonetheless it remains a fascinating product of an era of upheaval as well as a meaningful statement about the nature of prejudice Peter Canavense of Groucho Reviews stated that it is sweet but a bit dull noting that Overall the picture is good hearted and colorful with an ending that carries a nice touch of ambiguity about the tussle of nature and nurture John J Puccio of Movie Metropolis claimed that it is very sweet and no doubt a delight for children but I found it quite slow and tedious br The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received a approval rating with an average rating of based on reviews
