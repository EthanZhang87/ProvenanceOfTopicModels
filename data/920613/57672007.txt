The Mazda MX NA sold in Japan as the Eunos Roadster Y nosu R dosut and in North America as the Mazda MX Miata is the first generation of the Mazda MX manufactured from to Inspired by the post war era British sports cars the MX rejuvenated interest in roadsters after the demise of cars such as the MG B and Triumph Spitfire Since its debut the MX has won numerous automotive awards and has become the world s best selling sports car br br br Overview br The MX was unveiled at the Chicago Auto Show on February with a price tag of US equivalent to in The MX with production code NA was made available for delivery to buyers worldwide in the following dates May as a model in the US and Canada September in Japan and in Europe An optional hardtop was made available at the same time in sheet moulding compound SMC Demand initially outstripped production fueled by enthusiastic press reviews br In Japan the car was not badged as a Mazda as the company was in the process of launching different marques for deluxe models similar to Nissan s Infiniti Honda s Acura and Toyota s Lexus Instead the Mazda MX was sold as the Eunos Roadster and was joined by the MX AZ Eunos Presso based on Japanese Mazda dealerships The exterior dimensions and the engine displacement were also in compliance with Japanese Government compact car regulation br br The NA has a steel unitary body shell with a lightweight aluminium hood Overall dimensions are mm in in length mm in in width and mm in in height Without options the NA weighs only kg lb It has a drag coefficient of Cd Suspension is independent by double wishbones on all four wheels with anti roll bars front and rear Four wheel disc brakes ventilated at the front are behind alloy wheels with HR radial tires The base model came with stamped steel wheels from the then current Protege br br The original MX with standard manual transmission came with a L cu in DOHC inline four cylinder engine producing kW bhp at rpm and N m lbf ft of torque at rpm The engine employs an electronic fuel injection system using a vane type air flow meter and an electronic ignition system with a camshaft angle sensor instead of a distributor This engine codenamed B ZE RS was specifically designed for the MX and featured a lightened crankshaft flywheel and aluminium sump with cooling fins An MX with the optional automatic transmission had its L engine tuned to develop peak torque at lower rpm s Nm lbf ft at rpm to better mate with the automatic transmission gearing and torque requirements This tuning resulted in a lower peak power of kW bhp at rpm br The standard transmission was a speed manual derived from that used in the also rear wheel drive Mazda Luce The gear shift was the subject of close attention during development with engineers told to make it shift in as small a gear pattern as possible and with minimal effort In the American and Japanese markets a speed automatic transmission was also offered as well as an optional viscous limited slip differential on manual transmission cars To achieve a low introductory price and low weight true to Lotus add lightness philosophy applied on the Elan model the entry model was kept basic It had steel wheels no power brakes steering or windows and no stereo or air conditioning Power brakes steering stereo and air conditioning were added as standard equipment in later years and depending on market br Mazda reported that the NA would reach mph km h in seconds with a top speed of mph km h Japanese market Eunos models were limited to km h mph Car and Driver tested the NA for their September issue achieving a mph km h time of seconds and a top speed of mph km h with hardtop installed Motor Trend s July test gave a mph km h time of seconds The NA with an automatic transmission reached km h mph in seconds and had a top speed of km h mph br br In LE Limited Edition cars were produced This model featured red leather interior upgraded stereo Nardi shift knob Nardi steering wheel cruise control limited slip differential power windows power mirrors power steering air conditioning BBS wheels Bilstein shocks front and rear spoilers ABS brakes stainless sill plates and Harley style peanut tank door speaker trim All LE cars came in black br For the model year the first generation MX was freshened with the introduction of the more powerful cc L cu in BP ZE engine dual airbags placed in a redesigned dashboard the addition of a Mazda badge on the front fascia in the US and a Torsen limited slip differential in some markets The chassis was substantially braced to meet new side impact standards most visibly by adding a track bar between the seatbelt towers inside the car but also to the front and rear subframes Also and were the only years in which Mazda offered a light metallic blue paint Laguna Blue Mica making these cars desirable to some collectors also saw the introduction of the R package a sport themed package with Bilstein shocks stiffer sway bars retuned springs subtle front and rear underbody spoilers and a Torsen LSD Air conditioning was optional but the R package was not available with power steering leather or an automatic transmission It can also be identified by a red Miata badge on the rear instead of the usual black No body style changes were made however Halfway through the model year the hazard light button was changed to a black button with red symbol as opposed to the earlier red button with white symbol br The new cc L cu in engine produced kW bhp at rpm and N m lbf ft of torque at rpm which was then increased to kW bhp at rpm and N m lbf ft of torque at rpm for the model year The base weight increased to kg lb Performance was thus improved slightly because the additional weight was more than offset by the extra power In some markets such as Europe the L cu in engine continued to be available as a lower cost option but was detuned to kW bhp This lower powered model did not receive all the additional chassis bracing of the new L cu in Japanese and U S models offered an optional Torsen LSD which was far more durable than the previous viscous differential br br There were a number of trim levels and special editions available determined by local Mazda marketing departments In the US the base model was offered for US at launch and was very basic with manual windows steel wheels and
