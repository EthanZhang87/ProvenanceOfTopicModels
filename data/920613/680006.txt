the Indian jungle by wolves as his friends Bagheera the panther and Baloo the bear try to convince him to leave the jungle before the ruthless tiger Shere Khan arrives br The early versions of both the screenplay and the soundtrack followed Kipling s work more closely with a dramatic dark and sinister tone which Disney did not want in his family film leading to writer Bill Peet and songwriter

village Feeling betrayed Mowgli runs away Bagheera later finds Colonel Hathi s herd and seeks their help in finding Mowgli However unbeknownst to any of them Shere Khan has overheard this and now

However Shere Khan soon arrives and tries to kill Mowgli before Baloo intervenes Whilst Shere Khan attacks and nearly kills Baloo Mowgli ties a burning branch to Shere Khan s tail forcing him to run

br Digby Wolfe voiced Ziggy the fourth member of the vulture quartet Leo De Lyon Bill Skiles Pete Henderson and Hal Smith voiced King Louie s monkeys br br Walt Disney first considered making an animated version of Rudyard Kipling s collection of stories The Jungle Book in the late s In the early s after completing his work on The Sword in the Stone story artist Bill Peet proposed The Jungle Book as the studio s next animated feature seeing it as a great chance to develop some good animal characters Disney agreed and acquired the film rights to all thirteen Jungle Book stories from the estate of Alexander Korda who had produced the film adaptation by April after having spent the previous ten years in negotiations At that point Peet had written an early story treatment and developed the initial character designs Disney originally intended to closely follow Kipling s work planning to make a film that would be both naturalistic and fantastic suggestive of the compelling stag fight in Bambi br Peet created his treatment with little supervision as he had done with One Hundred and One Dalmatians and The Sword in the Stone He tried to make the story more linear since the novel was very episodic while preserving its ominous tone and adding more drama and suspense in particular Peet s story would start with wolves and Bagheera rescuing baby Mowgli from falling from a waterfall He also decided on Mowgli s journey from the jungle back to the Man Village as the film s central storyline One of the few major departures from Kipling s works was the character of Baloo whom Peet rewrote into a big playful buffoon of a bear with the role of Mowgli s serious minded mentor given to Bagheera Peet created an original character for the film King Louie the leader of the Bandar log who would kidnap Mowgli and try to get him to teach them how to make fire and rebuild the ancient city Louie was also to show Mowgli the treasure under the ruins a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book which would serve as a setup for the film s climax After Mowgli had arrived to the Man Village he would get into an argument with the local hunter Buldeo which would cause Mowgli to return to the jungle with a torch and use it to scare those who attacked or mocked him through the journey and confront Shere Khan before being dragged to the ancient city by Buldeo in search for the treasure After taking some of the treasures Buldeo would attempt to burn the jungle to avoid the threat of Shere Khan only for the tiger to attack and kill him before being killed by Mowgli with Buldeo s rifle Because of his actions Mowgli would be hailed as a hero in both the jungle and the village and declared the first human member of the wolves council br After the box office underperformance of The Sword in the Stone Walt Disney decided to get more involved in the story development of The Jungle Book than he had been with the past two films Upon reviewing the storyboards Disney felt that Peet s approach was too dark and depressing and held a meeting insisting on making the story lighter and more aimed at the family demographic Peet who had been working on his treatment for over a year by then refused resulting in a long argument between him and Disney On January Peet left the studio after another fight with Disney over the preliminary recording for Bagheera s voice as well as Disney insulting him claiming that he should see Mary Poppins for real entertainment Peet would later admit in his autobiography that he was glad he didn t insult back at Disney over the film and left the studio when he did knowing that Disney would die two years after he left br br After Peet s departure Disney assigned Larry Clemmons as his new writer and one of the four story men for the film giving Clemmons a copy of Kipling s book and telling him The first thing I want you to do is not to read it Clemmons still looked at the novel and thought it was too disjointed and without continuity needing adaptations to fit a film script Clemmons wanted to start in medias res with some flashbacks afterward but then Disney said to focus on doing the storyline more straight Let s do the meat of the picture Let s establish the characters Let s have fun with it br Although most of Peet s work was discarded the personalities of the characters remained in the final film This was because Disney felt that the story should be kept simple and the characters should drive the story Disney took an active role in the story meetings acting out each role and helping to explore the emotions of the characters helping create gags and developing emotional sequences The Sherman Brothers re imagined Peet s darker and more sinister version of King Louie as a more comedic character based around jazz and swing music As Richard M Sherman recalled our discussion at the time was He s an ape what does an ape do Swings in a tree The jazz is swing music and a guy literally swings if he s an ape Clemmons also created the human girl with whom Mowgli falls in love as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle Clemmons would write a rough script with an outline for most sequences The story artists then discussed how to fill the scenes including the comedic gags to employ The script also tried to incorporate how the voice actors molded their characters and interacted with each other The Jungle Book also marked the last animated film to have Disney s personal touches before his death on December br br Walt Disney wanted to bring in more well known performers to voice the key characters of The Jungle Book which was a rarity in his past works All the celebrities cast in the film had inspired the animators in creating the characters and helped to shape their personalities The studio held many auditions for the role of Baloo initially searching for an Ed Wynn esque voice The animators also tried out exchange students from India to see if they could get a voice with an indigenous quality but the idea did not work out Disney eventually suggested Phil Harris after meeting him at a benefit in Palm Springs much to the surprise of the animation staff who could not imagine Harris who was a comedian as Kipling s character Harris nearly turned down the role after doing a test recording as he could not see himself as the character but reconsidered after the filmmakers allowed him to perform the way that felt the most comfortable to him Wolfgang Reitherman said when they told Harris not to be a bear but to be Phil Harris he got in front of the microphone and tore that thing apart The casting of Harris prompted the story artists to expand the role of Baloo from an episodic part to one of the film s main characters Many of Baloo s lines were improvised by Harris br Disney initially considered Louis Armstrong for the role of King Louie according to Richard M Sherman the idea was discarded after one of the writers said that NAACP is going to jump all over it having a black man playing an ape it would be politically terrible That was the last thing on our minds nothing we d ever thought of so we said okay we ll think of someone else After Phil Harris was cast as Baloo Disneyland Records president Jimmy Johnson suggested Disney to get Louis Prima whom he thought to be great as a foil for Harris character br Disney had vultures bearing a physical and vocal resemblance to The Beatles including the signature mop top haircut It was also planned to have the members of the band to both voice the characters and sing their song That s What Friends Are For However at the time The Beatles John Lennon refused to work on animated films which led to the idea being discarded The casting of the vultures still brought a British Invasion musician Chad Stuart of the duo Chad Jeremy In earlier drafts of the scene the vultures had a near sighted rhinoceros friend named Rocky who was to be voiced by Frank Fontaine but Disney decided to cut the character feeling that the film already had enough action with the monkeys and vultures br Child actor David Bailey was originally cast as Mowgli but during the film s production he hit puberty and his voice changed As a result Wolfgang Reitherman replaced him with his son Bruce who had just voiced Christopher Robin in Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree The animators also shot a live action footage of Bruce Reitherman as a guide for the character s animation performance Child actress Darlene Carr was going around singing in the studio when composers Sherman Brothers asked her to record a demo of My Own Home Carr s performance impressed Disney enough for him to cast her as the role of the human girl Clint Howard was cast as Hathi Jr br Early in the film s development Bill Peet suggested Howard Morris for the role of Bagheera but Disney did not approve of the choice with Wolfgang Reitherman and other animators preferring either Karl Swenson or Sebastian Cabot Cabot was the final choice Several of the studio s voice regulars were cast in the film including Sterling Holloway as Kaa J Pat O Malley as both Colonel Hathi and Buzzie the Vulture and Verna Felton as Winifred br br Animation on The Jungle Book commenced on June While many of the later Disney feature films had animators being responsible for single characters in The Jungle Book the animators were in charge of whole sequences since many have characters interacting with one another The animation was done by xerography with character design led by Ken Anderson employing rough artistic edges in contrast to the round animals seen in productions such as Dumbo br Anderson also decided to make Shere Khan resemble his voice actor George Sanders Backgrounds were hand painted with an exception of the waterfall mostly consisting of footage of the Angel Falls and sometimes scenery was used in both foreground and bottom to create a notion of depth One of Reitherman s trademarks was repurposing animation from previous animated films including his For example animation of the wolf cubs were redrawn from the dalmatian puppies in One Hundred and One Dalmatians Animator Milt Kahl based Bagheera and Shere Khan s movements on live action felines which he saw in two Disney productions A Tiger Walks and the True Life Adventure film Jungle Cat br Baloo was also based on footage of bears even incorporating the animal s penchant for scratching Since Kaa has no limbs his design received big expressive eyes and parts of Kaa s body did the action that normally would be done with hands The monkeys dance during I Wan na Be Like You was partially inspired by a performance Louis Prima did with his band on a Las Vegas soundstage that convinced Disney to cast him br br The film s score was composed by George Bruns and orchestrated by Walter Sheets Two of the cues were reused from previous Disney films the scene where Mowgli wakes up after escaping King Louie used one of Bruns themes for Sleeping Beauty and the scene where Bagheera gives a eulogy to Baloo when he mistakenly thinks the bear was killed by Shere Khan used Paul J Smith s organ score from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs br The score features six original songs five by the Sherman Brothers and one by Terry Gilkyson Longtime Disney collaborator Gilkyson was the first songwriter to bring several complete songs that followed the book closely but Walt Disney felt that his efforts were too dark The only piece of Gilkyson s work which survived to the final film was his upbeat tune The Bare Necessities which was liked by the rest of the film crew The Sherman Brothers were then brought in to do a complete rewrite Disney asked the siblings if they had read Kipling s book and they replied that they had done so a long long time ago and that they had also seen the version by Alexander Korda Disney said the nice mysterious heavy stuff from both works was not what he aimed for instead going for a lightness a Disney touch Disney frequently brought the composers to the storyline sessions He asked them to find scary places and write fun songs for their compositions that fit in with the story and advanced the plot instead of being interruptive br br The Jungle Book premiered at the Grauman s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on October ten months after Walt Disney s death The premiere served as a fundraiser for the Los Angeles Zoo which had been founded the year before By December The Jungle Book was

Book received positive reviews upon release undoubtedly influenced by a nostalgic reaction to the death of Walt Disney Time magazine noted the film strayed far from the Kipling stories but n evertheless the result is thoroughly delightful it is the happiest possible way to remember Walt Disney Howard Thompson of The New York Times praised the film as simple uncluttered straight forward fun as put together by the director Wolfgang Reitherman four screen writers and the usual small army of technicians Using some lovely exotic pastel backgrounds and a nice clutch of tunes the picture unfolds like an intelligent comic strip fairy tale Richard Schickel reviewing for Life magazine referred to it as the best thing of its kind since Dumbo another short bright unscary and blessedly uncultivated cartoon Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote the film was really really good Disney indeed and nobody needs to say a great deal more Arthur D Murphy of Variety gave the film a favorable review while noting that the story development is restrained and that younger audiences may squirm at times The song The Bare Necessities was nominated for Best Original Song at the th Academy Awards losing to Talk to the Animals from Doctor Dolittle Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president Gregory Peck lobbied extensively for the film to be nominated for Best Picture but was unsuccessful br Retrospective reviews were also positive with the film s animation characters and music receiving much praise throughout the years On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film received an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The site s critical consensus reads With expressive animation fun characters and catchy songs The Jungle Book endures as a crowd pleasing Disney classic In when the film had its last theatrical re release Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that The Jungle Book isn t a classic Walt Disney film on the order of say Cinderella or Pinocchio but it s one of Disney s liveliest and funniest Charles Solomon reviewing for the Los Angeles Times thought the film s animators was near the height of their talents and the resulting film remains a high spirited romp that will delight children and parents weary of action films with body counts that exceed their box office grosses In Empire described the film as one that gets pretty much everything right noting that the vibrant animation and catchy songs overcame the plot deficiencies br Colin Greenland reviewed The Jungle Book for Imagine magazine and stated that the last film the old boy worked on himself and I reckon the last good animated feature in his traditional mode not least because of some rather jolly jazz which legend has it Walt himself resisted and was added after his death br br There has been criticism of the portrayal of King Louie who some have viewed as a racist caricature of African Americans However this was not the filmmakers intention as the character and mannerisms of King Louie were largely based on his voice actor Louis Prima a well known Italian American jazz musician and performer who would have been instantly recognizable to audiences during the late s While Louis Armstrong was briefly considered for the part the filmmakers quickly steered away from that direction upon realizing the racist implications br In Disney added disclaimers warning of outdated cultural depictions at the start of the film on Disney In January Disney removed access to the film for child profiles in Disney and strengthened the warning message to read This program includes negative depictions and or mistreatment of people or cultures These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now Rather than remove this content we want to acknowledge its harmful impact learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together br br Since its original release in The Jungle Book has been widely acclaimed by the animation industry with animators such as Brad Bird Andreas Deja Glen Keane and Sergio Pablos citing the film to be their inspiration for entering the business Eric Goldberg also declared that the film boasts possibly the best character animation a studio has ever done The character design and art direction of The Jungle Book heavily influenced the animators of Aladdin The Lion King Tarzan and Lilo Stitch in creating animal characters for each of these films Elements of The Jungle Book were recycled in the later Disney feature film Robin Hood such as Baloo being inspiration for Little John who not only was a bear but also voiced by Phil Harris in particular the dance sequence between Baloo and King Louie was rotoscoped for Little John and Lady Cluck s dance br In Jimmy Johnson approached Larry Clemmons to write a sequel to The Jungle Book for a story telling records the album titled More Jungle Book Further Adventures Of Baloo And Mowgli was released by Disneyland Records the following year with Phil Harris and Louis Prima reprising their film roles In DisneyToon Studios released a theatrical sequel to the original film The Jungle Book screenwriter Robert Reece also pitched the idea of a third film to Disney executives in but the project never materialized br In a live action sketch titled The Wonderful World of Ernie from Morecambe and Wise parodied I Wan na Be Like You The Monkey Song by doing a full reenactment of the scene with sets and costumes and lip synching to the song s original recording including the characters spoken dialogue in the middle of the song The sketch starred Danny Rolnick as Mowgli Derek Griffiths as Bagheera Eric Morecambe as Baloo and Ernie Wise as King Louie br Many characters appear in the animated series TaleSpin Between and the TV series Jungle Cubs told the stories of Baloo Hahti Bagheera Louie Kaa and Shere Khan when they were children Disney later made a live action adaptation of the film which was more of a realistic action adventure film with somewhat more adult themes The film released in differs even more from the book than its animated counterpart but was still a box office success In Disney released a direct to video film entitled The Jungle Book Mowgli s Story A new live action version of The Jungle Book was released by Disney in which even reused most of the songs of the
