Cab over also known as cab over engine COE cab forward or flat face U S flat nose Canada or forward control UK is a body style of truck bus or van that has a vertical front flat face or a semi hood with the cab of the truck sitting above or forward of the front axle This contrasts with a conventional truck where the engine is mounted in front of the driver br This truck configuration is currently common among European and Asian truck manufacturers European regulations set restrictions for both the total length and the length of the load area which allow a cab length of m ft in in combination with the maximum load area length This allows a sleeper cab with a narrow bunk or a bonneted hooded day cab Nonetheless no manufacturer in Europe produces such day cabs with bonnets The last manufacturer of a conventional truck in Europe Scania stopped production in due to a decline in sales to less than units worldwide with European sales declining by and sales in South America by within one decade In addition Asian regulations are typically stricter and the relatively shorter journey distances allow trucks to forgo sleepers to save even more length br br Cabover trucks are widely used in the United States for refuse collection terminal tractors and other vocational applications requiring a tight turning radius or frequent ingress egress by the driver Autocar the oldest surviving motor vehicle manufacturer in America produces primarily cabover trucks Although cabover trucks were popular among U S heavy truckers and trucking companies during the s because of strict length laws in many states when those length laws were repealed most heavy truck makers moved to other body styles One of the reasons is the Federal Bridge Formula which is unique to the US and encourages spreading out the load If axle distances are too tight the maximum load allowance is reduced For COEs operated at maximum weight in the US this required an axle directly behind the front bumper This cab design caused an awkward climb into the cab for the driver forcing them to climb up behind the front wheel then moving to the front and into the cab European or Chinese or Japanese truckers enter their cab in a straight fashion with handrails left and right br Cabovers are also very popular in the US s light and medium duty truck segment where compact size is required for urban mobility without sacrificing payload Hino a Toyota subsidiary Isuzu and Mitsubishi Fuso models are a regular sight for this reason American company Paccar which owns the Kenworth and Peterbilt brands still manufactures traditional cab over engine designs for the Australian and South African markets where length restrictions still make them advantageous br In Australia both American cab over axle and European Japanese Chinese cab forward of axle types as well as the conventional type are common Cab over engine types dominate urban and light duty use with conventional trucks predominating in remote and off road areas Both types are common for highway use br br br History br br The first truck in the United States was built by Autocar in using a format then called engine under the seat and was available with optional or horsepower or kilowatts motors Although early Autocar trucks were not exactly cab over since the truck did not have a cab per se they were the fore runners to COEs The Sternberg company of Wisconsin produced cab over trucks as early as though by only their seven ton model was a cab over They reintroduced the cab over layout in with their Camel Back model which allowed the cab to be tilted to access the engine br The introduction of the first modern cab over layout in the United States is credited to industrial designer Viktor Schreckengost who with engineer Ray Spiller designed a cab over truck for the White Motor Company in Schreckengost was later joined by other designers such as Raymond Loewy who designed the Metro series of vans and trucks for International Harvester The bodies for these vehicles were initially produced by the Metropolitan Body Company MBC The company produced a wide variety of truck and commercial bodies for several vehicle manufacturers such as Chevrolet Ford Dodge Bros and International Harvester until when they were purchased by the latter MBC was instrumental in the development of COE route delivery bodies in the s br The laws of the time limited overall truck length to feet m on highways Setting the cab over the engine and front axle shaved several feet off the length of the tractor feet which could then be added to the length of the trailer while keeping the dimensions of the entire truck within the permissible limit Schreckengost patented the design in br Autocar reintroduced the engine under the seat format with their Model U in which became a staple of U S roads and the U S military through World War II and well into the s br White Freightliner introduced its first tilting cab over design in which allowed the entire cab to tilt forward for access to the engine br br br Design aspects br br In Class tractors using the US designation the cab over design allows the vehicle s wheelbase to be shorter than in the conventional arrangement wherein the engine is placed in front of the cab covered by a horizontal or sloping hood that opens to allow engine access Its shorter wheelbase allows cab over semi trucks to have a shorter overall length thereby allowing for longer trailers to be used For light and medium duty solid or rigid axle trucks the cab over design requires less length for the cab and engine in a given wheelbase and therefore allows a greater length for the truck body or load area br In both class tractors and light and medium duty vocational trucks the cab over engine design gives the COE model an advantage in maneuverability over a conventional model And since COEs are generally lighter than conventionals they can often haul heavier loads given equal gross vehicle weight rating GVWRs and gross combination weight rating GCWRs Despite the COE designs being smaller in general over the road tractors can still be fully equipped with single or bunk beds Also lack of a hood gives better visibility to the driver and a tighter turning radius and significantly reduces the forward blind spots br One critique is that the shorter wheelbase in the COE semi trucks gives a rougher ride than those with conventional cabs as the driver s seat is above the front axle In the s COEs used to be noisier because the engine is directly below This was an important consideration back then Interior noise in the cab was between and dB A creating an unhealthy work environment As of US long distance trucks provide an interior noise level of dB A at highway speed while European long distance trucks all built as a COE provide a level of dB A br Because of their flat front design early COE semi trucks had significantly worse aerodynamics than conventional tractors Modern cab over designs in both semi trucks and light and medium duty models have improved aerodynamics significantly over early models but often still have higher drag coefficients than their modern conventional design counterparts br Although the tilting cab gives comparatively unobstructed access to the engine its deployment causes unsecured items in the cab and sleeper if equipped to fall onto the windshield or under the instrument panel Vehicles without a tilting cab will usually be equipped with removable floor panels through which mechanics can access and service the engine In Europe Mercedes Benz was the last manufacturer to use such panels instead of a tilting cab with the last non tilting cabs produced well into br br br Safety aspects br br Truck occupant safety depends on survival space within the cab with rollover being the most significant heavy truck accident causing occupant casualties br In the s when many truck cabs were still wooden structures knowledge about the most common accidents was already established and led to the first mechanized truck cab crash test in performed by Volvo The test became a Swedish standard and was adopted by the European Community in simplified form as ECE R in During the early s the safest place for a truck driver was a European truck usually a cabover br Motor placement before or under the cab does not have much influence on the results of rollovers Behind the danger of a rollover heavy truck on heavy truck crashes are the second most relevant reason for occupant casualties With a s US conventional the result of such a crash was Frame front axle and wheels would go under the truck in front while the motor got pushed into the cab which was very small in a s conventional br Both conventionals and cabovers need structural protection against rollovers and special protection against massive objects at the height of another truck body The survival space should be able to move backward on the frame br In military use the COE design increases the chance of crew injury or death in the event of running over a landmine This is because the tire that detonates the mine is directly below beside the driver br
