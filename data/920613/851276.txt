Peterbilt Motors Company is an American truck manufacturer Established in from the acquisition of Fageol Truck and Motor Company Peterbilt specializes in the production of heavy duty Class and medium duty Classes commercial vehicles The namesake of company founder T A Al Peterman Peterbilt has operated as part of PACCAR since operating alongside sister division Kenworth Truck Company though serving as one of the longest running marketplace rivalries in American truck manufacturing br Peterbilt trucks are identified by a large red oval brand emblem in use since The company also uses a bird style hood ornament on conventional cab trucks in use since br Headquartered in Denton Texas the company also manufactures trucks at PACCAR facilities in Sainte Th r se Quebec Canada and Mexicali Mexico br br br History br br br Background br In the first third of the th century transportation in the lumber industry remained time consuming as logs were primarily transported by steam tractors or horse teams T A Peterman was a lumberman located in Tacoma Washington seeking to modernize the transportation of logs transporting them faster and more efficiently to lumber mills to manufacture plywood br In Peterman acquired acres of forestland in Morton Washington instead of using railroads he built roads and acquired a fleet of trucks purchasing White Motor Company trucks surplused by the U S Army For logging use the former military vehicles underwent several refurbishments and modifications along with upgrades to their durability the trucks underwent a degree of modernization notably replacing hand cranks with electric starters Safety changes included the addition of air brakes and air cooled finned brake drums br On a business trip in San Francisco Peterman learned that Fageol Truck and Motor Company was to be sold Seeking an opportunity to expand into new vehicle production he acquired Fageol from Sterling Motor Company for receiving the acre Fageol plant in Oakland California its tooling and parts inventory the purchase was completed in br br br s br br In the Fageol plant in Oakland opened for business as Peterbilt Motors Company As part of the design process Peterman and his company engineers sought input from truck owners and drivers on how to develop trucks initially planning to develop chain drive trucks for the logging industry the company transitioned towards vehicles intended towards highway freight transport In April Peterbilt released its first vehicles for public sale the single axle Model chain drive and the tandem axle Model shaft drive both vehicles were offered with either gasoline or diesel engines The and were equipped with an all steel cab trimmed with plywood sourced from Peterman owned lumber mills In a tradition that would last for the next years the company would designate single rear axle trucks with model numbers starting with tandem rear axle trucks started with br Through the end of the year Peterbilt produced vehicles the first Peterbilt was a fire truck chassis built for Centerville now Fremont California For production increased to vehicles To supplement its revenue Peterbilt continued its practice of servicing and refurbishing trucks from all manufacturers br For Peterbilt created the heavier duty Model initially developed for the logging industry the was re purposed for military production for World War II In the company developed its first cab over engine COE truck which was derived from the The vehicle was a half cab design with a full deck chassis br In production was increased as Peterbilt secured a contract to supply military trucks In November T A Peterman died from cancer at the age of leaving the company to his wife Ida br In the company resumed production of civilian vehicles to increase payloads Peterbilt introduced aluminum built cabs reducing the weight of the truck br During Ida Peterman sold Peterbilt Motors Company to a group of company managers and investors for while the investors received the company assets Peterman retained ownership of the company real estate br br In the company released a second generation of trucks replacing the with the all new Model The Iron Nose conventional was distinguished by its tall narrow grille with vertical grille shutters and cycle style fenders a design that remains in use today on some Peterbilt conventionals The first mass produced COE by Peterbilt the Bubble Nose COE relocated the cab of the conventional above the front axle but still received a short hood br br br s br br During the early s Peterbilt developed the dromedary cargo system a longer wheelbase truck typically a COE was configured to transport a auxiliary cargo system placed between the cab and trailer br In Peterbilt introduced its current brand emblem switching from a rectangular border to the current red oval br In the underwent a redesign becoming the Model Narrow nose conventional the grille was redesigned converting to horizontal grille shutters A COE was introduced introducing a larger wider cab design sharing only the doors with the conventional The shorter hood Model was heavier duty intended for vocational applications br In following a decline in truck sales Ida Peterman the owner of the company real estate announced to company owners her plans to redevelop the factory site as a shopping center Rather than take on the large investment of developing a new factory the investment group chose to sell Peterbilt Motors Company in June to Pacific Car and Foundry a Seattle based company that specialized in production of railroad freight cars the company had acquired Kenworth in The new owners of Peterbilt began the relocation of the company keeping it in the San Francisco Bay Area In construction commenced on a square foot facility in Newark California br br For the COE was replaced by the COE While externally similar though upgrading to quad headlamps in a major change the new design introduced a tilting cab to allow better access to the engine br br br s br br In August the first Peterbilt trucks were assembled by the Newark California factory production increased to vehicles for Coinciding with the introduction of the new factory Peterbilt debuted a redesigned Unilite cab for its conventional trucks distinguished by larger windows and a redesigned interior including an all new instrument panel In an organizational change Pacific Car changed its ownership status of Peterbilt converting it from a wholly owned subsidiary to a division within the company making it the sister company of marketplace rival Kenworth a division since br In Peterbilt introduced the Model largely replacing the which remained in production The first Peterbilt conventional with a tilting hood the replaced a fixed radiator and grille shutters with a grille surround attached to the aluminum hood a fiberglass hood was added as an option in Serving partially as a grab handle the Peterbilt bird hood ornament made its debut a feature remaining in current production nearly unchanged br In the company to expand its model line beyond highway tractors reintroducing heavy duty trucks as part of its model line Above the Model the Model was a x truck primarily for off road construction use br In Peterbilt introduced the Model highway tractor Similar in design to the the also used a tilting hood but was fitted with a larger grille to accommodate larger diesel engines br In Peterbilt expanded its production capability opening a facility in Madison Tennessee suburban Nashville Along with the ability to meet additional product demand the location was chosen to serve customers closer to the East Coast As part of a revision to the cab design the COE adopted the name Pacemaker br br br s br br In the Model was introduced gradually replacing the remaining until Intended for vocational use the was the first Peterbilt designed with an angled fiberglass hood the was similar in configuration designed with a larger grille Developed in a joint venture with Kenworth Peterbilt released the CB a low cab COE developed nearly exclusively for refuse transport br At the beginning of Pacific Car and Foundry intending to exit steel manufacturing introduced its current name PACCAR The same year Peterbilt redesigned the cab for its conventionals replacing the Unilite cab with the series cab Named for square inches of windshield glass the new design was taller with redesigned doors an all new interior and increased window space Designed for the same applications for the slightly larger the Model x was designed with a set back front axle placed nearly below the cab For testing the company developed a prototype vehicle powered by a jet turbine engine the design was not placed into production br In the Model was introduced as a construction oriented variant of the using its wider grille replacing the and heavy duty versions of the production of the Madison facility was doubled allowing the company to deliver vehicles yearly In a set back front axle was added to the br In Peterbilt expanded its manufacturing base a second time introducing Peterbilt Canada in Sainte Th r se Quebec Greater Montreal the facility began production of the CB sold by Kenworth as the Hustler Sized between the and the the was another heavy duty truck developed primarily for off road use The COE underwent a model revision becoming the H high mounted cab to accommodate larger engines br After a year model run the was retired for Replaced by the and as the Peterbilt highway tractor over a decade earlier the had continued production as a heavy duty truck built primarily for vocational use in the early s its cycle style fenders were replaced by flat steel fenders The narrow hood was also retired as the larger grille was better suited to the cooling needs of newer diesel engines br In Peterbilt assembled its th vehicle a long hood Model The model line underwent minor revisions as the cab received a revised dashboard and an optional inch sleeper cab with walk through entry a first for the model line br For the CB was replaced by the Model Again shared with Kenworth the was a new generation of the low cab COE model line br br By Peterbilt began to revise its model nomenclature phasing out separate designations for single rear axle trucks all trucks began to use model numbers starting with regardless of drive configuration br br br s br br In the Model was discontinued largely replaced by the smaller and To expand the vocationally oriented model family a lighter weight highway tractor the first Peterbilt highway truck with a sloped nose was added to the model line the H was offered with a straight hood In Peterbilt introduced the Model the largest vehicle ever designed by the company the conventional x was exclusively for off road use Only s were assembled one in and one in Peterbilt opened its third manufacturing facility in the United States located in Denton Texas northern Dallas Fort Worth suburbs the company opened an acre square foot assembly facility br In the Madison facility began assembly of the Model COE Replacing the H the was the first completely new COE from Peterbilt in years Distinguished by its curved piece windshield and three windshield wipers a piece wiper configuration was optional the was designed with a larger more aerodynamic cab and a larger more functional interior Several axle configurations were offered including set back front axles twin steer configurations and all wheel drive In total six cab configurations were offered ranging from to inches in length br In Peterbilt commenced a series of massive changes within both the company and its product line After years assembly operations ended at the Newark facility as the company began production consolidation in Denton at the time Newark retained its corporate headquarters and engineering operations Commencing a transition of the entire Peterbilt model line the company revised its vocational lineup as the replaced the and the served as a successor to the While trailing other manufacturers by several years Peterbilt began offering raised roof sleeper cabs as an option for the br For the company introduced two different conventional highway tractors the Model and the Model While more conservative than the design of the Kenworth T the used a sloped hood angled further than the a standard set back front axle and a wraparound front bumper integrated with the front fenders later including composite lens headlamps Replacing the long running the served as the standard Class highway tractor sharing the series cab with the the was distinguished by its redesigned headlamp clusters and horizontally mounted windshield wipers also used on the The Model was redesigned becoming the Model no longer shared with Kenworth the allowed the driver to drive in a standing position For the first time Peterbilt entered the medium duty Class market introducing the Mid Ranger low cab COE Produced in Brazil using a MAN G cab a wider version of the Volkswagen LT the Mid Ranger was fitted with American drivetrain components PACCAR marketed the vehicle through both Kenworth and Peterbilt br br In Peterbilt introduced a second Class COE the Model aerodynamically enhanced highway tractor Sharing its doors and internal structure with the the was rebodied to maximize both aerodynamics and fuel economy the three piece windshield was replaced by a pointed center design Designed as part of the cab the roof fairing extended forward of the windshield below the windshield an upward tilting shroud included the grille While the did not use a set back front axle the design included a wraparound front bumper skirted body sides were available as an option Despite its COE configuration overcoming an inherently massive frontal area the aerodynamic enhancements of the achieved over mpg in real world testing br br br s br br In Peterbilt ended all operations in Newark relocating its corporate and engineering headquarters to Denton alongside its primary manufacturing operations Coinciding with the consolidation the company expanded production at the Denton facility br In the Model COE ended production with Peterbilt focusing production on the more mainstream Alongside declining overall demand for COEs the controversial exterior design of the had seen a poor market response earning nicknames football helmet or Darth Vader among less appropriate ones br In the company closed Peterbilt Canada the Sainte Th r se facility had been plagued by multiple strikes and struggled with efficiency in comparison to the Denton and Madison facilities In PACCAR chose to redevelop its Canadian operations demolishing the facility in to rebuild an all new assembly facility in The Model was introduced as a shorter length version of the a inch and inch version were offered the latter eventually replacing the br In Peterbilt introduced the Model COE a medium duty class low cab COE Replacing the Mid Ranger the was derived from the DAF LF coinciding with the PACCAR acquisition of Dutch manufacturer DAF as with the Mid Ranger the design was adapted to an American sourced powertrain br br In the Model was introduced serving as the indirect successor to the alongside the Completely unrelated to the namesake heavy duty truck the

vocational trucks and the to Sainte Th r se br In the Model ended production following years of declining sales of COEs the became the final cabover model line sold in North America leaving only the Freightliner Argosy itself ending North American sales a year later As a running change during production the doors of the series cab were revised distinguished with the deletion of the vent windows and redesigned door handles the side window brackets were redesigned and relocated from the door to the body As a more direct successor to the the Model combined the aerodynamic hood of the with the traditional series cab The Model was introduced as a second medium duty conventional sized in the Class range the introduced a scaled down version of the hood from the br In the medium duty product line was expanded further Alongside the Class Model Peterbilt introduced its smallest ever conventional the Class Model the latter not requiring a CDL to operate The same year the company released its first diesel electric hybrid vehicle introducing and hybrids Serving as the successor to the and the and were introduced serving as heavy duty Class trucks along with vocationally oriented configurations the model line is also offered as a tractor br In the company withdrew the medium duty COEs as second party equipment manufacturers found difficulties adapting to its European based design After a year production run the Model was retired replaced by the Model Sharing its cab with the the was designed with a longer hood the longest ever Peterbilt conventional upgraded headlamps
