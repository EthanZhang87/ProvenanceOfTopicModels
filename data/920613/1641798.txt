Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage is an attraction in the Tomorrowland area of Disneyland Park in Anaheim California It opened on June Based on the characters and settings of the Disney Pixar film Finding Nemo it is a re theming of the classic Submarine Voyage attraction that operated from to br br br History br br br The original Submarine Voyage built in as part of the new Tomorrowland was loosely based on the USS Nautilus the first nuclear powered submarine and its voyage to the North Pole in On July it was announced that the ride would be closed on September and that it would reopen with a new theme by br On its final day of operation Imagineer Tony Baxter told then Disneyland president Paul Pressler This is one of the worst days of my life Baxter was one of many Imagineers who campaigned to bring the attraction back with a new theme br One of the first attempts to resurrect the subs was to create an attraction based on Disney s animated film Atlantis The Lost Empire A mock up was built to test the concept but when the film failed at the box office those plans were shelved The next year an attempt was made to re theme the attraction on Disney s animated film Treasure Planet but it too was a commercial failure A theme based on Disney s animated film The Little Mermaid was also briefly considered During this time the lagoon remained as scenery At one point Disneyland executives considered removing the submarines feeling they occupied too much of the park s storage space Imagineering creative chief Marty Sklar hired a naval engineering firm to inspect the subs and they determined they had to years of life left in them saving them from destruction br The special effects team at Walt Disney Imagineering eventually developed new projection technology and around the same time the Pixar animated film Finding Nemo was in development which had potential for a Submarine Voyage re theme Matt Ouimet became president of Disneyland Resort in and in there was new activity in the Submarine lagoon One of the original eight subs was moored at the old Submarine Voyage dock for inspection by Imagineering Rumors quickly spread over the Internet that an attraction based on Finding Nemo would replace Submarine Voyage The subs were tested to see if new animated show scenes could be visible from their portholes A mock up of the new technology was created and a presentation was staged for Ouimet In spite of the enormous price tag Ouimet was impressed and the Finding Nemo theme for the Submarine Voyage was green lighted It was the first major theme park project for Bob Iger who became CEO of The Walt Disney Company in and the first major project for John Lasseter executive producer of Finding Nemo and then chief creative officer of Pixar and Disney Animation in his role as Principal Creative Advisor for Imagineering br On July two days before the th Anniversary of Disneyland the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage was officially announced at the new Turtle Talk with Crush attraction at Disney California Adventure by then Walt Disney Parks and Resorts President Jay Rasulo br For the attraction the Imagineers used more than tons of recycled crushed glass to paint the lagoon s coral and rockwork They also created more than colors for the lagoon area such as Yamber a cross between yam and amber Mango Mud Toast Blue Feint barely blue Aqua Jazz Swamp dark green amber Danger Red Burning Coal Split Pea Earth Phantom and Peritwinkle The submarines were also converted from diesel fuel to electric power br In Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage received an award for outstanding achievement from the Themed Entertainment Association br On January the attraction closed and the lagoon drained for extended refurbishment to make improvements to the rockwork and coral It reopened on September br Although Disneyland reopened on April from its closure due to the COVID pandemic the attraction remained temporarily closed It reopened on July During its closure the lagoon was drained and the attraction was refurbished with fresh paint new coral kelp and seaweed and received enhanced special effects and lighting A figure of Hank from the Finding Nemo sequel Finding Dory was also placed atop a rock in the lagoon br br br Voyage br br At the attraction s entrance guests enter the institute of Nautical Exploration and Marine Observation NEMO Three seagulls perched on a nearby buoy cry out Mine Mine Mine every few moments Guests board one of NEMO s eight yellow research submarines and set out in search of an active underwater volcano Through their portholes guests view a colorful underwater environment One of the first things guests see is Darla the niece of dentist P Sherman in Finding Nemo freediving amid the coral holding a plastic bag with fish she has captured br As the journey continues guests see a giant sea bass swimming through a seaweed forest The submarines then enter the ruins of an ancient civilization which are being explored by P Sherman who is scuba diving Among the ruins lies two gigantic tiki heads embedded in the ocean floor The subs then enter a coral reef with many bright reflective colors Giant clams slowly open and close as the submarines pass The captain commands the sub to dive much deeper to avoid a surface storm ahead br At this point the submarine travels through a waterfall and enters the hidden ride building where guests find themselves apparently moving through underwater caverns The captain announces that due to advancements in marine technology they can use sonar hydrophones an homage to the original attraction to hear the fish talk The sub passes through a dark cavern where huge eels lunge toward it and lobsters can also be seen The sub passes Marlin and Dory as they discover that Nemo has gotten lost again Farther along the reef guests encounter Mr Ray and his class swimming through the coral looking for Nemo as well The first mate announces that the sub is approaching the East Australian Current and the submarine enters the current along with Nemo Squirt Crush and other green sea turtles br The sub then exits the current and enters a graveyard of sunken ships Jacques and Blenny can both be seen nearby while Marlin and Dory continue their search for Nemo Bruce and Chum swim inside a sunken submarine surrounded by mines The submarine hits one of the mines causing all the mines to explode and the sub to shake and temporarily lose power As the sub goes dark Marlin and Dory are surrounded by small glowing lights which turn out to be phosphorescent lights on several huge deep sea anglerfish After they escape the creatures they make their way through a forest of jellyfish br The submarine reaches the active deep sea volcano Gill Bloat Gurgle Bubbles and Squirt chant as lava flows down the volcano s sides while Marlin and Dory reunite with Nemo The volcano erupts just as the sub escapes and returns to the reef The fish gather around and celebrate finding Nemo once again Suddenly a pod of humpback whales appears and one of them swallows both Dory and the submarine Dory swims about trying to understand the whale s vocalizations After a few moments the whale shoots the submarine and Dory out through its blowhole Dory then mistakes the sub for a big yellow whale and speaks whale saying goodbye br The captain tells the first mate not to enter anything that has happened in the ship s log because nobody would believe it He then says they should bring the sub up to the surface before we have a run in with a sea serpent or an encounter with a mermaid references to the original attraction which included mermaids and a sea serpent Two rock formations can be seen one shaped like a sea serpent s head and the other shaped like a mermaid The sub then surfaces and reenters the harbor where a pair of king crabs snap at air bubbles coming from a sewage pipe An instrumental version of Beyond the Sea plays as the submarine docks and the captain thanks the passengers for riding br br br Submarines br br The attraction reuses the eight original Submarine Voyage through Liquid Space attraction vehicle hulls built at the Todd Shipyards in San Pedro California Vertical rollers attached at each end of the keel roll within a submerged guide channel The original diesel engines were replaced by electric battery powered propulsion units which are charged at the loading dock by contact less inductive coils increasing efficiency and eliminating fuel spills Guests board through a hatch at either end by crossing hinged loading ramps and descending spiral stairs Twenty aft boarding guests are seated facing the starboard side and fore boarding guests are seated facing port Each submarine originally seated guests but removal of the diesel engines increased seating to spring loaded fiberglass seats Lap sitting of small children is permitted on board flotation devices limit maximum capacity to guests and one helmsman When the boarding ramps are raised the hatches are sealed watertight but not airtight and mooring lines released Although their viewports are below water level the submarines do not actually submerge when diving Descent and submersion is simulated with bubbles that rise across the viewports when the vehicles pass through compressed air released under the hull and waterfalls Each viewport blows fresh dehumidified air across its glass to prevent fogging Each cabin interior has viewports framed with dark blue mesh and a wavy blue stripe painted across the ceiling The original subs s exteriors were painted navy gray the new livery colors are bright yellow above water a light blue boot stripe at the waterline and a reflection reducing matte blue black below the waterline br The sail of each submarine from which the helmsman operates has a control console and a board of indicator lights displaying the submarine s status if anything abnormal occurs on the ride s cycle Cast members are trained how to respond to each abnormality and are always in contact with other operating positions of the ride Although the submarine is on a guideway the helmsman controls its forward and backward movement via a small joystick to regulate these speeds shown in RPM in lieu of the actual propeller which moves the boat which vary in different sections of the ride Cast members operating the submarines guide them through a series of laser sensors that activate each show scene Guiding timers and block lights are placed throughout the ride to help cast members time each scene br The helmsman unlocks the sub s watertight hatches via levers in the sail each time it returns to dock Each sail also has a flashlight checklists for the ride s opening and closing crews and a radio to communicate with other boats and stations br The queue docks subs and scenes were all re themed to represent the movie s Australian harbor and the captain and his first mate speak with Australian accents br To accommodate guests with conditions preventing them from boarding the subs the adjacent Marine Observation Outpost M O O has a high definition LCD screen featuring a version of the show that is similar to the underwater attraction br br br Nemo submarine names br Nautilus br Scout formerly Neptune formerly Seawolf br Voyager formerly Sea Star formerly Skate br Mariner
