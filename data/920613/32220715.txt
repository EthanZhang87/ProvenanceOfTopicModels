the producer of the first film also returned while Chris Sanders who co directed and co wrote the first film acted only as an additional executive producer this time due to his involvement with The Croods When offered the sequel DeBlois accepted it on condition he could turn it into a trilogy For the sequel he intended to revisit the films of his youth with The Empire Strikes Back and My Neighbor Totoro having the pivotal inspirations for the film What I loved especially about Empire is that it expanded Star Wars in every direction emotionally its scope characters fun It felt like an embellishment and that s the goal br The entire original voice cast Baruchel Butler Ferguson Ferrera Hill Mintz Plasse Miller and Wiig returned for the sequel On June it was announced that Kit Harington of Game of Thrones fame was cast as one of the film s antagonists At the San Diego Comic Con International it was announced that Cate Blanchett and Djimon Hounsou had joined the cast they lent their voices to Valka and Drago Bludvist respectively br While the first film was set in a generic North Sea environment the creative team decided to focus on Norway this time around Early in the sequel s development about a dozen of them traveled there for a week long research trip where they toured Oslo Bergen and the fjords DeBlois together with Gregg Taylor DreamWorks head of feature development and Roger Deakins a cinematographer who served as visual consultant then broke off from the group to visit Svalbard and see polar bears in the wild with the assistance of armed guides br DeBlois explained that he had learned from directing Lilo Stitch that if you set an animated film in a place you want to visit there s a chance you might get to go there He had wanted to visit Svalbard for some time after learning of its stark beauty from a couple of backpackers he met during earlier visits to Iceland to work with post rock band Sigur R s on the documentary film Heima br An early draft for the film had Gobber the Belch being the one killed by the brainwashed Toothless under Drago Bludvist s orders instead of Stoick the Vast However when DeBlois shared his plot outline as originally envisioned to his colleague Guillermo del Toro who had enjoyed the first film del Toro suggested instead to have Stoick killed over Gobber as Stoick had exhausted his narrative contribution and would represent a crutch for Hiccup if he were to become chief DeBlois ultimately felt this was a right decision for the story and del Toro was given a Thank you credit br br Over the five years
