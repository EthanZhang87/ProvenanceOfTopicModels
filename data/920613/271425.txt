major races on road courses paved ovals and dirt tracks in one season a feat that he accomplished four times With his final IndyCar win in April Andretti became the first driver to have won IndyCar races in four different decades and the first to win automobile races of any kind in five br In American popular culture Andretti s name has become synonymous with speed You think you re Mario Andretti similar to Barney Oldfield in the early th century and Stirling Moss in the United Kingdom br br Andretti and his twin brother Aldo were born to Alvise Andretti a farm administrator and his wife Rina in Montona Istria Kingdom of Italy in present day Motovun Croatia Istria was then part of the Kingdom of Italy but it became part of Yugoslavia at the end of World War II as product of the Treaty of Paris in and later the Treaty of Osimo in In the Andretti family like many other Istrian Italians at the time left during the Istrian Dalmatian exodus They initially ended up in a refugee camp in Lucca Italy br In Andretti told author Paul Stenning My father left everything behind we left our home and took what we could carry and went further into Italy They had to swallow all of these families that were dispersed and they formed all different camps over Italy and we were shipped to a place in Tuscany Life was a bit weird at the time but the one thing that my father always did he always provided for us As kids we were never cold we were never hungry we went to school he always provided quite well br br The twins mother Rina said that when they were two years old they would take pot lids out of the cupboards and run around the kitchen going Vroom vroom like they were driving cars before the twins had even yet seen a car In at age five he and Aldo were racing their hand crafted wooden cars through the steep streets of their hometown The brothers were later hired by a garage to park cars In his autobiography What s It Like Out There published in Andretti described the experience writing The first time I fired up a car felt the engine shudder and the wheel come to life in my hands I was hooked It was a feeling I can t describe I still get it every time I get into a race car br Andretti s first racing experience was in a new youth racing league called Formula Junior in Ancona Italy when he was thirteen years old Years later in an interview during an RRDC Evening with Mario Andretti Andretti implied that he and his brother made up the story of racing in the Formula Junior league when they moved to Pennsylvania to improve their chances of competing in dirt track racing because having purchased racing suits in Italy they looked the part br Marco De Cesari and Danilo Piccinini the owners of the garage noticed the Andretti brothers passion for racing and brought them to the Abetone pass to watch a stretch of the Mille Miglia race in which caused him to become captivated by Italian two time Formula One world champion Alberto Ascari who won the race Later in the same year Piccinini brought the brothers to the Monza for the Italian Grand Prix where Andretti saw Ascari and Juan Manuel Fangio race against each other I remember being just mesmerized overwhelmed by the sound by the speed Andretti recalled years later We didn t even have a grandstand seat we were up on that bank before the Parabolica on the left You know we had a good view of things br br Andretti s father had maintained contact with his brother in law who had lived in the U S for many years It took the family three years to obtain a U S visa Alvise Andretti initially told the family they would move to the U S for five years and then return to Italy In the Andretti family emigrated to the U S settling in Nazareth in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania with just to their name br In Andretti said When I looked at my life in many ways out of so many negatives here comes a positive and this was certainly one of them here was an opportunity created for us the kids and my dad always cited that He would say in a sense I am looking at your future where I think would be the best solution for you kids to have opportunities and he was correct he was right because if we had remained in Italy I don t know whether I could have pursued what my first passion was and the only passion I really had career wise br While getting acquainted with Pennsylvania Mario and Aldo were surprised to find a half mile dirt racing track Nazareth Speedway in Nazareth The twins worked on a Hudson and raced it in the Limited Sportsman Class funded by money that they earned in their uncle s garage in They took turns racing the old Hudson on oval dirt tracks near Nazareth After finishing high school Mario planned to become a welder but he falsified a driver license so he could pass for and enter an amateur race Mario and Aldo did not tell their parents that they were racing The twins each had two wins after their first four races Aldo was seriously hurt near the end of the season and their parents were unhappy to find out that the twins were racing Mario had modified stock car wins in races in and br br Andretti became a naturalized U S citizen in He competed

American Three Quarter Midget Racing Association in the winter to be seen by full sized midget car owners He raced in over one hundred events in Andretti won three feature races at two different tracks on Labor Day in He won an afternoon feature at Flemington New Jersey and swept twin features at Hatfield Pennsylvania br The next rung on the racing ladder on the East Coast of the United States was to race in sprint cars in the United Racing Club URC Andretti was able to get a ride for individual races in the URC sprint car racing series but was unable to secure a full time ride He once drove from Canada to Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania hoping to find a ride in an event but he went empty handed He bypassed the series when he was offered a full time ride in a United States

racing series in North America was the USAC National Championship It was often referred to as IndyCar racing referring to the famous Indianapolis race which was the centerpiece of the championship The

Jersey He started sixteenth and finished eleventh Andretti was introduced by his USAC sprint car owner Rufus Gray to veteran mechanic Clint Brawner Brawner was not impressed since sprint car drivers Stan Bowman and Donnie Davis had recently died and Brawner s current driver Chuck Hulse had been critically injured Chris Economaki recommended Andretti to Brawner so Brawner watched Andretti race at Terre Haute Indiana Brawner was convinced that he had found the new driver for his team The two stayed together for six years Andretti finished eleventh in the USAC National Championship that season Andretti won his first championship car race at the Hoosier Grand Prix on a road course at Indianapolis Raceway Park in His third place finish at the Indianapolis in the Brawner Hawk a mechanical copy

in both seasons br br Formula One is the highest form of open wheel racing sanctioned by the F d ration Internationale de l Automobile FIA motorsport s international governing body Although originating in Europe by the s it included races worldwide At Andretti s first Indianapolis in he met Colin Chapman owner of the Lotus Formula One team who was running eventual race winner Jim Clark s car Andretti told Chapman of his ambition to compete in Formula One and was told When you re ready call me By Andretti felt he was ready Chapman gave him a car and the young American took the pole position on his debut at the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen in his Lotus br Andretti drove sporadically in Formula One over the next four years for Lotus March and Ferrari while continuing to focus on his racing career in America At the South African Grand Prix on his debut for Ferrari he won his first Grand Prix That was a big moment one of those I ll always cherish recalled Andretti Kyalami was a fun circuit to drive with lots of elevation changes and Ferrari gave me equal equipment to my teammates It was a good weekend Three weeks later at the non championship Questor Grand Prix in the U S he brought the Italian team a second victory The day before the Questor GP he had finished th in the Indy car race at Phoenix International Raceway At the end of the season Ferrari called Andretti and made him a pitch to be his No driver but Andretti declined F didn t pay much back then and my contracts and commitments were so lucrative over here I couldn t give that up for the security of my family The timing wasn t right yet so I had to turn him down but I always figured I d get another opportunity br br In Andretti drove a full Formula One season for the first time for the American Parnelli team The team was new to Formula One although it had been successful in both Formula and IndyCar racing in America with Andretti driving The team had run Andretti in the two North American end of season races in with promising results Andretti qualified fourth and led the Spanish Grand Prix for nine laps before his suspension failed He scored five championship points in the season Andretti continued to compete in IndyCar missing two Formula One races in the middle of the season to do so br When the Parnelli team pulled out of Formula One after two races of the season Andretti returned to Chapman s Lotus team for whom he had already driven at the season opening Brazilian Grand Prix Lotus was then at a low point having failed to produce a competitive car to replace s Lotus Andretti s ability at developing a racing car contributed to Lotus return to the front of the Formula One grid culminating in lapping the field in his victory at the season ending race at the Mount Fuji circuit in Japan Since mid Lotus had been developing the use of ground effect shaping the underside of the car to generate downforce with little penalizing drag For his part Andretti worked at setting up his cars for the races exploiting subtle differences in tire size stagger and suspension set up cross weighting on each side of the car to optimize it for each track an approach imported from his extensive oval racing experience in the United States In at Long Beach he became the only American to win the United States Grand Prix West and the last American as of to win any US Grand Prix The Lotus wing car proved to be the most competitive car of but despite winning four races more than any other driver reliability problems and collisions with other drivers meant Andretti finished only third in the championship br At the end of Andretti was approached by Ferrari as a potential replacement for Niki Lauda I had a handshake agreement with Colin and he d already agreed to pay me what Ronnie Peterson was making which was the highest salary in F So I asked Mr Ferrari what was he willing to pay me He said You know Mario I can t put a price on your talent so you tell me That SOB threw it right back in my lap Well Andretti s wife Dee Ann was sitting next to me and I asked her what should I do and she said double it And Mr Ferrari agreed The next day I got a telex from him saying Let s just leave things alone because he d just had a visit from Colin who d followed me to Maranello and raised hell with Mr Ferrari Can you imagine So I told Colin he d always been good to me but you don t want an unhappy driver Then I told him I wanted a point you got nine points for a win back then and he had to agree br In the Lotus designed by Chapman exploited ground effect even further Andretti dominated the season and took the title with six wins He clinched the championship at the Italian Grand Prix There was no championship celebration though because his teammate Ronnie Peterson crashed heavily at the start of the race he was hospitalised and died that night from complications resulting from his injuries br Andretti found little success after in Formula One he failed to win another grand prix He had a difficult year in as the new Lotus was not competitive and the team had to rely on the Lotus which had been overtaken by the second generation of ground effect cars In he was paired with the young Italian Elio de Angelis and briefly with test driver Nigel Mansell but the team was again unsuccessful br For the season Andretti decided to move to the Alfa Romeo team run by Carlo Chiti Although the car was reasonably competitive Andretti finished fourth on his debut with the team in Long Beach a general lack of reliability resulted in yet another unsuccessful campaign Like other drivers of the period Andretti did not like the ground effect cars of the time the cars were getting absurd really crude with no suspension movement whatever It was toggle switch driving with no need for any kind of delicacy it made leaving Formula One a lot easier than it would have been br br The next year Andretti raced once for the Williams team after their driver Carlos Reutemann suddenly quit before replacing the seriously injured Didier Pironi at Ferrari for the last two races of the year Suspension failure dropped him out of the last race of the season but at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza he took the pole position and finished third in the race br There was almost a return to F for Andretti at the Detroit Grand Prix when the Renault team put him on standby to replace regular driver Patrick Tambay if the Frenchman had been unable to race as was the case at the previous race in Canada However in the event Tambay was able to take part in the race br Andretti was also considered as a replacement again for Tambay who had been injured in Canada at the Detroit Grand Prix this time for the Carl Haas owned Haas Lola team Andretti declined but recommended his son Michael Andretti When Michael was unable to obtain the FIA Superlicense required to allow him to race in Formula One the drive went to Eddie Cheever br br Andretti had continued to race and occasionally win in the USAC National Championship during his time in the Formula One world championship In a new organization Championship Auto Racing Teams CART had set up the IndyCar World Series as a rival to the USAC National Championships that Andretti had won three times in the s The new series had rapidly become the top open wheel racing series in North America br Andretti joined CART full time in driving for Patrick Racing He started from row two in the Indianapolis that year but was involved in a wreck on the approach to the start when rookie Kevin Cogan suddenly spun out Three minutes after the wreck Andretti was heard saying This is what happens when you have children doing a man s job up front and he and Cogan were later involved in a shoving match br In he joined the new Newman Haas Racing team set up by Carl Haas and actor Paul Newman using cars built by British company Lola Andretti took the team s first win at Elkhart Lake in He won the pole for nine of sixteen events in and claimed his fourth Champ Car title at the age of He edged out Tom Sneva by points It was the first series title for the second year team br In August Andretti won the Pocono in his th attempt to win at the track near his Pennsylvania home It gave Andretti mile Indy car wins at Indianapolis Michigan and Pocono br Mario s son Michael joined Newman Haas in Together they made history as the first father son team to compete in both IMSA GT and Champ Car racing With regard to the former it was their fourth time in an endurance race together as co drivers Mario finished seventh in points for the season the year that Michael won the championship Mario s last victory in IndyCar racing came in at Phoenix International Raceway the year that Michael left Newman Haas to race in Formula One The win made Mario the oldest recorded winner in an IndyCar event years days old Andretti qualified on the pole at the Michigan later that year with a speed of miles per hour km h The speed was a new closed course world record Andretti s final season in was dubbed The Arrivederci Tour He raced in the last of his Indy car races that September br br Andretti won once at the Indianapolis in attempts Andretti has had so many incidents and near victories at the track that critics have dubbed the family s performance after Mario s Indianapolis victory the Andretti Curse br Andretti finished all miles km just five times including his Indianapolis victory Andretti was the first driver to exceed miles per hour km h while practicing for the Indianapolis In after years of bad luck and non finishes Andretti dominated the Indianapolis en route to his only victory in the race The race is notable as it is the only Indy in history where the winning driver ran the whole race on only set of tires br Between his victory in the race and Andretti dropped out of the races due to part failures or crashes His luck seemed to turn around in Andretti finished second in the Indianapolis by eight seconds behind Bobby Unser The following day Unser was penalized one lap for passing cars under a caution flag and Andretti was declared the winner Unser and his car owner Roger Penske appealed the race stewards decision USAC overturned the one lap penalty four months later and penalized Unser with a fine br At the start of the Indianapolis second year driver Kevin Cogan teammate to polesitter Rick Mears suddenly spun right when accelerating for the green flag Cogan bounced off A J Foyt slamming Foyt s steering rod That contact turned Cogan s car left at a degree angle to the field where he was promptly T boned by Mario Andretti was livid and engaged in a shoving match with Cogan before walking off In an interview three minutes after the wreck an irked Andretti was heard saying This is what happens when you have children doing a man s job up front Andretti s Patrick Racing teammate that year was the eventual race winner Gordon Johncock who started next to Andretti in the middle of row two In later years Johncock pointed out that Andretti had jumped the start and could have avoided the spinning car of Cogan had he been lined up properly in the second row next to Gordy br In the Indianapolis he was passed for the lead by Danny Sullivan in Turn One on lap Immediately after completing the pass Sullivan spun in front of Andretti A caution flag for the spin minimized the time Sullivan would lose to Andretti by pitting to replace his tires Sullivan took the lead for good laps later when he passed Andretti without incident Andretti dominated the Indianapolis leading of the first laps of the race His lead was so large that he was advised to slow his pace to preserve his equipment In a cruel twist of fate when Andretti started running slower his reduced engine rpm s created a harmonic imbalance in his turbocharged Ilmor Chevrolet V that led to a broken valve spring with laps to go br The Indianapolis was run in extremely cold weather which resulted in a large number of wrecks by cars on cold tires Andretti accelerated off of turn three for the restart at the end of the rd lap Under acceleration Mario s car got loose in the middle of turn four and rotated degrees to smash nose first into the wall Andretti was taken to the hospital with six of his toes broken and would shortly be joined by his son Jeff Andretti who smashed both legs after a wheel came loose on his race car on the th lap of the race Mario would only miss one race due to his injuries and returned to run th in a race just four weeks after his crash br The Indianapolis was Andretti s last notable run and he had just come off a victory at Phoenix On pole day Andretti was the first car to complete a qualifying run and sat on the provisional pole position Andretti s speed held up all afternoon but with less than an hour to go Arie Luyendyk topped his speed and took the pole On race day Andretti was a factor most of the afternoon leading the most laps While leading on lap Andretti was penalized for entering the pits while they were closed A stop and go penalty dropped him only down to second place In the final laps he began developing handling problems because of his tires and slid down the standings to finish th Andretti s last race at Indy was the Indianapolis br On April in the lead up to the Indianapolis Andretti took to the track for the first time in ten years in a major open wheel car at the age of He participated in a test session for son Michael s AGR IndyCar team One of the team s regular drivers Tony Kanaan suffered a radial fracture of his arm a week earlier in an April crash at Twin Ring Motegi If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify the car for him He would turn the car over to Kanaan on race day though no plans had been made for Andretti to actually drive in the race During the test Andretti ran at competitive speeds but running over debris saw his car becoming airborne and the attempt ended with a spectacular crash Andretti was able to walk away from the wreck with just a minor cut on his chin This was Andretti s last
