songs it s only occasionally as much fun as it ought to be Brian Lowry of Variety gave it a mostly positive review saying Owing a strong debt to Monty Python and a lesser one to spoofs like When Things Were Rotten Galavant largely overcomes the challenges that have traditionally bedeviled TV musicals with rambunctious energy cheeky lyrics and music and significantly a half hour format thus condensing the need to create songs into a manageable task TVLine s Matt Webb Mitovich wrote With some resignation given a colleague s meh reaction to the pilot I finally cued up Galavant and found myself binge watching the six episodes available to me And I seldom binge anything That s why I think ABC is smart to double pump episodes because yes the plot progression is a bit slow pausing as it does to allow for song and dance numbers and vamping by the more colorful characters the king included You ll want two at a time to come away satisfied Alan Sepinwall of HitFix however was more negative writing the whole is less than the sum of its comic and musical parts br The second season was met with equally positive critical response On Rotten Tomatoes it has a rating based on reviews with an average rating of The consensus reads The surprise second season of Galavant sends its cast in many directions but keeps the fun and music that made it a hit firmly at its center On Metacritic it has a rating based on critics br br br Ratings br br br Season br br br Season br br br br br br External links br br Galavant at IMDb
