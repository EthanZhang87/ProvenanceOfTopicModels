Services and features br br br Present br br br Wikis br The main purpose of articles in a Fandom community is to cover information and discussion on a particular topic in a much greater and more comprehensive detail level than what can be found in Wikipedia articles br Other examples of content that is generally considered beyond the scope of Wikipedia articles include Fandom information about video games and related video game topics detailed instructions gameplay details plot details and so forth Gameplay concepts can also have their own articles Fandom also allows wikis to have a point of view rather than the neutral POV that is required by Wikipedia although NPOV is a local policy on many Fandom communities br The image policies of Fandom communities tend to be more lenient than those of Wikimedia Foundation projects allowing articles with much more illustration Fandom requires all user text content to be published under a free license most use the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license although a few wikis use a licence with a noncommercial clause for instance Memory Alpha Uncyclopedia and others and some use the GNU Free Documentation License Fandom s terms of use forbid hate speech libel pornography or copyright infringement Other material is allowed as long as the added material does not duplicate existing wikis br Wikis are also not owned by their founders nor does the founder s opinion carry more weight in disagreements than any other user s opinion Consensus and cooperation are the primary means for organizing a community on Fandom However Fandom may make decisions affecting the community even if there is no consensus at all br br br Technology br As of May Fandom uses a heavily modified version of the MediaWiki software based on the version of MediaWiki It has several custom extensions installed to add social features like blogs chat badges forums and multimedia but also remove features like advanced user options or skins The personal choice of using the Monobook skin instead of the default custom skin was removed on May alluding GDPR compliance br In August Fandom announced it would switch to a service oriented architecture It has also removed many custom extensions and functionality for specific wiki has created certain features to fill those needs br br br Entertainment news br In Wikia launched Fandom an online entertainment media website The program utilizes volunteer contributors called Fandom Contributors to produce articles working alongside an editorial team employed by Wikia In contrast to the blogging feature of individual wiki communities Fandom focuses on pop culture and fan topics such as video games movies and television shows The project features fan opinions interviews with property creators reviews and how to guides Fandom also includes videos and specific news coverage sponsored or paid for by a property creator to promote their property br In the same year it was also announced that the entire Wikia platform would be rebranded under the Fandom name on October A leak from Fandom s Community Council was posted to Reddit s r Wikia subreddit in August confirming that Fandom would be migrating all wikis from the wikia com domain to fandom com in early as part of a push for greater adoption of Fandom s wiki specific applications on both iOS and Android s app ecosystems The post was later deleted br br br Wiki partnerships br Fandom has created several official partnerships to create wikis vetted by the corporation as being the official encyclopedia or wiki of a property In Fandom partnered with Sony Online Entertainment to create the first Wikia Official Community for PlanetSide with the game s wiki slated to receive exclusive content and support

esports tournaments and streams on Twitch br br br Fandom Games YouTube channel br With Fandom s acquisition of Curse Media the Curse Entertainment YouTube channel was renamed to Fandom Games Fandom Games publishes Honest Game Trailers which was previously published on the Smosh Games YouTube channel until Screen Junkies was acquired by Fandom br br br Past services br br br OpenServing br OpenServing was a short lived Web publishing project owned by Fandom founded on December and abandoned unannounced in January Like Fandom OpenServing was to offer free wiki hosting but it would differ in that each wiki s founder would retain any revenue gained from advertising on the site OpenServing used a modified version of the Wikimedia Foundation s MediaWiki software created by ArmchairGM but was intended to branch out to other open source packages br According to Fandom co founder and chairman Jimmy Wales the OpenServing site received several thousand applications in January However after a year no sites had been launched under the OpenServing banner br br br Armchair GM br ArmchairGM was a sports forum and wiki site created by Aaron Wright Dan Lewis Robert Lefkowitz and developer David Pean Launched in early the site was initially US based but sought to improve its links to sports associated with Britain over its first year Its MediaWiki based software included a Digg style article voting mechanism blog like comment forms with thumbs up down user feedback and the ability to write multiple types of posts news opinions or locker room discussion entries br In late the site was bought by Fandom for million After the purchase was made the former owners applied ArmchairGM s architecture to other Fandom sites However Wikia had dropped support for the custom software innovations by ArmchairGM by January From September to February Fandom absorbed ArmchairGM s encyclopedia articles and blanked all of its old blog entries effectively discontinuing ArmchairGM in its original form br The software powering ArmchairGM was incrementally open sourced starting in February with the public release of the SocialProfile MediaWiki extension This process was complete by August when the original ArmchairGM codebase internally codenamed wikia ny was released in full Since the ArmchairGM innovations nicknamed social tools have been developed by volunteer developers of the MediaWiki community and they are available under the GNU General Public License version or later which is a free and open source software license The source code is hosted on the Wikimedia Foundation s web servers and mirrored to the popular source code hosting platform GitHub br br br Search engines br Wikia Inc initially proposed creating a copyleft search engine the software but not the site was named Wikiasari by a November naming contest The proposal became inactive in The public alpha of the Wikia Search web search engine was launched on January from the USSHC underground data center This roll out version of the search interface was roundly panned by reviewers in technology media br The project was ended in March Late in a new search engine was established to index and display results from all sites hosted on Fandom br br br Questions and answers site br In January the company created a question and answer website named Wikianswers not to be confused with the preexisting WikiAnswers In March Fandom re launched Answers from Wikia where users could create topic specialized knowledge market wikis based upon Fandom s own Wikianswers subdomain br br br Controversies br br br Advertising controversies br Fandom communities have complained of inappropriate advertisements resource intensive advertisements or advertising in the body text area Users have also complained that the advertisements are so resource intensive and hindering that they have no choice but to use an ad blocker to continue using the website br br br McDonald s Grimace Shake promotion br In June McDonald s paid Fandom an undisclosed amount to temporarily replace the McDonald s Wiki s main page and exhaustive article on Grimace into an advertisement promoting the Grimace Shake and the character s nd anniversary The article s primary contributor Nathan Steinmetz complained that the decision undermined his research and efforts and considered Fandom to have set a really bad precedent of IP holders ability to suppress user generated content with press releases br br br Wiki departures br A number of wikis have migrated away from Fandom citing issues such as intrusive advertising and branding a non user friendly site design a lack of customizability and company cross promotion which is often irrelevant to wiki content Other communities such as the Zelda Wiki and Minecraft Wiki have named the increasing corporate consolidation of wikis alleged censorship Fandom s degraded functionality and the Grimace controversy among their reasons for migrating Covering the Minecraft Wiki s departure for PC Gamer Rich Stanton stated that most of the migrations began after the acquisition and Gamepedia s move to Fandom He noted that the Minecraft Wiki would have to face Fandom s higher search engine optimization SEO and the struggle to establish a wider audience after moving In Fandom CEO Perkins Miller told The Verge that he takes wiki migration very seriously br Some of the more high profile wikis which have migrated from Fandom include the RuneScape wiki in the Zelda and Terraria wikis in and the Minecraft Fallout and Hollow Knight wikis in Some wikis have received support from the creators of their topic areas during migration br br br Forking br There is no easy way for individual communities to switch to conventional paid hosting as Fandom usually owns the relevant domain names When a community leaves Fandom for new hosting Fandom typically continues to operate the abandoned forked wiki using its original name and content for advertising revenue as long as editing and viewership remains This can adversely affect the new wiki s search rankings potentially also resulting in outdated or incorrect information being present and viewed more often than the information on the new wiki Fandom allows only a message directing viewers to a discussion about whether to fork for as long as the discussion is active before the message is removed and any administrators involved in the new wiki have their rights on the Fandom wiki removed br br br Relationship with Wikipedia br In the s Fandom then called Wikia was accused of unduly profiting from a perceived association with Wikipedia Although Fandom has been referred to in the media as the commercial counterpart to the non profit Wikipedia Wikimedia and Fandom staff call this description inaccurate br In the Wikimedia Foundation shared hosting and bandwidth costs with Wikia and received some donated office space from Wikia during the fiscal year ending June At the end of the fiscal year Wikia owed the foundation In June two members of the foundation s board of directors also served as employees officers or directors of Wikia In January Wikia subleased two conference rooms to the Wikimedia Foundation for the Wikipedia Usability Initiative According to a email by Erik M ller deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation br br We obtained about a dozen bids We used averaging as a way to arrive at a fair market rate to neither advantage nor disadvantage Wikia when suggesting a rate The averaging also resulted in a rate that was roughly equivalent to the most comparable space in the running br br br Fandom Inc br br The overall parent company Fandom Inc is headquartered at the Hallidie Building on Sutter Street in San Francisco California The company was incorporated in Florida in December and re incorporated in Delaware as Wikia Inc on January br Fandom has technical staff in the US but also has an office in Pozna Poland where the primary engineering functions are performed br Fandom derives income from advertising The company initially used Google AdSense but moved on to Federated Media before bringing ad management in house Alongside Fandom s in house advertising they continue to use AdSense as well as Amazon Ads and several other third party advertising services Fandom also gains income from various partnerships oriented around various sweepstake sponsorships on related wikis br Fandom has several other offices International operations are based in Germany and Asian operations and sales are conducted in Tokyo Other sales offices are located in
