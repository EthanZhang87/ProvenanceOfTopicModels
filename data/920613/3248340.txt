reveals that his secret ingredient soup has no secret ingredient at all explaining that things can become special with belief Realizing that this is the message of the Dragon Scroll Po rushes back to help Shifu br At the Jade Palace Tai Lung brutally defeats Shifu but he discovers that the Scroll is missing Po arrives with the Scroll saving Shifu s life and prompting them to fight Po proves to be a formidable opponent gaining an edge on Tai Lung with his confusing fighting techniques Tai Lung eventually obtains the Scroll but does not comprehend its blank surface Furious Tai Lung uses his

DreamWorks had done before When the head of the production handed the script to VFX Supervisor Markus Manninen she reportedly laughed and wished him good luck When we started talking said Manninen the movie was still a high concept But for everyone that looked at it it screamed complexity We launched off by saying how can you make this movie tangible How can you find smart ways to bring this world to life in a way that makes it a great movie and not feel like the complexity becomes the driver of the story but the story and the emotion being the driver In preparation the animators took a six hour kung fu class br Producer Melissa Cobb said that Po was originally more of a jerk but that the character changed after they heard Black According to Black he worked mostly in isolation although
