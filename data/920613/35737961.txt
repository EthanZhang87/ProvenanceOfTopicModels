caveboy but Arlo cannot bring himself to kill him and sets him free Disappointed and a little mad Henry takes Arlo to track the caveboy into a ravine Henry then saves Arlo from a flash flood before being killed by debris br Without his father Arlo shoulders more of the workload He spots the same caveboy inside the silo blaming the caveboy for his father s death Arlo chases him into a river out of anger rage and hatred where both are swept miles downstream Arlo is knocked unconscious by a rock and awakens to find himself deep in the wilderness As he tries to return his leg is caught by a boulder The next day Arlo wakes to find his leg has been freed by the caveboy digging out the dirt below Arlo s leg The caveboy appears with food and leads Arlo to a berry tree The caveboy then fends off a large snake amazing Arlo and impressing Forrest Woodbush a nearby eccentric Styracosaurus who wants to keep the boy He forces Arlo to compete with him to give the boy a name he will respond to and Arlo wins the game when he calls the boy Spot Arlo and Spot bond as Arlo laments his lost family and Spot reveals that his own parents are both dead br Later when a storm strikes Arlo runs away in fear and loses the riverbank he has been following home The next morning Arlo wakes to find Spot at his side They are noticed by a band of pterodactyls who appear to be conducting a rescue operation but turn out to be savagely carnivorous When the pterodactyls try to eat Spot Arlo and Spot flee they encounter a Tyrannosaurus named Nash and his sister Ramsey who both drive off the pterodactyls Nash Ramsey and Butch have lost their herd of longhorns somewhere in the south so Arlo offers Spot s help in sniffing them out The group locates the herd but Butch recognizes the work of cattle rustlers Arlo and Spot lure the four rustler Velociraptors into the open allowing Butch and his family to attack After the rustlers have been driven off and telling stories at camp Arlo joins the Tyrannosaurus in driving the cattle south Later he sees the familiar mountain peaks of his homeland in the distance and leaves with Spot to return home br Along the way they encounter an adult feral caveman in the distance Spot is intrigued but Arlo dissuades him and they continue on As another storm approaches the pterodactyls return attack and carry Spot away Arlo gets pushed off a cliff by one of the pterodactyls and becomes entangled in vines being knocked unconscious as a rock hits his head Arlo has a vision of his father freeing him and leading him home Knowing it wasn t Spot s fault for what happened to his father Arlo instead resolves to save Spot making the vision of Henry proud of his son before it fades away The vision invigorates Arlo with refound strength as he frees himself from the vines and finds and attacks the pterodactyls who have cornered Spot in the river Arlo and Spot together plunge the pterodactyls into the water where they are swept helplessly downstream When

director producer and other small details On April Pixar officially revealed the film s title as The Good Dinosaur br The filmmakers wanted to explore what dinosaurs represent in the present day and how they are represented in stereotypes Peterson stated It s time to do a movie where you get to know the dinosaur what it s really like to be a dinosaur and to be with a dinosaur Peterson said that his inspiration of the film came from the World s Fair childhood visit where he gets impressed by dinosaur animatronics Sohn described the film s title as deceptively simple which has more meaning than it seems He additionally explained Arlo has a lot of issues when he s born He s fearful and he s weak and he s disconnected from the family because of these issues and he feels like he s not worthy and so he finds a way to become worthy br In April Pixar announced that the film s release date had been shifted from November to May with Walt Disney Animation Studios Frozen taking its place On August it was announced at the D Expo that Lucas Neff John Lithgow Frances McDormand Neil Patrick Harris Judy Greer and Bill Hader had joined the cast of the film br br br Revisions br By mid Peterson was removed from the film due to story problems Peterson who could not solve the film s third act was absent from the D Expo where Sohn and producer Denise Ream presented footage from the film Peterson moved on to another project he developed at Pixar while Ream replaced producer John Walker who left to work on Disney s own Tomorrowland John Lasseter Lee Unkrich Mark Andrews and Sohn stepped in temporarily to work on various sections of the film In September The Good Dinosaur was pushed back from May the scheduled release date for Inside Out but was eventually moved to to November the scheduled release date for Pixar s Finding Dory According to Ream the primary reason for the rescheduling was because the story was not working period full stop it just was not where it needed to be In November due to the delay Pixar laid off employees of its person workforce following the closure of Pixar Canada a month before when about employees had been laid off officially to refocus Pixar s efforts at its main headquarters br In August Lithgow revealed in an interview that the film had been dismantled and completely reimagined and that he was expected to rerecord his role in the next month while mentioning that McDormand was still part of the film In October Sohn was announced as the new director of the film In November it was reported that new elements had been added to the story

revealed that Neff had been replaced by Raymond Ochoa and Lithgow had been replaced by Jeffrey Wright Arlo s three siblings to be voiced by Harris Hader and Greer had been cut down to a single brother named Buck voiced by Marcus Scribner and later a sister named Libby voiced by Maleah Padilla It was also confirmed that the farmer aspect was still part of the film br br br Design and setting br br The filmmakers wanted nature to be the antagonist for the main character Arlo Ream noted Nature can overcome anything including a massive dinosaur In order to achieve the needed realism the film s team traveled to the American Northwest spending time in Jackson Hole Wyoming Juntura Oregon and southern Montana Production designer Harley Jessup stated that the film has a fantastic variety of landscapes which ranged from the Jackson Valley and the Tetons to the amazing geysers and waterfalls in Yellowstone as the filmmakers studied the grasslands of Montana and the Red Desert and used them to incorporate into the film To use the landscapes that they had experienced the filmmakers used data from the U S Geological Survey and satellite images from Google Earth The geographical data provided a foundation that the team then built on According to supervising technical director Sanjay Bakshi this gave Sohn the freedom to shoot in any direction he wanted to make the world feel big and real In addition The Good Dinosaur features three dimensional volumetric clouds In previous Pixar films clouds have been painted onto the sets Lighting cinematographer Sharon Calahan described the storm clouds are almost like a villain in the film and appeared in almost every scene Calahan also noted These particular clouds can be rendered and we can light them which we ve never been able to properly do before br According to the filmmakers the environments and landscapes in the film are not photo realistic they are just detailed in a way that advanced technology and style decisions allow In terms of animating Arlo directing animator Rob Duquette Thompson and animation character developer Kevin O Hara went to a zoo and shot video of elephants in motion A system where Arlo s head goes up and his chest goes down when his hips goes up was therefore created To get an idea of the scale of Arlo a complete full size model was built out of card and foam core In total The Good Dinosaur took up TB of server space ten times as much space as Monsters University br Arlo was designed so that the audience could identify with him and be able to see the boy inside the dinosaur Since The Good Dinosaur is set in a world in which dinosaurs never became extinct they were instead able to evolve Herbivores like Arlo and his family become farmers and carnivores like the T rex become ranchers Because they are meant to be reminiscent of cowboys when the T rex run their lower bodies mimic a galloping horse while their upper bodies have the feel of a riding cowboy To help inspire Butch s physical look and performance the filmmakers looked at classic film cowboys such as characters portrayed by Clint Eastwood and Jack Palance br br br Music br br The film s score was composed by Mychael Danna and his brother Jeff replacing Thomas Newman who was originally attached to score the film when it was set to be directed by Peterson It marks the first Pixar film to be scored by two composers Danna was approached by Sohn and Ream due to his score for Life of Pi which won an Academy Award Having a lot of work he invited his brother as a co writer Walt Disney Records released the

Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described it as antic and unexpected as well as homiletic rife with subversive elements wacky critters and some of the most beautiful landscapes ever seen in a computer animated film Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt the film has a few things on its mind but its tone is overwhelmingly playful not hectoring Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal opined that As Pixar productions go this one isn t a groundbreaker but it s heartfelt and endearing as well as visually splendiferous and kids will love it for sure Justin Chang of Variety wrote Clever and cloying by turns it s a movie that always seems to be trying to evolve beyond its conventional trappings and not succeeding as often as Pixar devotees have come to expect Many of the reviewers praised the sophistication of its nearly photorealistic backgrounds br Christopher Orr of The Atlantic felt it to be the studio s first film explicitly targeted towards children though it is by no means a bad movie It s a simple story well told Mark Feeney writing for The Boston Globe felt similarly deeming it a very middling movie The Good Dinosaur generally features a sort of sentimentality and emotional reductiveness that make it seem meant for small children as no previous Pixar movie has The Washington Post s Stephanie Merry dubbed it a nice conventional story but it s not Pixar level imaginative Richard Roeper for the Chicago Sun Times felt it one strange aggressively gross and dark adventure Inconsistent and weird The Good Dinosaur is second level Pixar all the way Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter panned its disappointingly derivative screenplay Mark Kermode of The Guardian says But however much it may delight on a scene by scene basis The Good Dinosaur never comes together as a coherent whole a crucial flaw for a film by Pixar which has always put story first br br br Accolades br br br See also br List of
