Kingdom Hearts III is a action role playing game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation Xbox One Windows and Nintendo Switch It is the twelfth installment in the Kingdom Hearts series and serves as a conclusion of the Dark Seeker Saga story arc that began with the original game Set after the events of Kingdom Hearts D Dream Drop Distance returning protagonist Sora is joined by Donald Duck Goofy King Mickey and Riku in their search for seven guardians of light as they attempt to thwart Xehanort s plan to bring about a second Keyblade War Their journey has them cross paths with characters and visit worlds based on different Disney and Pixar intellectual properties br Concepts for Kingdom Hearts III began as early as after the release of Kingdom Hearts II in Japan with the game s development not being officially announced until following years of rumors and speculation The game features recurring gameplay elements from the series while expanding parties to five characters total introducing new Attraction Flow attacks that incorporate various Disney Parks attractions and including minigames inspired by classic Mickey Mouse cartoons in the style of s LCD games br Kingdom Hearts III was released worldwide in January and received generally positive reviews from critics Critics praised its visuals soundtrack art style gameplay and variety of combat options while reception towards its plot and presentation was more mixed It sold over five million copies within its first week of release becoming both the fastest selling and best selling game in the series history in North America A downloadable content expansion of the game titled Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind was released on January for PlayStation and on February for Xbox One A version of the game bundled with the DLC titled as Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind was released on Windows via Epic Games Store and Steam on March and June respectively The same version was released on the Nintendo Switch via cloud streaming on February br br br Gameplay br Gameplay in Kingdom Hearts III is similar to its predecessors with hack and slash combat which director Tetsuya Nomura stated would be along the lines of the system seen in Kingdom Hearts II with an evolution similar to what was seen from Kingdom Hearts to Kingdom Hearts II and closely tied to the gameplay in Kingdom Hearts D Dream Drop Distance He also revealed that the handheld games of the series were where he could experiment with the combat mechanics and that some of the well received additions could appear in Kingdom Hearts III Nomura noted that new gameplay elements are the skeleton of the game saying development starts with a fun element for gameplay or system to then build the story and concept around Additionally the development team always want to try something new taking previously introduced mechanics and making small tweak s to them so they are customized for Kingdom Hearts III br Sora returns as the main playable character once again joined in the party by Donald Duck and Goofy with the ability to have two additional characters join the party for a total of five player parties This is an increase from previous main entries in the series where players were limited to two additional party members at any given time along with Sora Certain parts of the game have Riku and Aqua as playable characters Describing the gameplay Nomura called the action pretty frantic as well as really flashy and exciting The enemy AI is a lot more intricate too and I think the gameplay will reflect that new dynamic balance Sora can perform magic with a new powerful tier of each spell available to him similar to what Aqua has available to her in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep A Fragmentary Passage Magic performs differently in underwater sections of the game with Kingdom Hearts III introducing a new spell Water Team up attacks are also featured which combine Sora and various party members into one attack Players can equip various abilities for Sora and his party members with the system to do so an evolution of sorts from the system used in Kingdom Hearts II Character summons make a return from previous entries this time known as Links where an additional character joins the battle to assist the player with specialized attacks br br Sora faces Heartless Nobodies and Unversed in the game with new variants of these enemy types appearing In addition to these traditional smaller enemies the player faces giant bosses which give Sora greater freedom of movement and room to experiment with attacks including the new theme park ride summon attacks known as Attraction Flow These attacks are inspired by the Disney Parks attractions Mad Tea Party Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters and Grizzly River Run and generic pirate ship and carousel attractions these attacks draw visual inspiration from Disney Parks Main Street Electrical Parade Sora also has the ability to jump on certain enemies such as ones shaped like a vehicle Regarding traversal Nomura noted the new mechanic called Athletic Flow in Japanese was refined from the Flowmotion mechanic from Dream Drop Distance which players felt was a little too free and it was kind of hard to control on their end Athletic Flow allows the player to utilize the environment to access previously unreachable areas Co director Tai Yasue stated this mechanic was created to try something new and radically change the gameplay for the Hercules world which led to its use in the other worlds As a result each world was able to have more height scale and sense of discovery br Situation Commands also return from previous entries which can trigger the Keyblade transformations Nomura revealed that Keyblade transformations were conceived as early as the development of Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix and would be similar to Aqua s ability in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep saying Each Keyblade transformation is unlocked by clearing all missions in one of the game s worlds and each individual world offers its own unique Keyblade transformation He further elaborated stating there were two forms each Keyblade can take with multiple layers in terms of transforming starting with one transformation and achieving the second after successfully connect ing your combos The Keyblade transformations active the various Formchanges Power Guard Magic and Speed and change Sora s outfit similarly to the Drive Form mechanic in Kingdom Hearts II Various Keyblades are linked to each form for example the Toy Story world Keyblade actives Power Form for Sora with the Keyblade s transformations changing into a hammer and then into a drill There is also Second Form which changes Sora s battle skills rather than transform the Keyblade Unlike previous games in the series players are able to quickly switch between different Keyblades seamlessly during gameplay rather than from the game s equipment menu and each Keyblade can be leveled up to increase their abilities Shotlocks also return which use a focus meter that can target and lock on to individual enemies with the attack depending on which Keyblade is equipped br Each world offers a specific gameplay element such as first person shooter Gigas mechs in the Toy Story world downhill sledding in the Frozen world and naval underwater and aerial combat in the Pirates of the Caribbean world which also features numerous smaller islands at sea which can be explored The Gummi Ship also returns as a means of travel between the different worlds of the game The mechanic has been split into two phases exploration which has been likened to being more open world without a fixed travel route as in previous games and combat which has increased its scale from previous games with more enemies present Gummi Ship customization also returns with more options available than in previous Kingdom Hearts games br Various mini games playable throughout Kingdom Hearts III including a cooking themed game featuring Remy from Ratatouille and a music game in the Tangled world Additionally the Classic Kingdom features over games presented in the style of s LCD games such as Game Watch while the Acre Wood world features puzzle games Members of the development team suggested each type of mini game featured with Nomura working on the Classic Kingdom Kingdom Hearts III also has a Memory Archive feature which has several short films explaining the basic story elements of the series from the previous games br br br Story br br br Setting br The story opens with the final scenes of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep A Fragmentary Passage and serves as a conclusion of the Dark Seeker Xehanort Saga that occurs in most preceding games Most of the worlds featured in the game inspired by Disney properties are new to the series including the Kingdom of Corona based on Tangled Arendelle Frozen San Fransokyo Big Hero and the Pixar based worlds Toy Box Toy Story

Barnyard Battle The Klondike Kid and Mickey s Mechanical Man br The Toy Story Monsters Inc and Big Hero worlds feature original stories with the former set between the events of Toy Story and Toy Story and the latter two set after the events of their respective films This is different from previous worlds in the series which have often loosely followed plot lines from the films on which they were based including the Tangled Frozen and Pirates of the Caribbean worlds On the amount of worlds featured in the game Nomura noted the development team focused on creating rich gameplay in an individual world designed so players can take their time and enjoy the gameplay that s available opposed to having multiple different little worlds br br br Characters br The main protagonist and playable character of the game is Sora a year old boy who uses a key shaped weapon called the Keyblade to battle the forces of darkness Sora is accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy the royal magician

from Lilo Stitch Remy from Ratatouille who is referred to in game by his nickname of Little Chef appears in one of the game s mini games at the bistro br Most Final Fantasy characters were excluded from the initial game release as Tetsuya Nomura felt that they would detract from the story and that the Kingdom Hearts characters needed less support than they did before the Moogle character returns as the item shopkeeper while the Re Mind DLC sees previous Final Fantasy characters appear br br br Plot br Yen Sid begins preparing seven Keyblade wielders as guardians of light to counteract Master Xehanort s plan of forging the blade Sora accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy resumes his travels across other worlds to regain his power of waking the ability to restore lost hearts which he lost

throughout their travels by former Organization member Ienzo who uncovers research notes from Ansem the Wise revealing that the hearts of Roxas and two others later identified as Ventus and Xion are dormant within Sora s heart Sora suggests implanting Roxas s heart in an artificial Replica body made by Vexen one of the Organization s reserves after learning that the Organization s time traveling members are using the same method to exist in the present Meanwhile the Heartless Ansem abducts Ansem the Wise from the realm of darkness but Vexen rescues Ansem the Wise Revealing himself as a double agent Vexen enlists fellow reserve Demyx to deliver a spare Replica for Roxas to inhabit br Riku and Mickey are attacked by Aqua who has become corrupted by the dark realm s influence Discovering Master Eraqus s Keyblade on the Destiny Islands Sora uses it to enter the realm of darkness and aid his friends defeating and restoring Aqua Aqua then travels to awaken Ventus at Castle Oblivion which she transforms back into the Land of Departure When she is attacked by Vanitas Sora rediscovers his power of waking and revives Ventus who fends Vanitas off br The seven guardians arrive at the Keyblade Graveyard to battle the Organization only to be consumed by a swarm of Heartless summoned by the possessed Terra Sustained by Kairi s power Sora awakens in a limbo realm called the Final World where a Chirithy guides him in restoring his fragmented body He then uses the power of waking to revive his friends and travel back in time to the moment before their defeat which is averted by the appearance of Terra s lingering will In the guardians ensuing battle against the Organization Terra regains control of his body and reunites with Aqua and Ventus while Roxas and Xion the latter of whom was duplicated as the Organization s final member regain their hearts from Sora and reunite with Lea br After the other Organization members are defeated Xehanort provokes Sora into attacking him by destroying Kairi s body allowing Xehanort to acquire the blade and unlock Kingdom Hearts Sora Donald and Goofy hinder Xehanort by transporting him to his boyhood home of Scala ad Caelum where they eventually defeat him In Xehanort s dying moments Eraqus s spirit emerges from Terra and convinces Xehanort to surrender the blade After sealing Kingdom Hearts Sora decides to use the power of waking to save Kairi despite being warned about the grave consequences of doing so Afterwards Sora s allies gathers at the Destiny Islands where a revived Kairi stays beside Sora before he fades away br In a

a chess game reminiscent of Sora s final battle with Xehanort begin a new game that predicts a battle with Luxu and the Foretellers br br br Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind br Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind is a downloadable expansion set during and after the climax of the game It is divided into three separate scenarios Re Mind the Limitcut Episode and the Secret Episode which are unlocked in sequential order after the original game is cleared br The titular scenario depicts Sora s rescue of Kairi during the game s ending scenes Assuming an incorporeal form Sora travels back in time to the battle between the guardians of light and the Organization passing through the guardians hearts to reach Kairi Despite his initial failure Sora finds and assembles fragments of Kairi s heart in Scala ad Caelum before his past self s final battle with Xehanort restoring Kairi After revisiting the Final World to invite Chirithy to the realm of light Sora visits his friends worlds with Kairi before his disappearance br The Limitcut Episode is set one year after Sora s disappearance his allies have since led an ongoing search for him while Kairi has entered stasis after volunteering as Ansem the Wise s test subject to help Sora During a visit to Radiant Garden Riku analyzes digital copies of Sora and the Organization s members programmed into Cid Highwind s computer hoping to uncover clues to Sora s whereabouts through their battles After the analysis proves inconclusive Riku is approached by the Fairy Godmother to meet with Yen Sid who has determined a method of finding Sora through Riku and two others br The Secret Episode focuses on Sora who has become trapped in the Final World since his disappearance There Sora encounters Yozora who claims to have been requested to save Sora but questions his identity and battles him atop a skyscraper in a modern day metropolis If Sora wins Yozora fades away before Sora returns to the Final World if Sora loses Yozora crystallizes him and goes to the Final World instead Afterward regardless of who wins Yozora awakens in a car while a closing narration ensues in his and Sora s voices with the battle s victor saying None of this makes sense to me br br br Development br After Square Enix finished development of Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix Tetsuya Nomura was approached by Disney who expressed interest in a sequel In regard to a possible release of Kingdom Hearts III Nomura said We have various ideas but we re not at the point where we can say that He added that due to the development of Final Fantasy XV titled Final Fantasy Versus XIII at the time which was being developed by the Kingdom Hearts II team it was physically impossible at the present I feel that it s not the right time to talk about the future of Kingdom Hearts In response to questions about the secret film in Final Mix Nomura noted that it was of a new series in Kingdom Hearts rather than Kingdom Hearts III When asked about Kingdom Hearts III Nomura noted that fans and partners alike were interested in its release and would work to realize it as soon as possible In the Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania guide book Nomura announced three upcoming titles one of which was Kingdom Hearts III However Final Fantasy XV was still his primary focus preventing him from starting production on Kingdom Hearts III He later noted that Kingdom Hearts III would not see a release until after due to his continuing work on Final Fantasy XV regardless of the tenth anniversary of the series occurring in that year The Nintendo DS video game Kingdom Hearts D Dream Drop Distance was announced to connect to Kingdom Hearts III both in terms of gameplay system and story br Sony announced Kingdom Hearts III for the PlayStation with a teaser trailer at its E event in June Square Enix later confirmed the game s cross platform release for the Xbox One as a port of the PlayStation version Though some development and concepts for the game began during the seventh generation of video game consoles it was always intended that the game would release during the eighth generation Unlike Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II which were developed by Square Enix s Product Development Division team Kingdom Hearts III was developed by Square Enix s st Production Department who developed Birth by Sleep Dream Drop Distance and worked on the HD Remix collection and Square Enix s Business Division Rie Nishi serves as the game s producer The game began using the in house Luminous Studio engine to develop the game after some initial development tests had been done using Unreal Engine br Directly after E Nomura claimed that Kingdom Hearts III was announced early based on where the game stood in development He continued by saying planning alongside Final Fantasy XV Kingdom Hearts III is not intended to be the final game in the series and serves as the final chapter of the Dark Seeker Xehanort saga Series producer Shinji Hashimoto stated in September that since Nomura was director of both Kingdom Hearts III and Final Fantasy XV it was expected that there would be a significant gap between the release of the two as they want each game to be perfect in terms of quality Hashimoto also reiterated Nomura s statements about the game s announcement at E as the company thought it was about time it addressed speculation about the long awaited conclusion to the trilogy A short teaser for the game appeared at the end of the Kingdom Hearts HD Remix trailer at E Yasue revealed that the sequence seen in the teaser was the opening scene for the game He added that it was created by Nomura who had a real clear picture of what the starting sequence should be and that the text seen and heard was going to be a real integral part of the story As Nomura stopped working on Final Fantasy XV focusing his attention on other projects including Kingdom Hearts III Nomura revealed that the game had switched to using Epic Games Unreal Engine due to a variety of reasons with the development team having the full support of Epic br In January Yasue revealed that working on HD Remix simultaneously allowed the developers to learn all the best qualities from the series to aid in creating III Additionally he stated the Kingdom Hearts team was sharing knowledge with the Final Fantasy XV team to expand the game and get the most out of the PlayStation and Xbox One A gameplay trailer was released during the Kingdom Hearts Orchestra World Tour in Los Angeles in mid June The possibility of a Nintendo Switch version of the game might be created but wanted to focus on the development and promise of completing the PlayStation and Xbox One versions was thought Nomura noted the long development was due to internal Square Enix corporate decisions such as changing to the Unreal Engine about a year into the game s development which led to extensive delays and a bit of time that needed to be rewinded and started over and certain timing and resources challenges within Square Enix despite submitting and getting approved a plan for when more personal resources would be needed on the project Regarding downloadable content DLC for the game Nomura stated that nothing is set in stone regarding it but he told the development team to be prepared to be able to accommodate for something like that We can t suddenly develop a system where we re accommodating for downloadable content So it s not confirming or denying either way but just so that the development team will be prepared He would later add that he wanted to have some sort of additional content for the game but nothing in depth had been discussed Nomura was open to potentially adding customizable accessories as was able to be done in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep A Fragmentary Passage with Aqua as that feature does not return for Kingdom Hearts III Nomura also preferred DLC to expand or change the game over releasing a Final Mix version as had been done with some past entries in the series br At D Japan Square Enix revealed the game was being developed in three sections with approximately three worlds in each section At that time the worlds in the first section were said to be percent complete and development of the middle section at around percent No update was given on the final section of the game though Nomura stated its contents were something he s always wanted to do and put into Kingdom Hearts ever since the days of working on Final Fantasy It is bound to surprise everyone In April the Classic Kingdom mini games were revealed for the game while also announcing the games would be playable in the mobile game Kingdom Hearts Union A selection of the mini games were made available in Union in its mode added in September which enables players to obtain the Starlight Keyblade in Kingdom Hearts III by completing certain objectives By June the secret film for the game had been created Additionally Nomura revealed the development team was concerned with the size of the game and if it would fit on the game disc To help with this the team was turning some of the cutscenes into pre rendered films to help reduce load times Nomura had requested the use of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in the game which he called his favorite Disney character but was denied such a proposal br At E Nomura also provided an update to the development of the Big Hero world revealing all the gameplay had been created with the cutscenes still needing to be completed At X a world based on Winnie the Pooh was revealed Shortly after it was reported that the character of Winnie the Pooh would be censored in China This was due to the Chinese government banning any depictions of the character after the character s appearance had been compared to that of Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping To improve the Gummi Ship gameplay a criticism in previous entries the development team who created the scrolling shooter game Einh nder was brought in to handle this portion of the game along with other programmers and engineers who have worked on driving games Development of the game was completed by November br br br World selection br Nomura revealed the Tangled world was one of the first determined to be in the game as the development team wanted to include Rapunzel due to her strong personality and her hair finding it fitting for the gameplay The Pirates of the Caribbean world was included because Nomura wanted at least one world based on a live action Disney film stating that the Caribbean location allowed for interesting gameplay opportunities He also chose to have the world be based on the third film At World s End over other films in the series particularly Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man s Chest because Dead Man s Chest is setup for At World s End and the game would have to end the story in the middle as well The world also mimics the color palette from the film being deliberately washed out with the sky for example being more grey blue over t he typical fantasy blue br Since the release of Kingdom Hearts II in The Walt Disney Company acquired Pixar Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm When asked in if any of these properties would appear in Kingdom Hearts III Nomura said he contacts Disney after he hears of an acquisition though he noted that Disney s pretty honest on the possibility of an inclusion If the situation is really difficult they ll say it s really difficult If it s impossible they ll say it s impossible He later stated that even though the Disney Company had acquired these properties Disney Interactive Studios may not necessarily have the ability to license the content due to existing deals such as Disney s deal with Electronic Arts for Star Wars games Yasue added that they were looking at all of Disney the new ones as well when choosing worlds for the game including worlds potentially based on Marvel Comics and Star Wars properties He expanded saying each world needed originally to stand out br Nomura had hoped to include a world based on Toy Story since Kingdom Hearts II saying he felt Sora really fit in and matched well with that world and being able to execute that into the game is something I m really excited for Nomura felt Pixar worlds were extremely important to include in Kingdom Hearts specifically one based on the film Toy Story and stated he considered not making Kingdom Hearts III if he could not get the rights to use Pixar properties from Disney This world was the first submitted to Pixar for approval shortly after the completion of Kingdom Hearts II with Nomura presenting them a general outline of the story he had planned for the world It would take Pixar several years to approve the story and character designs as Nomura and Square Enix were negotiating through Disney not with Pixar directly br Nomura noted the approval process for each world was more difficult than with earlier games because many of the worlds are based on some of Disney s more contemporary films making it harder to take creative license with the worlds He explained Previous to Kingdom Hearts III I think these companies kind of saw it more as like secondary rights permissions They saw it more as a product like you would a branded toy or something Continuing Nomura noted Because we are working with more recent titles the staff who were on the original project are the ones we go to for approvals For instance Frozen The staff is still there and they work with us on Frozen Because we go directly to the creators they have the most passion for their titles br br br Design br In June Nomura discussed the updated visuals saying that the development team tried to return the character s texture to the original paintbrush art from Disney productions The resulting visuals were referred to as the Kingdom Shader Nomura felt it might not seems a massive change it was still a notable evolution of previous visuals Nomura also revealed that Sora is the same proportions as in previous games however they muted the volume on his hair it s not as wild Regarding updating Sora s look from his Kingdom Hearts II design Nomura noted that outfit s popularity but felt the desire to change it since the game is the first numbered sequel since II s release He added that the basis for the resulting design is a mix between Sora s costumes for Kingdom Hearts II and Dream Drop Distance one that is a lot more sleek and sporty in order to make him look more acrobatic Riku and King Mickey also received updated outfits When asked about Noctis Lucis Caelum similarities with Yozora Nomura stated that while he noted there are several similarities between the two characters they hold no connections Roxas and Xion popular characters from Kingdom Hearts II and other games in the series were originally not planned to appear but positive response to their characters led to their inclusion br Speaking on the designs of the worlds Nomura said the updated graphical capabilities allowed the development team to depict the world s of the original film s as close to their original form as possible after previously creating worlds to be a stylized Kingdom Hearts world Disney shared basic polygon information with the development team who ultimately had to remake all of the characters animations and environments from scratch Members of Pixar assisted with the creation of the worlds based on Toy Story and Monsters Inc and for the Pixar characters in the game Pixar shared their actual character models with Square Enix and had the original character designers consult on the game to make sure everything looked as true to the films as we could make it The design team would talk weekly with Disney sharing their assets to receive feedback with Disney sometimes asking for minute alterations such as insisting a character show less teeth having their eyelids move differently or their line of sight adjusted The line of sight notes which came from Pixar were instrumental in raising the general quality of the animation throughout according to the development team br Supporting characters can explore an environment on their own if Sora idles momentarily sometimes triggering additional cutscene moments For example Rapunzel responds if an Aero spell is cast on a group of dandelions Speaking specifically to interactions such as this with Rapunzel Yasue said finding and activating these moments builds trust with her and can lead to additional combat scenarios and treasure opportunities br br br Audio br br br Music br br The game s soundtrack was composed by long time series composer Yoko Shimomura and features additional contributions from Takeharu Ishimoto and Tsuyoshi Sekito Shimomura felt pressure over working in the title since it was Square s first numbered game after several years She wanted fans to look forward to the game believing its content would appeal to the audience The soundtrack includes a highly altered version of the track Dearly Beloved in order to fit the ending of the Seeker of Darkness Arc The soundtrack was released on November the album of which contains CDs The soundtrack that plays during Xemnas Ansem and Xehanort Forza Finale last force in Italian was composed by Yasunori Nishiki of whom Shimomura was a fan Due to the game being released worldwide the team decided to localise titles in multiple languages br As with the first two main Kingdom Hearts games it has a theme song written and performed by Hikaru Utada titled Chikai in Japanese and Don t Think Twice in English It serves as the game s ending theme An additional theme titled Face My Fears by Skrillex Poo Bear and Utada is used for the opening of the game Skrillex a fan of the series originally intended to remix Don t Think Twice before creating Face My Fears which also has a Japanese version Both Face My Fears and Don t Think Twice were released on January br Utada requested that the producer Skrillex produce a remix of the song Chikai for Kingdom Hearts III since it was known that he was a fan of the game He proposed to instead make a completely new song Utada agreed to collaborate with him and songwriter Poo Bear to write the song br br br Voice cast br br Kingdom Hearts III only features English and Japanese voice acting and lip syncing despite previous entries in the series having dubbing in other languages Nomura noted that the development team wanted to prioritize a global simultaneous release for the game and given the time and resources for recording the dialogue this would not have been possible with additional language recordings Though the game has both English and Japanese voice acting it does not have the ability to switch between them as the development team found this feature difficult to properly support A version of the game with Chinese subtitles will also be released Kingdom Hearts III has full voice acting in optional dialogue moments outside of cut scenes which is a first for the series br In the Japanese voice cast Akio Otsuka the voice actor for Xehanort s Heartless Ansem replaced his late father Chikao Ohtsuka who played the villain Master Xehanort Miyu Irino returned to voice Sora and Vanitas as he faced more issues during recordings of the game After finishing the game Irino wondered if he might properly portray Sora in sequels due to his age gap Mamoru Miyano also returned to voice Riku and his replica persona with similar difficulties to his more drastic age gap Miyano reflected that Riku had to act more positive especially when interacting with his replica since he understood his mindset Risa Uchida provided the voice for Kairi and Xion again noting that Kairi had a more mature perspective such as when she befriends Axel in contrast Uchida felt that Xion was more relatable Olaf received a new Japanese voice actor in an updated patch following the arrest of his original Japanese voice actor Pierre Taki br Haley Joel Osment returned to voice Sora in the English version Due to Sora s lack of growth across the franchise Osment faced the challenge of properly giving him the tone of a teenager In retrospect Osment found the idea of ending Kingdom Hearts III as an emotional moment as while the series would not end with this installment the narrative would give proper closure to the story started by the antagonist Xehanort Tony Anselmo and Bill Farmer who portrayed Donald Duck and Goofy in English were overjoyed with their multiple redesigns when the characters traveled to other worlds Other actors include David Gallagher as Riku Riku Replica Bret Iwan as Mickey Mouse and Alyson Stoner as Kairi and Xion Jason Dohring Willa Holland Jesse McCartney and Mark Hamill reprise their roles as Terra Aqua Ventus and Master Eraqus from Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep respectively McCartney also reprises his role as Roxas Dylan Sprouse appears in the Re Mind downloadable content as the voice of new character Yozora and was overjoyed with his character due to him liking Japanese role playing heroes Rutger Hauer voices Master Xehanort replacing Leonard Nimoy after his death in following Hauer s death in Christopher Lloyd portrayed the character in the Re Mind downloadable content br br br Release br Kingdom Hearts III was released for the PlayStation and Xbox One on January in Japan and other Asian countries and on January elsewhere In July at D it was announced that the game would release in Almost a year later at an additional performance of the Kingdom Hearts Orchestra World Tour in Los Angeles the game s North American release date was revealed to be January Nomura spoke to moving the game s release date outside of stating the development team had been told the original release date they had considered was not good timing in the year to release the game especially considering differences in holiday lengths and how stores behave in different regions In addition Square Enix requested the game be released as simultaneously as possible between Japan and the rest of the world and not wanting to move up the release at the expense of development resulted in the January date being chosen The game s epilogue was planned to be added to the game on January for Japan and January elsewhere while the secret ending content was planned to be added worldwide on January This was done in order to help prevent them from leaking beforehand since Nomura called them the biggest spoilers in the game br A deluxe edition of the game features an art book steelbook case and collectible pin Another edition exclusive to the Square Enix store includes Bring Arts figures of Sora Donald and Goofy in their Toy Box outfits in addition to the deluxe edition contents A limited edition Kingdom Hearts III themed PlayStation Pro and DualShock controller was released on January exclusive to GameStop and EB Games in North America br Following the release of the game Nomura confirmed the development of post launch downloadable content saying that the development team s current top priority is on making DLC for KH with the intention of releasing a single content package of DLC in lieu of a separate

Game Informer called Kingdom Hearts III the series at its strongest a game that provide d satisfying answers to the biggest question marks of the series praising the combat and gameplay but panning the sidequests Gummi Ship mode and general repetitiveness of the final worlds Writing for IGN Jonathon Dornbush praised the technical advancements for the game and combat GamesRadar was generally positive but also panned the Gummi Ship game mode for its blandness VideoGamer panned it in general finding it too simplistic and repetitive br Critical response to the narrative was mixed with both RPGamer and GamesRadar finding the visuals of the Pirates of the Caribbean world awkward to watch due to Square s attempt to emulate realism Despite panning the narrative as incomprehensible VideoGamer com found the Toy Story worlds and Pixar in general the most entertaining GameRevolution enjoyed the Disney worlds complimenting both their narratives and visuals The more complex subplots was also generally praised but DenOfGeek claimed it was confusing The absence of Final Fantasy characters in the initial release of the game apart from Moogles were criticized by fans GameRevolution and EGM found that the Organization XIII as final stage villains made the narrative accessible to most gamers and praised the voice acting especially Haley Joel Osment as Sora and Richard Epcar and Paul St Peter as Xehanort s alter egos br Sora s characterization was praised for retaining likable heroic traits though Polygon felt Sora s characterization was off lacking change RPGamer said Sora s hero s journey is mostly shown in the climax His fate in the ending was the subject of analysis due to his apparent death after saving Kairi to the point GameRevolution stated that Kingdom Hearts III did not give the audience the happy ending they expected despite ending Xehanort s arc The ending was generally praised for its bittersweet character endings although GameSpot claimed that heavy handed storytelling inevitably culminates in battles that are impressive set pieces but feel cheap and spammy to play with the story wrapping up in an incredibly unfulfilling way br br br Sales br In

criticized the new boss characters were too difficult to defeat as there are few ways to level up GameSpot and GameInformer called it a director s cut with the former praising the inclusion of Riku Aqua and Kairi as playable characters but criticizing how the main fighting area the Keyblade Graveyard had poor design in contrast to other worlds previously seen in the franchise JXV said that the high difficulty of the boss fights the DLC offers was Square s response to gamers criticism in regards to the easy difficulty of the actual game as well as the return of quick time events from the previous game Kingdom Hearts II Destructoid liked the inclusion of new playable characters and how the new bosses seem to be a response to the easy difficulty Comic Book Resources regarded Data Xehanort and Yozora as the most challenging bosses in the entire game br In regards to the narrative GameInformer found it disappointing as while the game allows the player to explore a new area and see more Final Fantasy characters they are not properly followed Still they felt the new cutscenes helped to improve the game s final act making the story more enjoyable Destructoid enjoyed the new cutscenes that expand on the game s final battle between Sora s group and Xehanort s forces especially because Kairi is given more screentime and plays a more pivotal role in the outcome than in the original game Unlike GameInformer Destructoid praised the new boss characters as fighting them provided the reviewer more fun IGN felt that the narrative was hard to follow as the game ends on a more open nature than the original game GameSpot was more critical to the story labeling it as filler and that it lacks the Disney and Pixar worlds that made the game enjoyable br br br Notes br br br br
