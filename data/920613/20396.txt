Elisabeth Schumacher who operated the track s canteen When Schumacher was four his father modified his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine After he crashed it into a lamp post in Kerpen his parents took him to the karting track at Kerpen Horrem where he became the youngest member of the karting club His father built him a kart from discarded parts at the age of six Schumacher won his first club championship To support his racing Schumacher s father took on a second job renting and repairing karts while his mother worked at the track s canteen Nevertheless when Schumacher needed a new engine costing DM his parents were unable to afford it he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen br Regulations in Germany require a driver to be at least years old to obtain a kart license To get around this Schumacher obtained a license in Luxembourg at the age of In he obtained his German license a year after he won the German Junior Kart Championship Schumacher

Three Championship winning the German Formula Three Championship He also won the Macau Grand Prix under controversial circumstances He placed second behind Mika H kkinen in the first heat three seconds behind At the start of the second heat he overtook H kkinen who only had to finish within three seconds of Schumacher to clinch the overall win In the closing laps Schumacher made a mistake allowing H kkinen to attempt to overtake Schumacher changed his line immediately before H kkinen did the same as the latter moved to overtake and H kkinen crashed into the back of Schumacher s car While H kkinen s race was ended Schumacher drove to victory without a rear wing Schumacher gave the prize money from winning the race to his family as they had debts br br During along with his Formula Three rivals Heinz Harald Frentzen and Karl Wendlinger Schumacher joined the Mercedes Benz junior racing programme in the World Sportscar Championship This was unusual for a young driver as most of Schumacher s contemporaries competed in Formula on the way to Formula One Weber advised Schumacher that being exposed to professional press conferences and driving powerful cars in long distance races would help his career In the World Sportscar Championship season Schumacher won the season finale at the Aut dromo Hermanos Rodr guez in a Sauber Mercedes C and finished fifth in the Drivers Championship despite only driving in three of the nine races He continued with the team in the World Sportscar Championship season winning again at the final race of the season at Autopolis in

trying to set his flying lap in qualifying Schumacher encountered Warwick s Jaguar XJR on a slow lap resulting in lost time for Schumacher As retaliation for Warwick being in his way Schumacher swerved his Sauber into Warwick s car hitting the Jaguar s nose and front wheel Enraged by Schumacher s attitude Warwick drove to the pits and chased Schumacher on foot He eventually caught up with Schumacher and it took intervention from several mechanics and Schumacher s teammate Jochen Mass to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher br br br Formula One career br br br Profile br br Schumacher was noted throughout his career for his speed and racecraft and his ability to produce fast laps at crucial moments in a race and to push his car to the very limit for sustained periods He was also noted for his work ethic pioneering fitness regimen and ability to galvanise teams around him In Slate magazine described Schumacher as the ultimate driving machine and the most dominant athlete in the world due to him having become quicker stronger and fitter than the competition by outworking them in the weight room The magazine also stated that Schumacher changed the sport as he set a new benchmark for other drivers and built the team and technologies around him Schumacher exercised four hours a day mostly to strengthen his neck muscles to better withstand G forces during races After his gym session he would often head to the race track for testing In Deutsche Welle highlighted Schumacher s natural talent for racing and his discipline and leadership In former Formula One rival Giancarlo Fisichella observed that Schumacher did not even seem to have sweated during races adding that Schumacher is the greatest Formula One driver of all time and rewrote the history of Formula One br In F Racing magazine analysed Schumacher s driving style using telemetry data It was observed that Schumacher was very sensitive and flexible on the gas and brakes Compared with his Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello who often either braked or accelerated in a corner Schumacher usually braked later into a corner and stabilised his car by accelerating slightly often using both the brake and accelerator pedals at the same time Exiting a corner Schumacher accelerated considerably and balanced his car by braking lightly Martin Brundle talked about being in awe upon seeing Schumacher s telemetry showing he took turn one on full throttle at the Suzuka circuit With his driving style Schumacher also went km h faster through the hairpin corner of Suzuka compared to Barrichello who lost seconds to Schumacher in this corner It was also observed that when needed such as when the brakes started to overheat Schumacher adapted his driving style to protect the brakes br Motor Sport author Christopher Hilton observed in that a measure of a driver s capabilities is his performance in wet races because the most delicate car control and sensitivity are needed and commented that like other great drivers Schumacher s record in wet conditions shows very few mistakes up to the end of Schumacher won of the races in wet conditions he contested Some of Schumacher s best performances occurred in such conditions earning him the nicknames Regenk nig Rain King or Regenmeister Rain Master even in the non German language media He is further known as the Red Baron because of his red Ferrari and in reference to the German Manfred von Richthofen the famous flying ace of the First World War Schumacher s nicknames also include Schumi Schuey and Schu br Schumacher has often been credited with popularising Formula One worldwide especially in Germany where it was formerly considered a fringe sport In a FIA survey he was voted the most popular driver of the season among Formula One fans Throughout his career Schumacher was subject to anti German prejudices especially from the British media About his collision with Schumacher in British driver Damon Hill wrote There are two things that set Michael apart from the rest of the drivers in Formula One his sheer talent and his attitude I am full of admiration for the former but the latter leaves me cold In addition to Hill Schumacher also had rivalries with Mika H kkinen whom he beat for his first World Championship at Ferrari and the team s first Drivers Championship since the season and Fernando Alonso who ended Schumacher s five consecutive titles in the s Despite only facing him during Schumacher s brief comeback in the s Lewis Hamilton is also seen a rival due to their similar achievements and driving styles and cited him as inspiration br When Schumacher first retired in three of the top ten drivers in that year s Drivers standings were German more than any other nationality Younger German drivers such as Sebastian Vettel felt Schumacher was key in their becoming Formula One drivers In Vettel named Schumacher the greatest Formula One driver of all time During a large part of his Formula One career Schumacher was the president of the Grand Prix Drivers Association a representative body originally set up in that had been disbanded in and Schumacher had helped to relaunch in In Formula One rival David Coulthard hailed Schumacher as the greatest all round racing driver in the history of the sport while three time World Champion Niki Lauda stated He is the greatest Nobody will ever beat him as long as we are alive In Schumacher was voted the most influential person in Formula One history br br br Jordan br Schumacher made his Formula One debut with the Irish Jordan Ford team at the Belgian Grand Prix driving car number as a replacement for the imprisoned Bertrand Gachot Schumacher still a contracted Mercedes driver was signed by Eddie Jordan after Mercedes paid Jordan for his debut br The week before the race Schumacher impressed Jordan designer Gary Anderson and team manager Trevor Foster during a test drive at the Silverstone circuit Schumacher s manager Weber assured Jordan that Schumacher knew the challenging Spa Francorchamps circuit well although in fact he had only seen it as a spectator During the race weekend teammate Andrea de Cesaris was meant to show Schumacher the circuit but was held up with contract negotiations Schumacher then learned the track on his own by cycling around the track on a fold up bike he brought with him br In his debut Schumacher impressed the paddock by qualifying seventh he did so in a midfield car the Jordan which he drove half a day of testing and at a track he had never raced at This also matched the team s season best grid position and Schumacher outqualified veteran de Cesaris Motor Sport journalist Joe Saward reported that after qualifying clumps of German journalists were talking about the best talent since Stefan Bellof Schumacher retired on the first lap of the race with clutch problems br br br Benetton br Following his Belgian Grand Prix debut despite an agreement in principle between Jordan and Schumacher s Mercedes management that would see the German race for the Irish team for the remainder of the season Schumacher was engaged by Benetton Ford for the next race Jordan applied for an injunction in the British courts to prevent Schumacher driving for Benetton but lost the case as they had not yet signed a final contract br br br first points podiums and wins br Schumacher finished the season with four points out of six races His best finish was fifth in his second race the Italian Grand Prix in which he finished ahead of his teammate and three time World Champion Nelson Piquet He also outqualified Piquet four times out of five in the season run in and scored only half a point less than him in the time they were together br br At the start of the season the Sauber team planning their Formula One debut with Mercedes backing for the following year invoked a clause in Schumacher s contract that stated that if Mercedes entered Formula One Schumacher would drive for them It was eventually agreed that Schumacher would stay with Benetton Peter Sauber stated that Schumacher didn t want to drive for us Why would I have forced him The year was dominated by the Williams FW B of Nigel Mansell and Riccardo Patrese featuring powerful Renault engines semi automatic gearboxes and active suspension to control the car s ride height In the conventional Benetton B Schumacher took his place on the podium for the first time finishing third in the Mexican Grand Prix Through what has been described as a tactical masterstroke he went on to take his first victory at the Belgian Grand Prix in a wet race at the Spa Francorchamps circuit which by he would call far and away my favourite track That also marked as the last Formula One car to win a Grand Prix while sporting a H pattern manual gearbox br From the Portuguese Grand Prix to the Monaco Grand Prix Schumacher was not beaten by his teammate when both cars finished was also the first of many times that Schumacher beat his teammate through a full season and Martin Brundle was fired as a result Benetton team boss Flavio Briatore later regretted this decision saying that he had underestimated the ability of both his drivers Schumacher finished third in the Drivers Championship in with points three points behind runner up Patrese and three in front of the Brazilian Ayrton Senna According to Jo Ram rez a close friend of Senna the Brazilian considered Schumacher the next big threat way ahead of all the other drivers around at the time br The Williams FW C of Damon Hill and Alain Prost dominated the season as well Benetton introduced their own active suspension and traction control early in the season last of the frontrunning teams to do so Schumacher won one race the Portuguese Grand Prix where he beat Prost and had nine podium finishes he retired in seven of the other races He finished the season in fourth with points beating Patrese as teammate so much so that Briatore and his team thought that Patrese was washed up and that they had no problem with their car br br br back to back World Championship years br br Schumacher won his first Drivers Championship in Driving the Benetton B which has been called the worst car to have won a Formula One World Championship and was difficult to drive so much so that Schumacher had three different teammates JJ Lehto Jos Verstappen and Johnny Herbert due to crashes Schumacher won the first four races and finished the season with eight wins He won six of the first seven races including the Brazilian Grand Prix in which he lapped the entire field and was leading the Spanish Grand Prix before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear for most of the race Schumacher made two pit stops without stalling and finished the race in second place Benetton boss Flavio Briatore stated that Schumacher s drive was one of the best he had ever seen br The season was marred by the death of Ayrton Senna which was witnessed by Schumacher who was directly behind Senna and that of Roland Ratzenberger during the San Marino Grand Prix there were also allegations of cheating during the Formula One season involving several teams most particularly Schumacher s Benetton having allegedly broken the sport s technical regulations Following the San Marino Grand Prix the Benetton Ferrari and McLaren teams were investigated on suspicion of breaking the FIA imposed ban on electronic aids Benetton and McLaren initially refused to hand over their source code for investigation When they did so the FIA discovered hidden functionality in both teams software but no evidence that it had been used in a race Both teams were fined for their initial refusal to cooperate The McLaren software which was a gearbox program that allowed automatic shifts was deemed legal By contrast the Benetton software was deemed to be a form of launch control that would have allowed Schumacher to make perfect starts which was explicitly outlawed by the regulations Benetton and Willem Toet a Formula One aerodynamicist for over thirty years who worked at Benetton until stated that traction control was legally achieved through rotational inertia There was no evidence to suggest the software was used br At the British Grand Prix Schumacher was penalised for overtaking Hill on the formation lap He and Benetton then ignored the penalty and the subsequent black flag which indicates that the driver must immediately return to the pits for which he was disqualified and later given a two race ban Benetton blamed the incident on a communication error between the stewards and the team Schumacher was also disqualified after winning the Belgian Grand Prix after his car was found to have illegal wear on its skid block a measure used after the accidents at Imola to limit downforce and hence cornering speed Benetton protested that the skid block had been damaged when Schumacher spun over a kerb the FIA rejected their appeal because of the pattern of wear and damage visible on the block The two race ban punishment was seen by many observers as petty and insignificant and that it was a result of Benetton feud with the FIA with Schumacher being a victim and the FIA trying to deny him his first World Championship These incidents helped Damon Hill close the points gap and Schumacher led by a single point going into the final race at the Australian Grand Prix On lap Schumacher hit the guardrail on the outside of the track while leading Hill attempted to pass but as Schumacher s car returned to the track there was a collision on the corner causing them both to retire As a result Schumacher won the Drivers Championship the first German to do so Jochen Rindt the only posthumous Drivers Champion was German but raced under the Austrian flag and whose domination in was later equalled by Schumacher The race stewards judged it as a racing accident and took no action against either driver Although the Drivers Championship had been decided in a similar manner in and public opinion was divided over the incident and Schumacher was vilified in the British media At the FIA conference after the race Schumacher dedicated his title to Senna br br In Schumacher successfully defended his title with Benetton which now had the same Renault engine as Williams according to Motor Sport author Marcus Simmons Benetton had the better team while Williams had the superior car Schumacher accumulated more points than second placed Hill With Herbert as teammate he took Benetton to its first Constructors Championship breaking the dominance of McLaren and Williams and became the youngest two time World Champion in Formula One history The season was marred by several collisions with Hill in particular an overtaking manoeuvre by Hill took them both out of the British Grand Prix on lap and again on lap of the Italian Grand Prix it also saw one of his career s best ovetakes with the one over Jean Alesi giving him the win at the European Grand Prix after he reduced the half a minute gap in the final dozen laps Schumacher won of the races including the French Grand Prix and finished on the podium times It was only once that he qualify worse than fourth at the Belgian Grand Prix he qualified th but nevertheless went on to win the wet dry race finishing seconds ahead of Hill with whom he had ferocious wheel to wheel racing and involved some crucial strategic calls His bad qualifying was a result of a crash he had in the final free practice and by the time his car was rebuilt it had started to rain this ended his race streak of outqualifiyng his teammates that started in after he missed a gear in qualifying in Adelaide in and was outqualified by Nelson Piquet br br br Ferrari br In Schumacher joined Ferrari a team that had last won the Drivers Championship in and the Constructors Championship in for a salary of million over two years He left Benetton a year before his contract with them expired he later cited the team s damaging actions in as his reason for opting out of his deal A year later Schumacher lured Benetton employees Rory Byrne designer and Ross Brawn technical director to Ferrari Ferrari had previously come close to the championship in and The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in the early s partially as its famous V engine was no longer competitive against the smaller lighter and more fuel efficient V s of its competitors Various drivers notably Alain Prost had given the vehicles disparaging labels such as truck pig and accident waiting to happen Furthermore the poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a running joke At the end of although the team had improved into a solid competitor it was still considered inferior to front running teams like Benetton and Williams Schumacher declared the Ferrari F good enough to win a championship although afterwards his teammate Eddie Irvine labelled the F an awful car a piece of junk and almost undriveable while designer John Barnard admitted that the car wasn t very good Irvine also later commented The Ferrari car was a disaster and was nearly undriveable Only someone of Michael Schumacher s ability and maybe Senna could have driven it br During winter testing Schumacher first drove a Ferrari their Ferrari T and was two seconds faster than former regulars Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger had been Alesi and Berger were allowed to drive Schumacher s Benetton B with which he won the World Championship in and they could not believe how Schumacher had won with it calling it the ugly ducking for being so ugly to drive and having many crashes In a interview with his and World Championship rival Damon Hill Schumacher recalled You remember when I left Benetton and Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger took their first steps in that Benetton You remember how many crashes they had I mean that car was really unbelievable Really difficult to drive It was so edgy But it was fast when you just drove it exactly on that edge Now though there have been a lot of aerodynamic improvements to the cars and so the cars I have driven have been a lot more stable And that applies to most of the cars today br Schumacher Brawn Byrne and Jean Todt have been credited as turning the struggling team into the most successful team in Formula One history Schumacher became the byword for Formula One and motorsports in general Three time World Champion Jackie Stewart believed the transformation of the Ferrari team was Schumacher s greatest feat At Ferrari Schumacher scored Grand Prix wins and won five consecutive Drivers titles from to As of only Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes both of whom were Schumacher s successor and his career last team were considered in the same ballpark in terms of dominance and sustained success According to Brawn had Schumacher not retired in and not suffered a ski injury in he would have had a chance at winning his eighth World Championship in In Williams team principal James Vowles who was Mercedes chief strategist during Schumacher s time at the team between and and was instrumental in the team s success in the mid to late s said that Schumacher brought Mercedes together Vowles added Schumacher also knew his performance was perhaps not quite at the same level but he made up for it in terms of the amount of work and dedication he put in From that Nico learned a lot and conversely Lewis learned a lot from Nico br br br World Championship challenges br br In Schumacher finished third in the Drivers Championship and helped Ferrari to second place in the Constructors Championship ahead of his old team Benetton During the season the car had reliability problems Schumacher did not finish in of the races At the French Grand Prix Schumacher took pole position but suffered engine failure on the formation lap He won three races more than the team s total tally for the period from to despite a poor chassis He took his first win for Ferrari at the Spanish Grand Prix where he lapped the entire field up to third place in the wet After a bad start which saw him dropping from third to sixth place before taking the lead on lap he consistently lapped five seconds faster than the rest of the field in the difficult conditions At the Belgian Grand Prix he used well timed pit stops to fend off Williams Jacques Villeneuve He also took first place at the Italian Grand Prix to win in front of the tifosi Ferrari fans br br Schumacher and Villeneuve competed for the title in despite never sharing a podium and almost never battling directly on the track in what has been described as the sport s most dramatic and controversial season finale Villeneuve driving the superior Williams FW led the championship in the early part of the season Schumacher first win of the season came at the wet Monaco Grand Prix in which he took a six second lead after one lap By mid season despite possibly driving not even the second fastest car on the grid Schumacher had taken the championship lead winning five races and entered the season s finale the European Grand Prix at the Jerez circuit with a one point advantage In qualifying Schumacher set the same fastest lap as Villeneuve and Heinz Harald Frentzen He started in second position as Villeneuve set his fastest lap first but was able to jump him at the start Towards the end of the race Schumacher s Ferrari developed a coolant leak and loss of performance indicating he might not finish the race As Villeneuve approached to pass his rival on lap Schumacher turned in on him but retired from the race Villeneuve went on and scored four points to take the championship Despite public outcry the race stewards did not initially award any penalty as they had deemed it a racing incident two weeks after the race in an unprecedented move Schumacher was disqualified from the entire Drivers Championship after an FIA disciplinary hearing found that his manoeuvre was an instinctive reaction and although deliberate not made with malice or premeditation it was a serious error Initially feeling wronged Schumacher accepted the decision and admitted having made a mistake upon seeing the footage when he got out of the car and adrenaline had worn off His actions were widely condemned in British German and Italian newspapers Another view is that Villeneuve went into the corner too fast without Schumacher turning into him he would have overshot the turn and ended up in the gravel In later years Villeneuve himself admitted that he would never have made that corner without Schumacher s push and Schumacher stated in that if he could have his career over again he would do some things differently citing Jerez as something that he would have changed in his career br br In Finnish driver Mika H kkinen became Schumacher s main title rival Driving the superior McLaren MP H kkinen won the first two races of the season gaining a point advantage over Schumacher who then won the Argentine Grand Prix With the Ferrari improving significantly in the second half of the season Schumacher took six victories and had five other podium finishes One of his victories was at the Hungarian Grand Prix a track where overtaking is difficult and that favoured McLaren Schumacher drove consecutive qualifying like laps to make Ross Brawn s alternative three stop strategy work and to go from third to first place Brawn had told him Michael you have laps to pull out seconds We need qualifying laps from you Schumacher ultimately came seconds ahead of David Coulthard H kkinen who started on pole achieved only a point due to reliability issues Ferrari took a finish at the French Grand Prix the first Ferrari finish since and at the Italian Grand Prix which tied Schumacher with H kkinen for the lead of the Drivers Championship with points br There were two controversies during the season At the British Grand Prix Schumacher was leading on the last lap when he turned into the pit lane crossed the start finish line and stopped to serve his ten second stop go penalty which was a result of overtaking the lapped car of Alexander Wurz during a safety car period There was some doubt whether this counted as serving the penalty because he had crossed the finish line when he came into the pit lane the win was valid The FIA rescinded the penalty due to taking minutes rather than within the minutes limit and rejected McLaren s protest At the Belgian Grand Prix Schumacher was leading the race by seconds in heavy spray but collided with Coulthard s McLaren when the Scot a lap down slowed on the racing line in poor visibility to let Schumacher past His Ferrari lost a wheel but could return to the pits although he was forced to retire Schumacher leaped out of his car and headed to McLaren s garage in an infuriated manner and accused Coulthard of trying to kill him Coulthard admitted five years later that the accident had been his mistake From a possible three point lead Schumacher was still seven points behind H kkinen Heading into the final race the Japanese Grand Prix H kkinen held a four point advantage over Schumacher who started on pole but stalled and caused the start to be aborted which meant he had to start from the back of the field He made a comeback up to third but retired after hitting debris from an accident H kkinen won the Drivers Championship by winning the final two races despite Schumacher being the polesitter both times continuing Ferrari s longest World Championship drought br In Schumacher s efforts helped Ferrari win the Constructors Championship the team s first title since He lost his chance to win the Drivers Championship at the British Grand Prix at the high speed Stowe Corner his car s rear brake failed sending him off the track into the barriers and resulting in a broken leg During his day absence he was replaced by Finnish driver Mika Salo About his return Schumacher s Eddie Irvine teammate recalled It was amazing I remember me and Mika Salo were testing at Mugello which is one of the hardest circuits in the world and he Schumacher hadn t driven for eight months He got in the car and within a lap he was a tenth or two tenths slower than I was How do you do that And then of course a couple of laps later he s half a second quicker and it s just impossible It s really really annoying but it was an honour to be able to see his telemetry and see the things he could do with a car After missing six races he made his return at the inaugural Malaysian Grand Prix qualifying in pole position with his career s greatest pole margin with his time faster than Eddie Irvine by almost a second He then assumed the role of second driver helping Irvine to victory and assisting his teammate s bid to win the Drivers Championship for Ferrari with Irvine leading the championship by one point About Schumacher s role Irvine stated He is not only the best driver in the world he is also the best number two in the world In the last race of the season the Japanese Grand Prix H kkinen won his second consecutive title after he beat him off the line Schumacher later said that H kkinen was the best opponent I ve had and the one he respected the most br br br five consecutive World Championships br br in Schumacher won his third Drivers Championship his first with Ferrari after a year long battle with H kkinen Schumacher won the first three races of the season and five of the first eight Midway through the year Schumacher s chances suffered with three consecutive non finishes allowing H kkinen to close the gap in the standings At the German Grand Prix qualifying session which was largely decided in the opening minutes of semi dry weather Schumacher was able to improve his time in the final seconds and qualified second In the race he reitired after crashing out at the start as his new teammate Rubens Barrichello took his maiden win from th H kkinen then took another two victories before Schumacher won at the Italian Grand Prix his th career win At the post race press conference after equalling the number of wins won by his idol Ayrton Senna Schumacher broke into tears The championship fight came down to the penultimate race of the season the Japanese Grand Prix Starting from pole position Schumacher lost the lead to H kkinen at the start After his second pit stop Schumacher came out ahead of H kkinen and went on to win the race and the Drivers Championship he later described it as the fight of his life Although Schumacher won more than twice as many Grands Prix as H kkinen BBC Sport journalist Andrew Benson stated that the challenge from Mika Hakkinen and McLaren Mercedes was far stronger than the raw statistics suggest and that the Adrian Newey designed McLaren was the fastest car in F for the third straight year Benson also hailed Schumacher as unquestionably the greatest driver of his era br In Schumacher took his fourth Drivers title Four other drivers won races but none sustained a season long challenge for the championship Schumacher scored a record tying nine wins and clinched the World Championship with four races yet to run He finished the championship with points ahead of runner up Coulthard Season highlights included the Spanish Grand Prix where he won after H kkinen retired on the last lap due to his car s engine blowing up leading Schumacher to say he was sorry for him and that they had been bloody lucky Canadian Grand Prix where Schumacher finished second to his brother Ralf thus scoring the first ever finish by brothers in Formula One and the Belgian Grand Prix in which Schumacher scored his nd career win breaking Alain Prost s record for most career wins that had stood since br br In Schumacher retained his Drivers Championship In winning the Drivers Championship he equalled the record set by Juan Manuel Fangio of five World Championships Ferrari won out of races and Schumacher won the title with six races remaining in the season which is still the earliest point in the season for a driver to be crowned World Champion Schumacher broke his own record shared with Nigel Mansell of nine race wins in a season by winning times and finishing every race on the podium He finished with points a record breaking points ahead of the runner up his teammate Barrichello This pair finished nine of the races in the first two places br During the season there was some controversy at the Austrian Grand Prix where Barrichello was leading but in the final metres of the race under team orders slowed down to allow Schumacher to win the race Although the switching of positions did not break any actual sporting or technical regulation as Ferrari did the same at the Austrian Grand Prix the previous year where Schumacher finishe second and Barrichello third it angered fans and it was claimed that the team s actions showed a lack of sportsmanship and respect to the spectators Many argued that Schumacher did not need to be given wins in only the sixth race of the season which he would have won anyway a view also shared by Jean Todt and Ross Brawn in retrospect particularly given that he had already won four of the previous five Grands Prix and that Barrichello had dominated the race weekend up to that point At the podium ceremony Schumacher pushed Barrichello onto the top step and the Ferrari team incurred a million fine for this disturbance Schumacher vowed to pay back Barrichello and later that same year returned the favour in several races to help him finish second in the standings At the United States Grand Prix Schumacher returned the favour by giving Barrichello the win by seconds the second closest margin on the finishing line in Formula One history in a failed dead heat finish In an unplanned finish Schumacher s explanation varied between it being him returning the favour for Austria or trying to engineer a formation finish a feat derided as near impossible in a sport where timings are taken to within a thousandth of a second After the end of the season the FIA banned team orders which interfere with the race result the ban was lifted for the season because the ruling was difficult to enforce br br Schumacher broke Fangio s year record of five Drivers Championships by winning the drivers title for the sixth time in after a closely contested battle with his main rivals which was also a result of lobbying regarding the Michelin tyres Before the season started the FIA introduced new regulations and a new points system to make the championship more open The biggest competition came from the McLaren Mercedes and Williams BMW teams In the first race Schumacher was run off track and he was involved in collisions in the following two He fell points behind McLaren s Kimi R ikk nen Despite the death of his mother Elisabeth just hours before the race Schumacher won the San Marino Grand Prix despite being losing the first position into turn one He also won the next two races and closed within two points of R ikk nen Aside from Schumacher s victory at the Canadian Grand Prix and Barrichello s victory at the British Grand Prix the mid season was dominated by Williams drivers Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya who each claimed two victories After the Hungarian Grand Prix Schumacher led Montoya and R ikk nen by only one and two points respectively Ahead of the next race the FIA announced changes to the way tyre widths were to be measured this forced Michelin supplier to Williams and McLaren among others to rapidly redesign their tyres before the Italian Grand Prix Schumacher running on Bridgestone tyres won the next two races After Montoya was penalised in the United States Grand Prix only Schumacher and R ikk nen remained in contention for the title At the final round the Japanese Grand Prix Schumacher needed only one point whilst R ikk nen needed to win By finishing the race in eighth place Schumacher took one point and assured his sixth Drivers title ending the season two points ahead of R ikk nen br In Schumacher won a record of the first races of the season including the inaugural Bahrain Grand Prix and the Japanese Grand Prix only failing to finish in Monaco after an accident with Montoya during a safety car period In August Schumacher s win at the Hungarian Grand Prix contributed to Ferrari s sixth consecutive Constructors Championship and he later clinched a seventh Drivers Championship at the Belgian Grand Prix Earlier in July at the French Grand Prix Schumacher beat polesitter Fernando Alonso with a four stop strategy He finished the season with a record points points ahead of the runner up Barrichello and set a new record of race wins out of a possible surpassing his previous best of wins from the season Between and Schumacher achieved five Drivers Championships wins and almost all Formula One records With his fifth Drivers Championship in a row he also broke Fangio s record of consecutive titles that had stood for nearly fifty years br br br rule changes and first retirement br br Rule changes for the season required tyres to last an entire race tipping the overall advantage to teams using Michelins over teams like Ferrari that relied on Bridgestone tyres The rule changes were partly in an effort to dent Ferrari s dominance and make the series more interesting The most notable moment of the early season for Schumacher was his battle with Renault R driver Fernando Alonso at the San Marino Grand Prix where he started th and finished only seconds behind Alonso Less than halfway through the season Schumacher stated I don t think I can count myself in this battle any more It was like trying to fight with a blunted weapon If your weapons are weak you don t have a chance Schumacher s sole win in came at the United States Grand Prix in a finish with Rubens Barrichello Before that race the Michelin tyres were found to have significant safety issues When no compromise between the teams and the FIA could be reached all but the three teams using Bridgestone tyres dropped out of the race after the formation lap leaving only six drivers on the grid Schumacher retired in of the races and finished the season in third with points fewer than half the points of World Champion Alonso br br became the last season of Schumacher s Ferrari career After three races Schumacher had just points and was already points behind Alonso He won the following two races his pole position at San Marino Grand Prix was his th breaking Ayrton Senna s year old record which was described as perhaps the greatest record that stood in the sport and was a reversal of the race Schumacher was stripped of pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix and started the race at the back of the grid as he stopped

December he said I want to have fun out there and I feel as fresh as ever I ve recharged myself after a three year break The challenge is what I look for I want to know it It has been argued that it was his motorcycle accident the reason why the comeback was not successful In the words of Mark Hughes I believe his motorcycle accident and the damaged neurons from a neck injury that in per cent of
