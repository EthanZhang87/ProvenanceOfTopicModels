fueled by glowing rocks Smash breaks the rocks apart and tosses them to Grab who feeds them into the train s engine They attempt to amuse themselves by turning their work into a game but are hindered from moving freely about the room or seeing out the window by their power cables The cords are so short that the robots cannot touch each other even to high five much to Smash s frustration br One day Smash builds itself a stack of rocks so it can partially see out the window It learns there is a world outside the train and that all the free robots move about unhindered thanks to spherical batteries which can attach to the same port the power cables do Seeing that some of these batteries have been loaded onto the train Smash cuts its power cable and uses what little power it has left to steal two batteries attaching one to itself and the other to Grab so they can flee together br Security robots pursue Smash and Grab and attempt to kill them before they reach freedom Trapped atop the train Smash catches and throws security robots to Grab when they come through the door Grab flings them against obstacles the train passes noticing their batteries explode if damaged One security robot manages to shoot Grab s arm off Grab deactivates and Smash attempts to revive its friend but is confronted by eight security robots Smash deliberately damages its own battery and throws it at the security robots The battery explodes causing a chain reaction which kills the security robots and derails the train br In the crater left by the explosion Grab reactivates finds a powered down but intact Smash and connects its battery to Smash via a cable so both of them can share its power The two high five for the first time and set out to explore the outside world together br br br Cast br Kenny Pickett br br br Production br Smash and Grab is the second short of Pixar s SparkShorts program which consists in Pixar giving employees six months and limited budgets to produce short animated films Writer director Brian Larsen was inspired by the concept of people wanting a change in routine particularly him wanting a change in his work as a head of story in Pixar Larsen used robots as main characters in the film because he felt it was a nice way to express the idea of wanting a change As the film focused on robots Larsen developed it as a science fiction film which departs from most of Pixar s previous projects with the exception of WALL E br Larsen and the animators used Art Deco designs for the film as Larson felt that it felt heavy it felt fast The animators also used simple character designs in the short which Larsen described as almost like appliance toasters The animators also used motion capture for Smash and Grab s movements while having screens in the same room to animate their movements as the characters something Larsen said it was in order to capture data and very quickly get the character s movements into the computer Larsen was very pleased with the film s production stating that he loves making the story come to life br br br Music br Barney Jones who composed the music for the Pixar short film Float composed the music for Smash and Grab The score was released on April br br br Track listing br br br Reception br Smash and Grab received generally positive reviews from critics with many positively comparing the short to Pixar s feature film WALL E Jacob Oller of Syfy Wire wrote that the short is a delightful bit of art deco sci fi outside of Wall E s decrepit view of the future Chelsea Steiner of The Mary Sue said that Smash and Grab like its predecessor Purl takes a simple idea and expands it with delightful and entertaining results It makes us root for two wordless robots and care for them over the course of an minute runtime That s animation at its finest Andy Meek of BGR wrote if you loved Wall E you ll definitely want to check out these ridiculously adorable robots performing mindless factory like jobs and somehow managing to exude charm and likeability with their beeps and boops human like motion and luminescent eyes a la our protagonist from Wall E Similarly Michelle Jaworski of The Daily Dot said that Smash and Grab will instantly invoke images and comparisons to Wall E for its futuristic feel and the robotic focus Alex Reif of Laughing Place said that f ans of WALL E will feel instantly welcomed into the world of Smash and Grab and felt that the short has a clear message inspired by a major societal issue However it handles it far more delicately and with a lot more subtlety This story about two workers who don t get the same luxuries as those who control them also doesn t present a sugary solution to a problem while ignoring others br br br Release br Smash and Grab had its world premiere along with the shorts Purl and Kitbull on January at the El Capitan Theatre The short was released on Pixar s YouTube channel on February and on Disney on November alongside fellow SparkShorts entries Purl Kitbull and Float br br br br br br External links br Smash and Grab at IMDb br Smash and Grab on Disney
