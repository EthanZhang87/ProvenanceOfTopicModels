intimidate Danny against further attempts to enlarge his part br Danny learns from the studio s mascot Woolie the elephant that human actors are normally given more important roles than animals

performance on the ark Darla and Max create a catastrophic flood that washes through Hollywood for which Mammoth blames and dismisses the animals When the satisfied Darla arrives to thank Danny he is

br br br Production br br br Development br The film was launched in as a vehicle for Michael Jackson who would produce star and be a consultant in the music and choreography It would have been a hybrid live action CGI film but by Jackson had ceased to be involved in the film In its earlier stages the film concerned less anthropomorphic stray cats that live among the sets and studio backlots At one point David Shire and Richard Maltby Jr composed songs for the film before Randy Newman was hired br Turner Animation was run by David Kirschner and had originated as the feature division of Hanna Barbera where Kirschner was CEO The Turner Animation writing department added cat characters based on stories about the filming of Warner Bros Studios productions like Casablanca East of Eden and The Music Man stagehands would feed feral cats which dominated the back lot for decades Producers David Kirschner and Paul Gertz then decided to have dance numbers in the vein of classic musical films like Singin in the Rain Kershner felt the style would appeal to a wide audience The s Hollywood backdrop also inspired the premise of anthropomorphic animals being allegories of those who did not look and or sound mainstream struggling to gain attention in Hollywood in the late s br Kirschner contacted Mark Dindal to be director of the project a year after the two met and while Dindal was working on The Rocketeer Around the same time Brian McEntee joined as art director Randy Newman joined as composer and Gene Kelly joined as dance consultant Dindal Kirschner and McEntee noticed the improving animation technology and were excited to see how it would be incorporated with traditional animation in Cats Don t Dance McEntee himself worked on the computer animated ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast The team watched old musical films for reference before asking Kelly who instantly joined due to his interest in the story One meeting took place at Kelly s house between him and Dindal and he vividly remembered how the films he starred in were choreographed br During production management at Turner Feature Animation changed repeatedly and each head that came in attempted to take drastic revisions including updating the setting to the s rock and roll era Dindal said It s pretty hard to try and keep what you have finished so far and then suddenly transition into a different period of time or introduce a different character or have a completely different ending that doesn t seem to fit the beginning you have br Dindal s portrayal of Max was initially a scratch track and was never intended to be heard on the film Dindal wanted Max to be voiced by a professional actor but as the film started running out of money he kept his own vocals in br br br Music br Steve Goldstein composed much of the score For the film Randy Newman composed songs inspired by the classic songs of the Golden Age of Hollywood including Danny s Arrival Song Little Boat On The Sea Animal Jam Session Big and Loud Tell Me Lies and Nothing s Gonna Stop Us Now while the opening and ending pop song Our Time Has Come was written by Martin Page and the end credits song I Do Believe

br Critical reaction br Cats Don t Dance received a approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews with an average rating of The site consensus reads Cats Don t Dance but they should easily entertain all ages audiences thanks to some colorful animation sharp humor and a catchy soundtrack br Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote Decked out with sharp and colorful design work some well drawn characters and six snappy Randy Newman tunes this first entry from Turner Feature Animation goes down very easily but lacks a hook Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three stars out of four He wrote the film is not compelling and it s not a breakthrough but on its own terms it works well Whether this will appeal to kids is debatable the story involves a time and a subject they re not much interested in But the songs by Randy Newman are catchy the look is bright the spirits are high and fans of Hollywood s golden age might find it engaging John Petrakis reviewing for the Chicago Tribune noted Cats Don t Dance would appeal more for adults than children but provided a good moral lesson on prejudice He further wrote the film has the sharp irreverence of the brilliant Who Framed Roger Rabbit There are plenty of clever asides and witty one liners not to mention a few terrific supporting characters br Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times summarized in his review While the animated characters bright colors and an appealing Randy Newman score may keep the children content Cats Don t Dance is no saccharine fantasy Its Hollywood references and dark satire constitute its real strengths Jack Mathews reviewing for the Los Angeles Times described the film as a startling miscalculation He next wrote It has lots of cute animals some jaunty Randy Newman songs and solid if uninspired animation work But blending parody and nostalgia about an era half a century removed from the lives of the core audience seems a foolish indulgence Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote the film was colorful but unimaginatively drawn Also from The Washington Post Jane Horwitz felt children won t get the references to old movies or stars like Bette Davis and Clark Gable Still the action however confusing the music and the characters should hold even toddlers for a while br br br Box office br Cats Don t Dance became a casualty of the merger between Turner and Time Warner It received a traditional theatrical release on March but without fanfare and did not draw an audience The film grossed million in the United States and Canada against its million production budget Dindal and Kirschner told the Los Angeles Times that they were both frustrated with Warner Bros over the lack of advertising and the failed marketing campaign br br br Accolades br Despite mostly positive reception the Stinkers filed the film under the Founders Award in which lamented the year s biggest studio disgraces citing it as loud unfunny and completely over the heads of its intended audience On the other hand when it comes to positive accolades although failing in gathering any Oscar nominations it became historically the first non Disney animated film to win the Best Animated Feature at the Annie Awards br br br br br br External links br br Cats Don t Dance at IMDb br Cats Don t Dance at AllMovie br Cats Don t Dance at Box Office Mojo
