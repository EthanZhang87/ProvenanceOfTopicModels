their retail trade within ten years of a Walmart store opening Presumably people who previously shopped in towns without Wal Mart stores choose to shop in towns with Wal Mart stores part of an older pattern in which smaller centers lose retail sales to larger ones Stone compared the changes to previous competitors that small town shops have faced in the past such as the development of the railroads the Sears Roebuck catalog and shopping malls He concluded that small towns are more affected by discount mass merchandiser stores than larger towns and that shop owners who adapt to the ever changing retail market can co exist and even thrive in this type of environment In later research Artz and Stone reported that in Mississippi the impact of opening a Walmart was much larger on existing retailers in rural communities than more urban ones This also suggests that Walmart has achieved its strongest growth in non metropolitan areas which tend to be low income br Studies of the impact of Walmart tend to focus on Supercenters rather than Neighborhood Markets Comparisons of performance metrics such as sales per square foot suggest that supermarkets and other high volume retailers in direct competition with Walmart Supercenters show significant decreases in profit margins While Walmart has often been said to be a destroyer of small businesses much of this is anecdotal Research so far suggests that Walmart superstores have little effect on smaller retailers such as Mom and Pop businesses A economic analysis published in the journal Economic Inquiry suggested that the process of creative destruction unleashed by Wal Mart has had no statistically significant long run impact on the overall size and profitability of the small business sector in the United States br Impact appears to be related to a number of factors with a key factor being the goods offered for sale A study by Ailawadi and others examined the impact of new Walmarts in detail She reported that median sales dropped percent at similar high volume stores percent at supermarkets and percent at drugstores However percent of specific product categories at high volume stores were unaffected Many retailers reduced prices and cut product selection in an attempt to compete directly with Walmart in effect attacking its areas of strength A more successful approach was to track sales identify vulnerable categories and increase the range of products in those categories By including products at both top and bottom price points and offering temporary promotions on those items retailers could attract both customers who were price conscious and those interested in a wider range of options A small store that specialized in a particular product area could compete effectively against Walmart Small specialized stores are less effective against big box category killer chains such as Home Depot and Best Buy electronics br Some studies have suggested that the impact a Walmart store has on a local business is correlated to its distance from the store David Merriman Joseph Persky Julie Davis and Ron Baiman outlined the impacts of Walmart in Chicago Based on three annual surveys of enterprises within a four mile radius of a new Chicago Walmart it shows that the probability of going out of business was significantly higher for establishments close to that store The overall findings of this study reinforce the contention that large city Walmarts like those in small towns absorb retail sales from nearby stores without significantly expanding the market Ellickson Grieco report in the Journal of Urban Economics that Wal Marts most strongly affect outlets of larger chains that are within miles km of their location br br A literature review concludes that there is no consensus on the impact of Walmart on local employment but most studies on the topic point to a modest increase in retail employment For example studies at the University of Missouri found that a new store increases net retail employment in the county by jobs in the short term half of which disappear over five years as other retail establishments close Similarly a net increase in employment jobs was found in a study of West Virginia counties between and br Like other chain stores Walmart tends to hire local employees for low skilled jobs with low wages and minimal benefits This may increase employees reliance on public assistance programs effectively transferring costs away from employers onto taxpayers Studies examining aggregate retail wage data from states and counties before and after the arrival of Walmart are mixed Some results particularly from nonmetropolitan areas in the South and central United States suggest lowered wages Other studies have found no effect e g Pennsylvania or an increase in wages e g Maryland A paper by Goetz and Swaminathan suggested that U S counties with Walmart stores suffered increased poverty compared with counties without Wal Marts It is difficult to distinguish the effects of opening a Walmart from other factors some of which may be related to the decision to open a store Known as endogeneity bias this makes it difficult to determine whether Walmart chooses to establish itself in communities with greater poverty and joblessness or creates more poverty and joblessness br Studies of socioeconomic well being civic participation and community welfare suggest that large non locally owned businesses tend to be centralized and vertically integrated rely on remote sources and support services and move money expertise and power away from local communities Large externally oriented businesses tend to be associated with lower local standards of living greater inequality and less social and civic participation This research is not specific to Walmart but to large businesses in general br In broader economic terms the Economic Policy Institute estimated that between and Wal Mart s trade deficit

care and issues involving the company s strong anti union policies In November the National Labor Relations Board NLRB announced that it had found that in U S states Wal Mart had pressured employees not to engage in strikes on Black Friday and had illegally disciplined workers who had engaged in strikes Critics point to Walmart s high turnover rate as evidence of an unhappy workforce although other factors may be involved Approximately percent of its employees leave within the first year Despite this turnover rate the company is still able to affect unemployment rates This was found in a study by Oklahoma State University which states Walmart is found to have substantially lowered the relative unemployment rates of blacks in those counties where it is present but to have had only a
