film in In June Moritz hired Justin Lin to direct it Lin who wasn t intimately familiar with drifting when he was approached to helm the project recalled I was in film school when The Fast and the Furious came out and I saw it along with a sold out crowd who just ate it up What really excited me about directing this film was the chance to harness that energy create a whole new chapter and up the ante by bringing something new to the table for the audience who loves action and speed Lin was not enthusiastic at first and was unimpressed by earlier drafts of the script saying I think it s offensive and dated and I don t have any intention of doing it The producers allowed him to develop the film in his own way although it was a constant challenge and he was always battling Universal to make the film better but Lin said that to their credit they were very fair and reasonable br br It was impossible to get the necessary filming permits in Tokyo so they went ahead without permission According to Lin I wanted to shoot in Shibuya which is the most crowded place in Tokyo The cops they re all so polite so it takes ten minutes for them to come over and kick you out Unknown to Lin the studio had hired a fall guy who stepped in when the police came to arrest him and said he was the director and spent the night in jail instead br Following respectable test screenings of The Fast and

drifting and driving stunts in the film Nobushige Kumakubo Kazuhiro Tanaka Tanner Foust Rich Rutherford Calvin Wan and Alex Pfeiffer were also brought in as none of Universal s own stunt drivers could drift Some racing events were filmed within the Hawthorne Mall parking lot in Los Angeles as filming in Tokyo required permits the studio was unable to obtain They instead used street lights and multiple props to help recreate Tokyo br Toshi Hayama was also brought in to keep elements of the film portrayed correctly who was contacted by Roger Fan an old high school friend who starred in Lin s Better Luck Tomorrow Hayama ensured certain references were deployed correctly such as the use of nitrous oxide in straights but not in turns and keeping the use of references to sponsors to a minimum

that director Justin Lin takes an established franchise and makes it surprisingly fresh and intriguing adding that Tokyo Drift is more observant than we expect and that the story is about something more than fast cars Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun felt that the opening half hour may prove to be a disreputable classic of pedal to the metal filmmaking and the last downhill race is a doozy Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said that it s not much of a movie but a hell of a ride Todd McCarthy of Variety gave the film a positive review and praised the good old fashioned genre filmmaking done in a no nonsense unpretentious style adding it stays in high gear most of the way with several exhilarating racing sequences and benefits greatly from the evocative Japanese setting McCarthy particularly praised the work of stunt coordinator Terry Leonard br Michael Medved gave Tokyo Drift one and a half stars out of four saying There s no discernible plot or emotion or humor but the final race is well staged and nicely shot The main achievement of this vapid time waster involves its promotion of new appreciation for the first two movies in the series James Berardinelli wrote When it comes to eye candy the film is on solid ground it offers plenty of babes and cars with the latter being more lovingly photographed than the former However it is unacceptable that the movie s action scenes races and chases are boring and incoherent If the movie can t deliver on its most important asset what s the point Richard Roeper strongly criticized the film saying The whole thing is preposterous The acting is so awful some of the worst performances I ve seen in a long long time Ethan Alter of Premiere magazine was particularly critical of Black s character during the course of this movie Sean makes so many dumb decisions it s a wonder that anyone wants to be associated with him Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said that Tokyo Drift suffers from blurred vision motor drag and a plot that s running on fumes Look out for a star cameo it s the only surprise you ll get from this heap Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle thought It quickly tanks thanks to a lead character with no goals focus appeal or intelligence and a lead actor who s just a little too convincing at playing a dunce adding As for the racing scenes who cares about the finesse move of drifting compared to going fast And who wants to watch guys race in a parking lot Matt Singer of Village Voice called it a subculture in search of a compelling story line and Black s leaden performance makes you pine for the days of Paul Walker br Rob Cohen who directed the first film of the series was very critical of this film saying If you were to just watch Tokyo Drift you d say I never want to see anything related to Fast Furious again br br In critics rankings of the series Tokyo Drift had in the past often appeared on the bottom of the list However over time it has been seen more favorably and was ranked second best in a list of all the Fast movies by IndieWire The Washington Post TheWrap Screen Rant and Collider Esquire magazine and BuzzFeed News ranked it the best of the series br It has become a favorite with car enthusiasts seen as the film in the series most specifically dealing with car culture and focusing on cars themselves Critics and fans have come to appreciate Tokyo Drift

incorporated less realistic storylines including heists and spying the relative simplicity of Tokyo Drift has become more appreciated by critics Tokyo Drift has been described as the movie that kept the series alive since Vin Diesel abandoned his other projects and came back with Lin at the helm br In a interview Christopher Nolan said that although the first film was his favorite he had a soft spot for Tokyo Drift br br Initially seen as a one off character in an almost straight to DVD release Han Lue became a fan favorite due to his portrayal by Sung Kang and was brought back by director
