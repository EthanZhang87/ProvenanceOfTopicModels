sorcerer Merlock who desires something Collie Baba owned The group discovers Collie Baba s treasure in a sand covered pyramid Webby sees a lamp in the treasure which Scrooge lets her keep since it does not retain any value br After packing up the treasure for transport Scrooge and his group are trapped in a room full of monstrous scorpions by Merlock and Dijon who steal the treasure However Merlock discovers that the lamp has been stolen he drags Dijon with him to locate it Scrooge and his friends manage to escape from the pyramid and with nothing more than Webby s lamp depart for Duckburg br Days later the children discover the lamp holds a Genie Ecstatic about his freedom the Genie grants the four children wishes each to trick Scrooge he poses as the boys Woodchuck scout friend Gene Using the lamp s powers irresponsibly their wishes include a baby elephant which runs amok through Scrooge s mansion and a giant ice cream sundae among other things Fearful of a bird flying by at night Genie tells them about Merlock who used his wishes for eternal life and the destruction of Atlantis and Pompeii which were both popular vacation spots Merlock s magic talisman which allows him to take various animal forms also overrides the lamp s rules granting him unlimited wishes Collie Baba stole the lamp from Merlock and hid it away with his treasure and Merlock has spent the centuries since searching for it The children suggest that they wish for the talisman but Genie says that this is the only wish he is unable to grant They must prevent Merlock from obtaining the lamp or the world will suffer br The next day Webby uses her last wish to bring all her toys to life which forces the children to reveal Genie s true identity to Scrooge Wishing to impress the Archeological Society at their annual ball Scrooge wishes for the treasure of Collie Baba and brings the lamp and Genie with him to the ball He is followed by Merlock and Dijon who ambush Scrooge In the ensuing struggle Scrooge mistakes a gravy boat for the lamp and leaves the lamp and Genie behind after which they both fall into the hands of Dijon who is convinced by Genie to keep the lamp instead of giving it to Merlock br Having wished for Scrooge s fortune Dijon takes possession of the Money Bin and other properties and has Scrooge arrested for trespassing However Scrooge is

the fortress hanging on for dear life The nephews use a slingshot to knock the lamp out of Merlock s hands tossing it to Scrooge who loses his grip and falls towards the earth Merlock recovers his talisman and pursues as a griffin grappling with Scrooge in the air but Scrooge knocks the talisman from Merlock s hand turning the sorcerer back to normal as he falls to his death br Recovering the lamp Scrooge uses his second wish to return himself his family and his Money Bin back to Duckburg Back in the Money Bin Scrooge declares that he has had enough of all this wishing and threatens to use his final wish to bury the lamp where it would never be found again After Genie and the children protest he instead wishes for Genie to become a real boy Without Genie the lamp disintegrates and

during this production the other creative artists hailing mostly from France Denmark Australia and Italy As the only American on staff there were many occasions when I had to explain to supervisors or other animators the exact meaning of some American slang phrases used in the dialogue of the script I d like to add that this little movie ended up being quite important because of the many notable animation professionals who got their start on this project Besides myself I ve animated numerous Disney projects also Classic Warner Bros shorts there are among others DreamWorks animators Sylvain Deboissy and Nicholas Marlet French animation director Pierre Lyphoudt and ILM s James Baker and Daniel Jeannette For all the Europeans working on this Disney feature it was a dream come true and because most of us were working on a feature for the first time in our lives in a way it was our Snow White br Director producer Bob Hathcock revealed in an interview that the film began as a five part episode for the TV series adding Our first idea was to see if there was a way to release that as a feature An initial treatment for the film centered on the Philosopher s stone but the idea was later dropped Due to the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit several animators who worked on the film were stationed at Disney s newly founded London studio and another location was established in Paris under the supervision of Paul and Ga tan Brizzi The Disney studio in Burbank designed the characters and storyboards then the materials were sent to Europe Hathcock spent most of his time between London and Paris while ink paint camera work was done in China and additional work in Spain The film was the last Disney feature to use cel animation but also one of the firsts to utilize computer animation br The initial voice overs took one year and another six months were spent on re takes and although Alan Young had never worked with Christopher Lloyd or Rip Taylor before he said he would sit there in awe watching them at work In addition to working with Alan Young and Russi Taylor Rip Taylor spent three six hour stints by himself to record new lines and at one point even phoned in some of his lines I was in Atlantic City when they called me and said they needed to change some dialogue I found a phone in a radio studio and phoned in six or seven pages of dialogue I had to do it seven times because they kept changing the dialogue br During the film s opening credits the title s typeface is similar to that of the Indiana Jones films Another homage to the Indiana Jones films comes later in the movie when someone looking like Indiana Jones can be seen briefly when Scrooge and Genie visit the Explorer s Club These references to Indiana Jones were thanks to Gary Krisel then president of Disney Television Animation who had an obsessive fascination with the series br br br Release br br br Box office br With a gross of million on a million budget the film was not a
