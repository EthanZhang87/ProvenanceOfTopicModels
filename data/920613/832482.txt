Rotten Tomatoes is an American review aggregation website for film and television The company was launched in August by three undergraduate students at the University of California Berkeley Senh Duong Patrick Y Lee and Stephen Wang Although the name Rotten Tomatoes connects to the practice of audiences throwing rotten tomatoes in disapproval of a poor stage performance the direct inspiration for the name from Duong Lee and Wang came from an equivalent scene in the Canadian film L olo br Since January Rotten Tomatoes has been owned by Flixster which was in turn acquired by Warner Bros in In February Rotten Tomatoes and its parent site Flixster were sold to Comcast s Fandango ticketing company Warner Bros retained a minority stake in the merged entities including Fandango br The site is influential among moviegoers a third of whom say they consult it before going to the cinema in the U S It has been criticized for oversimplifying reviews by flattening them into a fresh vs rotten dichotomy It has also been criticized for being easy for studios to manipulate by limiting early screenings to critics inclined to be favorable among other tactics br br Rotten Tomatoes was launched on August as a spare time project by Senh Duong His objective in creating Rotten Tomatoes was to create a site where people can get access to reviews from a variety of critics in the U S As a fan of Jackie Chan Duong was inspired to create the website after collecting all the reviews of Chan s Hong Kong action movies as they were being released in the United States The catalyst for the creation of the website was Rush Hour Chan s first major Hollywood crossover which was originally planned to release in August Duong coded the website in two weeks and the site went live the same month but the release of Rush Hour was delayed until September Besides Jackie Chan films he began including other films on Rotten Tomatoes extending it beyond Chan s fandom The first non Chan Hollywood movie whose reviews were featured on Rotten Tomatoes was Your Friends Neighbors The website was an immediate success receiving mentions by Netscape Yahoo and USA Today within the first week of its launch it attracted daily unique visitors as a result br Duong teamed up with University of California Berkeley classmates Patrick Y Lee and Stephen Wang his former partners at the Berkeley California based web design firm Design Reactor to pursue Rotten Tomatoes on a full time basis They officially launched it on April br In June IGN Entertainment acquired Rotten Tomatoes for an undisclosed sum In September IGN was bought by News Corp s Fox Interactive Media In January IGN sold the website to Flixster The combined reach of both companies is million unique visitors a month across all different platforms according to the companies In Warner Bros acquired Rotten Tomatoes br In early Current Television launched The Rotten Tomatoes Show a televised version of the web review site It was hosted by Brett Erlich and Ellen Fox and written by Mark Ganek The show aired Thursdays at EST until September It returned as a much shorter segment of InfoMania a satirical news show that ended in br By late the website was designed to enable Rotten Tomatoes users to create and join groups to discuss various aspects of film One group The Golden Oyster Awards accepted votes of members for various awards spoofing the better known Academy Awards or Golden Globes When Flixster bought the company they disbanded the groups br As of February new community features have been added and others removed For example users can no longer sort films by Fresh Ratings from Rotten Ratings and vice versa br On September a section devoted to scripted television series called TV Zone was created as a subsection of the website br In February Rotten Tomatoes and its parent site Flixster were sold to Comcast s Fandango Media Warner Bros retained a minority stake in the merged entities including Fandango br In December Fandango and all its various websites moved to Fox Interactive Media s former headquarters in Beverly Hills California br In July the website s editor in chief since Matt Atchity left to join The Young Turks YouTube channel On November the site launched a new web series on Facebook See It Skip It hosted by Jacqueline Coley and Segun Oduolowu br In March the site announced its new design icons and logo for the first time in years at South by Southwest br On May Rotten Tomatoes won the Webby People s Voice Award for Entertainment in the Web category br In February the Rotten Tomatoes staff made an entry on their Product Blog announcing several design changes to the site Each film s Score Box at the top of the page would now also include its release year genre and runtimes with an MPAA rating to be soon added the number of ratings would be shown in groupings from up to ratings for easier visualization Links to critics and viewers are included underneath the ratings By clicking on either the Tomatometer Score or the Audience Score the users can access Score Details information such as the number of Fresh and Rotten reviews average rating and Top Critics score The team also added a new What to Know section for each film entry page which could combine the Critics Consensus blurb with a new Audience Says blurb so users can see an at a glance summary of the sentiments of both certified critics and verified audience members br br Rotten Tomatoes staff first collect online reviews from writers who are certified members of various writing guilds or film critic associations To be accepted as a critic on the website a critic s original reviews must garner a specific number of likes from users Those classified as Top Critics generally write for major newspapers The critics upload their reviews to the movie page on the website and need to mark their review fresh if it is generally favorable or rotten otherwise It is necessary for the critic to do so as some reviews are qualitative and do not grant a numeric score making it impossible for the system to be automatic br The website keeps track of all the reviews counted for each film and calculates the percentage of positive reviews If the positive reviews make up or more the film is considered fresh If the positive reviews are less than the film is considered rotten An average score on a to scale is also calculated With each review a short excerpt of the review is quoted that also serves a hyperlink to the complete review essay for anyone interested to read the critic s full thoughts on the subject br Top Critics such as Roger Ebert Desson Thomson Stephen Hunter Owen Gleiberman Lisa Schwarzbaum Peter Travers and Michael Phillips are identified in a sub listing that calculates their reviews separately Their opinions are also included in the general rating When there are sufficient reviews the staff creates and posts a consensus statement to express the general reasons for the collective opinion of the film br This rating is indicated by an equivalent icon at the film listing to give the reader a one glance look at the general critical opinion about the work The Certified Fresh seal is reserved for movies that satisfy two criteria a Tomatometer of or better and at least reviews for limited release movies from Tomatometer critics including Top Critics Films earning this status will keep it unless the positive critical percentage drops below Films with positive ratings that lack the required number of reviews may not receive the Certified Fresh seal br br When a film or TV show reaches the requirements for the Certified Fresh it is not automatically granted the seal the Tomatometer score must be consistent and unlikely to deviate significantly before it is thus marked Once certified if a film s score drops and remains consistently below it loses its Certified Fresh designation br br In Rotten Tomatoes announced the RT Awards honoring the best reviewed films of the year according to the website s rating system The awards were later renamed the Golden Tomato Awards The nominees and winners are announced on the website although there is no actual awards ceremony br The films are divided into wide release and limited release categories Limited releases are defined as opening in or fewer theaters at initial release Platform releases movies initially released under theaters but later receiving wider distribution fall under this definition Any film opening in more than theaters is considered wide release There are also two categories purely for British and Australian films The User category represents the highest rated film among users and the Mouldy award represents the worst reviewed films of the year A movie must have originally or more rated reviews to be considered for domestic categories It must have or more user ratings to be considered for the User category br Films are further classified based on film genre Each movie is eligible in only one genre aside from non English language films which can be included in both their genre and the respective Foreign category br Once a film is considered eligible its votes are counted Each critic from the website s list gets one vote as determined by their review all weighted equally Because reviews are continually added manually and otherwise a cutoff date at which new reviews are not counted toward the Golden Tomato awards is initiated each year usually the first of the new year Reviews without ratings are not counted toward the results of the Golden Tomato Awards br br Each movie features a user average which calculates the percentage of registered users who have rated the film positively on a star scale similar to calculation of recognized critics reviews br On May Rotten Tomatoes introduced a verified rating system that would replace the earlier system where users were merely required to register in order to submit a rating So in addition to creating an account users will have to verify their ticket purchase through Fandango Media a ticketing company which Rotten Tomatoes is a subsidiary of While users can still leave reviews without verifying those reviews will not account for the average audience score displayed next to the Tomatometer br br In February a new What to Know section was created for each film entry combining the Critics Consensus and a new Audience Says blurbs within it to give users an at a glance summary of the general sentiments of a film as experienced by critics and audiences Prior to February only the Critics Consensus blurb was posted for each entry after enough certified critics had submitted reviews When the Audience Says blurbs were added Rotten Tomatoes initially included them only for newer films and those with a significant audience rating but suggested that they may later add them for older films as well br br Each movie features a brief blurb summary of the critics reviews called the Critical Consensus used in that entry s Tomatometer aggregate score These are written by Jeff Giles a longtime author for the site br In February Rotten Tomatoes added an Audience Says section similar to the Critics Consensus it summarizes the reviews noted by registered users into a concise blurb The Rotten Tomatoes staff noted that for any given film if there were any external factors such as controversies or issues affecting the sentiments of a film they may address it in the Audience Says section in order to give users the most relevant info regarding their viewing choices br br Localized versions of the site available in the United Kingdom India and Australia were discontinued following the acquisition of Rotten Tomatoes by Fandango The Mexican version of the site Tomatazos remains active br br The Rotten Tomatoes API provides limited access to critic and audience ratings and reviews allowing developers to incorporate Rotten Tomatoes data on other websites The free service is intended for use in the US only permission is required for use elsewhere As of API access is restricted to approved developers that must go through an application process br br Major Hollywood studios have come to see Rotten Tomatoes as a potential threat to their marketing In several blockbuster films like Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales Baywatch and The Mummy were projected to open with gross receipts of million million and million respectively but ended up debuting with million million and million Rotten Tomatoes which scored the films at and respectively was blamed for undermining them That same summer films like Wonder Woman and Spider Man Homecoming both received high scores and opened at or exceeded expectations with their million trackings br As a result of this concern th Century Fox commissioned a study titled Rotten Tomatoes and Box Office that stated the website combined with social media was going to be an increasingly serious complication for the film business The power of Rotten Tomatoes and fast breaking word of mouth will only get stronger Many Millennials and even Gen X ers now vet every purchase through the Internet whether it s restaurants video games make up consumer electronics or movies As they get older and comprise an even larger share of total moviegoers this behavior is unlikely to change Other studios have commissioned a number of studies on the subject with them finding that people said they would be less interested in seeing a film if the Rotten Tomatoes score was below and that the site has the most influence on people and younger br The scores have reached a level of online ubiquity which film companies have found threatening For instance the scores are regularly posted in Google search results for films so reviewed Furthermore the scores are prominently featured in Fandango s popular ticket purchasing website on its mobile app on popular streaming services like Peacock and on Flixster which led to complaints that rotten scores damaged films performances br Others have argued that filmmakers and studios have only themselves to blame if Rotten Tomatoes produces a bad score as this only reflects a poor reception among film critics As one independent film distributor marketing executive noted To me it s a ridiculous argument that Rotten Tomatoes is the problem make a good movie ComScore s Paul Dergarabedian had similar comments saying The best way for studios to combat the Rotten Tomatoes Effect is to make better movies plain and simple br Some studios have suggested embargoing or cancelling early critic screenings in a response to poor reviews prior to a film s release affecting pre sales and opening weekend numbers In July Sony embargoed critic reviews for The Emoji Movie until mid day the Thursday before its release The film ended up with a rating including after the first reviews but still opened to million on par with projections Josh Greenstein Sony Pictures President of Worldwide Marketing and Distribution said The Emoji Movie was built for people under so we wanted to give the movie its best chance What other wide release with a score under percent has opened north of million I don t think there is one Conversely Warner Bros also did not do critic pre screenings for The House which held a score of until the day of its release and opened to just million the lowest of star Will Ferrell s career br That marketing tactic can backfire and drew the vocal disgust of influential critics such as Roger Ebert who was prone to derisively condemn such moves with gestures such as The Wagging Finger of Shame on At the Movies Furthermore the very nature of withholding reviews can draw early conclusions from the public that the film is of poor quality because of that marketing tactic br On February in response to issues surrounding coordinated bombing of user reviews for several films most notably Captain Marvel and Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker prior to their release the site announced that user reviews would no longer be accepted until a film is publicly released The site also announced plans to introduce a system for verified reviews and that the Want to See statistic would now be expressed as a number so that it would not be confused with the audience score br In April The Snowman a film starring Michael Fassbender reached the No spot in America on Netflix s Current Top Most Watched list despite it holding a score on Rotten Tomatoes of br Despite arguments on how Rotten Tomatoes scores impact the box office academic researchers so far have not found evidence that Rotten Tomatoes ratings affect box office performance br br In January on the occasion of the th anniversary of the New York Film Critics Circle its chairman Armond White cited Rotten Tomatoes in particular and film review aggregators in general as examples of how the Internet takes revenge on individual expression He said they work by dumping reviewers onto one website and assigning spurious percentage enthusiasm points to the discrete reviews According to White such websites offer consensus as a substitute for assessment Landon Palmer a film and media historian and an assistant professor in the Department of Journalism and Creative Media director in the College of Communication and Information Sciences at the University of Alabama agreed with White stating that Rotten Tomatoes applies a problematic algorithm to pretty much all avenues of modern media art and entertainment br Director and producer Brett Ratner has criticized the website for reducing hundreds of reviews culled from print and online sources into a popularized aggregate score while expressing respect for traditional film critics Writer Max Landis following his film Victor Frankenstein receiving an approval rating of on the site wrote that the site breaks down entire reviews into just the word yes or no making criticism binary in a destructive arbitrary way br br Vulture ran an article in September that raised several criticisms including the ease at which large companies are able to manipulate reviewer ratings The article cited publicity company Bunker as an example of how scores can be boosted by recruiting obscure often self published reviewers using the example of s Ophelia br Rotten Tomatoes responded by delisting several Bunker films including Ophelia It told Vulture in a statement We take the integrity of our scores seriously and do not tolerate any attempts to manipulate them We have a dedicated team who monitors our platforms regularly and thoroughly investigates and resolves any suspicious activity br WIRED published an article in February written by Christopher Null a former film critic that argued such methods are standard activities performed by all PR agencies In particular Null points out that sponsoring legitimate honest reviews has a long history in other industries and is a common tactic employed by indie titles to get visibility br br American director Martin Scorsese wrote a column in The Hollywood Reporter criticizing both Rotten Tomatoes and CinemaScore for promoting the idea that films like Mother had to be instantly liked to be successful Scorsese in a dedication for the Roger Ebert Center for Film Studies at the University of Illinois later continued his criticism voicing that Rotten Tomatoes and other review services devalue cinema on streaming platforms to the level of content br In while promoting the film Suffragette which has a approval rating actress Meryl Streep accused Rotten Tomatoes of disproportionately representing the opinions of male film critics resulting in a skewed ratio that adversely affected the commercial performances of female driven films I submit to you that men and women are not the same they like different things she said Sometimes they like the same thing but sometimes their tastes diverge If the Tomatometer is slighted so completely to one set of tastes that drives box office in the United States absolutely Critics took issue with the sentiment that someone s gender or ethnic background would dictate their response to art br Rotten Tomatoes deliberately withheld the critic score for Justice League based on early reviews until the premiere of its See It Skip It episode on the Thursday before its release Some critics viewed the move as a ploy to promote the web series but some argued that the move was a deliberate conflict of interest on account of Warner Bros ownership of the film and Rotten Tomatoes and the tepid critical reception of the DC Extended Universe films at the time br The New York Times aggregated statistics on the critical reception of audience scores versus critic scores and noticed in almost every genre that The public rates a movie more positively than do the critics The only exceptions are black comedies and documentaries Critics systematically rate films in these genres more highly than do Rotten Tomatoes users Slate magazine collected data in a similar survey that revealed a noticeable favor for movies released before the s that may be explained by a bias toward reviewers reviewing or Rotten
