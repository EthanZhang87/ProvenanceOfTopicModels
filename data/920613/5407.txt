California is a state in the Western United States lying on the American Pacific Coast It borders Oregon to the north Nevada and Arizona to the east and a international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south With million residents across an area of square miles km it is the most populous U S state the third largest by area and most populated subnational entity in North America The Greater Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas are the nation s second and fifth most populous urban regions with million and million residents respectively Los Angeles is the state s most populous city and the nation s second most after New York California s capital Sacramento is located in the Central Valley br Prior to European colonization California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre Columbian North America European exploration in the th and th centuries led to the colonization by the Spanish Empire The area became a part of Mexico in following its successful war for independence but was ceded to the United States in after the Mexican American War The California Gold Rush started in and led to social and demographic changes including depopulation of indigenous peoples in the California genocide The western portion of Alta California was then organized and admitted as the st state in as a free state following the Compromise of br Notable contributions to popular culture ranging from entertainment sports music and fashion have their origins in California The state has made contributions in communication information innovation education environmentalism entertainment economics politics technology and religion California is the home of Hollywood the oldest and one of the largest film industries in the world profoundly influencing global entertainment It is the point of origin of hippie counterculture blue jeans the internet the personal computer Barbie and skateboarding among other inventions The San Francisco Bay and the Greater Los Angeles areas are seen as the centers of the global technology and U S film industries respectively br California s economy is the largest of any US state with a trillion gross state product as of It is the largest sub national economy in the world California s agricultural industry has the highest output of any U S state and is led by its dairy almonds and grapes With the busiest port in the country Los Angeles California plays a pivotal role in the global supply chain hauling in about of goods imported to the US of residents or older hold a high school degree the lowest high school education rate of all states Despite a continuing exodus of businesses from Downtown San Francisco and Downtown Los Angeles California retains one of the largest number of Fortune companies br The state s diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast and metropolitan areas in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountains in the east and from the redwood and Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast Two thirds of the nation s earthquake risk lies in California The Central Valley a fertile agricultural area dominates the state s center California is known for its warm Mediterranean climate along the coast and monsoon seasonal weather inland The large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior as well as snowy alpine in the mountains Droughts and wildfires are an ongoing issue br br br Etymology br br The Spaniards gave the name Las Californias to the peninsula of Baja California in modern day Mexico As Spanish explorers and settlers moved north and inland the region known as California or Las Californias grew Eventually it included lands north of the peninsula Alta California part of which became the present day U S state of California br A state legislative document states Numerous theories exist as to the origin and meaning of the word California and that all anyone knows is the name was added to a map by presumably by a Spanish navigator br The name most likely derived from the mythical island of California in the fictional story of Queen Calafia as recorded in a work The Adventures of Esplandi n by Garci Rodr guez de Montalvo Queen Calafia s kingdom was said to be a remote land rich in gold and pearls inhabited by beautiful Black women who wore gold armor and lived like Amazons as well as griffins and other strange beasts br Official abbreviations of the state s name include CA Cal Calif and US CA br br br History br br br Indigenous br br California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre Columbian North America Historians generally agree that there were at least people living in California prior to European colonization The indigenous peoples of California included more than distinct ethnic groups inhabiting environments ranging from mountains and deserts to islands and redwood forests br Living in these diverse geographic areas the indigenous peoples developed complex forms of ecosystem management including forest gardening to ensure the regular availability of food and medicinal plants This was a form of sustainable agriculture To mitigate destructive large wildfires from ravaging the natural environment indigenous peoples developed a practice of controlled burning This practice was recognized for its benefits by the California government in br These groups were also diverse in their political organization with bands tribes villages and on the resource rich coasts large chiefdoms such as the Chumash Pomo and Salinan Trade intermarriage craft specialists and military alliances fostered social and economic relationships between many groups Although nations would sometimes war most armed conflicts were between groups of men for vengeance Acquiring territory was not usually the purpose of these small scale battles br Men and women generally had different roles in society Women were often responsible for weaving harvesting processing and preparing food while men for hunting and other forms of physical labor Most societies also had roles for people whom the Spanish referred to as joyas who they saw as men who dressed as women Joyas were responsible for death burial and mourning rituals and they performed women s social roles Indigenous societies had terms such as two spirit to refer to them The Chumash referred to them as aqi The early Spanish settlers detested and sought to eliminate them br br br Spanish period br br The first Europeans to explore the coast of California were the members of a Spanish maritime expedition led by Portuguese captain Juan Rodr guez Cabrillo in Cabrillo was commissioned by Antonio de Mendoza the Viceroy of New Spain to lead an expedition up the Pacific coast in search of trade opportunities they entered San Diego Bay on September and reached at least as far north as San Miguel Island Privateer and explorer Francis Drake explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in landing north of the future city of San Francisco The first Asians to set foot on what would be the United States occurred in when Filipino sailors arrived in Spanish ships at Morro Bay Coincidentally the descendants of the Muslim Caliph Hasan ibn Ali in formerly Islamic Manila and had converted then mixed Christianity with Islam upon Spanish conquest transited through California Named after a Caliph on their way to Guerrero Mexico where they played a future role in the wars of independence Sebasti n Vizca no explored and mapped the coast of California in for New Spain putting ashore in Monterey Despite the on the ground explorations of California in the th century Rodr guez s idea of California as an island persisted Such depictions appeared on many European maps well into the th century br The Portol expedition of was a pivotal event in the Spanish colonization of California resulting in the establishment of numerous missions presidios and pueblos The military and civil contingent of the expedition was led by Gaspar de Portol who traveled over land from Sonora into California while the religious component was headed by Jun pero Serra who came by sea from Baja California In Portol and Serra established Mission San Diego de Alcal and the Presidio of San Diego the first religious and military settlements founded by the Spanish in California By the end of the expedition in they would establish the Presidio of Monterey and Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on Monterey Bay br br After the Portol expedition Spanish missionaries led by Father President Serra set out to establish Spanish missions of California along El Camino Real The Royal Road and along the California coast sites of which having been chosen during the Portol expedition Numerous major cities in California grew out of missions including San Francisco Mission San Francisco de As s San Diego Mission San Diego de Alcal Ventura Mission San Buenaventura or Santa Barbara Mission Santa Barbara among others br Juan Bautista de Anza led a similarly important expedition throughout California in which would extend deeper into the interior and north of California The Anza expedition selected numerous sites for missions presidios and pueblos which subsequently would be established by settlers Gabriel Moraga a member of the expedition would also christen many of California s prominent rivers with their names in such as the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River After the expedition Gabriel s son Jos Joaqu n Moraga would found the pueblo of San Jose in making it the first civilian established city in California br br During this same period sailors from the Russian Empire explored along the northern coast of California In the Russian American Company established a trading post and small fortification at Fort Ross on the North Coast Fort Ross was primarily used to supply Russia s Alaskan colonies with food supplies The settlement did not meet much success failing to attract settlers or establish long term trade viability and was abandoned by br During the War of Mexican Independence Alta California was largely unaffected and uninvolved in the revolution though many Californios supported independence from Spain which many believed had neglected California and limited its development Spain s trade monopoly on California had limited local trade prospects Following Mexican independence California ports were freely able to trade with foreign merchants Governor Pablo Vicente de Sol presided over the transition from Spanish colonial rule to independent Mexican rule br br br Mexican period br br In the Mexican War of Independence gave the Mexican Empire which included California independence from Spain For the next years Alta California remained a remote sparsely populated northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of Mexico which shortly after independence became a republic The missions which controlled most of the best land in the state were secularized by and became the property of the Mexican government The governor granted many square leagues of land to others with political influence These huge ranchos or cattle ranches emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios Hispanics native of California who traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants Beef did not become a commodity until the California Gold Rush br From the s trappers and settlers from the United States and Canada began to arrive in Northern California These new arrivals used the Siskiyou Trail California Trail Oregon Trail and Old Spanish Trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding California The early government of the newly independent Mexico was highly unstable and in a reflection of this from onwards California also experienced a series of armed disputes both internal and with the central Mexican government During this tumultuous political period Juan Bautista Alvarado was able to secure the governorship during The military action which first brought Alvarado to power had momentarily declared California to be an independent state and had been aided by Anglo American residents of California including Isaac Graham In one hundred of those residents who did not have passports were arrested leading to the Graham Affair which was resolved in part with the intercession of Royal Navy officials br br One of the largest ranchers in California was John Marsh After failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the Mexican courts he determined that California should become part of the United States Marsh conducted a letter writing campaign espousing the California climate the soil and other reasons to settle there as well as the best route to follow which became known as Marsh s route His letters were read reread passed around and printed in newspapers throughout the country and started the first wagon trains rolling to California After ushering in the period of organized emigration to California Marsh became involved in a military battle between the much hated Mexican general Manuel Micheltorena and the California governor he had replaced Juan Bautista Alvarado At the Battle of Providencia near Los Angeles he convinced each side that they had no reason to be fighting each other As a result of Marsh s actions they abandoned the fight Micheltorena was defeated and California born Pio Pico was returned to the governorship This paved the way to California s ultimate acquisition by the United States br br br U S Conquest and the California Republic br br In a group of American settlers in and around Sonoma rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt Afterward rebels raised the Bear Flag featuring a bear a star a red stripe and the words California Republic at Sonoma The Republic s only president was William B Ide who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt This revolt by American settlers served as a prelude to the later American military invasion of California and was closely coordinated with nearby American military commanders br The California Republic was short lived the same year marked the outbreak of the Mexican American War br Commodore John D Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into Monterey Bay in and began the U S military invasion of California with Northern California capitulating in less than a month to the United States forces In Southern California Californios continued to resist American forces Notable military engagements of the conquest include the Battle of San Pasqual and the Battle of Dominguez Rancho in Southern California as well as the Battle of Ol mpali and the Battle of Santa Clara in Northern California After a series of defensive battles in the south the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the Californios on January securing a censure and establishing de facto American control in California br br br Early American period br br Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo February that ended the war the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona Nevada Colorado and Utah The even more lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of Mexico In the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than plus about Native Americans down from about before Hispanic settlement in br In only one week before the official American annexation of the area gold was discovered in California this being an event which was to forever alter both the state s demographics and its finances Soon afterward a massive influx of immigration into the area resulted as prospectors and miners arrived by the thousands The population burgeoned with United States citizens Europeans Middle Easterns Chinese and other immigrants during the great California Gold Rush By the time of California s application for statehood in the settler population of California had multiplied to By more than settlers had come Between and the population of San Francisco increased from to br br The seat of government for California under Spanish and later Mexican rule had been located in Monterey from until Pio Pico the last Mexican governor of Alta California had briefly moved the capital to Los Angeles in The United States consulate had also been located in Monterey under consul Thomas O Larkin br In a state Constitutional Convention was first held in Monterey Among the first tasks of the convention was a decision on a location for the new state capital The first full legislative sessions were held in San Jose Subsequent locations included Vallejo and nearby Benicia these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well The capital has been located in Sacramento since with only a short break in when legislative sessions were held in San Francisco due to flooding in Sacramento br Once the state s Constitutional Convention had finalized its state constitution it applied to the U S Congress for admission to statehood On September as part of the Compromise of California became a free state and September a state holiday br During the American Civil War California sent gold shipments eastward to Washington in support of the Union However due to the existence of a large contingent of pro South sympathizers within the state the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the Union war effort Still several smaller military units within the Union army such as the California Company were unofficially associated with the state of California due to a majority of their members being from California br At the time of California s admission into the Union travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time consuming and dangerous feat Nineteen years later and seven years after it was greenlighted by President Lincoln the first transcontinental railroad was completed in California was then reachable from the eastern States in a week s time br Much of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general Vast expanses of wheat other cereal crops vegetable crops cotton and nut and fruit trees were grown including oranges in Southern California and the foundation was laid for the state s prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere br In the nineteenth century a large number of migrants from China traveled to the state as part of the Gold Rush or to seek work Even though the Chinese proved indispensable in building the transcontinental railroad from California to Utah perceived job competition with the Chinese led to anti Chinese riots in the state and eventually the US ended migration from China partially as a response to pressure from California with the Chinese Exclusion Act br br br California Genocide br br Under earlier Spanish and Mexican rule California s original native population had precipitously declined above all from Eurasian diseases to which the indigenous people of California had not yet developed a natural immunity Under its new American administration California s first governor Peter Hardeman Burnett instituted policies that have been described as a state sanctioned policy of elimination toward California s indigenous people Burnett announced in in his Second Annual Message to the Legislature That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert br As in other American states indigenous peoples were forcibly removed from their lands by American settlers like miners ranchers and farmers Although California had entered the American union as a free state the loitering or orphaned Indians were de facto enslaved by their new Anglo American masters under the Act for the Government and Protection of Indians One of these de facto slave auctions was approved by the Los Angeles City Council and occurred for nearly twenty years There were many massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed by settlers for their land br Between and the California state government paid around million dollars some of which was reimbursed by the federal government to hire militias with the stated purpose of protecting settlers however these militias perpetrated numerous massacres of indigenous people Indigenous people were also forcibly moved to reservations and rancherias which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to adequately sustain the populations living on them As a result settler colonialism was a calamity for indigenous people Several scholars and Native American activists including Benjamin Madley and Ed Castillo have described the actions of the California government as a genocide as well as the th governor of California Gavin Newsom Benjamin Madley estimates that from to between and indigenous people were killed including between and killed by the U S Army br br br present br br In the th century thousands of Japanese people migrated to California The state in passed the Alien Land Act excluding Asian immigrants from owning land During World War II Japanese Americans in California were interned in concentration camps in California apologized br Migration to California accelerated during the early th century with the completion of transcontinental highways like the Route From to the population grew from fewer than one million to the greatest in the Union In the Census Bureau reported California s population as Hispanic Asian and non Hispanic white br To meet the population s needs engineering feats like the California and Los Angeles Aqueducts the Oroville and Shasta Dams and the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges were built The state government adopted the California Master Plan for Higher Education in to develop an efficient system of public education br br Meanwhile attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate cheap land and the state s variety of geography filmmakers established the studio system in Hollywood in the s California manufactured of US armaments produced during World War II ranking third behind New York and Michigan California easily ranked first in production of military ships at drydock facilities in San Diego Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area Due to the hiring opportunities California offered during the conflict the population multiplied from the immigration it received due to the work in its war factories military bases and training facilities After World War II California s economy expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries whose size decreased following the end of the Cold War Stanford University began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay instead of leaving the state and develop a high tech region now known as Silicon Valley As a result of this California is a world center of the entertainment and music industries of technology engineering and the aerospace industry and as the US center of agricultural production Just before the Dot Com Bust California had the fifth largest economy in the world br In the mid and late twentieth century race related incidents occurred Tensions between police and African Americans combined with unemployment and poverty in inner cities led to riots such as the Rodney King riots California was the hub of the Black Panther Party known for arming African Americans to defend against racial injustice Mexican Filipino and other migrant farm workers rallied in the state around Cesar Chavez for better pay in the s and s br br During the th century two great disasters happened the San Francisco earthquake and St Francis Dam flood remain the deadliest in U S history br Although air pollution has been reduced health problems associated with pollution continue Brown haze known as smog has been substantially abated after federal and state restrictions on automobile exhaust An energy crisis in led to rolling blackouts soaring power rates and the importation of electricity from neighboring states Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Company came under heavy criticism br Housing prices in urban areas continued to increase a modest home which in the s cost would cost half a million dollars or more in urban areas by More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas Speculators bought houses expecting to make a huge profit in months then rolling it over by buying more properties Mortgage companies were compliant as people assumed prices would keep rising The bubble burst in as prices began to crash Hundreds of billions in property values vanished and foreclosures soared as financial institutions and investors were badly hurt br br In the st century droughts and frequent wildfires attributed to climate change have occurred From to a persistent drought was the worst in its recorded history The wildfire season was the state s deadliest and most destructive br One of the first confirmed COVID cases in the United States occurred in California on January A state of emergency was declared in the state on March and remained in effect until Governor Gavin Newsom ended it in February A mandatory statewide stay at home order was issued on March which was ended in January br Cultural and language revitalization efforts among indigenous Californians have progressed among tribes as of Some land returns to indigenous stewardship have occurred In the largest dam removal and river restoration project in US history was announced for the Klamath River as a win for California tribes br br br Geography br br Covering an area of sq mi km California is the third largest state in the United States in area after Alaska and Texas California is one of the most geographically diverse states in the union and is often geographically bisected into two regions Southern California comprising the ten southernmost counties and Northern California comprising the northernmost counties It is bordered by Oregon to the north Nevada to the east and northeast Arizona to the southeast the Pacific Ocean to the west and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south with which it makes up part of The Californias region of North America alongside Baja California Sur br In the middle of the state lies the California Central Valley bounded by the Sierra Nevada in the east the coastal mountain ranges in the west the Cascade Range to the north and by the Tehachapi Mountains in the south The Central Valley is California s productive agricultural heartland br Divided in two by the Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta the northern portion the Sacramento Valley serves as the watershed of the Sacramento River while the southern portion the San Joaquin Valley is the watershed for the San Joaquin River Both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them With dredging the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports br br The Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta is a critical water supply hub for the state Water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state to the Central Valley and the State Water Projects and other needs Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly million people almost two thirds of the state s population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley br Suisun Bay lies at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers The water is drained by the Carquinez Strait which flows into San Pablo Bay a northern extension of San Francisco Bay which then connects to the Pacific Ocean via the Golden Gate strait br The Channel Islands are located off the Southern coast while the Farallon Islands lie west of San Francisco br The Sierra Nevada Spanish for snowy range includes the highest peak in the contiguous states Mount Whitney at feet m The range embraces Yosemite Valley famous for its glacially carved domes and Sequoia National Park home to the giant sequoia trees the largest living organisms on Earth and the deep freshwater lake Lake Tahoe the largest lake in the state by volume br To the east of the Sierra Nevada are Owens Valley and Mono Lake an essential migratory bird habitat In the western part of the state is Clear Lake the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California Although Lake Tahoe is larger it is divided by the California Nevada border The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers including Palisade Glacier the southernmost glacier in the United States br br The Tulare Lake was the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River A remnant of Pleistocene era Lake Corcoran Tulare Lake dried up by the early th century after its tributary rivers were diverted for agricultural irrigation and municipal water uses br About percent of the state s total surface area is covered by forests and California s diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state California contains more forestland than any other state except Alaska Many of the trees in the California White Mountains are the oldest in the world an individual bristlecone pine is over years old br In the south is a large inland salt lake the Salton Sea The south central desert is called the Mojave to the northeast of the Mojave lies Death Valley which contains the lowest and hottest place in North America the Badwater Basin at feet m The horizontal distance from the bottom of Death Valley to the top of Mount Whitney is less than miles km Indeed almost all of southeastern California is arid hot desert with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the Colorado River from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water br A majority of California s cities are located in either the San Francisco Bay Area or the Sacramento metropolitan area in Northern California or the Los Angeles area the Inland Empire or the San Diego metropolitan area in Southern California The Los Angeles Area the Bay Area and the San Diego metropolitan area are among several major metropolitan areas along the California coast br As part of the Ring of Fire California is subject to tsunamis floods droughts Santa Ana winds wildfires and landslides on steep terrain California also has several volcanoes It has many earthquakes due to several faults running through the state the largest being the San Andreas Fault About earthquakes are recorded each year most are too small to be felt but two thirds of the human risk from earthquakes lies in California br br br Climate br br Most of the state has a Mediterranean climate The cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast Farther inland there are colder winters and hotter summers The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of Los Angeles and San Francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent Even the San Diego shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States Just a few miles inland summer temperature extremes are significantly higher with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast The same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the Bay Area where areas sheltered from the ocean experience significantly hotter summers and colder winters in contrast with nearby areas closer to the ocean br br Northern parts of the state have more rain than the south California s mountain ranges also influence the climate some of the rainiest parts of the state are west facing mountain slopes Coastal northwestern California has a temperate climate and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast The high mountains including the Sierra Nevada have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer br California s mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side creating extensive deserts The higher elevation deserts of eastern California have hot summers and cold winters while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters Death Valley a desert with large expanses below sea level is considered the hottest location in the world the highest temperature in the world F C was recorded there on July The lowest temperature in California was F C on January in Boca br The table below lists average temperatures for January and August in a selection of places throughout the state some highly populated and some not This includes the relatively cool summers of the Humboldt Bay region around Eureka the extreme heat of Death Valley and the mountain climate of Mammoth in the Sierra Nevada br br The wide range of climates leads to a high demand for water Over time droughts have been increasing due to climate change and overextraction becoming less seasonal and more year round further straining California s electricity supply and water security and having an impact on California business industry and agriculture br In a new state program was created in collaboration with indigenous peoples of California to revive the practice of controlled burns as a way of clearing excessive forest debris and making landscapes more resilient to wildfires Native American use of fire in ecosystem management was outlawed in yet has now been recognized br br br Ecology br br California is one of the ecologically richest and most diverse parts of the world and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities California is part of the Nearctic realm and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions br California s large number of endemic species includes relict species which have died out elsewhere such as the Catalina ironwood Lyonothamnus floribundus Many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac Ceanothus Many California endemics have become endangered as urbanization logging overgrazing and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat br br br Flora and fauna br br California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora the largest trees the tallest trees and the oldest trees California s native grasses are perennial plants and there are close to hundred succulent species native to the state After European contact these were generally replaced by invasive species of European annual grasses and in modern times California s hills turn a characteristic golden brown in summer br Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran Desert upper Sonoran foothill regions and some coastal lands transition coastal areas and moist northeastern counties and the Canadian Hudsonian and Arctic Zones comprising the state s highest elevations br Plant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus mesquite and paloverde The Joshua tree is found in the Mojave Desert Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters Fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the Central Valley The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt characterized by forests of small shrubs stunted trees and herbaceous plants Nemophila mint Phacelia Viola and the California poppy Eschscholzia californica the state flower also flourish in this zone along with the lupine more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world br The transition zone includes most of California s forests with the redwood Sequoia sempervirens and the big tree or giant sequoia Sequoiadendron giganteum among the oldest living things on earth some are said to have lived at least years Tanbark oak California laurel sugar pine madrona broad leaved maple and Douglas fir also grow here Forest floors are covered with swordfern alumnroot barrenwort and trillium and there are thickets of huckleberry azalea elder and wild currant Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa tulip and tiger and leopard lilies br br The high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the Jeffrey pine red fir and lodgepole pine to thrive Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf manzanita and ceanothus the unique Sierra puffball is also found here Right below the timberline in the Hudsonian zone the whitebark foxtail and silver pines grow At about feet m begins the Arctic zone a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers including Sierra primrose yellow columbine alpine buttercup and alpine shooting star br Palm trees are a well known feature of California particularly in Southern California and Los Angeles many species have been imported though the Washington filifera commonly known as the California fan palm is native to the state mainly growing in the Colorado Desert oases Other common plants that have been introduced to the state include the eucalyptus acacia pepper tree geranium and Scotch broom The species that are federally classified as endangered are the Contra Costa wallflower Antioch Dunes evening primrose Solano grass San Clemente Island larkspur salt marsh bird s beak McDonald s rock cress and Santa Barbara Island liveforever As of December plant species were listed as threatened or endangered br br In the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone the mammals include the jackrabbit kangaroo rat squirrel and opossum Common birds include the owl roadrunner cactus wren and various species of hawk The area s reptilian life include the sidewinder viper desert tortoise and horned toad The upper Sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the antelope brown footed woodrat and ring tailed cat Birds unique to this zone are the California thrasher bushtit and California condor br In the transition zone there are Colombian black tailed deer black bears gray foxes cougars bobcats and Roosevelt elk Reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone In addition amphibians such as the water puppy and redwood salamander are common too Birds such as the kingfisher chickadee towhee and hummingbird thrive here as well br The Canadian zone mammals include the mountain weasel snowshoe hare and several species of chipmunks Conspicuous birds include the blue fronted jay mountain chickadee hermit thrush American dipper and Townsend s solitaire As one ascends into the Hudsonian zone birds become scarcer While the gray crowned rosy finch is the only bird native to the high Arctic region other bird species such as Anna s hummingbird and Clark s nutcracker Principal mammals found in this region include the Sierra coney white tailed jackrabbit and the bighorn sheep As of April the bighorn sheep was listed as endangered by the U S Fish and Wildlife Service The fauna found throughout several zones are the mule deer coyote mountain lion northern flicker and several species of hawk and sparrow br br Aquatic life in California thrives from the state s mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline Numerous trout species are found among them rainbow golden and cutthroat Migratory species of salmon are common as well Deep sea life forms include sea bass yellowfin tuna barracuda and several types of whale Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals sea lions and many types of shorebirds including migratory species br As of April California animals were on the federal endangered list plants were listed as endangered or threatened Endangered animals include the San Joaquin kitfox Point Arena mountain beaver Pacific pocket mouse salt marsh harvest mouse Morro Bay kangaroo rat and five other species of kangaroo rat Amargosa vole California least tern California condor loggerhead shrike San Clemente sage sparrow San Francisco garter snake five species of salamander three species of chub and two species of pupfish Eleven butterflies are also endangered and two that are threatened are on the federal list Among threatened animals are the coastal California gnatcatcher Paiute cutthroat trout southern sea otter and northern spotted owl California has a total of acres km of National Wildlife Refuges As of September California animals were listed as either endangered or threatened on the federal list Also as of the same year species of California plants were listed either as endangered or threatened on this federal list br br br Rivers br br The most prominent river system within California is formed by the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River which are fed mostly by snowmelt from the west slope of the Sierra Nevada and respectively drain the north and south halves of the Central Valley The two rivers join in the Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta flowing into the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay Many major tributaries feed into the Sacramento San Joaquin system including the Pit River Feather River and Tuolumne River br The Klamath and Trinity Rivers drain a large area in far northwestern California The Eel River and Salinas River each drain portions of the California coast north and south of San Francisco Bay respectively The Mojave River is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert and the Santa Ana River drains much of the Transverse Ranges as it bisects Southern California The Colorado River forms the state s southeast border with Arizona br Most of California s major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects the Central Valley Project providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley and the California State Water Project diverting water from Northern to Southern California The state s coasts rivers and other bodies of water are regulated by the California Coastal Commission br br br Regions br br California is traditionally separated into Northern California and Southern California divided by a straight border which runs across the state separating the northern counties from the southern counties Despite the persistence of the northern southern divide California is more precisely divided into many regions multiple of which stretch across the northern southern divide br br Major divisions br Northern California br Southern California br Regions br br br Cities and towns br br The state has incorporated cities and towns of which are cities and are towns Under California law the terms city and town are explicitly interchangeable the name of an incorporated municipality in the state can either be City of Name or Town of Name br Sacramento became California s first incorporated city on February San Jose San Diego and Benicia tied for California s second incorporated city each receiving incorporation on March Mountain House became the state s most recent and rd incorporated municipality on July br The majority of these cities and towns are within one of five metropolitan areas the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area the San Francisco Bay Area the Riverside San Bernardino Area the San Diego metropolitan area or the Sacramento metropolitan area br br br Demographics br br br Population br br Presently close to one out of every nine United States residents lives in California The United States Census Bureau reported that the population of California was million on April a increase since the census During that decade the state s population grew more slowly than the rest of the nation resulting in the loss of one seat on the US House of Representatives the first loss in its entire history The estimated state population in was million For well over a century California experienced steady population growth Even while the rate of growth began to slow by the s some growth continued into the first two decades of the st century California added an average of around people per year to its population during the period Then in the state began to experience population declines continuing every year attributable mostly to moves out of state but also
