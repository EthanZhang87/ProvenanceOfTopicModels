id: 28349
Stock car racing is a form of automobile racing run on oval tracks and road courses measuring approximately to miles to km It originally used production model cars hence the name stock car but is now run using cars specifically built for racing It originated in the southern United States its largest governing body is NASCAR Its NASCAR Cup Series is the premier top level series of professional stock car racing Australia Canada New Zealand Mexico Brazil Argentina and the United Kingdom also have forms of stock car racing Top level races typically range between and miles and km in length br Top level stock cars exceed mph km h at speedway tracks and on superspeedway tracks such as Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway br Contemporary NASCAR spec top level cars produce maximum power outputs of hp from their naturally aspirated V engines In October American race car driver Russ Wicks set a speed record for stock cars in a season Dodge Charger built to NASCAR specifications by achieving a maximum speed of mph km h at Bonneville Speedway For the NASCAR Cup Series power output of the competing cars ranged from to hp to kW br br br History br br br Early years br In the s moonshine runners during the Prohibition era would often have to outrun the authorities To do so they had to upgrade their vehicles while leaving them looking ordinary so as not to attract attention Eventually runners started getting together with fellow runners and making runs together They would challenge one another and eventually progressed to organized events in the early s The Elgin Trophy held in Elgin Illinois was the first officially organized stock car race in the United States The main problem racing faced was the lack of a unified set of rules among the different tracks When Bill France Sr saw this problem he set up a meeting at the Streamline Hotel in order to form an organization that would unify the rules br When NASCAR was first formed by France in to regulate stock car racing in the U S there was a requirement that any car entered be made entirely of parts available to the general public through automobile dealers Additionally the cars had to be models that had sold more than units to the public This is referred to as homologation In NASCAR s early years the cars were so stock that it was commonplace for the drivers to drive themselves to the competitions in the car that they were going to run in the race While automobile engine technology had remained fairly stagnant in World War II advanced aircraft piston engine development had provided a great deal of available data and NASCAR was formed just as some of the improved technology was about to become available in production cars Until the advent of the Trans Am Series in NASCAR homologation cars were the closest thing that the public could buy that was actually very similar to the cars that were winning national races br The Oldsmobile Rocket V with a displacement of cu in L is widely recognized as the first postwar modern overhead valve OHV engine to become available to the public The Oldsmobile was an immediate success in and and all the automobile manufacturers could not help noticing the higher sales of the Oldsmobile to the buying public The motto of the day became win on Sunday sell on Monday However in spite of the fact that several competing engines were more advanced the aerodynamic and low slung Hudson Hornet managed to win in and with a cu in L inline six cylinder that used an old style flathead engine proving there was more to winning than just a more powerful engine br At the time it typically took three years for a new design of car body or engine to end up in production and be available for NASCAR racing Most cars sold to the public did not have a wide variety of engine choices and the majority of the buying public at the time was not interested in the large displacement special edition engine options that would soon become popular However the end of the Korean War in started an economic boom and then car buyers immediately began demanding more powerful engines br Also in NASCAR recommended that the drivers add roll bars but did not require them br In Chrysler produced the C with its Chrysler FirePower engine hp kW cu in L OHV engine which easily won in and br In several notable events happened The Automobile Manufacturers Association banned manufacturers from using race wins in their advertising and giving direct support to race teams as they felt it led to reckless street racing This forced manufacturers to become creative in producing race parts to help racers win Race teams were often caught trying to use factory produced racing parts that were not really available to the public though many parts passed muster by being labeled as heavy duty police parts Car manufacturers wanted to appear compliant with the ban but they also wanted to win br The NASCAR tracks at the time were mainly dirt tracks with modest barriers and during the season a Mercury Monterey crashed into the crowd This killed many spectators and resulted in a serious overhaul of the safety rules which in turn prompted the building of larger more modern tracks Also in Chevrolet sold enough of their new fuel injected engines to the public in order to make them available for racing and Ford began selling superchargers as an option but Bill France immediately banned fuel injection and superchargers from NASCAR before they could race However even without official factory support or the use of fuel injection Buck Baker won in driving a small block V Chevrolet Bel Air br In Ford introduced the F in a low drag Galaxie Starliner but and championships were won by drivers in powered Chevrolet Impalas br Pontiac introduced their Super Duty in Catalinas that made use of many aluminum body parts to save weight and the Pontiacs easily won in br br br Heyday br The desire from fans and manufacturers alike for higher performance cars within the restrictions of homologation meant that carmakers began producing limited production special edition cars based on high production base models It also became apparent that manufacturers were willing to produce increasingly larger engines to remain competitive Ford had developed a they hoped to race For the season NASCAR engines were restricted to using a maximum displacement of liters cu in and using only two valves per cylinder br Also even with heavy duty special editions sold to the public for homologation purposes the race car rules were further modified primarily in the interest of safety This is because race drivers and their cars during this era were subjected to forces unheard of in street use and require a far higher level of protection than is normally afforded by truly stock automobile bodies br In Ford sold enough of their aerodynamic sport roof edition Galaxies to the public so it would qualify as stock and with the heavy duty FE block bored and stroked to the new limit of the top five finishers were all Fords Chrysler had bored their to create the Max Wedge but it still could not compete with the Fords General Motors headquarters had genuinely tried to adhere to the ban but their Chevrolet division had also constantly tried to work around it because the other manufacturers had openly circumvented the ban In GM gave in and openly abandoned compliance and Chevrolet was allowed to produce the ZO but it did not immediately enjoy success br Then in the new Chrysler Hemi engine so dominated the series in a Plymouth Belvedere Sport Fury the homologation rules were changed so that of any engine and car had to be sold to the public to qualify as a stock part instead of just This made the Hemi unavailable for the season br In Ford adapted two single overhead cams to their FE V to allow it to run at a higher RPM called the Ford Cammer Ford started to sell cammers to the public to homologate it mostly to dealer sponsored privateer drag racers but NASCAR changed the rules to specify that all NASCAR engines must use a single cam in block But even without the cammer the Ford FE won in br In Chrysler sold enough of the Hemis to make it available again and they put it in their new Dodge Charger which had a low drag rear window that was radically sloped It was called a fast back and because of this David Pearson was the series champion that year with Richard Petty dominating winning of races including in a row in the boxier Plymouth Belvedere br The season featured the Torino Cobra or Torino Talladega which had enough aerodynamic body improvements that it gave it a higher speed than the Torino with no other changes The Cobra featuring extended nose and reshaped rockers was renamed Talladega part way through the season when the Boss replaced the Starting in up till this point Ford had won six straight Manufacturer Championships and by the end of the season Ford would make it seven in a row Richard Petty was tired of winning races but losing the championship so after a private viewing of Ford s new Talladega and Boss engine he signed a lucrative deal with Ford br Prior to its first race at the Daytona David Pearson s powered Ford Torino Cobra set a new NASCAR record by being the first to exceed mph km h when he qualified at mph km h When the race started Donnie Allison s Torino lead the majority of the race laps Towards the end of the race the Torino of LeeRoy Yarbrough chased down the Dodge of Charlie Glotzbach who had an second lead It was the first Daytona won on a last lap pass Things got worse for Dodge when NASCAR a few months later finally allowed Ford to run its hemi headed Boss engine br With Ford winning the majority of the races Dodge was forced to develop a better car of their own Using the Charger as a basis they added a pointed nose This nose was almost a carbon copy of the nose on the Ford Mustang I prototype This radical body shape required a wing to remain stable at speeds over mph km h They named it the Dodge Daytona after the race they hoped to win Even though it never won a Daytona race it was still a significant improvement over its predecessor the Dodge Charger br NASCAR feared that these increasing speeds significantly surpassed the abilities of the tire technology of the day and it would undoubtedly increase the number of gruesome wrecks that were occurring As a result the Homologation rules were changed so that one car for every two U S dealers had to be built for sale to the public to qualify hoping to delay the use of aero bodies until tires could improve br For the season Dodge raced the model Daytona but Plymouth managed to build over Plymouth Superbirds which were similarly equipped to the Daytona Petty came back to Plymouth in the plus mph km h Superbird and Bobby Isaac won the season championship in a Daytona NASCAR restricted all aero cars including the Ford Talladega Mercury Spoiler II Charger Dodge Daytona and Plymouth Superbird to a maximum engine displacement of cu in L for Almost all teams switched to non aero bodystyles NASCAR eventually adopted a restrictor plate to limit top speeds for the L engine as teams switched to small block cu in L engines br NASCAR edited the rules in a way that they hoped would make the cars safer and more equal so the race series would be more a test of the drivers rather than a test of car technology br The era drew to a conclusion in the s brought so many rule changes it has prompted many to consider this year as the start of the modern era of NASCAR racing In addition R J Reynolds the tobacco conglomerate took over as the major sponsor of NASCAR racing changing the name to the Winston Cup and they made a significantly larger financial contribution than previous sponsors Richard Petty s personal sponsorship with STP also set new higher standards for financial rewards to driving teams The sudden infusion of noticeably larger amounts of money changed the entire nature of the sport br The oil crisis meant that large displacement special edition homologation cars of all makes were suddenly sitting unsold Through the balance of the s until the factory stock sheetmetal over a racing frame meant the cars looked very much like their street version counterparts Then in with a highly modified body and more aerodynamics stock cars were quickly allowed to differ greatly from anything available to the public It also marks the beginning of the Generation car Modern racing stock cars are stock in name only using a body template that is vaguely modeled after currently available automobiles The chassis running gear and other equipment have almost nothing to do with anything in ordinary automobiles NASCAR and the auto manufacturers have become aware of this and for each brand Chevrolet Dodge Ford and Toyota have redesigned their racing sheetmetal to more resemble the street models of their cars br br br Types of cars br br A stock car in the original sense of the term is an automobile that has not been modified from its original factory configuration Later the term stock car came to mean any production based automobile used in racing This term is used to differentiate such a car from a race car a special custom built car designed only for racing purposes br The degree to which the cars conform to standard model specs has changed over the years and varies from country to country Today most American stock cars may superficially resemble standard American family sedans but are in fact silhouette cars purpose built racing machines built to a strict set of regulations governing the car design ensuring that the chassis suspension engine etc are architecturally identical to those in stock production vehicles For example NASCAR Cup Series race vehicles now require fuel injection In the UK and New Zealand there is a racing formula called stock cars but the cars are markedly different from any road car In Australia there was a formula that was quite similar to NASCAR called AUSCAR br The Racecar Euro Series began in and was sanctioned by NASCAR as a touring series in currently operating as the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series br br br Street stock and pure stock br br True stock car racing which consists of only street vehicles that can be bought by the general public is sometimes now called street stock pure stock hobby stock showroom stock or U car racing In SCCA started its first showroom stock racing series with a price ceiling on the cars of Some modern showroom stock racing allows safety modifications done on showroom stock cars br br br Super stock br Super stock classes are similar to street stock but allow for more modifications to the engine Power output is usually in the range of horsepower kilowatts Tire width is usually limited to in mm br Some entry level classes are called street stock and are similar to what is often called banger racing in England br br br Modifieds br br Modified stock cars resemble a hybrid of open wheel cars and stock cars The rear wheels are covered by fenders but the front wheels and engine are left exposed First popular in the United States after World War II this type of racing was early on characterized by its participants modification of passenger cars in pursuit of higher speeds hence the name In many regions particularly on the east coast modified racing is considered the highest class of stock cars in local racing br br br Late models br br In many areas of the country late models are usually the highest class of stock cars in local racing Rules for construction of a late model car vary from region to region and even race track to race track The most common variations on paved tracks include super late models SLMs late model stock cars LMSCs and limited late models LLMs A late model may be a custom built machine or a heavily modified streetcar Individual sanctioning bodies like NASCAR ACT PASS UARA CRA etc maintain their own late model rule books and even individual racetracks can maintain their own rule books meaning a late model that is legal in one series or at one track may not be legal at another without modifications The national touring series the NASCAR Late Model Sportsman Division originated from local late model races in the east coast of the U S This division was later called the Busch Series the Nationwide Series and currently the Xfinity Series as its title sponsor changed br br br United States br br br NASCAR br NASCAR is currently the largest stock car racing governing body in the world While NASCAR sanctions multiple series it has three national championship touring series that are commonly referred to as the top series In addition to the top three series NASCAR also sanctions many regional and local series NASCAR also sanctions three international series that race in Canada Mexico and Europe br br br NASCAR Cup Series br br The most prominent championship in stock car racing is the NASCAR Cup Series It is the most popular racing series in the United States drawing over million spectators in an average live audience of over people for each race br The most famous event in the series is the Daytona an annual mile km race at the Daytona International Speedway The series second biggest event is arguably The Brickyard an annual mile km race held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway the legendary home of the Indianapolis an open wheeled race However the event was excluded from the schedule in favor of a race on the track s road course Together the Cup Series and Xfinity Series drew million spectators in compared to million for both American open wheel series CART and IRL which merged in under the IRL banner In of the US top sporting events in terms of attendance were stock car races Only football drew more television viewers that year br br br NASCAR Xfinity Series br br The NASCAR Xfinity Series is the second tier series in the United States It serves as the primary feeder series to the Cup Series similar to Formula Two for Formula One and Indy Lights for Indy Car Races are commonly held as a support race to Cup Series events Many current Cup Series drivers formerly competed in the Series before moving on to competing full time in the Cup Series br The Xfinity series typically features multiple Cup Series competitors competing alongside full time Xfinity drivers There was some controversy as Cup Series drivers tended to be more successful than full time Xfinity drivers Cup drivers are not eligible to score points in the Xfinity series and are limited to the number of races they are allowed to race in the Series br br br NASCAR Camping World Truck Series br br Starting in the NASCAR Truck Series is the third highest ranking stock car series in the United States The series was the brainchild of then NASCAR West Coast executive Ken Clapp who was inspired by off road truck racing Unlike the other two national touring NASCAR series the Truck Series race pickup truck styled bodies though it is still considered a stock car series because of its similarity Much like the Xfinity Series the Truck Series often features Cup Series drivers competing for parts of the season br br br ARCA br The Automobile Racing Club of America was founded in as a Midwest regional series In addition to the ARCA Menards Series it also sanctions the ARCA Midwest Tour since and previously the ARCA Lincoln Welders Truck Series from to br NASCAR purchased ARCA in early For the season the NASCAR K N Series East and West were rebranded under the ARCA banner as the ARCA Menards Series East and ARCA Menards Series West br br br Other series br Outside of NASCAR there are a number of other national or regional stock car sanctioning bodies in the United States There are a few organizations that cater to these local short tracks The American Speed Association ASA Champion Racing Association CRA International Motor Contest Association IMCA United Auto Racing Association UARA Championship Auto Racing Series CARS and they all sanction their own forms of stock car racing on varying types of track and with various levels of media coverage The International Race of Champions IROC and Superstar Racing Experience SRX are usually perceived as being outside of the regular stock car racing scene because of their all star grids br br br New Zealand br br Stock car racing began in New Zealand during the s first race was at Aranui Speedway on November It was brought to New Zealand after New Zealand Speedway riders witnessed the huge crowds that watched the races in Britain earlier that year As with the UK Stock car racing in New Zealand is a very different form of racing than that of the US Stock car racing is a full contact sport in New Zealand as the rule book states contact is not only permitted it is encouraged br Cars are built to an extremely rigid design and feature strong steel guards around almost the entire car Stockcars are divided into three classes Superstocks Stock cars Ministocks Ministocks predominantly being a non contact youth class br Superstocks are the top class and are typically powered by V engines up to litres cu in which can produce over kilowatts hp The majority of races are of an individual nature however unique to New Zealand stock car racing is the team racing format Typically teams racing consists of two teams of four cars each that work together to win the race Teams normally protect their runners while attempting to eliminate the opposing team the races can be decided by a points format or first across the finish line br The class most resembling the North American form of stock car racing are known as Saloon cars Super Saloons are similar to dirt late models with the main differences being the bodies closer resemble production cars use iron engines up to litres cu in with no rear offset and run much larger sprint car tyres on the rear br br br Australia br br Stock car racing in the NASCAR mould AUSCAR had a following in Australia during the mid late s and through the s but with the advent of the Supercars Championship which took up the bulk of the competitors sponsorship dollars on offer as well as major television time the Australian Superspeedway series shut down after br The majority of the NASCAR and AUSCAR racing in Australia took place at the km mi high banked Calder Park Thunderdome in Melbourne The Thunderdome which was opened in and was built by multi millionaire tyre retailer Bob Jane at a cost of A million was modeled on a scaled down version of the famous Charlotte Motor Speedway Other tracks used included the mile metre Speedway Super Bowl at the Adelaide International Raceway also owned by Jane this was the only paved oval track in Australia other than the Thunderdome though with only banking in the turns it was more of a traditional flat track as well as road courses such as the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit where the cars ran as a support category to the Gold Coast IndyCar Grand Prix Oran Park in Sydney and the famous Mount Panorama Circuit br br br United Kingdom br br Stock in the sense of cars appearing to be similar to conventional road vehicles is represented in the UK and Europe by touring cars br The term stock cars in the UK refers to a specialized form of racing that bears little resemblance to any road car br Stock car racing was brought to Britain in Taking place on existing greyhound or speedway tracks the cars were mostly stock cars from the s with locked rear axle differentials and added armour After the first couple of years specials began to appear eventually making the stock car name something of a misnomer Since the early days of stock car racing in Britain the sport has developed into many different classes from the destructive Banger categories to the very sophisticated National Hot Rods However the name stock car is usually reserved for that racing class which traces its roots back to these early days in the s BriSCA F Stock Cars which were previously known as The Seniors or Senior Stock Cars Despite the physical demands of this full contact sport many competitors have been racing for and even years For the first years of the sport stock cars were either adapted from road cars or bore the recognizable bodywork of road cars By the s chassis and bodywork had evolved into very specialized forms br br In the ASCAR Racing Series was formed and ran until the series was a NASCAR style racing series that was predominantly run at Rockingham Motor Speedway as well as briefly on the continent The first season was won by John Mickel Other notable champions were Nicolas Minassian and Ben Collins who also played as The Stig on Top Gear The field was usually populated by professional or semi professional stock car drivers however notable drivers who were famous from other areas of motorsport either took part in single races or for one complete season they included Colin McRae Jason Plato Matt Neal Darren Manning Max Papis John Cleland and former NASCAR drivers Brandon Whitt and Randy Tolsma br The modern BriSCA Formula Stock Cars are a highly sophisticated purpose built race car with race tuned V engines developing kW bhp quick change axles and gearboxes and biased and staggered chassis and braking set up for constant left turning However large bumpers were mandatory with contact very much encouraged to remove opponents The sport can be seen at venues throughout Britain and Mainland Europe A downsized version of the BriSCA Formula Stock Cars the smaller BriSCA Formula Stock Cars previously known as The Juniors or Junior Stock Cars are also very popular these cars are powered by the litre Ford Pinto engine There are also many other formulas running on the oval tracks throughout a season that starts around March Easter and continues to October November br In the World Final held at Ipswich Andy Smith raced to victory becoming the BriSCA F Stock Car World Champion for the second time in his career taking the crown from brother Stuart Smith Jnr also saw Andy Smith win again this time at Kings Lynns Norfolk Arena saw Andy Smith win for a rd consecutive time at Coventry the same venue as his st win in The World Championship took place at Northampton on September with Paul Harrison the winner of the Gold Roof The World Championship held at Skegness was won by Lee Fairhurst The World Championship will be held at King s Lynn on Saturday September br In Ian Thompson Jr became the first driver from Northern Ireland to win the Brisca F Stock Car World title since when he took the honours at Bristol in However it was in controversial circumstances after first across the line Gordon Moodie Thomson Jr s brother in law was disqualified from the race after being found with carburetor irregularities at post race scrutineering This irregularity has since been proven to be a manufacturing fault with the control of the driver but the governing body have refused to reinstate Gordon Moodie as the winner in the record books In the World Championship winner was Micky Brennan and in the World Championship winner was John Fortune The World Championship Final took place at Kings Lynns Norfolk Arena on Saturday September with Mark Simpson winner of the Gold Roof In the World Championship was won again by Micky Brennan this time held at Barford The World Championship weekend will be held over days of racing on September at Smeatharpe near Honiton in Devon br Another open wheeled stock car formula that races in the UK are Spedeworth Superstox Licensed by Spedeworth as opposed to BriSCA Superstox are similar to Formula Two Stock Cars with the main visual difference being a smaller wing on the roof These cars are also powered by the litre Ford Pinto engine The World Championship Final held at Ipswich was won by Colin Aylward The World Championship Final was held at Londons Wimbledon Stadium on Sunday October and won by Nick Smith The World Championship was again held at Ipswich and won by Scot Stuart Gilchrist The World Championship will be held at Lochgelly in Fife Scotland with the date tbc br Another form of UK stock car racing is Saloon Stock Cars regulated by the Saloon Stock Car Association This formula is based on heavily armoured Ford Sierra Ford Mondeo Vauxhall Vectra cars purposely reconstructed for this full contact class The World Championship was held at Skegness in August with Eddie Darby the winner of the Gold Roof for the next months The World Championship Final was held at Smeatharpe Raceway near Honiton in Devon in August and again won by Eddie Darby Other similar Stock Car classes are the Litre Stock Cars licensed by Spedeworth and the Stock Cars licensed by several different promoters each to slightly differing rules although steps are currently being taken to standardise the specifications in order to make it a national class The World Championship was won by Barry Radcliffe at Ipswich The World Championship will be held at King s Lynn on Saturday August br br br Canada br Stock Car Racing has existed in Canada as early as the s in amateur format although official structured competitions began with the foundation of CASCAR in The league went on for a few decades until when it was purchased by NASCAR and became the NASCAR Canada Series Vehicle models used are typically from the makes of Chevrolet Dodge and Ford The series runs a higher percentage of road and street courses compared to the top NASCAR series in America The competition has had a growing interest in the recent decades br br br Other regions br br Internationally stock car racing has not enjoyed the same success as within the United States and Canada Brazil also has a successful stock car racing series with starting grids of or more cars and two brands competing Chevrolet and Toyota Brazilian Stock Car also has two developing series Despite the name Brazilian stock car competitions are not held on oval tracks thus they resemble more touring car racing than stock car racing the same can be said about Argentina s popular stock series called Turismo Carretera br Unsuccessful efforts have been made in Australia South Africa and Japan as well br br br Career paths br NASCAR drivers take various paths to the highest stock car divisions Some start racing on dirt surfaces but all end up racing on asphalt surfaces as they progress in their career They frequently start in karting or in cars that are completely stock except for safety modifications They generally advance through intermediate or advanced local level divisions The highest local division asphalt late model racing is generally considered a requirement to advance to the next step regional and national touring series br Dirt track drivers follow the same general path Their highest divisions are less well known national touring late model series such as the World of Outlaws Late Model Series and regional touring series br br br Crossover drivers br Some drivers have entered stock car racing after starting on a very different career path The most famous might well be Mario Andretti who won the Indianapolis NASCAR s Daytona and the Formula One World Championship Juan Pablo Montoya had wins in all three series with two Indy wins and seven Formula One wins and two Sprint Cup wins and A J Foyt with four Indianapolis wins seven IndyCar championships and a victory in the Hours of Le Mans on his resume also won the Daytona in Johnny Rutherford a three time winner at Indy has the rare distinction of winning his first NASCAR start a qualifying race for the Daytona Dan Gurney a leading s Formula One driver and later one of the most successful constructors of Indy cars as well as being Foyt s co driver at Le Mans excelled in NASCAR s road course events winning at Riverside five times between and A notable crossover oddity is the one race NASCAR career of the colorful Formula One and sports car driver Innes Ireland after retiring at the end of the season he was invited by NASCAR czar Bill France to compete at Daytona where he was running in the top ten when his engine blew on the th of laps br Montoya initially surprised the auto racing community by leaving F but he was quickly followed by other drivers Open wheel stars like Sam Hornish Jr Patrick Carpentier Dario Franchitti Jacques Villeneuve A J Allmendinger and Danica Patrick all made the move to the Monster Energy Cup series with varying degrees of success Two time Australian Supercars champion Marcos Ambrose competed in the Monster Energy Cup Series from to winning two races br Other drivers compete often in stock car racing but are well known for their success elsewhere Ron Fellows and Boris Said are champion road racers and are often brought in by teams solely to compete in NASCAR s road course events a title known as road course ringers Robby Gordon was one of NASCAR s few remaining owner drivers but he is most famous for his numerous off road championships and his three Baja wins br br br Tracks br Stock car races take place predominantly on oval tracks of or turns with all turns to the left Oval tracks are classified as short track less than mile intermediate or speedway to miles or superspeedway over miles Road courses are any tracks having both left and right turns Depending on the track typical race speeds can vary from miles per hour km h at Martinsville to over miles per hour km h at Talladega In Bill Elliott s mph km h qualifying time at Talladega brought about a change at superspeedways Daytona and Talladega Such high speeds and Bobby Allison s car going airborne into the catch fence and injuring fans forced NASCAR to implement power reducing measures one of which was the mandated implement of below carburetor restrictor plates This later became known as restrictor plate racing br Oval circuits differ from the rough terrain and sharp turns of Rally and the complicated twists and turns of Formula One tracks that put up to or g of horizontal stress on the driver s body Stock cars are much heavier than Formula One cars and as a result they are generally slower Additionally they cannot produce the g forces of an open wheel car A stock car s weak handling with high power output places more emphasis on car control br br br Tactics br br In contrast with most forms of racing minor car to car contact is generally accepted in stock car racing This may happen in the form of forcing another vehicle out of the way or pushing a competing vehicle forward for mutual benefit Stock cars are generally built to be tolerant of superficial damage to bodywork whereas open wheel designs can experience severe reductions in performance with even slight spoiler damage On intermediate tracks and superspeedways drafting is used to reduce the overall effect of drag A driver accomplishes this by positioning the vehicle close to the one ahead of so as to benefit from the other s slipstream Drafting was discovered by Junior Johnson during his winning performance at the Daytona br br br See also br br br br br br External links br NASCAR
