Zen Japanese from Chinese Ch n in Korean S n and Vietnamese Thi n is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty as the Chan School ch nz ng meditation school or the Buddha mind school f x nz ng and later developed into various sub schools and branches From China Ch n spread south to Vietnam and became Vietnamese Thi n northeast to Korea to become Seon Buddhism and east to Japan becoming Japanese Zen br Zen emphasizes meditation practice direct insight into one s own Buddha nature Ch ji nx ng Jp kensh and the personal expression of this insight in daily life for the benefit of others Some Zen sources de emphasize doctrinal study and traditional practices favoring direct understanding through zazen and interaction with a master Jp r shi Ch sh fu who may be depicted as an iconoclastic and unconventional figure In spite of this most Zen schools also promote traditional Buddhist practices like chanting precepts rituals monasticism and scriptural study br With an emphasis on Buddha nature thought intrinsic enlightenment and sudden awakening Zen teaching draws from numerous Buddhist sources including Sarv stiv da meditation the Mahayana teachings on the bodhisattva Yogachara and Tath gatagarbha texts like the La k vat ra and the Huayan school The Praj p ramit literature as well as Madhyamaka thought have also been influential in the shaping of the apophatic and sometimes iconoclastic nature of Zen rhetoric br Furthermore the Chan School was also influenced by Daoist philosophy especially Neo Daoist thought br br The word Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation kana of the Middle Chinese word Middle Chinese d ian pinyin Ch n which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word dhy na which can be approximately translated as contemplation absorption or meditative state br The actual Chinese term for the Zen school is pinyin Ch nz ng while Chan just refers to the practice of meditation itself Chinese pinyin x ch n or the study of meditation Chinese pinyin ch nxu though it is often used as an abbreviated form of Ch nzong br Zen is also called f x nz ng Chinese or busshin sh Japanese the Buddha mind school from f x n Buddha mind this term can refer either to the or a Buddha s compassionate and enlightened mind or to the originally clear and pure mind inherent in all beings to which they must awaken Busshin may also refer to Buddhakaya the Buddha body an embodiment of awakened activity br Zen is traditionally a proper noun as it usually describes a particular Buddhist sect In more recent times the lowercase zen is used when discussing a worldview or attitude that is peaceful and calm It was officially added to the Merriam Webster dictionary in br br The practice of meditation Ch ch n Skt dhy na especially sitting meditation Chinese zu ch n Japanese zazen is a central part of Zen Buddhism br br The practice of Buddhist meditation originated in India and first entered China through the translations of An Shigao fl c CE and Kum raj va CE Both of these figures translated various Dhy na sutras These were influential meditation texts which were mostly based on the meditation teachings of the Kashmiri Sarv stiv da school circa st th centuries CE Among the most influential early Chinese meditation texts are the Anban Shouyi Jing Sutra on n p nasm ti the Zuochan Sanmei Jing Sutra of sitting dhy na sam dhi and the Damoduoluo Chan Jing Dharmatrata dhy na sutra br These early Chinese meditation works continued to exert influence on Zen practice well into the modern era For example the th century Rinzai Zen master T rei Enji wrote a commentary on the Damoduoluo Chan Jing and used the Zuochan Sanmei Jing as a source in the writing of this commentary T rei believed that the Damoduoluo Chan Jing had been authored by Bodhidharma br While dhy na in a strict sense refers to the classic four dhy nas in Chinese Buddhism ch n may refer to various kinds of meditation techniques and their preparatory practices which are necessary to practice dhy na The five main types of meditation in the Dhy na sutras are n p nasm ti mindfulness of breathing pa ik lamanasik ra meditation mindfulness of the impurities of the body maitr meditation loving kindness the contemplation on the twelve links of prat tyasamutp da and contemplation on the Buddha According to the modern Chan master Sheng Yen these practices are termed the five methods for stilling or pacifying the mind and serve to focus and purify the mind and support the development of the stages of dhyana Chan Buddhists may also use other classic Buddhist practices like the four foundations of mindfulness and the Three Gates of Liberation emptiness or nyat signlessness or animitta and wishlessness or apra ihita br Early Chan texts also teach forms of meditation that are unique to Mah y na Buddhism For example the Treatise on the Essentials of Cultivating the Mind which depicts the teachings of the th century East Mountain school teaches a visualization of a sun disk similar to that taught in the Contemplation Sutra br According to Charles Luk there was no single fixed method in early Chan Zen All the various Buddhist meditation methods were simply skillful means which could lead a meditator to the buddha mind within br br Modern scholars like Robert Sharf argue that early Chan while having unique teachings and myths also made use of classic Buddhist meditation methods and this is why it is hard to find many uniquely Chan meditation instructions in some of the earliest sources However Sharf also notes there was a unique kind of Chan meditation taught in some early sources which also tend to deprecate the traditional Buddhist meditations This uniquely Zen approach goes by various names like maintaining mind shouxin maintaining unity shouyi pacifying the mind anxin discerning the mind guanxin and viewing the mind kanxin A traditional phrase that describes this practice states that Ch n points directly to the human mind to enable people to see their true nature and become buddhas br Likewise John McRae notes that a major development in early Ch an was the rejection of some of the traditional techniques in favor of a uniquely Zen direct approach Early Chan sources like the Bodhidharma Anthology the Platform Sutra and the works of Shenhui criticize traditional meditation methods of concentration and mindfulness as not necessary and instead promote a more direct and sudden method For example the Bodhidharma Anthology states The man of sharp abilities hears of the path without producing a covetous mind He does not even produce right mindfulness and right reflection and If mind is not produced what need is there for cross legged sitting dhyana Similarly the Platform Sutra criticizes the practice of sitting sam dhi One is enlightened to the Way through the mind How could it depend on sitting while Shenhui s four pronouncements criticize the freezing stopping activating and concentrating of the mind br According to McRae the first explicit statement of the sudden and direct approach that was to become the hallmark of Ch an religious practice is associated with the East Mountain School It is a method named maintaining the one without wavering sh u y b y the one being the true nature of mind or Suchness which is equated with buddha nature Sharf writes that in this practice one turns the attention from the objects of experience to the nature of conscious awareness itself the innately pure buddha nature which was compared to a clear mirror or to the sun which is always shining but may be covered by clouds This type of meditation is based on classic Mah y na ideas which are not uniquely Chan but according to McRae it differs from traditional practice in that no preparatory requirements no moral prerequisites or preliminary exercises are given and is without steps or gradations One concentrates understands and is enlightened all in one undifferentiated practice br Zen sources also use the term tracing back the radiance or turning one s light around Ch f n zh o to describe seeing the inherent radiant source of the mind itself the numinous awareness luminosity or buddha nature The Platform Sutra mentions this term and connects it with seeing one s original face The Record of Linji states that all that is needed to obtain the Dharma is to turn your own light in upon yourselves and never seek elsewhere The Japanese Zen master D gen describes it as follows You should stop the intellectual practice of pursuing words and learn the stepping back of turning the light around and shining back Jp ek hensh mind and body will naturally drop off and the original face will appear Similarly the Korean Seon master Y ndam Yuil states to use one s own mind to trace the radiance back to the numinous awareness of one s own mind It is like seeing the radiance of the sun s rays and following it back until you see the orb of the sun itself br Sharf also notes that this early notion of contemplating a pure Buddha Mind was tempered and balanced by other Zen sources with terms like no mind wuxin and no mindfulness wunien to avoid any metaphysical reification of mind and any clinging to mind or language This kind of negative Madhyamaka style dialectic is found in early Zen sources like the Treatise on No Mind Wuxin lun and the Platform Sutra These sources tend to emphasize emptiness negation and absence wusuo as the main theme of contemplation These two contemplative themes the buddha mind and no mind positive and the negative rhetoric continued to shape the development of Zen theory and practice throughout its history br Later Chinese Chan Buddhists developed their own meditation chan manuals which taught their unique method of direct and sudden contemplation The earliest of these is the widely imitated and influential Zu ch n Y c th century which recommends a simple contemplative practice which is said to lead to the discovery of inherent wisdom already present in the mind This work also shows the influence of the earlier meditation manuals composed by Tiantai patriarch Zhiyi br However other Zen sources de emphasize traditional practices like sitting meditation and instead focus on effortlessness and on ordinary daily activities One example of this is found in the Record of Linji which states Followers of the Way as to buddhadharma no effort is necessary You have only to be ordinary with nothing to do defecating urinating wearing clothes eating food and lying down when tired Similarly some Zen sources also emphasize non action or having no concerns wu shih For example Chan master Huangbo states that nothing compares with non seeking describing the Zen adept as follows the person of the Way is the one who has nothing to do wu shih who has no mind at all and no doctrine to preach Having nothing to do such a person lives at ease br Zen sources which focus on the sudden teaching can sometimes be quite radical in their rejection of the importance of traditional Buddhist ideas and practices The Record of the Dharma Jewel Through the Ages Lidai Fabao Ji for example states better that one should destroy la ethics and not destroy true seeing la causes rebirth in Heaven adding more karmic bonds while true seeing attains nirv a Similarly the Bloodstream Sermon states that it doesn t matter whether one is a butcher or not if one sees one s true nature then one will not be affected by karma The Bloodstream Sermon also rejects worshiping of buddhas and bodhisattvas stating that Those who hold onto appearances are devils They fall from the Path Why worship illusions born of the mind Those who worship don t know and those who know don t worship Similarly the Lidai Fabao Ji states that No thought is none other than seeing the Buddha and rejects the practice of worship and recitation Most famously the Record of Linji has the master state that if you meet a buddha kill the buddha as well as patriarchs arhats parents and kinfolk further claiming that through this you will gain emancipation will not be entangled with things br br During sitting meditation Ch zu ch n Jp zazen Ko jwaseon practitioners usually assume a sitting position such as the lotus position half lotus Burmese or seiza Their hands often placed in a specific gesture or mudr Often a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on in some other cases a chair may be used br To regulate the mind Zen students are often directed towards counting breaths Either both exhalations and inhalations are counted or one of them only The count can be up to ten and then this process is repeated until the mind is calmed Zen teachers like Omori Sogen teach a series of long and deep exhalations and inhalations as a way to prepare for regular breath meditation Attention is often placed on the energy center dantian below the navel Zen teachers often promote diaphragmatic breathing stating that the breath must come from the lower abdomen known as hara or tanden in Japanese and that this part of the body should expand forward slightly as one breathes Over time the breathing should become smoother deeper and slower When the counting becomes an encumbrance the practice of simply following the natural rhythm of breathing with concentrated attention is recommended br br A common form of sitting meditation is called Silent illumination Ch m zh o Jp mokush This practice was traditionally promoted by the Caodong school of Chinese Chan and is associated with Hongzhi Zhengjue who wrote various works on the practice This method derives from the Indian Buddhist practice of the union Skt yuganaddha of amatha and vipa yan br Hongzhi s practice of silent illumination does not depend on concentration on particular objects such as visual images sounds breathing concepts stories or deities Instead it is a non dual objectless meditation involving withdrawal from exclusive focus on a particular sensory or mental object This practice allows the meditator to be aware of all phenomena as a unified totality without any conceptualizing grasping goal seeking or subject object duality According to Leighton this method rests on the faith verified in experience that the field of vast brightness is ours from the outset This vast luminous buddha field is our immanent inalienable endowment of wisdom which cannot be cultivated or enhanced Instead one just has to recognize this radiant clarity without any interference br A similar practice is taught in the major schools of Japanese Zen but is especially emphasized by S t where it is more widely known as Shikantaza Ch zh gu n d zu Just sitting This method is discussed in the works of the Japanese S t Zen thinker D gen especially in his Sh b genz and his Fukanzazengi For D gen shikantaza is characterized by hishiry non thinking without thinking beyond thinking which according to Kasulis is a state of no mind in which one is simply aware of things as they are beyond thinking and not thinking br While the Japanese and the Chinese forms of these simple methods are similar they are considered distinct approaches br br During the Song dynasty g ng n Jp k an literature became popular Literally meaning public case they were stories or dialogues describing teachings and interactions between Zen masters and their students K ans are meant to illustrate Zen s non conceptual insight praj a During the Song a new meditation method was developed by Linji school figures such as Dahui called kanhua chan observing the phrase meditation which referred to contemplation on a single word or phrase called the huatou critical phrase of a g ng n Dahui famously criticised Caodong s silent illumination While the two methods of Caodong and Linji are sometimes seen as competing with each other Schl tter writes that Dahui himself did not completely condemn quiet sitting in fact he seems to have recommended it at least to his monastic disciples br In Chinese Chan and Korean Seon the practice of observing the huatou hwadu in Korean is a widely practiced method It was taught by Seon masters like Chinul and Seongcheol and modern Chinese masters like Sheng Yen and Xuyun br In the Japanese Rinzai school k an introspection developed its own formalized style with a standardized curriculum of k ans which must be studied meditated on and passed in sequence Monks are instructed to become one with their koan by repeating the koan s question constantly They are also advised not to attempt to answer it intellectually since the goal of the practice is a non conceptual insight into non duality The Zen student s mastery of a given k an is presented to the teacher in a private interview referred to in Japanese as dokusan daisan or sanzen The process includes standardized answers checking questions sassho and common sets of capping phrase jakugo poetry all which must be memorized by students While there are standardized answers to a k an practitioners are also expected to demonstrate their spiritual understanding through their responses The teacher may approve or disapprove of the answer based on their behavior and guide the student in the right direction According to Hori the traditional Japanese Rinzai koan curriculum can take years to complete for a full time monk The interaction with a teacher is central in Zen but also makes Zen practice vulnerable to misunderstanding and exploitation br K an inquiry may be practiced during zazen sitting meditation kinhin walking meditation and throughout all the activities of daily life The goal of the practice is often termed kensho seeing one s true nature and is to be followed by further practice to attain a natural effortless down to earth state of being the ultimate liberation knowing without any kind of defilement This style of k an practice is particularly emphasized in modern Rinzai but it also occurs in other schools or branches of Zen depending on the teaching line br In the Caodong and Soto traditions koans were studied and commented on for example Hongzhi published a collection of koans and Dogen discussed koans extensively However they were not traditionally used in sitting meditation Some Zen masters have also critiqued the practice of using koans for meditation According to Haskel Bankei called k ans old wastepaper and saw the k an method as hopelessly contrived Similarly the Song era master Foyan Qingyuan rejected the use of koans public cases and similar stories arguing that they did not exist during the time of Bodhidharma and that the true koan is what is presently coming into being br br Nianfo Jp nembutsu from Skt buddh nusm ti recollection of the Buddha refers to the recitation of the Buddha s name in most cases the Buddha Amitabha In Chinese Chan the Pure Land practice of nianfo based on the phrase N m m tu f Homage to Amitabha is a widely practiced form of Zen meditation which came to be known as Nianfo Chan Nianfo was practiced and taught by early Chan masters like Daoxin who taught that one should bind the mind to one buddha and exclusively invoke his name The practice is also taught in Shenxiu s Kuan hsin lun Likewise the Ch uan fa pao chi Taisho ca one of the earliest Chan histories shows this practice was widespread in the early Chan generation of Hung jen Fa ju and Ta tung who are said to have invoked the name of the Buddha so as to purify the mind br Evidence for the practice of nianfo chan can also be found in Changlu Zongze s died c Chanyuan qinggui The Rules of Purity in the Chan Monastery perhaps the most influential Ch an monastic code in East Asia Nianfo continued to be taught as a form of Chan meditation by later Chinese figures such as Yongming Yanshou Zhongfen Mingben and Tianru Weize During the late Ming the tradition of Nianfo Chan meditation was continued by figures such as Yunqi Zhuhong and Hanshan Deqing Chan figures like Yongming Yanshou generally advocated a view called mind only Pure Land wei hsin ching t u which held that the Buddha and the Pure Land are just mind br The practice of nianfo as well as its adaptation into the nembutsu k an is a major practice in the Japanese baku school of Zen The recitation of a Buddha s name was also practiced in the Soto school at different times throughout its history During the Meiji period for example both Shaka nembutsu reciting the name of Shakyamuni Buddha namu Shakamuni Butsu and Amida nembutsu were promoted by Soto school priests as easy practices for laypersons br Nianfo chan is also widely practiced in Vietnamese Thien br br Since Zen is a form of Mahayana Buddhism it is grounded on the schema of the bodhisattva path which is based on the practice of the transcendent virtues or perfections Skt p ramit Ch b lu m Jp baramitsu as well as the taking of the bodhisattva vows The most widely used list of six virtues is generosity moral training incl five precepts patient endurance energy or effort meditation dhyana wisdom An important source for these teachings is the Avatamsaka sutra which also outlines the grounds bhumis or levels of the bodhisattva path The p ramit s are mentioned in early Chan works such as Bodhidharma s Two entrances and four practices and are seen as an important part of gradual cultivation jianxiu by later Chan figures like Zongmi br An important element of this practice is the formal and ceremonial taking of refuge in the three jewels bodhisattva vows and precepts Various sets of precepts are taken in Zen including the five precepts ten essential precepts and the sixteen bodhisattva precepts This is commonly done in an initiation ritual Ch sh u ji Jp Jukai Ko sugye receiving the precepts which is also undertaken by lay followers and marks a layperson as a formal Buddhist br The Chinese Buddhist practice of fasting zhai especially during the uposatha days Ch zhairi days of fasting can also be an element of Chan training Chan masters may go on extended absolute fasts as exemplified by master Hsuan Hua s day fast which he undertook during the Cuban missile crisis for the generation of merit br br Zen developed in a Buddhist monastic context and throughout its history most Zen masters have been Buddhist monastics bhiksus ordained in the Buddhist monastic code Vinaya living in Buddhist monasteries East Asian Buddhist monasticism differs in various respects from traditional Buddhist monasticism however emphasizing self sufficiency For example Zen monks do not live by begging but store and cook their own food in the monastery and may even farm and grow their own food br Zen Monastics in Japan are particularly exceptional in the Buddhist tradition because the monks and nuns can marry after receiving their ordination This is because they follow the practice of ordaining under the bodhisattva vows instead of the traditional monastic Vinaya br Zen monasteries pinyin qi l n Jp garan Skt sa gh r ma will often rely on Zen monastic codes like the Rules of Purity in the Chan Monastery and Dogen s Pure Standards for the Zen Community Eihei Shingi which regulate life and behavior in the monastery Zen monasteries often have a specific building or hall for meditation the zend Chinese ch nt ng as well as a buddha hall Ch Jp butsuden used for ritual purposes which houses the main object of veneration Ch b nz n Jp honzon usually a Buddha image Life in a Zen monastery is often guided by a daily schedule which includes periods of work group meditation rituals and formal meals br br Intensive group meditation may be practiced by serious Zen practitioners In the Japanese language this practice is called sesshin While the daily routine may require monks to meditate for several hours each day during the intensive period they devote themselves almost exclusively to zen practice The numerous minute long sitting meditation zazen periods are interwoven with rest breaks ritualized formal meals Jp oryoki and short periods of work Jp samu that are to be performed with the same state of mindfulness In modern Buddhist practice in Japan Taiwan and the West lay students often attend these intensive practice sessions or retreats These are held at many Zen centers or temples br br Most Zen monasteries temples and centers perform various rituals services and ceremonies such as initiation ceremonies and funerals which are always accompanied by the chanting of verses poems or sutras There are also ceremonies that are specifically for the purpose of sutra recitation Ch niansong Jp nenju itself Zen schools may have an official sutra book that collects these writings in Japanese these are called kyohon Practitioners may chant major Mahayana sutras such as the Heart Sutra and chapter of the Lotus Sutra often called the Avalokite vara Sutra Dh ra s and Zen poems may also be part of a Zen temple liturgy including texts like the Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi the Sandokai the N laka ha Dh ra and the U a Vijaya Dh ra S tra br The butsudan is the altar in a monastery temple or a lay person s home where offerings are made to the images of the Buddha bodhisattvas and deceased family members and ancestors Rituals usually center on major Buddhas or bodhisattvas like Avalokite vara see Guanyin K itigarbha and Manjushri An important element in Zen ritual practice is the performance of ritual prostrations Jp raihai or bows usually done in front of a butsudan br A widely practiced ritual in Chinese Chan is the Tang era Rite for releasing the hungry ghosts The Chinese holiday of the Ghost Festival might also be celebrated with similar rituals for the dead These ghost rituals are a source of contention in modern Chinese Chan and masters such as Sheng Yen criticize the practice for not having any basis in Buddhist teachings Funerals are also an important ritual and are a common point of contact between Zen monastics and the laity Statistics published by the S t school state that percent of S t laymen visit their temple only for reasons having to do with funerals and death Seventeen percent visit for spiritual reasons and percent visit a Zen priest at a time of personal trouble or crisis br Another important type of ritual practiced in Zen are various repentance or confession rituals Jp zange that were widely practiced in all forms of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism One popular Chan text on this is known as the Emperor Liang Repentance Ritual composed by Chan master Baozhi Dogen also wrote a treatise on repentance the Shushogi br Other rituals could include rites dealing with local deities kami in Japan and ceremonies on Buddhist holidays such as Buddha s Birthday Another popular form of ritual in Japanese Zen is Mizuko kuy Water child ceremonies which are performed for those who have had a miscarriage stillbirth or abortion These ceremonies are also performed in American Zen Buddhism br br Depending on the tradition esoteric methods such as mantra and dh ra may also be used for different purposes including meditation practice protection from evil invoking great compassion invoking the power of certain bodhisattvas and are chanted during ceremonies and rituals In the Kwan Um school of Zen for example a mantra of Guanyin Kwanseum Bosal may be used during sitting meditation The Heart Sutra Mantra is also another mantra that is used in Zen during various rituals Another example is the Mantra of Light k my shingon which is common in Japanese Soto Zen and was derived from the Shingon sect br In Chinese Chan the usage of esoteric mantras in Zen goes back to the Tang dynasty There is evidence that Chan Buddhists adopted practices from Chinese Esoteric Buddhism in findings from Dunhuang According to Henrik S rensen several successors of Shenxiu such as Jingxian and Yixing were also students of the Zhenyan Mantra school Influential esoteric dh ra such as the U a Vijaya Dh ra S tra and the N laka ha Dh ra also begin to be cited in the literature of the Baotang school during the Tang dynasty The eighth century Chan monks of Shaolin temple also performed esoteric practices such as mantra and dharani Many mantras have been preserved since the Tang period and continue to be practiced in modern monasteries One common example is the ra gama Mantra which is common in Japanese Zen and has been propagated by various moden Chan figures like Hsuan Hua br Chan repentance rituals such as the Liberation Rite of Water and Land also involve various esoteric aspects including the invocation of esoteric deities such as the Five Wisdom Buddhas and the Ten Wisdom Kings Japanese Zen schools also adopted esoteric rites and continue to perform them These include the ambrosia gate kanro mon ghost festival ritual which includes esoteric elements the secret Dharma transmission shih rituals and in some cases the homa ritual br During the Joseon dynasty the Korean Zen Seon was highly inclusive and ecumenical This extended to Esoteric Buddhist lore and rituals that appear in Seon literature from the th century onwards According to S rensen the writings of several Seon masters such as Hyujeong reveal they were esoteric adepts In Japanese Zen the use of esoteric practices within Zen is sometimes termed mixed Zen kensh zen and the influential Soto monk Keizan J kin was major promoter of esoteric methods Keizan was heavily influenced by Shingon and Shugendo and is known for introducing numerous esoteric ritual forms into the Soto school Another influential Soto figure Menzan Zuih was also a practitioner of Shingon having received esoteric initiation under a Shingon figure named Kisan Biku Similarly numerous Rinzai figures were also esoteric practitioners such as the Rinzai founder My an Eisai and Enni Ben en Under Enni Ben en s abbotship Fumon in the future T fuku ji held Shingon and Tendai rituals He also lectured on the esoteric Mahavairocana sutra br br Certain arts such as painting calligraphy poetry gardening flower arrangement tea ceremony and others have also been used as part of zen training and practice Classical Chinese arts like brush painting and calligraphy were used by Chan monk painters such as Guanxiu and Muqi Fachang to communicate their spiritual understanding in unique ways to their students Some Zen writes even argued that devotion to an art Japanese suki could be a spiritual practice that leads to enlightenment as the Japanese monk poet Ch mei writes in his Hosshinsh br Zen paintings are sometimes termed zenga in Japanese Hakuin is one Japanese Zen master who was known to create a large corpus of unique sumi e ink and wash paintings and Japanese calligraphy to communicate zen in a visual way His work and that of his disciples were widely influential in Japanese Zen Another example of Zen arts can be seen in the short lived Fuke sect of Japanese Zen which practiced a unique form of blowing zen suizen by playing the shakuhachi bamboo flute br br Traditional martial arts like Chinese martial arts Japanese archery other forms of Japanese bud have also been seen as forms of zen praxis by some Zen schools In China this trend goes back to the influential Shaolin Monastery in Henan which developed the first institutionalized form of g ngfu By the late Ming Shaolin g ngfu was very popular and widespread as evidenced by mentions in various forms of Ming literature featuring staff wielding fighting monks like Sun Wukong and historical sources which also speak of Shaolin s impressive monastic army that rendered military service to the state in return for patronage br These Shaolin practices which began to develop around the th century were also traditionally seen as a form of Chan Buddhist inner cultivation today called wuchan martial chan The Shaolin arts also made use of Taoist physical exercises daoyin breathing and qi cultivation qigong practices They were seen as therapeutic practices which improved internal strength neili health and longevity lit nourishing life yangsheng as well as means to spiritual liberation The influence of these Taoist practices can be seen in the work of Wang Zuyuan ca after whose Illustrated Exposition of Internal Techniques Neigong tushuo shows how Shaolin monks drew on Taoist methods like those of the Yijin Jing and Eight pieces of brocade According to the modern Chan master Sheng Yen Chinese Buddhism has adopted internal cultivation exercises from the Shaolin tradition as ways to harmonize the body and develop concentration in the midst of activity This is because techniques for harmonizing the vital energy are powerful assistants to the cultivation of samadhi and spiritual insight Korean Seon also has developed a similar form of active physical training termed Sunmudo br br In Japan the classic combat arts bud and zen practice have been in contact since the embrace of Rinzai Zen by the H j clan in the th century who applied zen discipline to their martial practice One influential figure in this relationship was the Rinzai priest Takuan S h who was well known for his writings on zen and bud addressed to the samurai class especially his The Unfettered Mind br The Rinzai school also adopted certain Chinese practices which work with qi which are also common in Taoism They were introduced by Hakuin who learned various techniques from a hermit named Hakuyu who helped Hakuin cure his Zen sickness a condition of physical and mental exhaustion These energetic practices known as naikan are based on focusing the mind and one s vital energy ki on the tanden a spot slightly below the navel br br Zen is grounded in the rich doctrinal background of East Asian Mahayana Buddhism Zen doctrinal teaching is thoroughly influenced by the Mahayana Buddhist teachings on the bodhisattva path Chinese Madhyamaka S nl n Yogacara W ish the Praj aparamita literature and Buddha nature texts like the La k vat ra S tra and the Nirvana sutra br Some Zen traditions especially Linji Rinzai focused traditions stress a narrative which sees Zen as a special transmission outside scriptures which does not stand upon words Nevertheless Mahayana Buddhist doctrine and East Asian Buddhist teachings remain an essential part of Zen Buddhism Various Zen masters throughout the history of Zen like Guifeng Zongmi Jinul and Yongming Yanshou have instead promoted the correspondence of the teachings and Zen which argues for the unity of Zen and the Buddhist teachings br In Zen doctrinal teaching is often compared to the finger pointing at the moon While Zen doctrines point to the moon awakening the Dharma realm the originally enlightened mind one should not mistake fixating on the finger the teachings to be Zen instead one must look at the moon reality As such doctrinal teachings are just another skillful means upaya which can help one attain awakening They are not the goal of Zen nor are they held as fixed dogmas to be attached to since ultimate reality transcends all concepts but are nevertheless seen as useful as long as one does not reify them or cling to them br br The complex Mahayana Buddhist notion of Buddha nature Sanskrit buddhadh tu Chinese f x ng was a key idea in the doctrinal development of Zen and remains central to Zen Buddhism In China this doctrine developed to encompass the related teaching of original enlightenment b nju which held that the awakened mind of a Buddha is already present in each sentient being and that enlightenment is inherent from the outset and accessible in the present br Drawing on sources like the Lankavatara sutra the buddha nature sutras the Awakening of Faith and the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment Chan masters championed the view that the innately awakened buddha mind was immanently present within all beings Following the view of the Awakening of Faith this awakened buddha nature is seen in Zen as the empty source of all things the ultimate principle li out of which all phenomena Ch shi i e all dharmas arise br Thus the Zen path is one of recognizing the inherently enlightened source that is already here Indeed the Zen insight and the Zen path are based on that very innate awakening By the time of the codification of the Platform Sutra c th to th century the Zen scripture par excellence original enlightenment had become a central teaching of the Zen tradition br Historically influential Chan schools like East Mountain and Hongzhou drew on the Awakening of Faith in its teachings on the buddha mind the true mind as Suchness which Hongzhou compared to a clear mirror Similarly the Tang master Guifeng Zongmi draws on the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment when he writes that all sentient beings without exception have the intrinsically enlightened true mind which is a clear and bright ever present awareness that gets covered over by deluded thoughts The importance of the concept of the innately awakened mind for Zen is such that it even became an alternative name for Zen the Buddha mind school br br The influence of Madhyamaka and Praj aparamita on Zen can be discerned in the Zen stress on emptiness k ng non conceptual wisdom Skt nirvikalpa j ana the teaching of no mind and the apophatic and sometimes paradoxical language of Zen literature br Zen masters and texts took great pains to avoid the reification of doctrinal concepts and terms including important terms like buddha nature and enlightenment This is because Zen affirms the Mahayana view of emptiness which states that all phenomena lack a fixed and independent essence svabhava To avoid any reification which grasps at essences Zen sources often make use of a negative dialectic influenced by Madhyamaka philosophy As Kasulis writes since all things are empty the Zen student must learn not to think of linguistic distinctions as always referring to ontically distinct realities Indeed all doctrines distinctions and words are relative and deceptive in some way and thus they must be transcended This apophatic element of Zen teaching is sometimes described as Mu Ch w no which appears in the famous Zhaozhou s Dog koan A monk asked Does a dog have a Buddha nature or not The master said Not w br Zen teachings also often include a seemingly paradoxical use of both negation and affirmation For example the teachings of the influential Tang dynasty master Mazu Daoyi founder of the Hongzhou school could include affirmative phrases like Mind is Buddha as well as negative ones like it is neither mind nor Buddha Since no concepts or differentiations can capture the true nature of things Zen affirms the importance of the non conceptual and non differentiating perfection of wisdom praj aparamita which transcends all relative and conventional language even the language of negation itself According to Kasulis this is the basis of much apophatic rhetoric found in Zen which often seems paradoxical or contradictory br The importance of negation is also seen in the key Zen teaching of no mind wuxin which is considered to be a state of meditative clarity free of concepts defilements and clinging which is also associated with wisdom and a direct experience of the ultimate truth br br Zen texts also stress the concept of non duality Skt advaya Ch which is an important theme in Zen literature and is explained in various different ways One set of themes is the non dual unity of the absolute and the relative truths which derives from the classic Buddhist theme of the two truths This can be found in Zen sources like the Five Ranks of Tozan Faith in Mind and the Harmony of Difference and Sameness It is also an important theme in Mahayana sutras which are important to Zen like the Vimalak rtinirde a and the La k vat ra S tra br A related explanation of non duality which is influential in Zen makes use of the Chinese Buddhist discourse of essence function Ch tiyong which is most famously taught in the influential Awakening of Faith In this type of discourse the essence refers to the inner nature of things the absolute reality while the functions refer to the more external relative and secondary characteristics of things The Platform Sutra compares the essence to a lamp while the function is its light br Another application of non duality in Zen discourse is the idea that mundane reality which includes the natural world i e samsara the world of suffering and nirvana the ultimate enlightened reality are not separate This is a view found in Indian Mahayana sources like Nagarjuna s Root Verses on Madhyamaka As such Buddhas and sentient beings as well as Buddhahood and the natural world are also considered to be non dual in Zen This idea influenced Zen attitudes on social harmony and harmony he with the natural world br A further meaning of non duality in Zen is as the absence of a duality between the perceiving subject and the perceived object This understanding of non duality is derived from the Indian Yogachara school The philosophy of the Huayan school also had an influence on Chinese Chan s conception of the non dual ultimate truth and its understanding of essence function One example is the Huayan doctrine of the interpenetration of phenomena or perfect interfusion yuanrong which also makes use of native Chinese philosophical concepts such as principle li and phenomena shi The influence of the related Huayan theory of the Fourfold Dharmadhatu can be seen in the Five Ranks of Dongshan Liangjie the founder of the Caodong lineage of Chan br br The idea of the immanent character of Buddha nature influenced Zen s characteristic emphasis on a direct insight As such a central topic of discussion in Zen is seeing the nature pinyin ji nx ng Jp kensh Zen teachings use this term to refer to an insight which can occur to a Zen practitioner suddenly and often equate it with a kind of enlightenment The nature here is the buddha nature the originally enlightened mind As such this experience provides one with a glimpse of the ultimate truth The term ji nx ng occurs in the classic Zen phrase seeing one s nature becoming Buddha which is held to encapsulate the meaning of Zen Zen schools have disagreed with each other on how to achieve seeing nature the Linji school s huatou practice vs Caodong s silent illumination as well as how to relate to cultivate express and deepen one s relationship with the experience This remains a major topic of debate and discussion among contemporary Zen traditions br br Traditionally Zen considers that its practices aim at a sudden insight into the true nature of things This idea of sudden enlightenment or instant awakening d nw which is closely related to seeing the nature is another important theme in Zen Zen sources often argue that its sudden method is more direct and superior to the gradual paths which take place in a step by step fashion Such methods can be found in some of the earliest Zen traditions like the East Mountain school s teaching of maintaining the one a direct contemplation on buddha nature that was not dependent on preliminary practices or step by step instructions br The sudden teaching was further emphasized by patriarch Shenhui and it became canonized as a key Zen teaching in the Platform Sutra In spite of the rhetorical emphasis on sudden awakening and the critique of gradual methods found in various Zen sources Zen traditions do not reject gradual practices such as taking precepts scriptural study ritual practice and the six paramitas Instead Zen schools generally incorporate these practices within a schema grounded in sudden enlightenment thought As such many Zen sources which emphasize sudden awakening like the Platform Sutra also refer to traditional Mahayana practices br This means that the Zen path does not end at seeing the nature since further practice and cultivation is considered necessary to deepen one s insight remove the traces of the defilements attachments aversions etc and to learn to express buddha nature in daily life Zen masters like Zongmi described this method as sudden enlightenment followed by gradual cultivation holding that the sudden and gradual teachings point to the same truth Zongmi argued that even though sudden awakening reveals the truth directly and instantly the Zen practitioner still has deeply rooted defilements Skt kle a Ch f nn o which cloud the mind and can only be removed through further training br This sudden gradual schema became a standard view of Zen practice in China after the time of Zongmi It is found in Zen sources like Dongshan s Five Ranks the works of Jinul the Four Ways of Knowing of Hakuin Torei s Undying Lamp of Zen and the Ten Ox Herding Pictures which depict a gradual set of steps on the Zen path while also including the idea of a sudden awakening to an immanent innate pure nature br br Today there are two major traditions or groupings of Zen schools along with numerous other smaller lineages orders and schools The two main lineages are the Caodong tradition traced back to Dongshan Liangjie and the Linji school which is traced to Linji Yixuan died CE During the Song dynasty the Caodong lineage became closely associated with the teaching of silent illumination Ch mozhao as formulated by Hongzhi Zhengjue The competing Linji school meanwhile became associated with the contemplation method of Dahui Zonggao which focuses on meditating on the huatou critical phrase of a koan Some traditions and organizations include both lineages so these categories should not be seen as mutually exclusive br Both the Linji school and the Caodong school were transmitted outside of China to Japan Korea and Vietnam S t is the Japanese line of Caodong and it was founded by D gen who emphasized the practice of shikantaza nothing but just sitting The S t school has de emphasized k ans since Gent Sokuch circa A Vietnamese Caodong lineage T o ng was founded by th century Chan master Th ng Gi c o Nam Recently the Caodong silent illumination method was revived in the Sinosphere by Sheng Yen and his Dharma Drum Mountain association br br Regarding Linji it is known in Japan as the Rinzai school This tradition emphasizes meditation on k ans mediated through master disciple meetings sanzen as the essential method to attain kensh seeing one s true nature Most traditions in Korean Seon are also generally in the Linji lineage and focus on huatou practice though the exact methods and teachings on this differ There are also Vietnamese lineages of Linji such as the L m T and the Li u Qu n schools These lineages also mix Zen practice with Pure Land elements br br Besides the two major families or traditions of Zen there are several smaller schools These include br br baku sh a school established in the th century It includes classic Chan teachings and also Pure Land methods br Fuke sh a small Japanese sect A unique feature of this sect is the use of flute music as a meditation br Sanbo Kyodan a modern Japanese school which draws on both Rinzai and S t methods br Tr c L m a unique native sect of Vietnamese Zen which is known for attempting to harmonize the Three teachings of Buddhism Confucianism and Taoism br The Plum Village L ng Mai Tradition a new modern tradition founded by the influential Vietnamese teacher and activist Th ch Nh t H nh br The Kwan Um School of Zen a new modern tradition founded by Zen Master Seung Sahn br Schools of Zen recently founded in America such as Ordinary Mind Zen School and White Plum Asanga br br Zen practice like that of all religions is supported by collective endeavors Though some Zen sources sometimes emphasize individual experience and antinomianism Zen traditions are maintained and transferred by mostly hierarchical temple based institutions focused around a core of ordained clergy These Zen masters or teachers Ch sh fu Jp r shi or osh may or may not be celibate monastics bhiksus who follow the Vinaya the traditional Buddhist monastic code depending on the tradition br Some important Zen organizations include the Japanese S t school the Soto Zen Buddhist Association of America the various independent branches of Japanese Rinzai the Korean Jogye and Taego orders and the Chinese Dharma Drum Mountain and Fo Guang Shan organizations In Japan modernity led to criticism of traditional Zen institutions and new lay oriented Zen schools such as the Sanbo Kyodan and the Ningen Zen Kyodan emerged in response Some modern challenges for contemporary Zen include how to organize the continuity of the Zen tradition constraining charismatic authority with the risk of abuse of power it brings on the one hand and maintaining the legitimacy of traditional authorities by limiting the number of authorized teachers on the other hand br br An important feature of traditional Zen institutions is the use of dharma transmission Chinese chu n f from master to disciple to pass on Zen lineages to the next generation The procedure of dharma transmission particularly the act of authorization or confirmation Ch y n k Jp inka K inga is considered to establish a Zen teacher as a direct successor of their master and to link them to a lineage which is traditionally believed to go back to the ancient Chinese patriarchs and to the Buddha himself These transmissions are sometimes seen esoterically as the mind to mind transmission of the light of awakening from master to disciple Scholars like William Bodiford and John Jorgensen have argued that this ancestral dimension of Zen which sees the school as an extended family is influenced by Confucian values and that it is part of what allowed Zen to become such an influential form of Buddhism in East Asia br Zen lineages often maintain Zen lineage charts which list all the teachers in their transmission lineage establishing institutional legitimacy by claiming a direct link from the Buddha to the present Indeed according to Michel Mohr the traditional view is that it is through the transmission process that the identity and integrity of the lineage is preserved Zen lineage narratives were further supported by transmission of the lamp texts e g J ngd Chu nd ngl which contained stories of the past masters and legitimized Zen lineages These texts could often be sectarian favoring a specific lineage or school and they sometimes even led to conflict among the Zen schools Furthermore these Zen transmission narratives were often not historically accurate and contain mythological material developed over centuries in China Their historicity has been recently critiqued by modern scholars br The formal practice of dharma transmission is generally understood in two main ways by Zen traditions It can be seen as a formal recognition of a disciple s deep spiritual realization which is separate from clerical ordination It could also be understood as an institutional procedure which ensures the transmission of a temple lineage br br The institutions of Dharma transmission have come under criticism in various times throughout Zen history Zen masters like Linji and Ikky were said to have refused to receive transmission certificates seeing the procedure as corrupt and institutionalized During the Ming dynasty important masters like Hanshan Deqing Zibo Zhenke and Yunqi Zhuhong did not belong to any formal lineage According to Jiang Wu these eminent Ming Chan monks emphasized self cultivation while criticizing formulaic instructions and nominal recognition Wu writes that at this time eminent monks who practiced meditation and asceticism but without proper dharma transmission were acclaimed as acquiring wisdom without teachers wushizhi Hanshan s writings indicate that he seriously questioned the value of dharma transmission seeing personal enlightenment as what truly mattered in Zen br In a similar fashion several important medieval Japanese masters like Takuan S h eschewed formal transmission and did not believe it was necessary since the Dharma was always available to be discovered within Some of these figures were even considered self enlightened and self certified jigo jish since they claimed to have achieved wisdom without a teacher pinyin w sh zh Japanese mushi dokugo They include Suzuki Sh san and My shin ji figures like Daigu Ungo and Isshi Modern Chinese Buddhists like Tanxu Taixu and Yinshun also criticized dharma transmission seeing it as a Chinese invention that was not taught by the Buddha Taixu held that the practice led to sectarianism and Tanxu wrote that it contributed to the decline of Zen Yinshun believed that the Dharma was not something that could belong to anyone and thus it could not be transmitted in a lineage br br Zen is deeply rooted in the teachings and doctrines of Mah y na Buddhism Classic Zen texts such as the Platform sutra contain numerous references to Mah y na sutras According to Sharf Zen monastics are expected to become familiar with the classics of the Zen canon A review of the early historical literature of early Zen clearly reveals that their authors were well versed in numerous Mah y na s tras as well as Mahayana Buddhist philosophy such as Madhyamaka br Nevertheless Zen masters are sometimes pictured as iconoclastically anti intellectual and dismissive of scriptural study or at least as weary of scripture Early Chan sources contain numerous statements which see scriptural study as unecessary The Bodhidharma Anthology for example states don t use knowledge of the sutras and treatises and instead states one should return to the ultimate principle firmly abiding without shifting in no way following after the written teachings The Bloodstream Sermon states The true Way is sublime It can t be expressed in language Of what use are scriptures But someone who sees his own nature finds the Way even if he can t read a word br br This radical antinomian view of Zen became more pronounced during a period between the late Tang and the Song Dynasty when Ch n especially the Hongzhou school became the dominant in China and gained great popularity among the literary classes who were attracted to the idea that true sages did not depend on texts and language Several famous phrases from this period defined Zen as not established on words and letters and as a special transmission outside the scriptures statements which were anachronistically attributed to Bodhidharma The Record of Linji is even more radical stating that the Buddhist scriptures are all so much old toilet paper to wipe away filth Another example of this attitute is found in the story of Deshan Xuanjian who is known for having burned all his scriptural commentaries br However scholars like Welter and Hori write that these rhetorical statements were not a complete denial of the importance of study and scripture but a warning to those who mistake the teachings for the direct insight into truth itself Indeed Chan masters of this period continue to cite and refer to Buddhist sutra passages Furthermore not all masters made use of this kind of rhetorical Chan which was popular in the Chinese Linji school and emphasized a direct mind to mind transmission of the truth from master to disciple while de emphasizing sutra study Another contrasting style of Chinese Chan was a more moderate literary Chan wenzi chan associated with figures like Nanyang Huizhong Zongmi and Yongming Yanshou This type of Chan continued to actively promote doctrinal study as a part of Chan practice with the slogan of the correspondence of the teachings and Chan chiao ch an i chih Even Mazu Daoyi often depicted as a great iconoclast alludes to and quotes numerous Mahayana sutras as do other Hongzhou school masters He also stated in his sermons that Bodhidharma used the Lank vat ra Scripture to seal the sentient beings mind ground br Zongmi s perspective was that the scriptures are like a marking line to be used as a standard to determine true and false those who transmit Ch an must use the scriptures and treatises as a standard Juefan Huihong coined the term literary chan and wrote on the importance of studying the sutras in his Zhizheng zhuan Commentary on wisdom and enlightenment Later figures like Zibo Zhenke and Hanyue Fazang promoted the view of Chan practice which makes use of the sutras based on the Zhizheng zhuan Similarly the Japanese Rinzai master Hakuin writes that the Zen path begins with studying all the classic Buddhist sutras and commentaries citing one of the four vows which states the Dharma teachings are infinite I vow to study them all br As such while the various Zen traditions today emphasize that enlightenment arises from a direct non conceptual insight they also generally accept that study and understanding of the Buddhist teachings support and guide one s practice Hori writes that modern Rinzai Zen teachers do not teach that intellectual understanding has nothing to do with Zen instead they teach the quite opposite lesson that Zen requires intellectual understanding and literary study Since the emphasis is generally on a balanced approach to study and practice the extremes which reject either pole are seen as problematic by most Zen traditions As Hori writes referring to the attitude of the modern Rinzai school the intellectual understanding of Zen and the experience itself are presented as standing in a complementary both and relationship As such it is said that the master of Zen uses two swords the study of the teaching kyoso and the experience of the way doriki br br The early Buddhist schools in China were each based on a specific sutra At the beginning of the Tang dynasty by the time of the Fifth Patriarch Hongren the Zen school became established as a separate school of Buddhism and began to develop its doctrinal position based on the scriptures Various sutras were used by the early Zen tradition even before the time of Hongren They include the r m l dev S tra Huike Awakening of Faith Daoxin the Lankavatara Sutra East Mountain School the Diamond Sutra Shenhui and the Platform Sutra a Chinese composition br The Chan tradition drew inspiration from a variety of scriptural sources and did not follow any single scripture over the others Subsequently the Zen tradition produced a rich corpus of written literature which has become a part of its practice and teaching Other influential sutras in Zen are the Vimalakirti Sutra Avatamsaka Sutra the Shurangama Sutra and the Mahaparinirvana Sutra Important apocryphal sutras composed in China include the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment and the Vajrasamadhi sutra br In his analysis of the works of the influential Tang dynasty Hongzhou school Mario Poceski notes that they cite the following Mahayana sutras often the Lotus Sutra the Huayan the Nirvana the La k vat ra the Praj p ramit sutras the Mah ratnak ta the Mah samnip ta and the Vimalak rti br br Zen developed a rich textual tradition based on original Zen writings such as poems dialogues histories and the recorded sayings of Zen masters Important Zen texts and genres include br br Zen sutras or scriptures Ch j ng such as the Platform Sutra a key work in the development and history of Zen The Korean Vajrasamadhi sutra is another apocryphal Zen work which calls itself a sutra br Poems or songs like Faith in Mind Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi and Song of Awakening br Records of Zen transmission and teachings tenglu and encounter dialogues ch jiyuan wenda jp kien mond such as Masters of the Lankavatara c Transmission of the Lamp c and Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall br Recorded sayings of the masters yulu like the Record of Mazu Huangbo s Essential of Mind Transmission the Linji Yulu and the Yunmen yulu br Collections of Zen koans Ch gongan such as the Gateless Barrier the Book of Equanimity and the Blue Cliff Record br Meditation manuals like the Zuochan Yi and the Fukanzazengi br br The history of Ch n in China is divided into various periods by different scholars who generally distinguish a classical phase and a post classical period Each period had different schools of Zen some of which remained influential while others vanished br Ferguson distinguishes three periods from the th century into the th century the Legendary period of the six patriarchs th century to the s BCE the Classical period of the Hongzhou masters s to and the Literary period of Song dynasty Chan which saw the compilation of the gongan collections and the rise of Linji and Caodong br McRae distinguishes four rough phases in the history of Ch n though he notes this is only an expedient device and the reality was much more complicated br br Proto Ch n c Southern and Northern dynasties to and Sui dynasty CE In this phase Ch n developed in multiple locations in northern China It was based on the practice of meditation as taught by figures likeBodhidharma and Huike A key source from this period is the Two Entrances and Four Practices attributed to Bodhidharma br Early Ch n c Tang dynasty c CE In this phase Ch n took its first clear contours Prime figures are the fifth patriarch Daman Hongren his dharma heir Yuquan Shenxiu the sixth patriarch Huineng protagonist of the quintessential Platform Sutra and Shenhui whose propaganda elevated Huineng to the status of sixth patriarch Major schools are the Northern School Southern School and Oxhead school br Middle Ch n c from An Lushan Rebellion c to the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period Major schools include the Hongzhou school the Heze school and the Hubei faction Some key figures include Mazu Shitou Huangbo Linji Xuefeng Yicun Zongmi and Yongming Yanshou A key text from this period is the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall which includes many encounter stories as well as the traditional genealogy of the Ch n school br Song Dynasty Ch n c This period saw the development of the traditional Zen narrative as well as the rise of the Linji school and the Caodong school The key figures are Dahui Zonggao who introduced the Hua Tou practice and Hongzhi Zhengjue who emphasized Shikantaza This era saw the composition of the classic koan collections e g Blue Cliff Record which reflect the influence of the literati class on the development of Ch n In this phase Ch n is transported to Japan and exerts a great influence on Korean Seon via Jinul br Neither Ferguson nor McRae give a periodisation for Chinese Ch n following the Song dynasty though McRae mentions at least a post classical phase or perhaps multiple phases David McMahan discusses the later Ming and Qing era of Chan which saw increasing syncretism with other traditions and a later modern phase th century onwards during which Chan adapted western ideas and attempted to modernize in response to the pressure of foreign imperialism br br Before the arrival of the founder of Chan Bodhidharma various Buddhist masters of meditation or dhyana Ch channa had taught in China including An Shigao and Buddhabhadra These figures also brought with them various meditation texts called the Dhy na sutras which mainly drew from the teachings of the Sarv stiv da These early meditation texts laid the groundwork for the practices of Chan Buddhism The translation work of Kum raj va especially his Praj p ramit translations and his Vimalakirti Sutra Buddhabhadra Avatamsaka Sutra and Gunabhadra Lank vat ra s tra were also key formative influences on Chan and remained key sources for later Chan masters Indeed in some early Chan texts like the Masters of the Lank vat ra it is Gunabhadra not Bodhidharma which is seen as the first patriarch who transmits the Chan lineage here seen as synonymous with the Lank vat ra tradition from India The meditation works of the fourth Tiantai patriarch Zhiyi such as his monumental Mohezhiguan were also influential on later Chan meditation manuals like the Tso chan i br A further possible influence on the origin of Chan Buddhism is Taoism Some of the earliest Chinese Buddhists were influenced by Daoist thought and terminology and this has led some scholars to see a Taoist influence on Chan Two Chinese disciples of Kum raj va Sengzhao and Tao Sheng were influenced by Taoist works like the Laozi and Zhuangzi These Sanlun figures in turn had an influence on some early Chan masters br br Proto Ch n c encompasses the Southern and Northern dynasties period to and Sui dynasty CE This is the time of the first patriarchs of Chan like Bodhidharma Seng fu and Huike There is little actual historical information about these early figures and most legendary stories about their life come from later mostly Tang sources What is known is that they were considered Mahayana meditation masters chanshi br An important text from this period is the Two Entrances and Four Practices found in Dunhuang and attributed to Bodhidharma Later sources mention that these figures taught using the La k vat ra S tra though there is no direct evidence of this from the earliest sources According to John McRae the earliest Chan sources on these masters show considerable influence from Madhyamaka thought while the influence from the La k vat ra is actually much less pronounced As such it is questionable if it was there at all with regards to the earliest figures like Bodhidharma and Huike br br Early Ch n refers to early Tang dynasty Ch n The fifth patriarch Daman Hongren and his dharma heir Yuquan Shenxiu were influential in founding the first Chan institution in Chinese history known as the East Mountain school Hongren emphasized the meditation practice of maintaining guarding the mind which focuses on an awareness of True Mind or Buddha nature within Shenxiu was the most influential and charismatic student of Hongren and was considered to be the sixth patriarch by his followers He was even invited to the Imperial Court by Empress Wu br Shenxiu also became the target of much criticism by Shenhui for his supposedly gradualist teachings Shenhui instead promoted the sudden teachings attributed to his teacher Huineng Shenhui s propaganda campaign eventually succeeded when he became a key figure in the royal court elevating Huineng to the status of sixth patriarch of Chinese Ch n br This sudden vs gradual debate came to define later forms of Chan discourse This early period also saw the composition of the Platform Sutra which would become one of the most influential Chan texts of all time The sutra purports to contain the teachings of the sixth Patriarch Huineng but modern scholars like Yanagida Seizan now believe that it was redacted over a period of time within the Oxhead school According to McRae the text attempts to reconcile the so called sudden teachings with the gradual teachings of the Northern school br br The Middle Ch n c phase runs from the An Lushan Rebellion to the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period This period saw the rise of Chan schools in rural southern China The most prominent among them was the Hongzhou school of Mazu Daoyi which arose in Hunan and Jiangxi br Other important Hongzhou masters include Shitou Baizhang and Huangbo This school is sometimes seen as the archetypal expression of Ch n with its emphasis on the personal expression of the buddha mind in everyday life activities its use of slang and Chinese vernacular as opposed to classical Chinese as well as the importance it placed on spontaneous and unconventional questions and answers during an encounter linji wenda between master and disciple This period also sees the first Chan monastic code the Pure Rules of Baizhang br Some sources depict these masters as highly antinomian and iconoclastic people who make paradoxical or nonsensical statements shout at and beat their students to shock them into realization However modern scholars have seen much of the literature that presents these iconoclastic encounters as being later revisions during the Song era The Hongzhou masters may not have been as radical as the Song sources depict them to be and they seem to have promoted traditional Buddhist practices like keeping precepts accumulating good karma and practicing meditation br There were other important schools of Zen in this period as well such as the J ngzh ng school of Zhishen and Kim Hwasang which was based in Sichuan the Baotang school also in Sichuan and the more moderate and intellectual Heze lineage of Guifeng Zongmi Zongmi who was also a Huayan patriarch is known for his critique of the Hongzhou tradition his sutra commentaries and for his extensive writings on Chan br The Great Anti Buddhist Persecution in was devastating for all schools of metropolitan Chinese Buddhism but the Chan tradition survived in the rural areas and in the outlying regions Chan was thus in a position to take a leading role in the later eras of Chinese Buddhism br During the subsequent Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms era the Hongzhou school gradually split into several regional traditions led by various masters These eventually became known as the Five Houses of Ch n Gu y ng C od ng L nj F y n and Y nm n Some schools of this period particularly that of Linji Yixuan d promoted an iconoclastic and often absurd style with masters often hitting and shouting at students This period also saw the development of encounter dialogue literature some of which were retroactively attributed to past Chan masters An important encounter dialogue text from this period is the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall which also establishes a genealogy of the Ch n school br br During Song Dynasty Ch n c Ch n Buddhism became a dominant force Ch n became the largest sect of Chinese Buddhism and had strong ties to the imperial government which led to the development of a highly organized system of temple rank and administration The development of printing technology advanced during this era and Chan works were widely printed and distributed Furthermore during this period Chan literati developed their own idealized history seeing the Tang era as a golden age of Chan In spite of the popularity of Chan at this time it was also under increased attack by Neo Confucian scholars who wrote critiques of Buddhism and dominated the imperial examination system br The dominant form of Song Ch n was the Linji school This was due to extensive support from the scholar officials and the imperial court The Linji school developed the study of gong an public case Jp k an literature which depicted stories of master student encounters that were seen as demonstrations of the awakened mind Most k an stories depicted the idealized encounters of past Chan masters particularly from the Tang era and show the influence of the Chinese literati class Some influential k an texts are the Blue Cliff Record the Book of Equanimity and The Gateless Gate br During the th century a rivalry emerged between the Linji and the Caodong schools for the support of Chinese elites Hongzhi Zhengjue of the Caodong school emphasized silent illumination or serene reflection m zh o as a means for solitary practice which could be undertaken by lay followers The Linji school s Dahui Zonggao meanwhile introduced k an hua chan observing the word head chan which involved meditation on the crucial phrase or punch line hua tou of a gong an br The Song also saw the syncretism of Ch n and Pure Land Buddhism by figures like Yongming Yanshou a practice that would become very popular Yongming also echoed Zongmi s work in indicating that the values of Taoism and Confucianism could also be embraced and integrated into Buddhism Ch n also influenced Neo Confucianism as well as certain forms of Taoism such as the Quanzhen school br During the Song Ch n was also transmitted to Japan by figures My an Eisai and Nanpo Sh my who studied in China It also exerted a great influence on Korean Seon via figures like Jinul br br Some scholars see the post classical phase as an age of syncretism The post classical period saw the increasing popularity of the dual practice of Ch n and Pure Land Buddhism known as nianfo Chan as seen in the teachings of Zhongfeng Mingben Hanshan Deqing and Ouyi Zhixu This became a widespread phenomenon and in time much of the distinction between them was lost with many monasteries teaching both Ch n meditation and the Pure Land practice of nianfo The Ming dynasty also saw the efforts of figures such as Yunqi Zhuhong and Daguan Zhenke to revive and reconcile Chan Buddhism with the practice of Buddhist scriptural study and writing This non sectarian and syncretic style of Chan Buddhism which drew on all facets of Chinese Buddhism was so dominant at this time that all Chinese monks were affiliated a Chan school during the Ming br In the beginning of the Qing dynasty the highly influential teacher Miyun Yuanwu began a revival of the Linji school style Miyun s students had a broad impact on Qing Chan as well as on Japanese and Vietnamese Zen br br After further centuries of decline during the Qing dynasty Ch n activity was revived again in the th and th centuries by a flurry of modernist activity This period saw the rise of worldly Chan activism what is sometimes called Humanistic Buddhism or more literally Buddhism for human life rensheng fojiao promoted by figures like Jing an Yuanying Taixu Xuyun and Yinshun These figures promoted social activism to address issues such as poverty and social injustice as well as participation in political movements They also promoted modern science and scholarship including the use of the methods of modern critical scholarship to study the history of Chan br Many Ch n teachers today trace their lineage back to Xuyun including Sheng yen and Hsuan Hua who have propagated Ch n in the West where it has grown steadily through the th and st centuries Ch n Buddhism was repressed in China during the s in the Cultural Revolution but in the subsequent reform and opening up period in the s a revival of Chinese Buddhism has been taking place on the mainland while Buddhism has a significant following in Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as among Overseas Chinese br br Chan was introduced to Vietnam during the early Chinese occupation periods BCE to CE as Thi n During the L and Tr n to dynasties Thi n rose to prominence among the elites and the royal court and a new native tradition was founded the Tr c L m Bamboo Grove school which also contained Confucian and Taoist influences In the th century the Linji school was brought to Vietnam as the L m

master Th ch Thanh T the activist and popularizer Th ch Nh t H nh and the philosopher Th ch Thi n n Vietnamese Thi n is eclectic and inclusive bringing in many practices such as breath meditation nianfo mantra Theravada influences chanting sutra recitation and engaged Buddhism activism br br Seon was gradually transmitted into Korea during the late Silla period th through th centuries as Korean monks travelled to China and returned home to establish the initial Seon schools of Korea which were known as the nine mountain schools Seon received its most significant impetus and consolidation from the Goryeo monk Jinul who is considered the most influential figure in the formation of the mature Seon school Jinul founded the Jogye Order which remains the largest Seon tradition in Korea today as well as the important Songgwangsa temple Jinul also wrote extensive works on Seon developing a comprehensive system of thought and practice br Buddhism was mostly suppressed during the strictly Confucian Joseon dynasty and the number of monasteries and clergy sharply declined The period of Japanese occupation also brought numerous modernist ideas and changes to Korean Seon Some monks began to adopt the Japanese practice of marrying and having families while others such as Yongseong worked to resist the Japanese occupation Today the largest Seon school the Jogye enforces celibacy while the second largest the Taego Order allows for married priests Important modernist figures that influenced contemporary Seon include Seongcheol and Gyeongheo Seon has also been transmitted to West with new traditions such as the Kwan Um School of Zen br br Zen was not introduced as a separate school until the th century when My an Eisai traveled to China and returned to establish a Linji lineage which eventually perished Decades later Nanpo Sh my also studied Linji teachings in China before founding the Japanese Otokan lineage the most influential and only surviving lineage of Rinzai in Japan In D gen a younger contemporary of Eisai s journeyed to China himself where he became a disciple of the Caodong master Tiantong Rujing After his return D gen established the S t school the Japanese branch of Caodong br The three traditional schools of Zen in contemporary Japan are the S t Rinzai and baku The schools are further divided into subschools by head temple with two head temples for S t S ji ji and Eihei ji fourteen head temples for Rinzai and one head temple Manpuku ji for baku Besides these traditional organizations there are newer modern Zen organizations that have especially attracted Western lay followers namely the Sanbo Kyodan and the FAS Society br br Various Zen traditions were transmitted to the West in the th century Important Asian figures in this transmission include Soyen Shaku D T Suzuki Nyogen Senzaki Sokei an Shunryu Suzuki Taizan Maezumi Hsuan Hua Sheng yen Seung Sahn Th ch Thi n n and Th ch Nh t H nh Zen became more popular in the s and s when Western authors wrote on and promoted Zen Western popularizers include Eugen Herrigel Philip Kapleau Ruth Fuller Sasaki Erich Fromm Jack Kerouac Allen Ginsberg Gary Snyder Robert Pirsig and Alan Watts There are currently numerous Zen centers from various traditions in the Western world including Rinzai Soto Plum Village Chinese Chan and Kwan Um br br The Ch n of the Tang dynasty especially that of Mazu and Linji with its antinomian saying and emphasis on shock techniques was retrospectively seen as a golden age of Ch n by later Chan authors As Mario Poceski writes Song dynasty texts like the Record of the Transmission of the Lamp c depict the past masters as iconoclastic sages who embraced radical and transgressive practices like shouting beating their students and making paradoxical statements However these iconoclastic stories cannot be traced back to Tang era sources and a such they should be seen as apocryphal lore This traditional Zen narrative became dominant during the Song when Ch n became dominant form of Buddhism in China due to support from the Imperial Court and the scholar official class br Another important element of the traditional Zen narrative is that Zen is an unbroken lineage that has transmitted the enlightened Buddha mind from the time of the Shakyamuni Buddha to the present This narrative is traditionally supported through Zen histories and Zen lineage charts which developed in China throughout several centuries until they became canonized in the Song br The traditional picture of the ancient iconoclastic Zen masters has gained great popularity in the West in the th century especially due to the influence of D T Suzuki and Hakuun Yasutani This traditional narrative has been challenged and complemented since the s by modern academic research on Zen history and pre Song sources br Modern scientific research on the history of Zen discerns three main narratives concerning Zen its history and its teachings
