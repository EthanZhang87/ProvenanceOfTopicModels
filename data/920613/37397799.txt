half hour vignette of gags action and self empowerment couching its never give up message in terrific non stop entertainment Brian Lowry of Variety said Toy Story of Terror is about a quarter the length of the average animated feature but everything else here could easily be mistaken for the bigscreen version from the pacing and humor to Michael Giacchino s score Rob Owen of Pittsburgh Post Gazette said It s a small adventure befitting the minute running time but it s also clever in the way it ultimately puts the Toy Story characters in a recognizable situation which is similar to the big screen movies Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said Once the annual avalanche of Halloween themed episodes specials and movies overtakes TV you probably don t expect to be using the word charming very often But charming perfectly describes one such entry Toy Story of Terror Emily VanDerWerff of The A V Club said The Toy Story franchise has always operated best with a note of existential panic and there s some of that here but it feels like the special leans awfully hard on the films that gave rise to it Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times said Themes from earlier Toy Story movies are also recycled which should bother no one Although Woody and Buzz get their screen time with Jessie they are the Jules et Jim of computer animated cartoons about sentient playthings it is
