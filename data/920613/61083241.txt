writing br br Soul began development in January following the announcement of the th Academy Awards when director Pete Docter pitched an idea for a new film to then studio head of Pixar John Lasseter Docter pondered the origins of human personalities with the concept of determinism In his first meeting with co writer Mike Jones Docter pitched an idea set in the astral plane involving souls with personalities The film spent four years in production with an approximate million budget br Docter and Jones worked on the development of the main character for about two years Initial ideas included portraying Joe as a scientist which did not feel so naturally pure Pixar eventually settled on portraying the film s main character as a musician because they wanted an appealing profession for the audience According to Docter once the creative team decided the main character played jazz music the filmmakers chose to make him African American due to the race being tied to jazz history br With co writer Kemp Powers s help Docter wrote Joe during the film s early development Powers s initial contract was weeks long but was later extended After making extensive contributions to the film Powers became a co director making him Pixar s first African American co director Powers based several elements of Joe on his personal life but wanted the character to transcend his own experience in order to make him more accessible Powers also placed additional emphasis on authentically depicting Joe s relationships within the black community In order to portray accurately African American culture within the film Pixar worked closely with an internal Cultural Trust composed of black Pixar employees and hired several consultants These consultants included musicians Herbie Hancock Terri Lyne Carrington Quincy Jones and Jon Batiste educator Johnnetta Cole and stars Questlove and Diggs br The idea of Joe s soul entering the body of a therapy cat came from Mike Jones Docter and Powers appreciated the idea as it allowed Joe to be able to look at his own life from a different perspective and appreciate it According to Murray the filmmakers were undecided on Soul s ending before the last screening Some test versions of the film ended featuring Joe pondering whether to pass on to the Great Beyond returning to Earth a year later or staying in the Great Before as a mentor Initial storyboards featured several brief scenes showing s life on Earth after her new birth including one of her reuniting with Joe in New York These scenes were ultimately discarded br br br Casting br In August it was announced that Jamie Foxx Tina Fey Questlove Phylicia Rashad and Daveed Diggs had joined the cast In March Angela Bassett announced she was cast in the film During the release of the film s trailer in October Richard Ayoade Graham Norton Rachel House Alice Braga Wes Studi Fortune Feimster Zenobia Shroff Donnell Rawlings and June Squibb were also announced to be in the cast br Docter said Jamie Foxx himself a classically trained pianist was perfect for Joe citing his comedic skills and musical background Foxx related the film s bittersweet feeling of losing someone but gaining a vision of joy br Tina Fey in addition to voicing also contributed to the screenplay helping to write her character s lines She considered the film in the context of the COVID pandemic a helpful reminder that life isn t defined by achievement or attainment br br br Animation and design br Soul is Pixar s first film to feature an African American lead Pixar and Docter were mindful of the history of racist imagery particularly caricatured depictions of African Americans in animation and wanted to create black characters as well as integrate authentic African American culture into the film s DNA to prevent caricatures stereotypes and tropes Pixar sought to capture the fine details of the characters including the textures of black hair and the way light plays on various tones of black skin According to Powers the animators used lighting in emphasizing the character s ethnic features Cinematographer Bradford Young worked as a lighting consultant on the film br Animators used footage of several music performers including Batiste as reference for the film s musical sequences By capturing MIDI data from the sessions animators retraced the exact key being played on the piano with each note and animated the performances authentically According to Docter the animators assigned to specific musical instruments often either had experience playing them or a great appreciation for them br The souls were animated by the filmmakers in a vaporous ethereal and non physical way Souls were designed to depict various religious and cultural outlooks The designs were also inspired by early drawings made by Docter Animators created two designs for the souls in the film one for the new souls in The Great Before described as very cute very appealing with simple rounded shapes by supervising animator Jude Brownbill and one for mentor souls feature distinctive characteristics since they have been on Earth They differentiated souls from ghosts by adjusting their color palette accordingly Animating the souls designs was challenging and substantial According to Murray several artists helped create the souls designs by giving their suggestions and opinions on how they should look br The design of soul counselors Jerrys originated from line drawings made by story artist Aphton Corbin Another artist created wire sculptures of them and the design was finalized Together with the design of Terry they were seen by critics as a reference to Osvaldo Cavandoli s Italian animated series La Linea br Soul s fantastical elements were difficult to render To address the issue Docter referred to his film Inside Out where the filmmakers personified through physicality For the Great Before the filmmakers did not want it to be based in any specific culture given its nature of universality They sought inspiration from the architecture of s s world s fairs making a sense of awe and importance Production designer Steve Pilcher believed in the simplicity of the Great Before saying that it was complicated and naive According to Docter the aim of the design was to make a grand statement about learning and knowledge The personality pavilions were designed to be abstract looking shapes as a literal interpretation of the abstract ideas they represent For the Great Beyond the filmmakers conceptualized going toward the light which they believed the audience would understand br The astral plane sequence took months to create despite the actual scene having a short duration Visual effects supervisor Bill Watral compared the sequence to the shower scene from Psycho taking a long time to film in spite of the actual short time span During this sequence filmmakers painstakingly animated sands liquids and rocks for the brief sequence br To animate New York the filmmakers explored jazz clubs and pizza stops for inspiration A barbershop scene received additional input from Powers The animation style moved away from photorealism depicting the city as distorted and crooked br br br Music br br Musicians Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails composed an ambient score for the metaphysical segments of the film while Batiste composed a number of original jazz songs for the New York City based segments of the film Batiste created a user friendly jazz which felt authentic but could still be appreciated by a general audience Ross composed a somewhat ominous musical cue in the afterlife walkway scene which also incorporated real world sounds Reznor and Ross were brought in on the recommendation of sound designer Ren Klyce who had worked extensively with the duo in David Fincher films br The score and the original songs from Soul were released in two vinyl exclusive albums while also compiled onto a single digital album It s All Right the end credits song performed by Batiste was originally recorded by The Impressions A second cover of the song a duet between Batiste and British soul singer Celeste was released alongside the film br br br Release br br br Theatrical and streaming br Soul had its premiere on October at the BFI London Film Festival It was initially scheduled for theatrical release in the

exercise of Docter s expertise as the film was considered a return of Pixar s form by some critics Leslie Felperin The Hollywood Reporter and Jason Solomons TheWrap described the film as its peak with Solomons characterized its colorful visuals and gentle wisdom A O Scott of The New York Times expressed its combination of skill feeling and inspiration br The story characters and music were also commended Kaleem Aftab of IndieWire felt the narrative veered off in many unexpected directions so that even the inevitable end point feels just right USA Today s Brian Truitt commended the performances of Foxx and Fey For Time Out Dubai Whelan Barzey believed Joe s story could appeal to many generations Felperin and Peter Travers ABC News praised the musical score calling it sublime Truitt and Travers credited Batiste Reznor and Ross for their music merits br Reviews were not uniformly positive Kirsten Acuna from Insider felt that the studio had taken a few steps backward in their racial sensitivity as Soul used the same trope of turning Black characters into creatures Molly Freeman of Screen Rant acknowledged the film s message about the meaning of life and finding purpose but it s messy and only made muddier by the questions the movie sets up then fails to answer The result is Soul loses much of its emotional impact with the third act playing out more like a rush to the finish line of the story without giving as much weight to the themes and emotional throughline of the film Charles Pulliam Moore of Gizmodo wrote that Soul comes across less like an earnest and casual celebration of everyday Blackness and more like a twee depiction of it that s meant for white audiences consumption Namwali Serpell of The New Yorker published an extensive critical essay of the film citing among other issues Not only does Twenty two use Joe as a vehicle but the movie must also make the grandiose and grotesque claim that he has learned to live through her and concluding that The most glaring artistic error in Soul is its misprision its elision really of what soul means for black culture br br br Accolades br br At the rd Academy Awards Soul received a
