Portuguese endonym portugu s or in full l ngua portuguesa is a Western Romance language of the Indo European language family originating from the Iberian Peninsula of Europe It is the official language of Portugal Brazil Cape Verde Angola Mozambique Guinea Bissau and S o Tom and Pr ncipe and has co official language status in East Timor Equatorial Guinea and Macau Portuguese speaking people or nations are known as Lusophones lus fonos As the result of expansion during colonial times a cultural presence of Portuguese speakers is also found around the world Portuguese is part of the Ibero Romance group that evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in the medieval Kingdom of Galicia and the County of Portugal and has kept some Celtic phonology br With approximately million native speakers and million second language speakers Portuguese has approximately million total speakers It is usually listed as the fifth most spoken native language the third most spoken European language in the world in terms of native speakers and the second most spoken Romance language in the world surpassed only by Spanish Being the most widely spoken language in South America and the most spoken language in the Southern Hemisphere it is also the second most spoken language after Spanish in Latin America one of the most spoken languages in Africa and an official language of the European Union Mercosul the Organization of American States the Economic Community of West African States the African Union and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries an international organization made up of all of the world s officially Lusophone nations In a comprehensive academic study ranked Portuguese as one of the most influential languages in the world br br br History br br When the Romans arrived in the Iberian Peninsula in BC they brought with them the Latin language from which all Romance languages are descended The language was spread by Roman soldiers settlers and merchants who built Roman cities mostly near the settlements of previous Celtic civilizations established long before the Roman arrivals For that reason the language has kept a relevant substratum of much older Atlantic European Megalithic Culture and Celtic culture part of the Hispano Celtic group of ancient languages In Latin the Portuguese language is known as lusitana or latina lusitanica after the Lusitanians a pre Celtic tribe that lived in the territory of present day Portugal and Spain that adopted the Latin language as Roman settlers moved in This is also the origin of the luso prefix seen in terms like Lusophone br Between AD and AD as the Roman Empire collapsed in Western Europe the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by Germanic peoples of the Migration Period The occupiers mainly Suebi Visigoths and Buri who originally spoke Germanic languages quickly adopted late Roman culture and the Vulgar Latin dialects of the peninsula and over the next years totally integrated into the local populations Some Germanic words from that period are part of the Portuguese lexicon together with place names surnames and first names With the Umayyad conquest beginning in Arabic became the administrative and common language in the conquered regions but most of the remaining Christian population continued to speak a form of Romance called Mozarabic which introduced a few hundred words from Arabic Persian Turkish and Berber Like other Neo Latin and European languages Portuguese has adopted a significant number of loanwords from Greek mainly in technical and scientific terminology These borrowings occurred via Latin and later during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance br br Portuguese evolved from the medieval language known today by linguists as Galician Portuguese Old Portuguese or Old Galician of the northwestern medieval Kingdom of Galicia of which the County of Portugal was part It is in Latin administrative documents of the th century that written Galician Portuguese words and phrases are first recorded This phase is known as Proto Portuguese which lasted from the th century until the th century independence of the County of Portugal from the Kingdom of Le n which had by then assumed reign over Galicia br In the first part of the Galician Portuguese period from the th to the th century the language was increasingly used for documents and other written forms For some time it was the language of preference for lyric poetry in Christian Hispania much as Occitan was the language of the poetry of the troubadours in France The Occitan digraphs lh and nh used in its classical orthography were adopted by the orthography of Portuguese presumably by Gerald of Braga a monk from Moissac who became bishop of Braga in Portugal in playing a major role in modernizing written Portuguese using classical Occitan norms Portugal became an independent kingdom in under King Afonso I of Portugal In King Denis of Portugal created the first Portuguese university in Lisbon the Estudos Gerais which later moved to Coimbra and decreed for Portuguese then simply called the common language to be known as the Portuguese language and used officially br In the second period of Old Portuguese in the th and th centuries with the Portuguese discoveries the language was taken to many regions of Africa Asia and the Americas By the mid th century Portuguese had become a lingua franca in Asia and Africa used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and Europeans of all nationalities The Portuguese expanded across South America across Africa to the Pacific Ocean taking their language with them br Its spread was helped by mixed marriages between Portuguese and local people and by its association with Roman Catholic missionary efforts which led to the formation of creole languages such as that called Kristang in many parts of Asia from the word crist o Christian The language continued to be popular in parts of Asia until the th century Some Portuguese speaking Christian communities in India Sri Lanka Malaysia and Indonesia preserved their language even after they were isolated from Portugal br The end of the Old Portuguese period was marked by the publication of the Cancioneiro Geral by Garcia de Resende in The early times of Modern Portuguese which spans the period from the th century to the present day were characterized by an increase in the number of learned words borrowed from Classical Latin and Classical Greek because of the Renaissance learned words borrowed from Latin also came from Renaissance Latin the form of Latin during that time which greatly enriched the lexicon Most literate Portuguese speakers were also literate in Latin and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing and eventually speech in Portuguese br Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes once called Portuguese the sweet and gracious language while the Brazilian poet Olavo Bilac described it as a ltima flor do L cio inculta e bela the last flower of Latium na ve and beautiful Portuguese is also termed the language of Cam es after Lu s Vaz de Cam es one of the greatest literary figures in the Portuguese language and author of the Portuguese epic poem The Lusiads br In March the Museum of the Portuguese Language an interactive museum about the Portuguese language was founded in S o Paulo Brazil the city with the greatest number of Portuguese language speakers in the world The museum is the first of its kind in the world In the museum was partially destroyed in a fire but restored and reopened in br br br Geographic distribution br br Portuguese is spoken by approximately million people in South America million in Africa million in Europe million in North America and million in Asia and Oceania It is the native language of the vast majority of the people in Portugal Brazil and S o Tom and Pr ncipe Around of the population of urban Angola speaks Portuguese natively with approximately fluent these rates are lower in the countryside Just over and rapidly increasing of the population of Mozambique are native speakers of Portuguese and are fluent according to the census Portuguese is also spoken natively by of the population in Guinea Bissau and a Portuguese based creole is understood by all Almost of the East Timorese are fluent in Portuguese No data is available for Cape Verde but almost all the population is bilingual and the monolingual population speaks the Portuguese based Cape Verdean Creole Portuguese is mentioned in the Constitution of South Africa as one of the languages spoken by communities within the country for which the Pan South African Language Board was charged with promoting and ensuring respect br There are also significant Portuguese speaking immigrant communities in many territories including Andorra Bermuda Canada people in the census France people Japan people Jersey Luxembourg about of the population as of Namibia about of the population mainly refugees from Angola in the north of the country Paraguay or people Switzerland in learning mother tongue Venezuela and the United States of the population or speakers according to the American Community Survey br In some parts of former Portuguese India namely Goa and Daman and Diu the language is still spoken by about people In an estimated students were learning Portuguese in Goa Approximately of the people of Macau China are fluent speakers of Portuguese Additionally the language is being very actively studied in the Chinese school system right up to the doctorate level The Kristang people in Malaysia speak Kristang a Portuguese Malay creole however the Portuguese language itself is not widely spoken in the country br br br Official status br br The Community of Portuguese Language Countries br in Portuguese Comunidade dos Pa ses de L ngua Portuguesa with the Portuguese acronym CPLP consists of the nine independent countries that have Portuguese as an official language Angola Brazil Cape Verde East Timor Equatorial Guinea Guinea Bissau Mozambique Portugal and S o Tom and Pr ncipe br Equatorial Guinea made a formal application for full membership to the CPLP in June a status given only to states with Portuguese as an official language Portuguese became its third official language besides Spanish and French in and in July the country was accepted as a member of the CPLP br Portuguese is also one of the official languages of the Special Administrative Region of the People s Republic of China of Macau alongside Chinese and of several international organizations including Mercosul the Organization of Ibero American States the Union of South American Nations the Organization of American States the African Union the Economic Community of West African States the Southern African Development Community and the European Union br br br Lusophone countries br According to The World Factbook s country population estimates for the population of each of the ten jurisdictions is as follows by descending order br br The combined population of the entire Lusophone area was estimated at million in January This number does not include the Lusophone diaspora estimated at million people including million Portuguese million Brazilians although it is hard to obtain official accurate numbers of diasporic Portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of Lusophone territory or are children of immigrants and may have only a basic command of the language Additionally a large part of the diaspora is a part of the already counted population of the Portuguese speaking countries and territories such as the high number of Brazilian and PALOP emigrant citizens in Portugal or the high number of Portuguese emigrant citizens in the PALOP and Brazil br The Portuguese language therefore serves more than million people daily who have direct or indirect legal juridical and social contact with it varying from the only language used in any contact to only education contact with local or international administration commerce and services or the simple sight of road signs public information and advertising in Portuguese br br br Portuguese as a foreign language br Portuguese is a mandatory subject in the school curriculum in Uruguay Other countries where Portuguese is commonly taught in schools or where it has been introduced as an option include Venezuela Zambia the Republic of the Congo Senegal Namibia Eswatini South Africa Ivory Coast and Mauritius In a project was launched to introduce Portuguese as a school subject in Zimbabwe Also according to Portugal s Minister of Foreign Affairs the language will be part of the school curriculum of a total of countries by In such countries Portuguese is spoken either as a native language by vast majorities due to their Portuguese colonial past or as a lingua franca in bordering and multilingual regions such as on the Brazilian borders of Uruguay and Paraguay and in regions of Angola and Namibia In many other countries Portuguese is spoken by majorities as a second language There remain communities of thousands of Portuguese or Creole first language speakers in Goa Sri Lanka Kuala Lumpur Daman and Diu and other areas due to Portuguese colonization In East Timor the number of Portuguese speakers is quickly increasing as Portuguese and Brazilian teachers are making great strides in teaching Portuguese in the schools all over the island Additionally there are many large Portuguese speaking immigrant communities all over the world br br br Future br br According to estimates by UNESCO Portuguese is the fastest growing European language after English and the language has according to the newspaper The Portugal News publishing data given from UNESCO the highest potential for growth as an international language in southern Africa and South America Portuguese is a globalized language spoken officially on five continents and as a second language by millions worldwide br Since when Brazil signed into the economic community of Mercosul with other South American nations namely Argentina Uruguay and Paraguay Portuguese is either mandatory or taught in the schools of those South American countries br Although early in the st century after Macau was returned to China and immigration of Brazilians of Japanese descent to Japan slowed down the use of Portuguese was in decline in Asia it is once again becoming a language of opportunity there mostly because of increased diplomatic and financial ties with economically powerful Portuguese speaking countries in the world br br br Current status and importance br Portuguese being a language spread on all continents has official status in several international organizations It is one of twenty official languages of the European Union an official language of NATO the Organization of American States alongside Spanish French and English and one of eighteen official languages of the European Space Agency br Portuguese is a working language in nonprofit organisations such as the Red Cross alongside English German Spanish French Arabic and Russian Amnesty International alongside other languages of which English is the most used followed by Spanish French German and Italian and M decins sans Fronti res used alongside English Spanish French and Arabic in addition to being the official legal language in the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights also in Community of Portuguese Language Countries an international organization formed essentially by lusophone countries br br br Dialects accents and varieties br Modern Standard European Portuguese portugu s padr o or portugu s continental is based on the Portuguese spoken in the area including and surrounding the cities of Coimbra and Lisbon in central Portugal Standard European Portuguese is also the preferred standard by the Portuguese speaking African countries As such and despite the fact that its speakers are dispersed around the world Portuguese has only two dialects used for learning the European and the Brazilian Some aspects and sounds found in many dialects of Brazil are exclusive to South America and cannot be found in Europe The same occur with the Santomean Mozambican Bissau Guinean Angolan and Cape Verdean dialects being exclusive to Africa See Portuguese in Africa br Audio samples of some dialects and accents of Portuguese are available below There are some differences between the areas but these are the best approximations possible IPA transcriptions refer to the names in local pronunciation br br br Portugal br br Micaelense A ores S o Miguel Azores br Alentejano Alentejo Alentejan Portuguese with the Oliventine subdialect br Algarvio Algarve there is a particular dialect in a small part of western Algarve br Minhoto Districts of Braga and Viana do Castelo hinterland br Beir o Alto Alentejano Central Portugal hinterland br Beir o Central Portugal br Estremenho Regions of Coimbra and Lisbon this is a disputed denomination as Coimbra and is not part of Estremadura and the Lisbon dialect has some peculiar features that are not only not shared with that of Coimbra but also significantly distinct and recognizable to most native speakers from elsewhere in Portugal br Madeirense Madeiran Madeira br Portuense Regions of the district of Porto and parts of Aveiro br Transmontano Tr s os Montes e Alto Douro br br Audio samples of some dialects and accents of Portuguese are available below There are some differences between the areas but these are the best approximations possible IPA transcriptions refer to the names in local pronunciation br br br Brazil br Caipira Spoken in the states of S o Paulo most markedly on the countryside and rural areas southern Minas Gerais northern Paran and southeastern Mato Grosso do Sul Depending on the vision of what constitutes caipira Tri ngulo Mineiro border areas of Goi s and the remaining parts of Mato Grosso do Sul are included and the frontier of caipira in Minas Gerais is expanded further northerly though not reaching metropolitan Belo Horizonte It is often said that caipira appeared by decreolization of the l ngua bras lica and the related l ngua geral paulista then spoken in almost all of what is now S o Paulo a former lingua franca in most of the contemporary Centro Sul of Brazil before the th century brought by the bandeirantes interior pioneers of Colonial Brazil closely related to its northern counterpart Nheengatu and that is why the dialect shows many general differences from other variants of the language It has striking remarkable differences in comparison to other Brazilian dialects in phonology prosody and grammar often stigmatized as being strongly associated with a substandard variant now mostly rural br Cearense or Costa norte is a dialect spoken more sharply in the states of Cear and Piau The variant of Cear includes fairly distinctive traits it shares with the one spoken in Piau though such as distinctive regional phonology and vocabulary for example a debuccalization process stronger than that of Portuguese a different system of the vowel harmony that spans Brazil from fluminense and mineiro to amazofonia but is especially prevalent in nordestino a very coherent coda sibilant palatalization as those of Portugal and Rio de Janeiro but allowed in fewer environments than in other accents of nordestino a greater presence of dental stop palatalization to palato alveolar in comparison to other accents of nordestino among others as well as a great number of archaic Portuguese words br Baiano Found in Bahia and border regions with Goi s and Tocantins Similar to nordestino it has a very characteristic syllable timed rhythm and the greatest tendency to pronounce unstressed vowels as open mid and br Fluminense A broad dialect with many variants spoken in the states of Rio de Janeiro Esp rito Santo and neighboring eastern regions of Minas Gerais Fluminense formed in these previously caipira speaking areas due to the gradual influence of European migrants causing many people to distance their speech from their original dialect and incorporate new terms Fluminense is sometimes referred to as carioca however carioca is a more specific term referring to the accent of the Greater Rio de Janeiro area by speakers with a fluminense dialect br Ga cho in Rio Grande do Sul similar to sulista There are many distinct accents in Rio Grande do Sul mainly due to the heavy influx of European immigrants of diverse origins who have settled in colonies throughout the state and to the proximity to Spanish speaking nations The word ga cho itself is a Spanish loanword into Portuguese of obscure Indigenous Amerindian origins br Mineiro Minas Gerais but not prevalent in the Tri ngulo Mineiro As with the fluminense area its associated region was formerly a sparsely populated land where caipira was spoken but the discovery of gold and gems made it the most prosperous Brazilian region attracting Portuguese colonists commoners from other parts of Brazil and their African slaves The south southwestern southeastern and northern areas of the state each have fairly distinctive speech actually approximating to caipira fluminense popularly and often pejoratively called carioca do brejo marsh carioca and baiano respectively Belo Horizonte and the area surrounding it have a distinctive accent br Nordestino more marked in the Sert o where in the th and th centuries and especially in the area including and surrounding the sert o the dry land after Agreste of Pernambuco and southern Cear it could sound less comprehensible to speakers of other Portuguese dialects than Galician or Rioplatense Spanish and nowadays less distinctive from other variants in the metropolitan cities along the coasts It can be divided in two regional variants one that includes the northern Maranh o and southern of Piau and other that goes from Cear to Alagoas br Nortista or amazofonia Most of Amazon Basin states i e Northern Brazil Before the th century most people from the nordestino area fleeing the droughts and their associated poverty settled here so it has some similarities with the Portuguese dialect there spoken The speech in and around the cities of Bel m and Manaus has a more European flavor in phonology prosody and grammar br Paulistano Variants spoken around Greater S o Paulo in its maximum definition and more easterly areas of S o Paulo state as well as perhaps educated speech from anywhere in the state of S o Paulo where it coexists with caipira Caipira is the hinterland sociolect of much of the Central Southern half of Brazil nowadays conservative only in the rural areas and associated with them that has a historically low prestige in cities as Rio de Janeiro Curitiba Belo Horizonte and until some years ago in S o Paulo itself Sociolinguistics or what by times is described as linguistic prejudice often correlated with classism is a polemic topic in the entirety of the country since the times of Adoniran Barbosa Also the Paulistano accent was heavily influenced by the presence of immigrants in the city of S o Paulo especially the Italians br Sertanejo Center Western states and also much of Tocantins and Rond nia It is closer to mineiro caipira nordestino or nortista depending on the location br Sulista The variants spoken in the areas between the northern regions of Rio Grande do Sul and southern regions of S o Paulo state encompassing most of southern Brazil The city of Curitiba does have a fairly distinct accent as well and a relative majority of speakers around and in Florian polis also speak this variant many speak florianopolitano or manezinho da ilha instead related to the European Portuguese dialects spoken in Azores and Madeira Speech of northern Paran is closer to that of inland S o Paulo br Florianopolitano Variants heavily influenced by European Portuguese spoken in Florian polis city due to a heavy immigration movement from Portugal mainly its insular regions and much of its metropolitan area Grande Florian polis said to be a continuum between those whose speech most resemble sulista dialects and those whose speech most resemble fluminense and European ones called often pejoratively manezinho da ilha br Carioca Not a dialect but sociolects of the fluminense variant spoken in an area roughly corresponding to Greater Rio de Janeiro It appeared after locals came in contact with the Portuguese aristocracy amidst the Portuguese royal family fled in the early th century There is actually a continuum between Vernacular countryside accents and the carioca sociolect and the educated speech in Portuguese norma culta which most closely resembles other Brazilian Portuguese standards but with marked recent Portuguese influences the nearest ones among the country s dialects along florianopolitano so that not all people native to the state of Rio de Janeiro speak the said sociolect but most carioca speakers will use the standard variant not influenced by it that is rather uniform around Brazil depending on context emphasis or formality for example br Brasiliense used in Bras lia and its metropolitan area It is not considered a dialect but more of a regional variant often deemed to be closer to fluminense than the dialect commonly spoken in most of Goi s sertanejo br Arco do desflorestamento or serra amaz nica Known in its region as the accent of the migrants it has similarities with caipira sertanejo and often sulista that make it differing from amazofonia in the opposite group of Brazilian dialects in which it is placed along nordestino baiano mineiro and fluminense It is the most recent dialect which appeared by the settlement of families from various other Brazilian regions attracted by the cheap land offer in recently deforested areas br Recifense used in Recife and its metropolitan area br Amaz nico Ocidental used in the extreme Western Amazon region namely Southwestern Amazonas including the region of Boca do Acre and throughout the State of Acre which share important historical cultural aspects such as once belonging to Peru Bolivian Confederation the First Amazon rubber cycle and Acre Time Zone sociologically is considered a homogenous region Differing from the traditional Northern dialect in which the phonetic realization of the s always has the sound of ch in the Brazilian Western Amazon region there will only be the sound of ch whose words the s are in the middle of the word as examples costa festa or destino as well as the one observed in dialect of the north coast Within the Brazilian countryside it is one of the few areas where the phonetic realization of r resembles those observed in the Carioca dialect open other examples where this phenomenon is observed Bras lia dialect and Belo Horizonte dialect br Voc a pronoun meaning you is used for educated formal and colloquial respectful speech in most Portuguese speaking regions In a few Brazilian states such as Rio Grande do Sul Par among others voc is virtually absent from the spoken language Riograndense and European Portuguese normally distinguishes formal from informal speech by verbal conjugation Informal speech employs tu followed by second person verbs formal language retains the formal voc followed by the third person conjugation br Conjugation of verbs in tu has three different forms in Brazil verb to see tu viste in the traditional second person tu viu in the third person and tu visse in the innovative second person the conjugation used in the Brazilian states of Par Santa Catarina and Maranh o being generally traditional second person the kind that is used in other Portuguese speaking countries and learned in Brazilian schools br The predominance of Southeastern based media products has established voc as the pronoun of choice for the second person singular in both writing and multimedia communications However in the city of Rio de Janeiro the country s main cultural center the usage of tu has been expanding ever since the end of the th century being most frequent among youngsters and a number of studies have also shown an increase in its use in a number of other Brazilian dialects br br br Other countries and

other dialects especially in their most colloquial forms there can also be some grammatical differences The Portuguese based creoles spoken in various parts of Africa Asia and the Americas are independent languages br br br Characterization and peculiarities br Portuguese like Catalan preserves the stressed vowels of Vulgar Latin which became diphthongs in most other Romance languages cf Port Cat Sard pedra Fr pierre Sp piedra It pietra Ro piatr from Lat petra stone or Port fogo Cat foc Sard fogu Sp fuego It fuoco Fr feu Ro foc from Lat focus fire Another characteristic of early Portuguese was the loss of intervocalic l and n sometimes followed by the merger of the two surrounding vowels or by the insertion of an epenthetic vowel between them cf Lat salire to exit tenere to have catena jail Port sair ter cadeia br When the elided consonant was n it often nasalized the preceding vowel cf Lat manum hand ranam frog bonum good Old Portuguese m o r a b o Portuguese m o r bom This process was the source of most of the language s distinctive nasal diphthongs In particular the Latin endings anem anum and onem became o in most cases cf Lat canis dog germanus brother ratio reason with Modern Port c o irm o raz o and their plurals anes anos ones normally became es os es cf c es irm os raz es This also occurs in the minority Swiss Romansh language in many equivalent words such as maun hand bun good or chaun dog br The Portuguese language is the only Romance language that preserves the clitic case mesoclisis cf dar te ei I ll give thee amar te ei I ll love you contact los ei I ll contact them Like Galician it also retains the Latin synthetic pluperfect tense eu estivera I had been eu vivera I had lived v s viv reis you had lived Romanian also has this tense but uses the s form br br br Vocabulary br br Most of the lexicon of Portuguese is derived directly or through other Romance languages from Latin Nevertheless because of its original Lusitanian and Celtic Gallaecian heritage and the later participation of Portugal in the Age of Discovery it has a relevant number of words from the ancient Hispano Celtic group and adopted loanwords from other languages around the world br A number of Portuguese words can still be traced to the pre Roman inhabitants of Portugal which included the Gallaeci Lusitanians Celtici and Cynetes Most of these words derived from the Hispano Celtic Gallaecian language of northwestern Iberia and are very often shared with Galician since both languages have the same origin in the medieval language of Galician Portuguese A few of these words existed in Latin as loanwords from other Celtic sources often Gaulish Altogether these are over words verbs toponymic names of towns rivers surnames tools lexicon linked to rural life and natural world br In the th century the Iberian Peninsula the Roman Hispania was conquered by the Germanic Suebi and Visigoths As they adopted the Roman civilization and language however these people contributed with some br Germanic words to the lexicon Many of these words are related to br br warfare such as espora spur estaca stake and guerra war from Gothic spa ra stakka and wirro respectively br natural world such as suino swine from sweina gavi o hawk from gabilans vaga wave from vigan br human emotions such as orgulho or orgulhoso pride proud from Old Germanic urguol and br verbs like gravar to craft record graft from graba or esmagar to squeeze quash grind from Suebian mag n or esfarrapar to shred from harp br The Germanic languages influence also exists in toponymic surnames and patronymic surnames borne by Visigoth sovereigns and their descendants and it dwells on placenames such as Ermesinde Esposende and Resende where sinde and sende are derived from the Germanic sinths military expedition and in the case of Resende the prefix re comes from Germanic reths council Other examples of Portuguese names surnames and town names of Germanic toponymic origin include Henrique Henriques Vermoim Mandim Calquim Baguim Gemunde Guetim Sermonde and many more are quite common mainly in the old Suebi and later Visigothic dominated regions covering today s Northern half of Portugal and Galicia br Between the th and early th centuries Portuguese acquired some to words from Arabic by influence of Moorish Iberia They are often recognizable by the initial Arabic article a l and include common words such as aldeia village from a ay a alface lettuce from al khassa armaz m warehouse from al makhzan and azeite olive oil from az zayt br br Starting in the th century the Portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from Asian languages For instance catana cutlass from Japanese katana ch tea from Chinese ch and canja chicken soup piece of cake from Malay br From the th to the th centuries because of the role of Portugal as intermediary in the Atlantic slave trade and the establishment of large Portuguese colonies in Angola Mozambique and Brazil Portuguese acquired several words of African and Amerind origin especially names for most of the animals and plants found in those territories While those terms are mostly used in the former colonies many became current in European Portuguese as well From Kimbundu for example came kifumate cafun head caress Brazil kusula ca ula youngest child Brazil marimbondo tropical wasp Brazil and kubungula bungular to dance like a wizard Angola From South America came batata potato from Taino anan s and abacaxi from Tupi Guarani nan and Tupi ib cati respectively two species of pineapple and pipoca popcorn from Tupi and tucano toucan from Guarani tucan br Finally it has received a steady influx of loanwords from other European languages especially French and English These are by far the most important languages when referring to loanwords There are many examples such as colchete croch bracket crochet palet jacket batom lipstick and fil filete steak slice rua street respectively from French crochet paletot b ton filet rue and bife steak futebol rev lver stock estoque folclore from English beef football revolver stock folklore br Examples from other European languages macarr o pasta piloto pilot carro a carriage and barraca barrack from Italian maccherone pilota carrozza and baracca melena hair lock fiambre wet cured ham in Portugal in contrast with presunto dry cured ham from Latin prae exsuctus dehydrated or canned ham in Brazil in contrast with non canned wet cured presunto cozido and dry cured presunto cru or castelhano Castilian from Spanish melena mane fiambre and castellano br br br Classification and related languages br br br Portuguese belongs to the West Iberian branch of the Romance languages and it has special ties with the following members of this group br br Galician Fala and portunhol do pampa the way riverense and its sibling dialects are referred to in Portuguese its closest relatives br Mirandese Leonese Asturian Extremaduran and Cantabrian Astur Leonese languages Mirandese is the only recognised regional language spoken in Portugal beside Portuguese the only official language in Portugal br Spanish and cal o the way cal language of the Iberian Romani is referred to in Portuguese br Portuguese and other Romance languages namely French and Italian share considerable similarities in both vocabulary and grammar Portuguese speakers will usually need some formal study before attaining strong comprehension in those Romance languages and vice versa However Portuguese and Galician are fully mutually intelligible and Spanish is considerably intelligible for lusophones owing to their genealogical proximity and shared genealogical history as West Iberian Ibero Romance languages historical contact between speakers and mutual influence shared areal features as well as modern lexical structural and grammatical similarity between them br Portu ol Portunhol a form of code switching has a more lively use and is more readily mentioned in popular culture in South America Said code switching is not to be confused with the Portu ol spoken on the borders of Brazil with Uruguay dialeto do pampa and Paraguay dialeto dos brasiguaios and of Portugal with Spain barranquenho that are Portuguese dialects spoken natively by thousands of people which have been heavily influenced by Spanish br Portuguese and Spanish are the only Ibero Romance languages and perhaps the only Romance languages with such thriving inter language forms in which visible and lively bilingual contact dialects and code switching have formed in which functional bilingual communication is achieved through attempting an approximation to the target foreign language known as Portu ol without a learned acquisition process but nevertheless facilitates communication There is an emerging literature focused on such phenomena including informal attempts of standardization of the linguistic continua and their usage br br br Galician Portuguese in Spain br br The closest relative of Portuguese is Galician which is spoken in the autonomous community and nationality of Galicia Spanish Kingdom The two were at one time a single language known today as Galician Portuguese but they have diverged especially in pronunciation and vocabulary due to the political separation of Portugal from Galicia There is however still a linguistic continuity consisting of the variant of Galician referred to as galego portugu s baixo limiao which is spoken in several Galician and Portuguese villages within the transboundary biosphere reserve of Ger s Xur s It is considered a rarity a living vestige of the medieval language that ranged from Cantabria to Mondego br As reported by UNESCO due to the pressure of Spanish on the standard official version of Galician and centuries old Hispanization the Galician language was on the verge of disappearing According to the UNESCO philologist Tapani Salminen the proximity to Portuguese protects Galician The core vocabulary and grammar of Galician are noticeably closer to Portuguese than to those of Spanish and within the EU context Galician is often considered the same language as Portuguese Galician like Portuguese uses the future subjunctive the personal infinitive and the synthetic pluperfect Mutual intelligibility estimated at is excellent between Galicians and Portuguese Despite political efforts in Spain to define them as separate languages many linguists consider Galician to be a co dialect of the Portuguese language with regional variations br Another member of the Galician Portuguese group most commonly thought of as a Galician dialect is spoken in the Eonavian region in a western strip in Asturias and the westernmost parts of the provinces of Le n and Zamora along the frontier with Galicia between the Eo and Navia rivers or more exactly Eo and Frexulfe rivers It is called eonaviego or gallego asturiano by its speakers br The Fala language known by its speakers as xalim s ma egu a fala de X lima and chapurr u and in Portuguese as a fala de X lima a fala da Estremadura o galego da Estremadura valego or galaico estremenho is another descendant of Galician Portuguese spoken by a small number of people in the Spanish towns of Valverde del Fresno Valverdi du Fresnu Eljas As Ellas and San Mart n de Trevejo Sa Mart n de Trevellu in the autonomous community of Extremadura near the border with Portugal br There are a number of other places in Spain in which the native language of the common people is a descendant of the Galician Portuguese group such as La Alamedilla Cedillo Cedilho Herrera de Alc ntara Ferreira d Alc ntara and Olivenza Oliven a but in these municipalities what is spoken is actually Portuguese not disputed as such in the mainstream br The diversity of dialects of the Portuguese language is known since the time of medieval Portuguese Galician language when it coexisted with the Lusitanian Mozarabic dialect spoken in the south of Portugal The dialectal diversity becomes more evident in the work of Fern o d Oliveira in the Grammatica da Lingoagem Portuguesa where he remarks that the people of Portuguese regions of Beira Alentejo Estremadura and Entre Douro e Minho all speak differently from each other Also Contador d Argote distinguishes three main varieties of dialects the local dialects the dialects of time and of profession work jargon Of local dialects he highlights five main dialects the dialect of Estremadura of Entre Douro e Minho of Beira of Algarve and of Tr s os Montes He also makes reference to the overseas dialects the rustic dialects the poetic dialect and that of prose br In the kingdom of Portugal Ladinho or Lingoagem Ladinha was the name given to the pure Portuguese romance language without any mixture of Aravia or Gerigon a Judenga While the term l ngua vulgar was used to name the language before D Dinis decided to call it Portuguese language the erudite version used and known as Galician Portuguese the language of the Portuguese court and all other Portuguese dialects were spoken at the same time In a historical perspective the Portuguese language was never just one dialect Just like today there is a standard Portuguese actually two among the several dialects of Portuguese in the past there was Galician Portuguese as the standard coexisting with other dialects br br br Influence on other languages br br br Portuguese has provided loanwords to many languages such as Indonesian Manado Malay Malayalam Sri Lankan Tamil and Sinhala Malay Bengali English Hindi Swahili Afrikaans Konkani Marathi Punjabi Tetum Xitsonga Japanese Lanc Patu Esan Bandari spoken in Iran and Sranan Tongo spoken in Suriname It left a strong influence on the l ngua bras lica a Tupi Guarani language which was the most widely spoken in Brazil until the th century and on the language spoken around Sikka in Flores Island Indonesia In nearby Larantuka Portuguese is used for prayers in Holy Week rituals br The Japanese Portuguese dictionary Nippo Jisho was the first dictionary of Japanese in a European language a product of Jesuit missionary activity in Japan Building on the work of earlier Portuguese missionaries the Dictionarium Anamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum Annamite Portuguese Latin dictionary of Alexandre de Rhodes introduced the modern orthography of Vietnamese which is based on the orthography of th century Portuguese The Romanization of Chinese was also influenced by the Portuguese language among others particularly regarding Chinese surnames one example is Mei During Italian Jesuits Michele Ruggieri and Matteo Ricci created a Portuguese Chinese dictionary the first ever European Chinese dictionary br For instance as Portuguese merchants were presumably the first to introduce the sweet orange in Europe in several modern Indo European languages the fruit has been named after them Some examples are Albanian portokall Bosnian archaic portokal prtokal Bulgarian portokal Greek portok li Macedonian portokal Persian porteghal and Romanian portocal Related names can be found in other languages such as Arabic burtuq l Georgian p ort oxali Turkish portakal and Amharic birtukan Also in southern Italian dialects e g Neapolitan an orange is portogallo or purtuallo literally the Portuguese one in contrast to standard Italian arancia br br br Derived languages br br Beginning in the th century the extensive contacts between Portuguese travelers and settlers African and Asian slaves and local populations led to the appearance of many pidgins with varying amounts of Portuguese influence br As each of these pidgins became the mother tongue of succeeding generations they evolved into fully fledged creole languages which remained in use in many parts of Asia Africa and South America until the th century br Some Portuguese based or Portuguese influenced creoles are still spoken today by over three million people worldwide especially people of partial Portuguese ancestry br br br Phonology br br Portuguese phonology is similar to those of languages such as Franco Proven al and Catalan whereas that of Spanish is similar to those of Sardinian and the Southern Italian dialects Some would describe the phonology of Portuguese as a blend of Spanish Gallo Romance e g French and the languages of northern Italy especially Genoese br Portuguese can have as many as oral vowels as many as semivowels and as many as consonants some varieties of the language have fewer phonemes There are also five nasal vowels which some linguists regard as allophones of oral vowels Galician Portuguese developed in the region of the former Roman province of Gallaecia from the Vulgar Latin common Latin that had been introduced by Roman soldiers colonists and magistrates during the time of the Roman Empire Although the process may have been slower than in other regions after a period of bilingualism the centuries of contact with Vulgar Latin completely extinguished the native languages and a variety of Latin with a few Gallaecian features evolved br Gallaecian and Lusitanian influences were absorbed into the local dialect of Vulgar Latin this can be detected in some Galician Portuguese words as well as in placenames of Celtic and Iberian origin br An early form of Galician Portuguese was already spoken in the Kingdom of the Suebi and by the year Galician Portuguese had already become the vernacular of northwestern Iberia The first known phonetic changes in Vulgar Latin which began the evolution to Galician Portuguese took place during the rule of the Germanic groups the Suebi and Visigoths The Galician Portuguese inflected infinitive or personal infinitive and the nasal vowels may have evolved under the influence of local Celtic as in Old French The nasal vowels would thus be a phonologic characteristic of the Vulgar Latin spoken in Roman Gallaecia but they are not attested in writing until after the th and th centuries br br br Vowels br br Like Catalan and German Portuguese uses vowel quality to contrast stressed syllables with unstressed syllables Unstressed isolated vowels tend to be raised and sometimes centralized br br br Consonants br br Phonetic notes br br Semivowels contrast with unstressed high vowels in verbal conjugation as in eu rio i u and ele riu iw Phonologists discuss whether their nature is vowel or consonant br In most of Brazil and Angola the consonant hereafter denoted as is realized as a nasal palatal approximant j which nasalizes the vowel that precedes it n j u br Bisol proposes that Portuguese possesses labio velar stops k and as additional phonemes rather than sequences of a velar stop and w br The consonant hereafter denoted as has a variety of realizations depending on dialect In Europe it is typically a uvular trill however a pronunciation as a voiced uvular fricative may be becoming dominant in urban areas There is also a realization as a voiceless uvular fricative and the original pronunciation as an alveolar trill r also remains very common in various dialects A common realization of the word initial r in the Lisbon accent is a voiced uvular fricative trill In Brazil can be velar uvular or glottal and may be voiceless unless between voiced sounds It is usually pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative x a voiceless glottal fricative h or voiceless uvular fricative See also Guttural R Portuguese br s and z are normally lamino alveolar as in English However a number of dialects in northern Portugal pronounce s and z as apico alveolar sibilants sounding somewhat like a soft or as in the Romance languages of northern Iberia Some very few northeastern Portugal dialects still maintain the medieval distinction between apical and laminal sibilants written s ss and c z respectively br As a phoneme t occurs only in loanwords names and interjections with a dialectal tendency for speakers to substitute in in most dialects outside of Brazil as well as some conservative Brazilian dialects to a variable extent However t is an allophone of t before i in a majority of Brazilian dialects Similarly d is an allophone of d in the same contexts br In northern and central Portugal the voiced stops b d and are usually lenited to fricatives and respectively except at the beginning of words or after nasal vowels At the end of a phrase due to final obstruent devoicing they may even be devoiced to and x for example verde at the end of a sentence may be pronounced ve br In Brazil many speakers further shift to w in closed syllables especially outside the southern region br Phonetically Portuguese and French are quite different from the other major Romance languages It has been suggested that this stems from the ancient link to Celtic languages such as Welsh or Breton with which it also shares a substantial number of cognates there are sounds in Portuguese including vowels consonants and diphthongs most of which exist in today s Celtic languages br br br Orthography br br br Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of br br br Grammar br br A notable aspect of the grammar of Portuguese is the verb Morphologically more verbal inflections from classical Latin have been preserved by Portuguese than by any other major Romance language Portuguese and Spanish share very similar grammar vocabulary and sentence structure Portuguese also has some grammatical innovations not found in other Romance languages except Galician and Fala br br The present perfect has an iterative sense unique to the Galician Portuguese language group It denotes an action or a series of actions that began in the past but expected to occur again in the future For instance the sentence Tenho tentado falar contigo would be translated to I have been trying to talk to you not I have tried to talk to you On the other hand the correct translation of Have you heard the latest news is not Tens ouvido as ltimas but Ouviste as ltimas since no repetition is implied br Portuguese makes use of the future subjunctive mood which developed from medieval West Iberian Romance In modern Spanish and Galician it has almost entirely fallen into disuse The future subjunctive appears in dependent clauses that denote a condition that must be fulfilled in the future so that the independent clause will occur English normally employs the present tense under the same circumstances br Se eu for eleito presidente mudarei a lei br If I am elected president I will change the law br Quando fores mais velho vais entender br When you grow older you will understand br The personal infinitive can inflect according to its subject in person and number It often shows who is expected to perform a certain action melhor voltares It is better for you to go back melhor voltarmos It is better for us to go back Perhaps for that reason infinitive clauses replace subjunctive clauses more often in Portuguese than in other Romance languages br br

devem agir uns para com os outros em esp rito de fraternidade br Article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in English br br All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights
