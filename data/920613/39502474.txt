to The Incredibles but only if it could be better than the original He stated I have pieces that I think are good but I don t have them all together In a May interview Bird reiterated his interest in a sequel I have been thinking about it People think that I have not been but I have because I love those characters and love that world I have many many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film and if I can get em to click all together I would probably wanna do that While publicizing the first film Bird had already conceptualized the eventual approach where Bob and Helen would switch roles and Jack Jack would develop multiple powers unknown to the family br At the Disney shareholder meeting in March Disney CEO and chairman Bob Iger confirmed that Pixar was working on an Incredibles sequel and that Bird would return as both director and screenwriter Bird started the script around April and said that the Incredibles sequel would be his next film after Tomorrowland br br One challenge in writing Incredibles was how to deal with the large number of superhero films and television series that had been released since the first film such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU To try to differentiate the sequel Bird wanted to avoid tropes related to the superhero genre I don t think that kind of idea stays interesting for very long For me the interesting thing was never the superhero part of it It was more the family dynamic and how do superhero things play into that He said he wanted to include some unused ideas from the first film and that the new story would focus on Helen Parr Elastigirl br Though the sequel was released fourteen years after the first Bird did not want to use a narrative element like an ellipsis or to come up with new characters and instead continued from where the first film left off This allowed him to keep characters with the same superpowers and not have to develop new ones nor did he need to figure out how to deal with Violet and Dash being adults This also allowed him to keep Jack Jack as an infant with an array of powers which Bird likened to how infants are able to understand numerous languages While the plot of the follow up video game to The Incredibles The Incredibles Rise of the Underminer begins at that same point of time the film discards the game s continuity The film was produced with a production budget of million br br In November Pixar announced that Holly Hunter and Samuel L Jackson would reprise their roles During the D Expo it was confirmed that Craig T Nelson

that Sophia Bush and Isabella Rossellini would voice new characters Voyd and The Ambassador while Jonathan Banks would voice Rick Dicker after the character s original voice actor Bud Luckey retired in after his death in the film was dedicated to Luckey s memory br br One advantage that Pixar had with Incredibles was the advancement of technology the company had seen since the original film and a team of much more experienced animators Producer John Walker said I think that one of the things that excited Brad and Ralph Eggleston the production designer was that the technology existed now to finally realize the designs in the way that they had hoped to realize them in There were no notions of Well we don t know how to do long hair we don t know how to do humans we don t know how to do muscles Everybody knows how to do it It s just now about doing it quickly Because Pixar no longer used the same systems from the first film all the characters had to be created from scratch on the computer again The studio also used physically based human eye models for the characters for the first time which possibly made the eyes larger and more stylized than that of real humans br br In Bird confirmed that Michael Giacchino would return to compose the score Giacchino began work around May The soundtrack album was released on June and on CD two weeks later In addition to the film s score it includes the vocalized theme songs for Mr Incredible Frozone and Elastigirl heard in the credits as well as bonus versions of the songs sung by Disney s a cappella group DCappella and the latter s

definite recommend br Robert Abele of TheWrap praised the film saying Whatever the opposite of phoning in a sequel is that s Brad Bird s progressive minded thunderously fun mix of super saves throwback aesthetics and family comedy A A Dowd writing for The A V Club felt it was A sparkling contraption of an animated comedy funny and often wondrous in its midcentury modern vision of an alternate America frozen in the amber of a bygone idealism David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a B saying When the Parrs are pushed out of their comfort zone Bird settles into his after inciting a Spielberg level monorail chase that reaffirms Bird s lucid gift for kinetic and character driven action filmmaking the movie blasts off and never looks back Stephanie Zacharek from Time considered it bold and rapturously entertaining while David Sims at The Atlantic dubbed it dazzling thought provoking and sometimes overwhelming in terms of plotting Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film a out of stars and said Long awaited follow up brings back everyone s favorite superhero family and suggests that we should give our caped crusader pop obsessions a rest Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote a positive review of the film saying The family that fights together remains the steadily throbbing unbreakable heart of Incredibles even when Bob and Helen swap traditional roles There s something too self conscious overcompensating much br Variety s Owen Gleiberman called the film fun but far from incredible and wrote It s true that the Toy Story films all three of which are fantastic did variations on the same theme of a toy s obsolescence but as movies they kept the emotions close to the surface In Incredibles we never get that rush of feeling Mark Kermode of The Guardian gave the film four out of five stars and said Slapstick genius profound social comment and a monstrously funny infant combine to conjure a magical second outing for the superhero family John Nugent of Empire magazine also gave the film four out of five stars saying There s some quibbles to be had in an over familiar setup and an under served villain but overall this is a gloriously fun family parable and as entertaining as any superhero movie you ll see this year Brian Tellerico of Rogerebert com gave the film out of stars and said Incredibles understands something that most family sequels even the Pixar ones fail to comprehend we don t just want to repeat something we loved before We want to love it all over again You will with Incredibles Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film out of stars and said Incredibles is content to punch the clock and stick to straight bombastic action mode In that mode composer Giacchino s music is the most successful element running nimble beautifully orchestrated variations on themes that feel familiar in the best ways while retaining their spark The animation is bright and visually dynamic The script well if the title were Satisfactories it d be about right Ty Burr for The Boston Globe called it a clattery unfocused affair that at times is more irritating than fun Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review saying Boosted by central characters that remain vastly engaging and a deep supply of wit Incredibles certainly proves worth the wait even if it hits the target but not the bull s eye in quite the way the first one did br br Many disability advocates including the Epilepsy Foundation have raised concerns that movie scenes with flashing lights including that in Incredibles of Elastigirl s fight with the Screenslaver can trigger seizures in viewers affected by photosensitive epilepsy As a result several theaters posted warnings for audiences Disney told USA Today that it appreciated those efforts and then in a memo asked all theaters exhibiting the movie to warn audiences Incredibles contains a sequence of flashing lights which may affect customers who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitivities br In response to this a re edited version was released in the United Kingdom with all affected sequences altered so that any flashing lights and strobe effects now pass the Harding test br br Following the release of Incredibles director Brad Bird acknowledged that the film s truncated production schedule resulted in many plotlines and ideas he had for the film being cut from the final version He cited Pixar s decision in October to swap the release dates of Toy Story and Incredibles which meant that Bird s film lost a full year of production Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment just as they did with the second There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be used whether it s another Incredibles film or something else Cast members including Samuel L Jackson and Sophia Bush have expressed interest in reprising their roles for the third film with Bush herself expressing the desires of a team up with Sarah Vowell s Violet for the third film Producer John Walker would not rule a third film out br In May in the lead up to the first film s th anniversary an interview with Pixar CCO Pete Docter and Pixar president Jim Morris revealed that the studio is considering making more sequels to their popular franchises among them being The Incredibles br br Media related
