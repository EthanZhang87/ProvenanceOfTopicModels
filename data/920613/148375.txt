worked as a resident physician at the hospital and came from a wealthy Southern family Taylor is of English and Scottish descent from the Taylor family of the Montrose area with the former being rooted in Massachusetts Bay Colony his ancestors include Edmund Rice an English colonist who co founded Sudbury Massachusetts His mother Gertrude n e Woodard studied singing with Marie Sundelius at the New England Conservatory of Music and was an aspiring opera singer before she married Isaac in Taylor is the younger brother of musician Alex Taylor and the older brother of musicians Kate Taylor born and Livingston Taylor born His youngest sibling a brother named Hugh born was also a musician Hugh eventually left the music industry and has operated The Outermost Inn a bed and breakfast in Aquinnah Massachusetts with his wife since br In Taylor and his family moved to Chapel Hill North Carolina when Isaac took a job as an assistant professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine They built a house in the Morgan Creek area off the present Morgan Creek Road which was sparsely populated Taylor later said Chapel Hill the Piedmont the outlying hills were tranquil rural beautiful but quiet Thinking of the red soil caused by local copper mining Taylor s later song Copperline was a nostalgic salute to that area where Taylor grew up plus the seasons the way things smelled down there I feel as though my experience of coming of age there was more a matter of landscape and climate than people James attended a public primary school in Chapel Hill Isaac s career prospered but he was frequently away from home on military service at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland or as part of Operation Deep Freeze in Antarctica in and Isaac Taylor later rose to become dean of the UNC School of Medicine from to Beginning in the Taylors spent summers on Martha s Vineyard br Taylor took cello lessons as a child in North Carolina before learning the guitar in His guitar style evolved influenced by hymns carols and the music of Woody Guthrie and his technique derived from his bass clef oriented cello training and from experimenting on his sister Kate s keyboards My style was a finger picking style that was meant to be like a piano as if my thumb were my left hand and my first second and third fingers were my right hand Spending summer holidays with his family on Martha s Vineyard he met Danny Kortchmar an aspiring teenage guitarist from Larchmont New York The two began listening to and playing blues and folk music together and Kortchmar felt that Taylor s singing had a natural sense of phrasing every syllable beautifully in time I knew James had that thing Taylor wrote his first song on guitar at and he continued to learn the instrument effortlessly By the summer of he and Kortchmar were playing coffeehouses around the Vineyard billed as Jamie Kootch br In Taylor went to Milton Academy a preparatory boarding school in Massachusetts He faltered during his junior year feeling uneasy in the high pressure college prep environment despite having a good scholastic performance The Milton headmaster later said James was more sensitive and less goal oriented than most students of his day He returned home to North Carolina to finish out the semester at Chapel Hill High School There he joined a band formed by his brother Alex called The Corsayers later The Fabulous Corsairs playing electric guitar in they cut a single in Raleigh that featured James s song Cha Cha Blues on the B side Having lost touch with his former school friends in North Carolina Taylor returned to Milton for his senior year where he started applying to colleges to complete his education But he felt part of a life that he was unable to lead and he became depressed he slept hours each day and his grades collapsed In late he committed himself to McLean a psychiatric hospital in Belmont Massachusetts where he was treated with chlorpromazine and where the organized days began to give him a sense of time and structure As the Vietnam War escalated Taylor received a psychological rejection from Selective Service System when he appeared before them with two white suited McLean assistants and was uncommunicative Taylor earned a high school diploma in from the hospital s associated Arlington School He later viewed his nine month stay at McLean as a lifesaver like a pardon or like a reprieve and both his brother Livingston and his sister Kate later were patients and students there as well As for his mental health struggles Taylor thought of them as innate and said It s an inseparable part of my personality that I have these feelings br br At Kortchmar s urging Taylor checked himself out of McLean and moved to New York City to form a band They recruited Joel O Brien formerly of Kortchmar s old band King Bees to play drums and Taylor s childhood friend Zachary Wiesner son of academic Jerome Wiesner to play bass After Taylor rejected the notion of naming the group after him they called themselves the Flying Machine They played songs that Taylor had written at and about McLean such as Knocking Round the Zoo Don t Talk Now and The Blues Is Just a Bad Dream In some other songs Taylor romanticized his life but he was plagued by self doubt By summer they were performing regularly at the high visibility Night Owl Cafe in Greenwich Village alongside acts such as the Turtles and Lothar and the Hand People br Taylor associated with a motley group of people and began using heroin to Kortchmar s dismay In a late hasty recording session the group cut a single Taylor s Night Owl backed with his Brighten Your Night with My Day Released on Rainy Day Records distributed by Jubilee Records it received some radio airplay in the Northeast but only charted at No nationally Other songs had been recorded during the same session but Jubilee declined to go forward with an album After a series of poorly chosen appearances outside New York culminating with a three week stay at a failing nightspot in Freeport Bahamas for which they were never paid the Flying Machine broke up A UK band with the same name emerged in with the hit song Smile a Little Smile for Me The Flying Machine was briefly referenced in Taylor s song Fire and Rain and following his success as a solo artist the band s recordings were later released in as James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine br Taylor would later say of this New York period I learned a lot about music and too much about drugs Indeed his drug use had developed into full blown heroin addiction during the final Flying Machine period I just fell into it since it was as easy to get high in the Village as get a drink He hung out in Washington Square Park playing guitar to ward off depression and then passing out letting runaways and criminals stay at his apartment Finally out of money and abandoned by his manager he made a desperate call one night to his father Isaac Taylor flew to New York and staged a rescue renting a car and driving all night back to North Carolina with James and his possessions Taylor spent six months getting treatment and making a tentative recovery he also required a throat operation to fix vocal cords damaged from singing too harshly br Taylor decided to try being a solo act with a change of scenery In late funded by a small family inheritance he moved to London living in various areas Notting Hill Belgravia and Chelsea After recording some demos in Soho his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees who once opened for Peter and Gordon to connect Taylor to Peter Asher Asher was A R head for the Beatles newly formed label Apple Records Taylor gave a demo tape of songs including Something in the Way She Moves to Asher who then played the demo for Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison McCartney remembers his first impression I just heard his voice and his guitar and I thought he was great and he came and played live so it was just like Wow he s great Taylor became the first non British act signed to Apple and he credits Asher for opening the door to his singing career Taylor said of Asher who later became his manager I knew from the first time that we met that he was the right person to steer my career He had this determination in his eye that I had never seen in anybody before br Living chaotically in various places with various women Taylor wrote additional material including Carolina in My Mind and rehearsed with a new backing band Taylor recorded what would become his first album from July to October at Trident Studios at the same time the Beatles were recording The White Album McCartney and an uncredited George Harrison guested on Carolina in My Mind whose lyric holy host of others standing around me referred to the Beatles and the title phrase of Taylor s Something in the Way She Moves provided the lyrical starting point for Harrison s classic Something McCartney and Asher brought in arranger Richard Anthony Hewson to add both orchestrations to several of the songs and unusual link passages between them they would receive a mixed reception at best br br During the recording sessions Taylor fell back into his drug habit by using heroin and methedrine He underwent physeptone treatment in a British program returned to New York and was hospitalized there and then finally committed himself to the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge Massachusetts which emphasized cultural and historical factors in trying to treat difficult psychiatric disorders Meanwhile Apple released his debut album James Taylor in December in the UK and February in the US Critical reception was generally positive including a complimentary review in Rolling Stone by Jon Landau who said that this album is the coolest breath of fresh air I ve inhaled in a good long while It knocks me out The record s commercial potential suffered from Taylor s inability to promote it because of his hospitalization and it sold poorly Carolina in My Mind was released as a single but failed to chart in the UK and only reached No on the U S charts br In July Taylor headlined a six night stand at the Troubadour in Los Angeles On July he performed at the Newport Folk Festival as the last act and was cheered by thousands of fans who stayed in the rain to hear him His set at Newport was cut short after minutes when festival co founder George Wein announced on stage that the Apollo astronauts had landed on the moon Shortly thereafter Taylor broke both hands and both feet in a motorcycle accident on Martha s Vineyard and was forced to stop playing for several months However while recovering he continued to write songs and in October signed a new deal with Warner Bros Records br br Once he had recovered Taylor moved to California keeping Asher as his manager and record producer In December he held the recording sessions for his second album there Titled Sweet Baby James and featuring the participation of Carole King the album was released in February and was Taylor s critical and popular breakthrough buoyed by the single Fire and Rain a song about both Taylor s experiences attempting to break his drug habit by undergoing treatment in psychiatric institutions and the suicide of his friend Suzanne Schnerr Both the album and the single reached No on the Billboard charts with Sweet Baby James selling more than million copies in its first year and eventually more than million in the United States alone Sweet Baby James was received at its time as a folk rock masterpiece an album that effectively showcased Taylor s talents to the mainstream public marking a direction he would take in following years It earned several Grammy Award nominations including one for Album of the Year It went on to be listed at No on Rolling Stone s Greatest Albums of All Time in with Fire and Rain listed as No on Rolling Stone s Greatest Songs of All Time in br During the time that Sweet Baby James was released Taylor appeared with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys in a Monte Hellman film

weapons tests by the US Atomic Energy Commission at Amchitka Alaska this performance was released in album format in as Amchitka The Concert That Launched Greenpeace In January sessions for Taylor s next album began br He appeared on The Johnny Cash Show singing Sweet Baby James Fire and Rain and Country Road on February His career success at this point and appeal to female fans of various ages piqued tremendous interest in him prompting a March Time magazine cover story of him as the face of new rock It compared his strong but brooding persona to that of Wuthering Heights Heathcliff and to The Sorrows of Young Werther and said Taylor s use of elemental imagery darkness and sunlight references to roads traveled and untraveled to fears spoken and left unsaid reaches a level both of intimacy and controlled emotion rarely achieved in purely pop music One of the writers described his look as a cowboy Jesus to which Taylor later replied I thought I was trying to look like George Harrison br br Released in April Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon also gained critical acclaim and contained Taylor s biggest hit single in the US a version of Carole King s new You ve Got a Friend featuring backing vocals by Joni Mitchell which reached No on the Billboard Hot in late July The follow up single Long Ago and Far Away also made the Top and reached No on the Billboard Adult

Swift In early Taylor won his first Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance Male for You ve Got a Friend King also won Song of the Year for the same song in that ceremony The album went on to sell million copies in the United States br November heralded the release of Taylor s fourth album One Man Dog A concept album primarily recorded in his home recording studio it featured a cameo by Linda Ronstadt along with Carole King Carly Simon and John McLaughlin The album consisted of eighteen short pieces of music put together Reception was generally lukewarm and despite making the Top of the Billboard Album Charts its overall sales were disappointing The lead single Don t Let Me Be Lonely Tonight peaked at No on the Hot and the follow up One Man Parade barely reached the Top Almost simultaneously Taylor married fellow singer songwriter Carly Simon on November in a small ceremony at her Murray Hill Manhattan apartment A post concert party following a Taylor performance at Radio City Music Hall turned into a large scale wedding party and the Simon Taylor marriage would find much public attention over the following years They had two children Sarah Maria Sally Taylor born January and Benjamin Simon Ben Taylor born January During their marriage the couple would guest on each other s albums and have two hit singles as duet partners a cover of Inez Charlie Foxx s

for his fifth album began Walking Man was released in June and featured appearances of Paul and Linda McCartney and guitarist David Spinozza The album was a critical and commercial disaster and was his first album to miss the Top since his contract with Warner It received poor reviews and sold only copies in the United States The title track failed to appear on the Top br br However Taylor s artistic fortunes spiked again in when the Gold album Gorilla reached No and provided one of his biggest hit singles a version of Marvin Gaye s How Sweet It Is To Be Loved by You featuring wife Carly on backing vocals and reached No in America and No in Canada On the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart the track also reached the top and the follow up single the feelgood Mexico featuring a guest appearance by Crosby Nash also reached the Top of that list A well received album Gorilla showcased Taylor s electric lighter side that was evident on Walking Man However it was arguably a more consistent and fresher sounding Taylor with songs such as Mexico Wandering and Angry Blues It also featured a song about his daughter Sally Sarah Maria br Gorilla was followed in by In the Pocket Taylor s last studio album to be released under Warner Bros Records The album found him with many colleagues and friends including Art Garfunkel David Crosby Bonnie Raitt and Stevie Wonder who co wrote a song with Taylor and contributed a harmonica solo A melodic album it was highlighted with the single Shower the People an enduring song that hit No on the Adult Contemporary chart and hit on the Pop Charts However the album was not well received reaching No and being criticized particularly by Rolling Stone Still In The Pocket went on to be certified gold br With the close of Taylor s

first album for the label JT released that June gave Taylor his best reviews since Sweet Baby James earning a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in Peter Herbst of Rolling Stone was particularly favorable to the album of which he wrote in its August issue JT is the least stiff and by far the most various album Taylor has done That s not meant to criticize Taylor s earlier efforts But it s nice to hear him sounding so healthy JT reached No on the Billboard charts and sold more than million copies in the United States alone The album s Triple Platinum status ties it with Sweet Baby James as Taylor s all time biggest selling studio album It was propelled by Jimmy Jones s and Otis Blackwell s Handy Man which hit No on Billboard s Adult Contemporary chart and reached No on the Hot

Your Smiling Face an enduring live favorite reached the American Top however Honey Don t Leave L A which Danny Kortchmar wrote and composed for Taylor did not enjoy much success reaching only No br

just one day later Taylor told the BBC in The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy hours before he shot John The next night Taylor who lived in a building next door to Lennon heard the assassination occur Taylor commented I heard him shoot five just as quick as you could pull the trigger about five explosions br In March Taylor released the album Dad Loves His Work whose themes concerned his relationship with his father the course his ancestors had taken and the effect that he and Simon had on each other The album was another Platinum

the deaths of his friends John Belushi and Dennis Wilson and in part by the desire to be a better father to his children Sally and Ben he discontinued methadone and overcame his heroin habit br Taylor had thoughts of retiring by the time he played the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro in January He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians and musically energized by the sounds and nature of Brazilian music I had sort of bottomed out in a drug habit my marriage with Carly had dissolved and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while he recalled in br br I sort of hit a low spot I was asked to go down to Rio de Janeiro to play in this festival down there We put the band together and went down and it was just an amazing response I played to people They not only knew my music they knew things about it and were interested in aspects of it that to that point had only interested me To have that kind of validation right about then was really what I needed It helped get me back on track br The song Only a Dream in Rio was written in tribute to that night with lines like I was there that very day and my heart came back alive The October album That s Why I m Here from which that song came started a series of studio recordings that while spaced further apart than his previous

Jump Up Behind Me paid tribute to his father s rescue of him after The Flying Machine days and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill Enough To Be on Your Way was inspired by the alcoholism related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade The themes were also inspired by Taylor and Walker s divorce which took place in Rolling Stone Magazine found that one of the themes of this record is disbelief while Taylor told the magazine that it was spirituals for agnostics Critics embraced the dark themes on the album and Hourglass was a commercial success reaching No on the Billboard Taylor s first Top album in sixteen years and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on Little More Time With You The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since JT when he was
