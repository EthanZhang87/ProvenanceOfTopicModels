The Oldsmobile Aurora is a luxury sedan manufactured and marketed by General Motors from until over two generations sharing platforms with Buick Riviera and using the Cadillac derived G platform At the time of production the Aurora was the flagship vehicle in the Oldsmobile lineup It originated as the Oldsmobile tube car concept br The Aurora replaced the Toronado coupe and eventually the Oldsmobile LSS and Regency in the Oldsmobile range using V and V engines It was equipped with a four speed automatic transmission br br br Origins br Early design work on what would become the Aurora began as early as the late s with the Oldsmobile Tube Car engineering concept designed by Bud Chandler In addition to the overall similar shape the Tube Car featured many detailed elements that were later found on the production automobile including a full width taillamp wraparound rear windshield and frameless windows Unlike the eventual production car the Tube Car used a pillarless hardtop design with suicide doors The final production design was signed off on in July originally set for a start of production br By the Aurora s introduction Oldsmobile sales had fallen from a record high of in to in rumors of the division s demise were rampant which GM at the time firmly denied Competition from Acura Infiniti and Lexus offered similar products that benefited from superior durability and reliability reputations GM developed the Aurora to rejuvenate Oldsmobile as a result The Aurora bore no Oldsmobile badging save for the radio CD cassette deck and engine cover during focus group testing potential customers had been repelled when they learned the Aurora was in truth an Oldsmobile At one point then division head John Rock who had recently arrived from the GMC division proposed using the Aurora name to replace the Oldsmobile brand entirely and offer cars in a similar fashion to GM s nascent Saturn division a plan ultimately nixed by the GM higher ups though for a period Saturn s no haggle pricing was implemented Instead the Aurora used a stylized A emblem foreshadowing a similar restyling of Oldsmobile s corporate rocket emblem for br One bizarre footnote of development was a incident where a prototype Aurora driven by freelance car reviewer Tim Dunne was nearly totaled after a four foot log fell from a Michigan Department of Natural Resources truck Dunne was able to maneuver the Aurora so much that only the right front wheel was struck this subsequently led then governor John Engler to purchase an Aurora Engler having been a life long Oldsmobile

used by General Motors racing division initially for Indy Racing League and IMSA competition starting in with the GM supported Aurora GTS racing program then was later used in the Cadillac Northstar LMP program in Both engines retained the L capacity but the Northstar LMP version was twin turbocharged The Aurora had a drag coefficient of br The Aurora was noted for its engine build quality ride and structural integrity During normal crush to failure tests to evaluate body torsional rigidity the Aurora s unibody construction broke GM s testing machine A frame crusher otherwise used to test stronger truck frames had to be used with the car twice exceeding federal standards for passenger cars br First generation Auroras were manufactured in Lake Orion Michigan along with the Buick LeSabre

design with front hydraulic bushing and rear cross axis ball joint for enhanced ride smoothness and better isolation from road noise and vibration Internal rebound springs added to front struts for improved body motion control and to minimize crash through Increased wheel travel mm and redesigned jounce bumpers for softer feel at full travel Dual durometer cradle mounts for improved isolation Premium valving and damping in the front and rear struts for a higher refinement in calibration There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation New steering calibration for more on center feel and reduced parking effort br GM s previously optional OnStar system standard for this year uses a dedicated button on the cellular telephone putting drivers in contact with an information center that can provide them with emergency assistance The system uses no transmitters to determine the vehicle s location and provide route information to any destination br Almost all of the changes

mounts for improved engine stability br Production for this generation ended on June No models were produced br Production Figures br br Production figures for were not provided br br br Second generation br br Oldsmobile s original intention for the second generation was to move the Aurora further upmarket retaining its V only drivetrain and sharing a platform with the new Buick Riviera as with the first gen Aurora This would have created more room within the Oldsmobile line for a four door Eighty Eight successor to be marketed as the Antares though there was talk of naming it the Aurora V or Aurora as the Antares name was not liked during focus group testing this platform was known internally as G plus Buick dropped its Riviera development plans at the same time Oldsmobile faced fiscal trouble The division was then forced to re engineer the Antares into an acceptable Aurora in a short time Still using the G body design the re engineered Aurora was the result retaining its V Northstar mounted to a T E automatic transmission br The second generation Aurora also offered a V engine the LX a version of the DOHC Aurora V with six cylinders The V powered Aurora was manufactured solely for model years with production ending in mid br br This Aurora did not sell as well as the original overshadowed by GM s announcement in December that the Oldsmobile marque was to be phased out over the next several years Though still retaining its unique styling it now also shared design cues with other Oldsmobiles The second generation Aurora was about six inches shorter than was the first generation Automobile magazine wrote that The Aurora s new look is not quite as sensuous or elegant as that of the outgoing model but the Auto Channel review said it was better in every respect br The second generation Aurora went into production on November and went on sale in February as a model The last V powered Auroras was assembled on June The final Auroras ended production on
