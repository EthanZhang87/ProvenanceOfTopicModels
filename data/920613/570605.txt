The Mitsubishi Eclipse is a sport compact car that was produced by Mitsubishi in four generations from until A convertible body style was added during the model year br The first two generations share the automobile platform and parts with the rebadged Eagle Talon and Plymouth Laser captive imports They were built during Mitsubishi Motors close relationship with Chrysler Corporation Their partnership was known as Diamond Star Motors DSM In Japan the first two generations were sold at a specific Japanese retail chain called Mitsubishi Car Plaza The third generation shared a redesigned platform with the Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Stratus In May the fourth and final generation Eclipse was introduced replacing the Chrysler platform used for the third generation with the PS platform br According to Mitsubishi Motors the Eclipse was named after an unbeaten th century English racehorse that won races in a row and then retired br At the end of August the final Eclipse was manufactured and subsequently auctioned for charity br In Mitsubishi resurrected the Eclipse name on a compact crossover vehicle called the Eclipse Cross br br The first generation Mitsubishi Eclipse was marketed as an entry to the mid level four cylinder sports coupe segment It was developed for the North American market where sales began in the autumn of Japanese sales of cars imported from Illinois began in and in late limited European sales began At first the car was only sold in Austria Sweden and Switzerland but other countries were gradually added Five trim levels were available all were front wheel drive except the GSX which was all wheel drive The GS Turbo and GSX were equipped with turbocharged engines br The profile was low and sleek the hood line was so low that it needed a bump to clear the engine s cam cover The first generation Eclipse underwent minor styling changes during its production the car received updated more ovoid sheet metal for The most notable is that the pre facelift models have pop up headlights whereas through models have exposed aerodynamic headlights The original Eclipse was replaced by the second generation model for the model year br br The Eclipse was available in five trim levels during its first generation production run AWD models were not available until halfway through the first model year br br Eclipse Base model equipped with a hp kW naturally aspirated L valve SOHC G I engine br Eclipse GS Upgraded model with more equipment br Eclipse GS DOHC Upgraded model equipped with a hp kW naturally aspirated L valve DOHC Mitsubishi Sirius engine a naturally aspirated variant of the G T I engine br Eclipse GS DOHC AWD Equipped with a hp kW G valve naturally aspirated engine AWD N A only available in Europe All were only available with a five speed manual transmission and without rear limited slip differential sunroof cruise control anti lock brakes central locking and air conditioning were included br Eclipse GS Turbo Upgraded model equipped with a hp kW turbocharged L valve DOHC G T I engine br Eclipse GSX AWD model equipped with a hp kW turbocharged L valve DOHC G T I engine br The GS Turbo with a manual transmission was rated at hp whereas the GSX with a manual transmission was rated at hp kW This was for the purpose of offsetting the additional weight of the AWD mechanism approximately lbs Vs lbs GVW However and later years of both turbo models standardized on the hp version G T The automatic models were rated at hp kW due to smaller fuel injectors and turbocharger br These models varied significantly in drivetrains and available options and included some variance in appearance as higher trim lines added different front and rear fascia panels and surrounding trim with the GSX model getting a notably different styling package from the others In the European market only a single trim was available sold either as plain Eclipse or with GS or GSi badging depending on the importer fitted with the liter DOHC engine producing PS kW bhp Some European buyers could also opt for four wheel drive br br The basic driveline layout of the Eclipse is a transverse mounted I Mitsubishi G or G engine situated on the left hand side of the car driving an automatic or manual transmission on the right hand side AWD models have a different transmission which includes a limited slip center differential and output shaft for a transfer case which drives the rear differential also available as limited slip and half shafts br br The G and G engines are gasoline inline fours The G has an iron engine block with an aluminum cylinder head and is equipped with two balance shafts The turbocharged version of the G sometimes referred to as the G T has a lower compression ratio of and oil squirters under the pistons for better cooling from extra heat created by forced induction The turbocharged G engine received an internal update during the model year The engines built from through April have bolt motors Beginning in May Mitsubishi revised the engine to a bolt design br br In March Mitsubishi issued a recall bulletin V for all Mitsubishi Eclipse GSXs citing Lockup of the transfer case can occur due to insufficient lubrication The condition can cause a loss of vehicle control increasing the risk of a crash The dealers would inspect the vehicles for the adequacy of the transfer case oil volume transfer case oil leakage and operational degradation of the transfer case mechanism The transfer case itself did not leak but rather the brass plug in the center of the transfer case yoke would leak Mitsubishi estimated that vehicles were affected br br The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA has determined crash test ratings of the G Eclipse br br The Eclipse Turbo was on Car and Driver magazine s Ten Best list for through br br The Eclipse was redesigned in for the model year and included standard dual airbags more rounded styling a larger interior and a new engine made by Chrysler for the base model The second generation car maintained the market focus of the first generation car but had numerous changes to appeal to a broader market A convertible model named the Eclipse Spyder was introduced in and offered in two trim levels the GS and the GS T The Spyder GS was powered by a L I naturally aspirated G engine The Spyder GS T was fitted with Mitsubishi s L turbocharged G I engine The GSX model was also powered by this engine but with the addition of all wheel drive system No convertible model was powered by the Chrysler s a engine nor was there a convertible with all wheel drive br The turbocharged engine option was updated for more power as compared to the previous generation hp kW vs hp kW The naturally aspirated cars had two different I engines depending on the market The US version engines produced hp found only in the RS and GS trims and were a modified version of the Chrysler Neon engine the A manufactured by Chrysler and delivered to and installed at the Diamond Star Motors facility The European market engines were a naturally aspirated G with PS kW hp International market Eclipses made less horsepower than their Japanese domestic market equivalents when equipped with the G hp kW hp kW due to emissions regulations br This model exceeded Japanese government s compact car regulations regarding exterior dimensions maximum width of mm in therefore incurred a more expensive annual road tax obligation br A special version of the Eclipse called the th Anniversary OZ Rally was sold at the end of the model run with unique inch Enkei wheels with the OZ Racing logo It also included the leather interior package accented exhaust exit silver gauges mud flaps and higher profile spoiler that were available as standard equipment on GS T coupe and GSX models The special edition package was only offered with the A engine br A unique version of the G Eclipse was sold in some European countries It used a naturally aspirated Mitsubishi G motor similar to what was available in the G unique side view mirrors and amber rear turn signals br A minor style revision was applied for the model year The front grille opening was given a more aggressive profile The headlights were given a sharper slant on the inner edges and the previous all chrome fixture interior changed to a black interior with chrome reflector inserts The driving lights were revised from a reflector type to a smaller projection type The rear bumper cap was altered and had the reverse lights restyled and moved out into the bumper fascia away from their original central position by the rear license plate bracket The GS T coupe and GSX received a higher profile rear spoiler The interior color choices also changed from blue and grey in model years to black grey tan black and grey in the model years A black leather interior option was only available in the package included all seats with the Mitsubishi logo embroidered on both of the fronts door inserts and a center console armrest br br The Eclipse was available in seven trim levels Base Only available in mid model year RS Rally Sport GS Grand Sport GS Spyder GS T

would slightly throughout the production run as some items that were optional on certain trims became standard later in the production run Each trim level came with a standard list of equipment however optional equipment packages were also available to add popular and premium features most commonly found on the GS model In addition optional equipment was also available such as a trunk

The basic driveline layout of the Eclipse is a transverse mounted I Chrysler A Mitsubishi G or G engine The Mitsubishi engines are mounted in the same orientation as the first generation cars The A powered cars had the engine mounted on the right side of the car and further back in the chassis AWD models had a similar transmission to the first generation car The second generation GSX also had a stronger carrier differential when equipped with the limited slip option br br All motors are four cylinder gasoline engines All have cast iron blocks with aluminum cylinder heads The G G engines retain the balance shafts for smoother operation while the a does not The turbo engines were given an increased compression ratio of up from and a smaller turbo a Garrett T set to psi bar in place of the previous Mitsubishi TD G turbocharger automatic cars and TD B turbocharger manual cars This was done to minimize turbo lag which was an undesirable trait for mass market appeal in the U S These changes led to increased horsepower and torque vs the previous G turbos The G turbo cars produced hp kW at rpm hp kW at rpm with automatic transmission and lb ft N m at rpm lb ft N m at rpm with automatic transmission br The G T engines found in models have a mm in throttle body compared to the MY s mm in The intake ports on the head and runners of the intake manifold are also larger on the G They also have larger crankshaft bearing journals to allow better lubrication Because they look similar it is important to note that the cylinder head is more on the side of high air volume while the cylinder head is more on the side of high air velocity br Mitsubishi Motors quietly updated its G engine in and The crankshaft is more precisely shaved and cut compared to previous years It is identical to that used in the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution which was not yet sold in North America until The thrust bearings have been revised to a split type to allow better lubrication and self alignment with the crankshaft It also had improved tuning and functionality thanks to a new ECU which was similar to Lancer Evolution ECUs Although originally deactivated to protect the drivetrain it included advanced features such as launch control boost control adjustable rev limit fuel system control as well as fuel and boost map selection for certain Mitsubishi Heavy Industries turbochargers br br The second generation Eclipse received numerous Technical Service Bulletins TSB affecting a variety of issues with the car however there was one notable powertrain recall In March Mitsubishi issued a recall bulletin V for all Mitsubishi Eclipse GSXs citing Lockup of the transfer case can occur due to insufficient lubrication The condition can cause a loss of vehicle control increasing the risk of a crash The dealers would inspect the vehicles for the adequacy of the transfer case oil volume transfer case oil leakage and operational degradation of the transfer case mechanism The transfer case itself did not leak but rather the brass plug in the center of the transfer case yoke would leak Mitsubishi estimated vehicles were affected br Another issue that impacted the mid Eclipse GS T GSX G equipped vehicles is thrust bearing failure commonly referred to in the Eclipse community as crankwalk Mitsubishi never publicly addressed the issue via a recall or TSB There were a variety of symptoms however the most common symptom of crankwalk is the clutch pedal would stick to the floor upon making a left turn If crankwalk occurred it typically meant engine failure In Mitsubishi revised manufacturing processes to correct the issue br br All G Eclipses came standard with driver and front passenger airbags side guard door beams front and rear body structure crumple zones mph energy absorbing bumpers safety cage body construction wheel disc brakes except RS three point ELR ALR lap shoulder safety belts ELR only for the driver and height adjustable front shoulder belts Anti lock brakes were optional on all models except for RS br The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA has determined crash test ratings of the G Eclipse br br and Driver s Choice Award MotorWeek br br The Eclipse underwent a change into its third generation in closely applying the Mitsubishi SST design study which debuted at the North American International Auto Show It was the first concept vehicle exhibited by Mitsubishi at an auto show in the U S br Two new powertrain options were available a hp kW L valve SOHC I G and a hp kW v SOHC L V G AWD was no longer an option The suspension setup was modified to provide a softer and more compliant ride quality br The third generation Eclipse shared its powertrain with the eighth generation Galant In late the power of the GT trim was lowered to hp kW as a result of tightened emission standards forcing MMNA to adopt the California emissions standards for all variants of the car rather than selling independent Federal Specification and California Specifications versions br In mid the GTS trim was introduced for the model year This vehicle included an engine with a compression ratio revised camshaft profile and an improved Mitsubishi Variable Induction Management MVIM air intake system that gave the car an extra hp kW and a slightly improved power curve The GTS coupe GTS Spyder and GT Spyder shared the new engine while the GT coupe retained the hp kW powertrain br With the introduction of the GTS model the Eclipse saw minor changes including a redesigned front bumper with slotted fog lights as well as a recoloring of the taillights On the interior the gauge face changed and the door panels were also redesigned Newly designed five spoke chrome wheels were offered with the GT and GTS trims br In Mitsubishi Motors imported the Eclipse Spyder to the Japanese Domestic Market as a special edition br br The Eclipse was available in trim levels RS GS GS Spyder GT GT Spyder GTS and GTS Spyder All trim levels besides RS and the Spyder came with an automatic tilt and retracting sunroof All models were front wheel drive FWD The GTS trims were introduced for the model year For the model year the RS trim was discontinued and a special Remix Edition GS trim package was introduced which included chrome wheels identifying placards and the premium interior package from the GT and GTS models which was not previously offered on the GS trim br br Eclipse RS Base model equipped with a hp kW L valve SOHC Mitsubishi G engine automatic RS models were only G Eclipse without Mitsubishi s sportronic

four cylinder and SOHC G L valve V Both engines use cast iron blocks with aluminum cylinder heads The four cylinder found in the RS GS and GS Spyder trims used a compression ratio and produced an output of hp kW and lb ft N m of torque throughout all years br The L V however used in GT and GT Spyder models produced hp kW in Federal Specifications between and hp kW in all GT models in California Specifications all years with a static compression ratio of In the L V was improved for the GTS and GT GTS Spyder using a revised camshaft profile raised compression ratio of and variable length MVIM intake manifold This engine produced hp kW br br The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA has determined crash test ratings of Eclipse of different model years br br The Mitsubishi Eclipse EV is a prototype electric vehicle with a lightweight electric motor and lithium ion batteries in the chassis of a third generation Eclipse It is powered by manganese lithium ion batteries made by Japan Storage Battery which have reduced charging time over nickel hydrogen batteries br The prototype model participated in the Shikoku EV Rally a km mi circuit around the perimeter of Shikoku Japan where it drove in excess of km mi on a single battery charge br br Another substantial styling revision was introduced with the fourth generation model taking some of the profile from the second generation model but maintaining a front fascia consistent with Mitsubishi s corporate styling features of the time Drivetrain features include a hp kW L MIVEC V engine for the GT trim and newer models have hp kW The GS has a hp kW L MIVEC four cylinder engine both derived from the Mitsubishi PS platform family with which the Eclipse shares many mechanical components Like the Galant and third generation Eclipse the fourth generation Eclipse is FWD only although a concept model has been produced by Mitsubishi and Ralliart with a MillenWorks designed hybrid electric AWD platform the G engine from the Lancer Evolution and more aggressive body styling with imitation carbon fiber accents The V produces hp kW and ft lbf N m of torque br The fourth generation Spyder convertible Eclipse

sit on in the grille the rear fascia changed the Eclipse insignia from an indent to raised silver letters An option to add a dual exhaust and projector H I D headlamps also became available The V engine now rated at hp kW and lb ft N m of torque in part due to the more open front fascia as well as a new stock dual exhaust system It was unveiled at the Chicago Auto Show br For the Mitsubishi Eclipse featured a blackout roof similar to the model Mitsubishi also lowered the suspension of Eclipse about half an inch to lower the center of gravity A rear backup camera and Bluetooth hands free calling to the Sun and sound package were included In the GS trim the car gets the same inch wheels and blackout front end as the GT model called the GS Sport br br For the model year the Eclipse received three slight changes brake override logic a clear lip spoiler on the GT trim and one new exterior color According to a review and rating by Motor Trend the fourth generation Eclipse was described as dated but its exterior design still stands out among sporty coupes currently available The model year Eclipse was now six years old and is still trying to pass itself off as a sporty two door This was the final model year albeit a short run because production ended in August br The last Eclipse to roll off the assembly line was built on August painted Kalapana Black Its color was chosen by members of Mitsubishi s Facebook community who picked from a historical Eclipse color palette This was the only Eclipse equipped with both the L hp V engine and the commemorative SE package as well as special inch Dark Argent alloy wheels and one of a kind graphics It is also built with a sunroof leather interior W Rockford Fosgate speaker audio system with Sirius XM hands free Bluetooth phone interface rear view camera and HID headlights The car was auctioned off by Mecum Auctions in St Charles Illinois on September for Proceeds went to the Japanese Red Cross to aid victims of the T hoku earthquake and tsunami br Grand total Eclipse production was units br br V Recalled February vehicles were found equipped with faulty brake booster assemblies The brake booster could separate due to improper crimp joints resulting in total brake failure br V Recalled June master cylinders were found to have improperly installed seals Brake fluid may bypass the seal and result in longer pedal stroke and reduced braking pressure br V Recalled February vehicles made between December and February were recalled for corrosion issues in the ABS unit This can cause internal valves to seize resulting in sudden brake failure or reduced stopping ability br V Recalled September certain vehicles had improper fuel tank mounting brackets which could split This could result in the fuel tank to come undone in a collision and potentially cause a fuel leak br br The Eclipse has been campaigned in various auto racing events br br The Eclipse and its Chrysler branded counterparts have competed
