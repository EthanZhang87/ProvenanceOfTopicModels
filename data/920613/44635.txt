Walk of Fame project in the s As recording executives on the Walk of Fame committee compiled a list of significant recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star they realized that many leading people in their business would not earn a star on Hollywood Boulevard They determined to rectify this by creating awards given by their industry similar to the Oscars and the Emmys After deciding to go forward with such awards a question remained what to call them One working title was the Eddie to honor Thomas Edison the inventor of the phonograph Eventually the name was chosen

the most popular interest typically about to including the four general field categories and one or two categories in the most popular music genres i e pop rock country and rap are presented directly at the televised award ceremony Most other Grammy trophies are presented in a pre telecast Premiere Ceremony in the afternoon before the Grammy Awards telecast br br On April the Recording Academy announced a significant overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for The number of categories was cut from to The most substantial change was eliminating the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo groups in various genre fields pop rock rhythm and blues R B country and rap Additionally several instrumental soloist categories were discontinued

the categories for best rap soloist and best rap duo or group have been merged into the new Best Rap Performance category br The roots category had the most eliminations Up through there were separate categories for regional American music forms such as Hawaiian Native American and Zydeco Cajun music A consistently low number of entries in these categories led the Recording Academy to combine these music variations into a new Best Regional Roots Music Album including polka which had lost its category in br In same genre fields the traditional and contemporary blues categories and the traditional and contemporary folk categories each were consolidated into one per genre due to the number of entries and the challenges in distinguishing between contemporary and traditional blues and folk songs In the world music field the traditional and contemporary categories also were merged br In the classical field its main category Best Classical Album was discontinued because most recipients in the category had also won in other classical categories for the same album Classical recordings are now eligible for the main Album of the Year category br A few minor name changes were also made to better reflect the nature of the separate categories The Recording Academy determined that the word gospel in the gospel genre field tends to connote images and sounds of traditional soul gospel to the exclusion of Contemporary Christian Music CCM Therefore the field and some categories were renamed as Gospel Contemporary Christian Music br br Since small adjustments have been made to lists of categories and genre fields The number of categories has risen from in to since In amid the George Floyd protests several urban rap and Latin music categories were renamed br In the number of awards was increased from to Performance categories were added for the Americana and alternative music genres alongside new categories for video game score and spoken word poetry albums A songwriter category

were held in different locations on the same day Originally New York City and Los Angeles were the host cities Chicago joined as a host city in and Nashville became a fourth location in br The ceremony at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles was the first to take place in one location In the ceremony was then moved to Madison Square Garden s Felt Forum in New York City then moved in to Nashville s Tennessee Theatre From to the Grammys were held in various venues in New York City and Los Angeles including New York s Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall and Los Angeles Shrine Auditorium Staples Center and Hollywood Palladium br In the Crypto com Arena known as the Staples Center from to became the permanent home of the award ceremonies The Grammy Museum was built

Grammy Awards holds the record for most awards won by a group br br When Pearl Jam won a Grammy for the Best Hard Rock Performance in the band s lead singer Eddie Vedder commented on stage I don t know what this means I don t think it means anything In Glen Hansard leader of the Irish rock group The Frames stated that the Grammys represent something outside of the real world of music that s fully industry based He said he was not particularly interested in attending that year s ceremony even though he had been nominated for two awards Maynard James Keenan lead singer of progressive rock band Tool did not attend the Grammy Awards ceremony to receive one of the band s awards explaining that br br I think the Grammys are nothing more than some gigantic promotional machine for the music industry They cater to a low intellect and they feed the masses They don t honor the arts or the artist for what he created It s the music business celebrating itself That s basically what it s all about br The Grammys have also been criticized for generally awarding or nominating more commercially successful albums rather than critically successful ones In Sin ad O Connor became the first musician to refuse a Grammy boycotting the ceremony after being nominated for Record of the Year Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance O Connor would go on to win the latter award She said her reasoning came from the Grammys extreme commercialism In Rhiannon Giddens described the financial strain of attending the ceremony for middle and working class musicians She criticized the Recording Academy for introducing a policy of charging nominees for a plus one saying the policy makes it ever more obvious who is valued and more specifically what that would be lots of money for the folks in the back A Billboard article clarified that the new policy was a tiered system ranging from to for a ticket to attend the pre telecast ceremony br br The Grammys also have been criticized for snubbing awards to some nominated artists The organization s awards journey states that nominees and winners are determined solely by voting members of the Recording Academy and that voting members are active creative professionals involved in the recording process such as performers songwriters producers and engineers br Nomination review committees composed of anonymous industry figures were established following the th Grammy Awards which attracted criticism for the slate of Album of the Year nominations The winner Tony Bennett s live album MTV Unplugged competed against the live classical album The Three Tenors in Concert Seal s second eponymous album and the twelfth albums from Bonnie Raitt and Eric Clapton both longtime musical mainstays Not nominated that year were several albums that would later be recognized as classics including Nas s debut album Illmatic Oasis s debut album Definitely Maybe Hole s album Live Through This Jeff Buckley s Grace and the debut album from Wu Tang Clan The nomination review committees would be disbanded in following criticism of the lack of nominations for The Weeknd s album After Hours br At the th Annual Grammy Awards artist Mariah Carey was nominated for six awards for her album Daydream including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for her single One Sweet Day Although critics believed Carey would be cleaning up that year Carey ultimately lost in all her nominated categories that night much to the shock of critics and Carey herself In Los Angeles Times journalist Randall Roberts criticized the exclusion of Kanye West s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy from Album of the Year nominations for the th Grammy Awards He described West s album as the most critically acclaimed album of the year a career defining record Roberts went on to criticize the Grammy Awards for being mired in the past and out of touch with new media and trends among music listeners such as music sharing stating br br The major nominations for the th annual awards clearly show that the recording academy has been working overtime to be all inclusive but more significantly they also reveal a deep chasm between its goals and the listening habits of the general population The focus is still on the old music industry model of cash cow hits major label investments and commercial radio br In an article for Time journalist Tour also responded to the snub and expressed general displeasure with the awards stating I don t pretend to understand the Grammys I have never been able to discern a consistent logic around who gets nominated or who gets statues I comprehend the particular logic of the Oscars but not the big awards for music My normal state of confusion around what drives Grammy decisions was exponentialized this week when to the shock of many Kanye s masterpiece My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was not nominated for a Grammy for Album of the Year He went on to compare understanding the Grammy Awards to Kremlinology and commented on The Recording Academy s exclusion of more mature hip hop albums as Album of the Year nominees noting that it occasionally opts to nominate pop friendly hip hop albums instead br In a profile for The New York Times after the rd Grammy Awards frontman Justin Vernon of indie band Bon Iver was asked about the Grammys and how he would react to a nomination for his group to which he responded br br You know I was thinking about that a couple of months ago someone asked me that and I was like I would go and I would and I don t think the Bon Iver record is the kind of record that would get nominated for a Grammy I would get up there and be like This is for my parents because they supported me because I know they would think it would be stupid of me not to go up there But I kinda felt like going up there and being like Everyone should go home this is ridiculous You should not be doing this We should not be gathering in a big room and looking at each other and pretending that this is important That s what I would say br He reaffirmed this sentiment and commented about the Grammys saying br br Ninety eight percent of the people in that room their art is compromised by the fact that they re thinking that and that they re hoping to get that award And who is that award given by It s like they think it s literally handed down by the musical history gods And I don t know who the voters are Like I have a friend who s a voter who was like I had to be a voter because I don t trust the other voters And I was like Me either And it s just not important and people spend too much time thinking about it br Bon Iver subsequently received four nominations in November for the th Grammy Awards After winning Vernon said in his acceptance It s really hard to accept this award There s so much talent out here and there s a lot of talent that s not here tonight It s also hard to accept because you know when I started to make songs I did it for the inherent reward of making songs so I m a little bit uncomfortable up here br In his article Everything Old Is Praised Again Jon Caramanica of The New York Times criticized Grammy voters for being conservative and disregarding more forward looking music and wrote in response to the th Grammy Awards for the umpteenth time the Grammys went with familiarity over risk bestowing album of the year honors and several more on an album that reinforced the values of an older generation suspicious of change He cited the Grammy successes of Lauryn Hill s The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill Norah Jones Come Away with Me and Adele s as examples of the Grammys drop ping a boatload of awards on a young female singer songwriter and her breakthrough album Of Kanye West s absence from the ceremony Caramanica stated He didn t even bother to show up for the broadcast which was well enough because hip hop was almost completely marginalized br In an article for The Huffington Post music executive and author Steve Stoute criticized the Recording Academy and the Grammy Awards for having lost touch with contemporary popular culture and noted two key sources for it over zealousness to produce a popular show that is at odds with its own system of voting and fundamental disrespect of cultural shifts as being viable and artistic Stoute accused the academy of snubbing artists with more cultural impact citing respective losses by the critical and commercial successes in Eminem s The Marshall Mathers LP and Kanye West s Graduation in the Album of the Year category Stoute asserted br br As an institution that celebrates artistic works of musicians singers songwriters producers and technical specialists we have come to expect that the Grammys upholds all of the values that reflect the very best in music that is born from our culture Unfortunately the awards show has become a series of hypocrisies and contradictions leaving me to question why any contemporary popular artist would even participate While there is no doubt in my mind of the artistic talents of Steely Dan or Herbie Hancock we must acknowledge the massive cultural impact of Eminem and Kanye West and how their music is shaping influencing and defining the voice of a generation It is this same cultural impact that acknowledged the commercial and critical success of Michael Jackson s Thriller in br In Canadian artist Abel Tesfaye known by his stage name The Weeknd was shut out from the Grammys when his fourth studio album After Hours received no nominations at the rd Annual Grammy Awards This came as a surprise to critics fans and Tesfaye himself who had a successful run in with the success of both his album and the single Blinding Lights Tesfaye responded by social media calling the Grammys corrupt Speculation arose that the announcement of his then upcoming Super Bowl performance as well as the discrepancy of being nominated as pop music versus R B contributed to the snubs Harvey Mason Jr CEO of the Recording Academy responded by saying br br We understand that The Weeknd is disappointed at not being nominated I was surprised and can empathize with what he s feeling His music this year was excellent and his contributions to the music community and broader world are worthy of everyone s admiration We were thrilled when we found out he would be performing at the upcoming Super Bowl and we would have loved to have him also perform on the Grammy stage the weekend before Unfortunately every year there are fewer nominations than the number of deserving artists But as the only peer voted music award we will continue to recognize and celebrate excellence in music while shining a light on the many amazing artists that make up our global community To be clear voting in all categories ended well before The Weeknd s performance at the Super Bowl was announced so in no way could it have affected the nomination process All Grammy nominees are recognized by the voting body for their excellence and we congratulate them all br br The Grammys eligibility period runs from October of one year until September of the next year Records released in the fourth quarter of a given year are not eligible for that year s awards the submissions and first round ballots are underway at that time This is despite the quarter falling during the Christmas and holiday season when many physical albums have been traditionally released and are heavily purchased for holiday gift giving and when Christmas music is at its natural peak br Fans unfamiliar with the Grammys voting window perennially hold a mistaken notion that a favorite artist has then been snubbed for example Adele s album was released in November and thus was ineligible for nomination for the awards despite its massive sales earning its Grammys including Album of the Year instead in Conversely the Grammys often recognize work more than a year after it was released Taylor Swift s won Album of the Year in even though the album came out in October br br The Grammys have also been accused of a racist bias against black recording artists In a interview Canadian artist Drake accused the awards of seeing him only as a rapper and not as a pop music artist due to his previous work and heritage He criticized the snubbing of One Dance for the Record of the Year award and the nomination of Hotline Bling for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Sung Performance despite it not being a rap song The Atlantic s Spencer Kornhaber accused the Grammys of sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one Drake did not attend the awards ceremony where he was nominated He had a performance in Manchester England on February the same night as the ceremony Frank Ocean was vocal about boycotting the same Grammy Awards and did not submit his album Blonde for award consideration as a protest br The Grammys were also criticized after the th Annual Grammy Awards when Adele s as mentioned above released in late won Album of the Year over Beyonc s album Lemonade released in April which many music publications believed should have won the award Steve Knopper of Rolling Stone magazine believed that she lost due to the Grammy voters being all white males and for her pro Black performance during the Super Bowl halftime show USA Today also criticized Beyonc s loss stating that Black artists have struggled to win album of the year They also felt won only due to the album s record breaking sales rather than having cultural significance and the large impact that Lemonade had in Adele also expressed that Lemonade should have won over her for Album of the Year stating in her acceptance speech br br I can t possibly accept this award And I m very humbled and I m very grateful and gracious But my artist of my life is Beyonc And this album to me the Lemonade album is just so monumental Beyonc it s so monumental And so well thought out and so beautiful and soul baring and we all got to see another side to you that you don t always let us see And we appreciate that And all us artists here adore you You are our light In for the first time since Outkast won Album of the Year in rap artists won major award nominations outside the rap categories when Childish Gambino won the first Song and Record of the Year awards ever for a rap song Hispanic and Latino Americans the largest minority in America are also considered to be under represented at the Grammy Awards and their music is prone to be shifted to the categories of the Latin Grammy Awards unless they have a mainstream following br In April the late Indian singer Lata Mangeshkar was omitted from the In Memoriam segment and the nation s domestic media criticized the Grammys and Oscars for their Western centric view of artists receiving attention over those throughout the rest of the world br br The Grammys have also been criticized for their treatment of female artists specifically Notably at the th Annual Grammy Awards in New Zealand singer Lorde made headlines after turning down an offer to perform at the ceremony She suggested that she was invited to perform alongside several other artists in a tribute to Tom Petty but was refused a solo slot despite being nominated for the Album of the Year award and stated that each male nominee was allowed a solo performance Lorde s mother Sonja Yelich also criticized the Grammys pointing out an article that only nine percent of the nominees at the previous six Grammy ceremonies were women After the th ceremony several media outlets reported that the ceremony had failed women specifically pointing to the most nominated female artist SZA who failed to win in any of her five nominated categories and to the Best Pop Solo Performance category which included four female nominees but was won by Ed Sheeran Neil Portnow president of the Recording Academy sparked controversy after stating in an interview that female artists needed to step up in order to win awards Portnow s comments were criticized by many female musicians including Pink Katy Perry Vanessa Carlton Sheryl Crow Iggy Azalea Halsey and Charli XCX They also caused the hashtag GrammysSoMale to trend on social media br Before the st Annual Grammy Awards in singer Ariana Grande decided not to perform or attend that year s ceremony over a disagreement about the song choices for her performance An anonymous source told Variety that Grande felt insulted when producers refused to let the singer perform her latest single Rings They compromised by having her perform the song as part of a medley but the condition that the producers choose the second song led Grande to withdraw from the show The source said that the same stipulations were not imposed on other performers Grande later accused Grammy producer Ken Ehrlich of lying about why she dropped out of the show Ehrlich had said that Grande felt it was too late for her to pull something together Grande responded br br I can pull together a performance over night and you know that Ken it was when my creativity and self expression was stifled by you that I decided not to attend I hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more br Despite the controversy Grande won for Best Pop Vocal Album and in performed at the nd Annual Grammy Awards when nominated

million from those tickets according to Tomarken Those tickets were never sold and were then returned to MusiCares which resulted in a loss br In June rapper Nicki Minaj spoke up against the Grammy s for allegedly blackballing her after her controversial performance of Roman Holiday at the th Annual Grammy Awards Minaj claimed that producer Ken Ehrlich who had previously accepted the performance wanted her to cancel it last minute due to what he excused as the passing of Whitney Houston Minaj however refused his request and performed anyway She accused that shortly after the performance Ehrlich had snubbed her from winning the Best New Artist category which was awarded to Bon Iver In October Minaj went after the Grammy s again for snubbing her song Super Freaky Girl from the rap categories at the th Annual Grammy Awards and instead placing it in the pop categories By way of comparison Minaj mentioned Latto s song Big Energy being potentially considered for the rap categories saying that if Minaj s own single is not being qualified as a rap song neither should be Latto s She also accused the Grammy s of purposely placing her in those categories to favor other artists over

nominations concert special in the last week of November where nominations would be released during a special exclusive to CBS rather than at a traditional early morning press conference to a multi
