Tia Dalma in the final scene of this film br br Following the success of Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl the cast and crew signed on for two more sequels to be shot back to back a practical decision on Disney s part to allow more time with the same cast and crew Writer Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio decided not to make the sequels new adventures featuring the same characters as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series but to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann s embrace at the end of the first film and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device They settled on introducing Davy Jones the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken They also introduced the historical East India Trading Company who for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates br Planning began in June and production was much larger than The Curse of the Black Pearl which was only shot on location in St Vincent This time the sequels would require fully working ships with a working Black Pearl built over the body of an oil tanker in Bayou La Batre Alabama By November the script was still unfinished as the writers did not want director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer to compromise what they had written so Verbinski worked with James Byrkit to storyboard major sequences without need of a script while Elliott and Rossio wrote a preparatory script for the crew to use before they finished the script they were happy with By January with rising costs and no script Disney executives threatened to cancel the film but changed their minds The writers would accompany the crew on location feeling that the lateness of their rewrites would improve the spontaneity of the cast s performances br br Principal photography began on February in Palos Verdes beginning with Elizabeth s ruined wedding day For Cutler Beckett s introduction Rossio and Elliott had him arrive on shore in a boat while sitting on a horse standing in the boat the duo had originally planned to use this introduction for Don Rafael Montero in The Mask of Zorro but the scene was cut for being deemed too expensive Similarly the Pirates crew wanted to cut the idea for budget reasons in addition to feel that it would be unbelievable or as the film s historian dismissed suicidal However Verbinski promised Rossio and Elliott to use the idea and the scene was filmed one day after weeks of planning and training The crew spent the first shooting days at Walt Disney Studios in Los Angeles including the interiors of the Black Pearl and the Edinburgh Trader which Elizabeth stows away on before moving to St Vincent to shoot the scenes in Port Royal and Tortuga Sets from the previous film were reused having survived three hurricanes although the main pier had to be rebuilt as it had collapsed in November The crew had four tall ships at their disposal to populate the backgrounds which were painted differently on each side for economy One of the ships used was the replica of HMS Bounty used in the film adaptation of Mutiny on the Bounty br On April the crew began shooting at Dominica a location Verbinski had selected as he felt it fitted the sense of remoteness he was looking for However this was also a problem the Dominican government were completely unprepared for the scale of a Hollywood production as while the strong crew occupying around of the roads on the island they had trouble moving around on the underdeveloped surfaces The weather also alternated between torrential rainstorms and hot temperatures the latter of which was made worse for the cast who had to wear period clothing At Dominica the sequences involving Pelegosto Cannibal Island and the forest segment of the battle on Isla Cruces were shot Verbinski preferred to use practical props for the giant wheel and bone cage sequences feeling long close up shots would help further suspend the audience s disbelief Dominica was also used for Tia Dalma s shack Filming on the island concluded on May br The crew moved to a small island in the Bahamas called White Cay for the beginning and end of the Isla Cruces battle before production took a break until August where in Los Angeles the interiors of the Flying Dutchman were shot On September the crew moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot ship exteriors including the working Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman Filming there was a tumultuous period starting with the fact that the tank had not actually been finished The hurricane season caused many pauses in shooting and Hurricane Wilma damaged many of the accessways and pumps though no one was hurt nor were any of the ships destroyed Principal photography was completed on September br The look of the Flying Dutchman was partially inspired by old Dutch fluyts th century vessels which resembled galleons and more specifically the Vasa a massive Swedish warship which sank in Stockholm s harbor upon its maiden voyage in the ship was salvaged in and housed in a special museum in the Swedish capital With its high heavily ornamented stern the ship provided a rich foundation for Rick Heinrichs wilder and more fantastical designs br One of the stuntmen Johnny Depp s stunt double Tony Angelotti was injured on set while filming a human yo yo stunt in July He was rushed to hospital suffering internal bleeding after nicking a branch off his femoral artery He lost six units of blood had an ACL reconstruction and spent a year in recovery before having to have the surgery all over again when a plate in his pelvis broke He also suffered from PTSD Despite this he did continue filming for the following sequel At World s End albeit doing lighter stunts like sword choreography or working as a stunt coordinator However in Tony Angelotti did sue Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer for the injury br br The Flying Dutchman s crew members were originally conceived by writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio as ghosts but Gore Verbinski disliked this and designed them as physical creatures Their hierarchy is reflected by how mutated they were newcomers had low level infections which resemble rosacea while veterans had full blown undersea creature attributes Verbinski wanted to keep them realistic rejecting a character with a turtle shell and the animators watched various David Attenborough documentaries to study the movement of sea anemones and mussels All of the crew are computer generated with the exception of Stellan Skarsg rd who played Bootstrap Bill Turner Initially his prosthetics would be augmented with CGI but that was abandoned Skarsg rd spent four hours in the make up chair and was dubbed Bouillabaisse on set br Davy Jones had originally been designed with chin growths before the designers made the move to full blown tentacles the skin of the character incorporates the texture of a coffee stained Styrofoam cup among other elements To portray Jones on set Bill Nighy wore a motion capture tracksuit that meant the animators at Industrial Light Magic did not have to reshoot the scene in the studio without him or on the motion capture stage Nighy wore make up around his eyes and mouth to splice into the computer generated shots but the images of his eyes and mouth were not used Nighy only wore a prosthetic once with blue colored tentacles for when Will Turner Orlando Bloom steals the key to the Dead Man s Chest from under his beard as he sleeps To create the CGI version of the character the model was closely based on a full body scan of Nighy with Jones reflecting his high cheekbones Animators studied every frame of Nighy s performance the actor himself had blessed them by making his performance more quirky than expected providing endless fun for them His performance also meant new controls had to be stored Finally Jones tentacles are mostly a simulation though at times they were hand animated when they act as limbs for the character br The Kraken was difficult to animate as it had no real life reference until animation director Hal Hickel instructed the crew to watch King Kong vs Godzilla which featured a live octopus crawling over miniatures On the set two pipes filled with pounds kg of cement were used to crash and split the Edinburgh Trader Completing the illusion are miniature masts and falling stuntmen shot on a bluescreen stage The scene where the Kraken spits at Jack Sparrow does not use computer generated spit it was real slime thrown at Johnny Depp br br The first trailer was attached to The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Disney produced a comic book adaption in their Junior Graphic Novels Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man s Chest Disney sponsored a racing yacht in the event of the Volvo Ocean Race The boat aptly named Black Pearl raced under the team name Pirates of the Caribbean for the United States The boat itself was a Volvo Open class yacht designed by Farr Yacht Design She was skippered to a nd place finish by American Paul Cayard after

generated Walt Disney Pictures logo from to which took a year for the studio to design W t FX and yU co were responsible for the logo s final animated rendering and Mark Mancina was hired to score a

rating to reviews the film received an average score of out of based on critics indicating mixed to average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four calling it two hours and minutes of escapism that once again makes the movies safe for guilt free fun Drew McWeeny compared the film to The Empire Strikes Back and also acclaimed its darkness in its depiction of the crew of the Flying Dutchman and its cliffhanger The completely computer generated Davy Jones turned out to be so realistic that some reviewers mistakenly identified Nighy as wearing prosthetic makeup br A O Scott of The New York Times said You put down your money still less than in most cities and in return you get two and a half hours of spirited swashbuckling and Gore Verbinski has an appropriate sense of mischief as a well as a gift nearly equaling those of Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg for integrating CGI seamlessly into his cinematic compositions Empire gave the film three out of five stars stating Depp is once again an unmitigated joy as Captain Sparrow delivering another eye darting word slurring turn with some wonderful slapstick flourishes Indeed Rossio and Elliot smartly exploit these in some wonderful action set pieces We don t get the predictable all friends together on the same quest structure and there s a surfeit of surprises crosses and double crosses and cheeky character beats which stay true to the original s anti heroic sense of fun After all Jack Sparrow is a pirate a bad guy in a hero s hat a man driven by self gain over concern for the greater good who will run away from a fight and cheat his friends without a second s thought br Paul Arendt of the BBC compared it to The Matrix Reloaded as a complex film that merely led onto the next film Richard George felt a better construct of Dead Man s Chest and At World s End would have been to take minutes of Chest mix it with all of End and then cut that film in two Alex Billington felt the third film almost makes the second film in the series obsolete or dulls it down enough that we can accept it in our trilogy DVD collections without ever watching it Mark Kermode of The Observer accused the film of lumpen direction lousy writing and pouting performances but wrote that the worst thing about Dead Man s Chest is its interminable length The entire Pirates of the Caribbean franchise may be a horrible indicator of the decline of narrative cinema br br At the th Academy

Light Magic had received that particular Academy Award The film was also nominated for Best Art Direction Sound Editing and Sound Mixing br The film also won a BAFTA and Satellite award for Best
