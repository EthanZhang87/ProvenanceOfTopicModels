New Zealand M ori Aotearoa a t a a is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean It consists of two main landmasses the North Island Te Ika a M ui and the South Island Te Waipounamu and over smaller islands It is the sixth largest island country by area and lies east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and south of the islands of New Caledonia Fiji and Tonga The country s varied topography and sharp mountain peaks including the Southern Alps owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions New Zealand s capital city is Wellington and its most populous city is Auckland br The islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable land to be settled by humans Between about and Polynesians began to settle in the islands and then subsequently developed a distinctive M ori culture In the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight and record New Zealand In the British explorer Captain James Cook became the first European to set foot on and map New Zealand In representatives of the United Kingdom and M ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi which paved the way for Britain s declaration of sovereignty later that year and the establishment of the Crown Colony of New Zealand in Subsequently a series of conflicts between the colonial government and M ori tribes resulted in the alienation and confiscation of large amounts of M ori land New Zealand became a dominion in it gained full statutory independence in retaining the monarch as head of state Today the majority of New Zealand s population of million is of European descent the indigenous M ori are the largest minority followed by Asians and Pasifika Reflecting this New Zealand s culture is mainly derived from M ori and early British settlers with recent broadening of culture arising from increased immigration The official languages are English M ori and New Zealand Sign Language with the local dialect of English being dominant br A developed country it was the first to introduce a minimum wage and the first to give women the right to vote It ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life human rights and it has one of the lowest levels of perceived corruption in the world It retains visible levels of inequality having structural disparities between its M ori and European populations New Zealand underwent major economic changes during the s which transformed it from a protectionist to a liberalised free trade economy The service sector dominates the national economy followed by the industrial sector and agriculture international tourism is also a significant source of revenue New Zealand is a member of the United Nations Commonwealth of Nations ANZUS UKUSA OECD ASEAN Plus Six Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation the Pacific Community and the Pacific Islands Forum It enjoys particularly close relations with the United States and is one of its major non NATO allies the United Kingdom Samoa Fiji and Tonga and with Australia with a shared Trans Tasman identity between the two countries stemming from centuries of British colonisation br Nationally legislative authority is vested in an elected unicameral Parliament while executive political power is exercised by the Government led by the prime minister currently Christopher Luxon Charles III is the country s king and is represented by the governor general Cindy Kiro In addition New Zealand is organised into regional councils and territorial authorities for local government purposes The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau a dependent territory the Cook Islands and Niue self governing states in free association with New Zealand and the Ross Dependency which is New Zealand s territorial claim in Antarctica br br br Etymology br br The first European visitor to New Zealand Dutch explorer Abel Tasman named the islands Staten Land believing they were part of the Staten Landt that Jacob Le Maire had sighted off the southern end of South America Hendrik Brouwer proved that the South American land was a small island in and Dutch cartographers subsequently renamed Tasman s discovery Nova Zeelandia from Latin after the Dutch province of Zeeland This name was later anglicised to New Zealand br This was written as Nu Tireni in the M ori language spelled Nu Tirani in Te Tiriti o Waitangi In a document written in M ori and entitled He Wakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni was translated into English and became the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand It was prepared by Te W h akaminenga o Nga Rangatiratanga o Nga Hapu o Nu Tireni the United Tribes of New Zealand and a copy was sent to King William IV who had already acknowledged the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand and who recognised the declaration in a letter from Lord Glenelg br Aotearoa pronounced a t a a in M ori and in English often translated as land of the long white cloud is the current M ori name for New Zealand It is unknown whether M ori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans Aotearoa originally referred to just the North Island M ori had several traditional names for the two main islands including Te Ika a M ui the fish of M ui for the North Island and Te Waipounamu the waters of greenstone or Te Waka o Aoraki the canoe of Aoraki for the South Island Early European maps labelled the islands North North Island Middle South Island and South Stewart Island Rakiura In mapmakers began to use North and South on their maps to distinguish the two largest islands and by this was the accepted norm The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised and names and alternative names were formalised in This set the names as North Island or Te Ika a M ui and South Island or Te Waipounamu For each island either its English or M ori name can be used or both can be used together Similarly the M ori and English names for the whole country are sometimes used together Aotearoa New Zealand however this has no official recognition br br br History br br The first people to reach New Zealand were Polynesians in ocean going waka canoes Their arrival likely occurred in several waves approximately between and CE Those Polynesian settlers isolated in New Zealand became the M ori of later years According to an early European synthesized interpretation of various M ori traditional accounts around CE the heroic explorer Kupe had discovered New Zealand and later around one great fleet of settlers set out from Hawaiki in eastern Polynesia However from the late th century this story has been increasingly relegated to the realm of legend and myth An alternative view has emerged from fresh archaeological and scientific evidence which correlates with doubts raised by historians everywhere as to the reliability of interpretations drawn from the oral evidence of indigenous peoples including from M ori br Regarding the arrival of these Polynesian settlers there are no human remains artefacts or structures which are confidently dated to earlier than the Kaharoa Tephra a layer of volcanic debris deposited by the Mount Tarawera eruption around CE Samples of rat bone rat gnawed shells and seed cases have given dates later than the Tarawera eruption except for three of a decade or so earlier Radiocarbon dating and pollen evidence of widespread forest fires shortly before the eruption might also indicate a pre eruption human presence Additionally mitochondrial DNA variability within the M ori populations suggest that Eastern Polynesians first settled the New Zealand archipelago between and Therefore current opinion is that whether or not some settlers arrived before the main settlement period was in the subsequent decades possibly involving a coordinated mass migration It is also the broad consensus of historians that the Polynesian settlement of New Zealand was planned and deliberate Over the centuries that followed the settlers developed a distinct culture now known as M ori This scenario is also consistent with a much debated questionable third line of oral evidence traditional genealogies whakapapa which point to around as a probable arrival date for many of the founding canoes waka from which many M ori trace their descent Some M ori later migrated to the Chatham Islands where they developed their distinct Moriori culture A later invasion by M ori resulted in the massacre and virtual extinction of the Moriori br br In a hostile encounter between Ng ti T matak kiri and Dutch explorer Abel Tasman s crew four of Tasman s crew members were killed and at least one M ori was hit by canister shot Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until when British explorer James Cook mapped almost the entire coastline Following Cook New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling sealing and trading ships They traded European food metal tools weapons and other goods for timber M ori food artefacts and water The introduction of the potato and the musket transformed M ori agriculture and warfare Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns The resulting intertribal Musket Wars encompassed over battles between and killing M ori From the early th century Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand eventually converting most of the M ori population The M ori population declined to around of its pre contact level during the th century introduced diseases were the major factor br br The British Government appointed James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in His duties given to him by Governor Bourke in Sydney were to protect settlers and traders of good standing prevent outrages against M ori and apprehend escaped convicts In following an announcement of impending French settlement by Charles de Thierry the nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand sent a Declaration of Independence to King William IV of the United Kingdom asking for protection Ongoing unrest the proposed settlement of New Zealand by the New Zealand Company which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from M ori and the dubious legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for the United Kingdom and negotiate a treaty with the M ori The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on February In response to the New Zealand Company s attempts to establish an independent settlement in Wellington Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on May even though copies of the treaty were still circulating throughout the country for M ori to sign With the signing of the treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants particularly from the United Kingdom began to increase br New Zealand was administered as a dependency of the Colony of New South Wales until becoming a separate Crown colony the Colony of New Zealand on May Armed conflict began between the colonial government and M ori in with the Wairau Affray over land and disagreements over sovereignty These conflicts mainly in the North Island saw thousands of imperial troops and the Royal Navy come to New Zealand and became known as the New Zealand Wars Following these armed conflicts large areas of M ori land were confiscated by the government to meet settler demands br br The colony gained a representative government in and the first Parliament met in In the colony effectively became self governing gaining responsibility over all domestic matters except native policy which was granted in the mid s Following concerns that the South Island might form a separate colony premier Alfred Domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from Auckland to a locality near Cook Strait Wellington was chosen for its central location with Parliament officially sitting there for the first time in br In New Zealand annexed the volcanic Kermadec Islands about km mi northeast of Auckland Since the islands are uninhabited except for about six people at Raoul Island station These islands put the northern border of New Zealand at degrees South latitude After the UNCLOS the islands contributed significantly to New Zealand s exclusive economic zone br In the Liberal Party came to power as the first organised political party The Liberal Government led by Richard Seddon for most of its period in office passed many important social and economic measures In New Zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all women the right to vote and pioneered the adoption of compulsory arbitration between employers and unions in The Liberals also guaranteed a minimum wage in a world first br In at the request of the New Zealand Parliament King Edward VII proclaimed New Zealand a Dominion within the British Empire reflecting its self governing status In New Zealand adopted the Statute of Westminster confirming that the British Parliament could no longer legislate for the country without its consent The British government s residual legislative powers were later removed by the Constitution Act and final rights of appeal to British courts were abolished in br Early in the th century New Zealand was involved in world affairs fighting in the First and Second World Wars and suffering through the Great Depression The depression led to the election of the first Labour Government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War and M ori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work A M ori protest movement developed which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of M ori culture and of the Treaty of Waitangi In a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in The government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi although M ori claims to the foreshore and seabed proved controversial in the s br br br Geography and environment br br New Zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and more than smaller islands The two main islands the North Island or Te Ika a M ui and the South Island or Te Waipounamu are separated by Cook Strait kilometres mi wide at its narrowest point Besides the North and South Islands the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island across the Foveaux Strait Chatham Island Great Barrier Island in the Hauraki Gulf D Urville Island in the Marlborough Sounds and Waiheke Island about km mi from central Auckland br New Zealand is long and narrow over kilometres mi along its north north east axis with a maximum width of kilometres mi with about km mi of coastline and a total land area of square kilometres sq mi Because of its far flung outlying islands and long coastline the country has extensive marine resources Its exclusive economic zone is one of the largest in the world covering more than times its land area br br The South Island is the largest landmass of New Zealand It is divided along its length by the Southern Alps There are peaks over metres ft the highest of which is Aoraki Mount Cook at metres ft Fiordland s steep mountains and deep fiords record the extensive ice age glaciation of this southwestern corner of the South Island The North Island is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism The highly active Taup Volcanic Zone has formed a large volcanic plateau punctuated by the North Island s highest mountain Mount Ruapehu metres ft The plateau also hosts the country s largest lake Lake Taup nestled in the caldera of one of the world s most active supervolcanoes New Zealand is prone to earthquakes br The country owes its varied topography and perhaps even its emergence above the waves to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo Australian Plates New Zealand is part of Zealandia a microcontinent nearly half the size of Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent About million years ago a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region This is now most evident in the Southern Alps formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault Elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other producing the Puysegur Trench to the south the Hikurangi Trench east of the North Island and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches further north br New Zealand together with Australia is part of a region known as Australasia It also forms the southwestern extremity of the geographic and ethnographic region called Polynesia Oceania is a wider region encompassing the Australian continent New Zealand and various island countries in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the seven continent model br br br Climate br br New Zealand s climate is predominantly temperate maritime K ppen Cfb with mean annual temperatures ranging from C F in the south to C F in the north Historical maxima and minima are C F in Rangiora Canterbury and C F in Ranfurly Otago Conditions vary sharply across regions from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to semi arid in Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury and subtropical in Northland Of the seven largest cities Christchurch is the driest receiving on average only millimetres in of rain per year and Wellington the wettest receiving almost twice that amount Auckland Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average of more than hours of sunshine The southern and southwestern parts of the South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate with around hours the northern and northeastern parts of the South Island are the sunniest areas of the country and receive about hours The general snow season is early June until early October though cold snaps can occur outside this season Snowfall is common in the eastern and southern parts of the South Island and mountain areas across the country br br br Biodiversity br br New Zealand s geographic isolation for million years and island biogeography has influenced evolution of the country s species of animals fungi and plants Physical isolation has caused biological isolation resulting in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species The flora and fauna of New Zealand were originally thought to have originated from New Zealand s fragmentation off from Gondwana however more recent evidence postulates species resulted from dispersal About of New Zealand s indigenous vascular plants are endemic covering species across genera The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand including lichen forming species is not known nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic but one estimate suggests there are about species of lichen forming fungi in New Zealand and of these are endemic The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps or by southern beech in cooler climates The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands the majority of which are tussock br Before the arrival of humans an estimated of the land was covered in forest with only high alpine wet infertile and volcanic areas without trees Massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming leaving forest occupying only of the land br br The forests were dominated by birds and the lack of mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi k k p weka and takah evolving flightlessness The arrival of humans associated changes to habitat and the introduction of rats ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species including large birds like the moa and Haast s eagle br Other indigenous animals are represented by reptiles tuatara skinks and geckos frogs such as the protected endangered Hamilton s Frog spiders insects w t and snails Some such as the tuatara are so unique that they have been called living fossils Three species of bats one since extinct were the only sign of native land mammals in New Zealand until the discovery of bones from a unique mouse sized land mammal at least million years old Marine mammals however are abundant with almost half the world s cetaceans whales dolphins and porpoises and large numbers of fur seals reported in New Zealand waters Many seabirds breed in New Zealand a third of them unique to the country More penguin species are found in New Zealand than in any other country with of the world s penguin species br Since human arrival almost half of the country s vertebrate species have become extinct including at least fifty one birds three frogs three lizards one freshwater fish and one bat Others are endangered or have had their range severely reduced However New Zealand conservationists have pioneered several methods to help threatened wildlife recover including island sanctuaries pest control wildlife translocation fostering and ecological restoration of islands and other protected areas br br br Government and politics br br New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy although its constitution is not codified Charles III is the King of New Zealand and thus the head of state The king is represented by the governor general whom he appoints on the advice of the prime minister The governor general can exercise the Crown s prerogative powers such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers ambassadors and other key public officials and in rare situations the reserve powers e g the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the royal assent of a bill into law The powers of the monarch and the governor general are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers br The New Zealand Parliament holds legislative power and consists of the king and the House of Representatives It also included an upper house the Legislative Council until this was abolished in The supremacy of parliament over the Crown and other government institutions was established in England by the Bill of Rights and has been ratified as law in New Zealand The House of Representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or coalition with the majority of seats If no majority is formed a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured The governor general appoints ministers under advice from the prime minister who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition Cabinet formed by ministers and led by the prime minister is the highest policy making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions The nd and current prime minister since November is Christopher Luxon br br A parliamentary general election must be called no later than three years after the previous election Almost all general elections between and were held under the first past the post voting system Since the election a form of proportional representation called mixed member proportional MMP has been used Under the MMP system each person has two votes one is for a candidate standing in the voter s electorate and the other is for a party Based on the census data there are electorates which include seven M ori electorates in which only M ori can optionally vote and the remaining of the seats are assigned so that representation in Parliament reflects the party vote with the threshold that a party must win at least one electorate or of the total party vote before it is eligible for a seat Elections since the s have been dominated by two political parties National and Labour More parties have been represented in Parliament since the introduction of MMP br New Zealand s judiciary headed by the chief justice includes the Supreme Court Court of Appeal the High Court and subordinate courts Judges and judicial officers are appointed non politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions br New Zealand is identified as one of the world s most stable and well governed states As of the country was ranked fourth in the strength of its democratic institutions and first in government transparency and lack of corruption LGBT rights in the nation are also recognised as among the most tolerant in Oceania New Zealand ranks highly for civic participation in the political process with voter turnout during recent general elections compared to an OECD average of However this is untrue for local council elections a historically low of eligible New Zealanders voted in the local elections compared with an already low turnout in A human rights report by the United States Department of State noted that the New Zealand government generally respected the rights of individuals but voiced concerns regarding the social status of the M ori population In terms of structural discrimination the New Zealand Human Rights Commission has asserted that there is strong consistent evidence that it is a real and ongoing socioeconomic issue One example of structural inequality in New Zealand can be seen in the criminal justice system According to the Ministry of Justice M ori are overrepresented comprising of New Zealanders convicted of crimes and of those imprisoned while only being of the population br br br Regions and external territories br br The early European settlers divided New Zealand into provinces which had a degree of autonomy Because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways education land sales and other policies government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays and sporting rivalries br Since various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government In the government reorganised local government into the current two tier structure of regional councils and territorial authorities The municipalities that existed in have now been consolidated into territorial authorities and regional councils The regional councils role is to regulate the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage water local roads building consents and other local matters Five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils The territorial authorities consist of city councils district councils and the Chatham Islands Council While officially the Chatham Islands Council is not a unitary authority it undertakes many functions of a regional council br The Realm of New Zealand one of Commonwealth realms is the entire area over which the king or queen of New Zealand is sovereign and comprises New Zealand Tokelau the Ross Dependency the Cook Islands and Niue The Cook Islands and Niue are self governing states in free association with New Zealand The New Zealand Parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence Tokelau is classified as a non self governing territory but is administered by a council of three elders one from each Tokelauan atoll The Ross Dependency is New Zealand s territorial claim in Antarctica where it operates the Scott Base research facility New Zealand nationality law treats all parts of the realm equally so most people born in New Zealand the Cook Islands Niue Tokelau and the Ross Dependency are New Zealand citizens br br br Foreign relations br br During the period of the New Zealand colony Britain was responsible for external trade and foreign relations The and Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate its own political treaties and the first commercial treaty was ratified in with Japan On September New Zealand allied itself with Britain and declared war on Germany with Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage proclaiming Where she goes we go where she stands we stand br In the United Kingdom became increasingly focused on its European interests while New Zealand joined Australia and the United States in the ANZUS security treaty The influence of the United States on New Zealand weakened following protests over the Vietnam War the refusal of the United States to admonish France after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues and New Zealand s nuclear free policy Despite the United States s suspension of ANZUS obligations the treaty remained in effect between New Zealand and Australia whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend Close political contact is maintained between the two countries with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit live and work in both countries without restrictions In there were about New Zealand citizens living in Australia which is equivalent to of the population of New Zealand br New Zealand has a strong presence among the Pacific Island countries and enjoys strong diplomatic relations with Samoa Fiji and Tonga and among smaller nations A large proportion of New Zealand s aid goes to these countries and many Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment The increase of this since the s led to the formation of the Pasifika New Zealander pan ethnic group the fourth largest ethnic grouping in the country Permanent migration is regulated under the Samoan Quota Scheme and the Pacific Access Category which allow up to Samoan nationals and up to other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents each year A seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in and in about Pacific Islanders were employed under it New Zealand is involved in the Pacific Islands Forum the Pacific Community Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum including the East Asia Summit New Zealand has been described as a middle power in the Asia Pacific region and an emerging power The country is a member of the United Nations the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD and participates in the Five Power Defence Arrangements br Today New Zealand enjoys particularly close relations with the United States and is one of its major non NATO allies as well as with Australia with a Trans Tasman identity between citizens of the latter being common New Zealand is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing agreement known formally as the UKUSA Agreement The five members of this agreement compromise the core Anglosphere Australia Canada New Zealand the United Kingdom and the United States Since New Zealand has had a partnership arrangement with NATO under the Partnership Interoperability Initiative br br br Military br br New Zealand s military services the New Zealand Defence Force comprise the New Zealand Army the Royal New Zealand Air Force and the Royal New Zealand Navy New Zealand s national defence needs are modest since a direct attack is unlikely However its military has had a global presence The country fought in both world wars with notable campaigns in Gallipoli Crete El Alamein and Cassino The Gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering New Zealand s national identity and strengthened the ANZAC tradition it shares with Australia br In addition to Vietnam and the two world wars New Zealand fought in the Second Boer War the Korean War the Malayan Emergency the Gulf War and the Afghanistan War It has contributed forces to several regional and global peacekeeping missions such as those in Cyprus Somalia Bosnia and Herzegovina the Sinai Angola Cambodia the Iran Iraq border Bougainville East Timor and the Solomon Islands br br br Economy br br New Zealand has an advanced market economy ranked th in the Human Development Index and fourth in the Index of Economic Freedom It is a high income economy with a nominal gross domestic product GDP per capita of US The currency is the New Zealand dollar informally known as the Kiwi dollar it also circulates in the Cook Islands see Cook Islands dollar Niue Tokelau and the Pitcairn Islands br Historically extractive industries have contributed strongly to New Zealand s economy focusing at different times on sealing whaling flax gold kauri gum and native timber The first shipment of refrigerated meat on the Dunedin in led to the establishment of meat and dairy exports to Britain a trade which provided the basis for strong economic growth in New Zealand High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the s and s In New Zealand s export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community and other compounding factors such as the oil and energy crises led to a severe economic depression Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe and by New Zealand had the lowest per capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank In the mid s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three year period Since successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protectionist and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy br br Unemployment peaked just above in and following the share market crash but eventually fell to in ranking third from twenty seven comparable OECD nations However the global financial crisis that followed had a major effect on New Zealand with the GDP shrinking for five consecutive quarters the longest recession in over thirty years and unemployment rising back to in late The lowest unemployment rate recorded using the current methodology was in December during the COVID pandemic at Unemployment rates for different age groups follow similar trends but are consistently higher among youth During the September quarter the general unemployment rate was around while the unemployment rate for youth aged to was New Zealand has experienced a series of brain drains since the s that still continue today Nearly one quarter of highly skilled workers live overseas mostly in Australia and Britain which is the largest proportion from any developed nation In recent decades however a brain gain has brought in educated professionals from Europe and less developed countries Today New Zealand s economy benefits from a high level of innovation br Poverty in New Zealand is characterised by growing income inequality wealth in New Zealand is highly concentrated with the top of the population owning of the country s wealth and the richest owning leaving a stark contrast where half the population including state beneficiaries and pensioners receive less than Moreover child poverty in New Zealand has been identified by the Government as a major societal issue the country has of children living in low income households that had less than of the median equivalised disposable household income as of June Poverty has a disproportionately high effect in ethnic minority households with a quarter of M ori children and almost a third of Pacific Islander children living in poverty as of br br br Trade br New Zealand is heavily dependent on international trade particularly in agricultural products Exports account for of its output making New Zealand vulnerable to international commodity prices and global economic slowdowns Food products made up of the value of all the country s exports in wood was the second largest earner New Zealand s main trading partners as at June are China NZ b Australia b the European Union b the United States b and Japan b On April New Zealand and China signed the New Zealand China Free Trade Agreement the first such agreement China has signed with a developed country In July New Zealand and the European Union entered into the EU New Zealand Free Trade Agreement which eliminated tariffs on several goods traded between the two regions This free trade agreement expanded on the pre existing free trade agreement and saw a reduction in tariffs on meat and dairy in response to feedback from the affected industries br The service sector is the largest sector in the economy followed by manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material extraction Tourism plays a significant role in the economy contributing billion or to New Zealand s total GDP and supporting of the total workforce in In international visitor arrivals were expected to increase at a rate of annually up to br br Wool was New Zealand s major agricultural export during the late th century Even as late as the s it made up over a third of all export revenues but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers In contrast dairy farming increased with the number of dairy cows doubling between and to become New Zealand s largest export earner In the year to June dairy products accounted for billion of total exports and the country s largest company Fonterra controls almost one third of the international dairy trade Other exports in were meat wood and wood products fruit machinery and wine New Zealand s wine industry has followed a similar trend to dairy the number of vineyards doubling over the same period overtaking wool exports for the first time in br br br Infrastructure br In renewable energy generated of New Zealand s gross energy supply The majority of the country s electricity supply is generated from hydroelectric power with major schemes on the Waikato Waitaki and Clutha Mata Au rivers as well as at Manapouri Geothermal power is also a significant generator of electricity with several large stations located across the Taup Volcanic Zone in the North Island The four main companies in the generation and retail market are Contact Energy Genesis Energy Mercury Energy and Meridian Energy State owned Transpower operates the high voltage transmission grids in the North and South Islands as well as the Inter Island HVDC link connecting the two together br The provision of water supply and sanitation is generally of good quality Regional authorities provide water abstraction treatment and distribution infrastructure to most developed areas br br New Zealand s transport network comprises kilometres mi of roads including kilometres mi of motorways and kilometres mi of railway lines Most major cities and towns are linked by bus services although the private car is the predominant mode of transport The railways were privatised in but were re nationalised by the government in stages between and The state owned enterprise KiwiRail now operates the railways with the exception of commuter services in Auckland and Wellington which are operated by Auckland One Rail and Transdev Wellington respectively Railways run the length of the country although most lines now carry freight rather than passengers The road and rail networks in the two main islands are linked by roll on roll off ferries between Wellington and Picton operated by Interislander part of KiwiRail and Bluebridge Most international visitors arrive via air New Zealand has four international airports Auckland Christchurch Queenstown and Wellington however only Auckland and Christchurch offer non stop flights to countries other than Australia or Fiji br The New Zealand Post Office had a monopoly over telecommunications in New Zealand until when Telecom New Zealand was formed initially as a state owned enterprise and then privatised in Chorus which was split from Telecom now Spark in still owns the majority of the telecommunications infrastructure but competition from other providers has increased A large scale rollout of gigabit capable fibre to the premises branded as Ultra Fast Broadband began in with a target of being available to of the population by As of the United Nations International Telecommunication Union ranks New Zealand th in the development of information and communications infrastructure br br br Science and technology br Early indigenous contribution to science in New Zealand was by M ori tohunga accumulating knowledge of agricultural practice and the effects of herbal remedies in the treatment of illness and disease Cook s voyages in the s and Darwin s in had important scientific botanical and zoological objectives The establishment of universities in the th century fostered scientific discoveries by notable New Zealanders including Ernest Rutherford for splitting the atom William Pickering for rocket science Maurice Wilkins for helping discover DNA Beatrice Tinsley for galaxy formation Archibald McIndoe for plastic surgery and Alan MacDiarmid for conducting polymers br Crown Research Institutes CRIs were formed in from existing government owned research organisations Their role is to research and develop new science knowledge products and services across the economic environmental social and cultural spectrum for the benefit of New Zealand The total gross expenditure on research and development R D as a proportion of GDP rose to in up from in New Zealand ranks st in the OECD for its gross R D spending as a percentage of GDP New Zealand was ranked th in the Global Innovation Index in br The New Zealand Space Agency was created by the government in for space policy regulation and sector development Rocket Lab was the notable first commercial rocket launcher in the country br The majority of private and commercial research organisations in New Zealand are focused on the agricultural and fisheries sectors Examples include the Cawthron Institute the Livestock Improvement Corporation the Fonterra Research and Development Centre the Bragato Research Institute the Kiwifruit Breeding Centre and B LNZ Genetics br br br Demographics br br The New Zealand census enumerated a resident population of an increase of over the census figure As of July the total population has risen to an estimated New Zealand s population increased at a rate of per year in the seven years ended June In September Statistics New Zealand reported that the population had climbed above million people in September according to population estimates based on the census br New Zealand s population today is concentrated to the north of the country with around of the population living in the North Island and in the South Island as of June During the th century New Zealand s population drifted north In the country s median centre of population was located in the Tasman Sea west of Levin in Manawat Whanganui by it had moved km mi north to near Kawhia in Waikato br New Zealand is a predominantly urban country with of the population living in urban areas and of the population living in the seven cities with populations exceeding Auckland with over million residents is by far the largest city New Zealand cities generally rank highly on international livability measures For instance in Auckland was ranked the world s third most liveable city and Wellington the twelfth by the Mercer Quality of Living Survey br The median age of the New Zealand population at the census was years with life expectancy in being years for males and years for females While New Zealand is experiencing sub replacement fertility with a total fertility rate of in the fertility rate is above the OECD average By the median age is projected to rise to years and the percentage of people years of age and older to rise from to In the leading cause of death was cancer at followed by ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease As of total expenditure on health care including private sector spending is

ori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples More recently American Australian Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand Non M ori Polynesian cultures are also apparent with Pasifika the world s largest Polynesian festival now an annual event in Auckland br The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New Zealanders being rugged

from soot paint and painted pictures of birds reptiles and other designs on cave walls M ori tattoos moko consisting of coloured soot mixed with gum were cut into the flesh with a bone chisel Since European arrival paintings and photographs have been dominated by landscapes originally not as works of art but as factual portrayals of New Zealand Portraits of M ori were also common with early painters often portraying them as an ideal race untainted by civilisation The country s isolation delayed the influence of European artistic trends allowing local artists to develop their own distinctive style of regionalism During the s and s many artists combined traditional M ori and Western techniques creating unique art forms New Zealand art and craft has gradually achieved an international audience with exhibitions in the Venice Biennale in and the Paradise Now exhibition in New York in br M ori cloaks are made of fine flax fibre and patterned with black red and white
