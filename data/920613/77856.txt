also then known primarily as a producer of animated films and had yet to produce a major live action work For more than years he made periodic efforts to convince Travers to release the rights including visiting her home in Chelsea London He finally succeeded in although Travers demanded and obtained script approval rights The Sherman Brothers composed the music score and were involved in

production even being billed as the film s Consultant However she disapproved of the dilution of the harsher aspects of Mary Poppins character felt ambivalent about the music and hated the use of animation so much that she ruled out any further adaptations of the later Mary Poppins novels She objected to a number of elements that made it into the film Rather than original songs she wanted the soundtrack to feature known standards of the Edwardian period in which the story is set However due to contract stipulations citing that he had final cut privilege on the finished print Disney overruled her br Much of the Travers Disney correspondence is part of the Travers collection of papers in the State Library of New South Wales Australia The relationship between Travers and Disney is

approached Andrews about playing Poppins she was three months pregnant Disney assured her that they were willing to postpone filming until she had given birth so that she could take the part Disney considered actor Stanley Holloway for the role of Admiral Boom but it went to Reginald Owen due to Holloway s commitment to My Fair Lady br Andrews also provided the voice in two other sections of the

the role Van Dyke lobbied to also play the senior Mr Dawes Disney felt he was too young for the part but Van Dyke won him over after a screen test Van Dyke had trouble with Bert s Cockney accent English character actor J Pat O Malley provided some coaching but although Van Dyke is fondly remembered for the film his attempt at a Cockney accent is considered one of the poorer accents in film history It was in a poll by Empire magazine of the worst film accents Van Dyke claimed that O Malley didn t do an accent any better than I did In Van Dyke received an award for television excellence from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts BAFTA at which time he said I appreciate this opportunity to apologise to the members of BAFTA for inflicting on them the most atrocious cockney accent in the history of cinema A chief executive of BAFTA responded We look forward to his acceptance speech in whatever accent he chooses on the night We have no doubt it will be supercalifragilisticexpialidocious br br br Filming br Filming took place between May and September post production and animation took another eleven months br br The scene in which Mary Poppins and Bert interact with a group of animated penguins is noted for its use of the sodium vapor process Rather than using the more common bluescreen process to insert the actors into the animated footage the actors were filmed against a white screen lit with sodium vapor lights which have a yellow hue A special camera was fitted with a prism that filtered this light to a separate reel of film creating a highly accurate matte that could be used to isolate the actors from the background This created a crisp clean image and even allowed the partially transparent veil of Mary Poppins s costume to let through light from the background The film received the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in for this effect br Peter Menefee one of the dancing chimney sweeps supporting Bert provided some insight into the film s choreography br br The choreography wasn t really done until we got there and they mounted it on us On the first day of filming the first thing we shot is the very last thing you see where we re all dancing down the street at the end That was hard because although we had worked for almost a month and a half with the brooms and everything we d been working on a plywood floor And all of a sudden we get out and we re on a cobblestone street and there s supposed to be four of us tumbling right next to each other and you put the broom down Even if it had a rubber point
