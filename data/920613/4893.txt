League Baseball instituting a playoff wild card Costas believed it diminishes the significance and drama of winning a divisional championship He prefers a system in which winning the wild card puts a

at the Summer Olympics in Beijing br br br Controversies br br br Gun culture controversy br During a segment on the Sunday Night Football halftime show on December Costas paraphrased Fox Sports columnist Jason Whitlock in regard to Jovan Belcher s murder suicide the day prior saying the United States gun culture was causing more domestic disputes to result in death and that it was likely Belcher and his girlfriend would not have died had he not possessed a gun br Critics interpreted his remarks as support for gun control Many including former Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Herman Cain felt Costas should not have used a program typically viewed as entertainment to publicize political views on sensitive topics Lou Dobbs criticized his remarks for supporting the abolition of the Second Amendment by quoting a sports writer while Andrew Levy remarked that he had been given a civics lecture by someone who had gotten rich thanks in part to a sport that destroys men s bodies and brains However reporter Erik Wemple of The Washington Post praised Costas for speaking out for gun control on the broadcast commenting that the incident s connection to the NFL provided him with an obligation to acknowledge the incident during the halftime show stating that the things that NFL players do affect the public beyond whether their teams cover the point spread And few cases better exemplify that dynamic as powerfully as the Belcher incident br During the following week Costas defended his remarks in an appearance on MSNBC s program The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell where he said the remarks were related to the country s gun culture and not about gun control as critics had inferred Costas did suggest that more regulation be placed on America s gun culture br br Now do I believe that we need more comprehensive and more sensible gun control legislation Yes I do That doesn t mean repeal the Second Amendment That doesn t mean a prohibition on someone having a gun to protect their home and their family It means sensible and more comprehensive gun control legislation But even if you had that you would still have the problem of what Jason Whitlock wrote about and what I agree with And that is a gun culture in this country br br br Winter Olympics br During his coverage of the Winter Olympics Costas was criticized by some conservative members of the media including Michelle Malkin and Glenn Beck for allegedly praising Russian president Vladimir Putin s role in defusing tensions surrounding Syria and Iran Other conservative media commentators including Bill O Reilly and Bernard Goldberg defended Costas s remarks as factually correct and pointed out that Costas had also voiced considerable criticism of both Russia and Putin while broadcasting from Sochi During an interview on Fox News Goldberg said the idea that Costas somehow portrayed Vladimir Putin as a benign figure is ridiculous Costas defended himself on O Reilly s broadcast on March reiterating that he criticized Putin immediately preceding and following the statements that were questioned O Reilly then aired a portion of an Olympic commentary in which Costas was pointedly critical of the Russian leader Costas also indicated that Senator John McCain who had been among those who had initially criticized Costas had called Costas to apologize after hearing the full segment in context br br br Football s future br While visiting the University of Maryland in November for a roundtable discussion on various sports topics Costas said the sport of football

Bowl LII his eighth as a host despite stepping down from Football Night in America in favor of his successor Mike Tirico Costas was to return while Tirico prepped to lead NBC s coverage of the Winter Olympics set to begin a few days later However the network announced shortly before the game that Liam McHugh would instead join Dan Patrick as a co host leading to speculation that NBC removed Costas from the NFL s biggest game over his comments Costas originally denied such saying it made more sense for McHugh who had been hosting Thursday night games on NBC to serve in that capacity However he later admitted in an interview with ESPN s Outside the Lines that the comments were indeed the basis of his removal ultimately resulting in his departure from the network after forty years br br br Personal life br Costas was married from to to Carole Randy Randall Krummenacher They had two children son Keith born and daughter Taylor born Costas once jokingly promised Minnesota Twins center
