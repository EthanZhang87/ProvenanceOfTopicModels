Richard He had previously been known as the Randleman Rocket br In Petty won races including the last ever race at Occoneechee Speedway br In Ford significantly ratcheted up their factory involvement in NASCAR when they introduced the Ford Torino Talladega The Talladega was specifically designed to give Ford a competitive race advantage by being more aerodynamic and thus faster especially on super speedway tracks more than a mile long Petty switched brands to Ford due to his belief the Plymouth was not competitive on super speedways he wanted a slippery Dodge Daytona but Chrysler executives insisted he stay with Plymouth He would win races and finish second in points He won in in the sleek new Plymouth Superbird with a shark nose and towel rack wing Petty returned to Plymouth for the season This is the car in which Petty is cast in the Pixar film Cars in which Richard and Lynda had voice roles br br On February Petty won his third Daytona driving a brand new for Plymouth Road Runner and beating Buddy Baker by little more than a car length en route to another historic year making him the first driver to win the race times He won more races which would make him become the first driver to earn more than million in career earnings and claimed his rd Grand National Championship At the end of the season Chrysler told the Pettys they no longer would receive direct factory funding support this caused the Petty team great concern In STP began what would turn into a successful year sponsorship arrangement with Petty however it marked the end of his famous all Petty Blue paint job STP previously insisted on an all STP orangish red color for the cars but Petty balked and after an all night negotiation session the familiar STP orange Petty blue paint scheme was agreed to as a compromise that would later become part of STP s motorsport paint schemes most notably Gordon Johncock s win in the Indianapolis where the car had a primarily Petty Blue scheme Thanks to his Top finishes Top finishes and victories Petty went on to win his th NASCAR Cup Series championship was a year of change in other ways as it was the last year where Petty would campaign a Plymouth based race car as in the middle of the year he debuted to drive a newly built Dodge Charger in a few races winning one of them as he believed that the car would have a slight aero advantage over the Plymouth body style In a driver s duel on February Petty in a newly built Dodge Charger a body style he would use exclusively until the end of outlasted Baker now with the K K Insurance Dodge race team to win his th Daytona after Baker s engine gave out with laps to go A year later Petty won the Daytona shortened laps mi km due to the energy crisis for the fifth time en route to his th Winston Cup Championship br was another historic year for Petty as he won the World for the first time in his career one of victories en route to his th Winston Cup The victories is a modern present NASCAR record for victories in a season and was tied in by Jeff Gordon although Gordon won out of races compared to Petty s out of races In Petty was involved in one of the most famous finishes in NASCAR history Petty and David Pearson were racing on the last lap out of turn in the Daytona As Petty tried to pass Pearson at the exit of turn Petty s right rear bumper hit Pearson s left front bumper Pearson and Petty both spun and hit the front stretch wall Petty s car came to rest just yards from the finish line but his engine stalled Pearson s car had hit the front stretch wall and clipped another car but his engine was running Members of Petty s pit crew came out onto the track and tried to push the car to the finish line but ultimately failed Pearson was able to drive his car toward the finish line while Petty s car would not restart Pearson passed Petty on the infield grass and won the Daytona Petty was given credit for second place br Oddly will stand out as the one year during his prime that Petty did not visit the winner s circle The Petty Enterprises Team could not get the new Dodge Magnum to handle properly even though much time effort and faith were spent massaging the cars Unhappy with the seven top five and eleven top ten finishes including three second places Petty decided that his longtime relationship with Chrysler could not continue and he instead began racing a secondhand Chevrolet Monte Carlo at the fall race at Michigan Returning to the General Motors fold proved successful as Petty recorded six top ten finishes in the final ten races of the season and finished sixth in the final standings He would go on to even better results in Petty won the Daytona in an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme in the Famous Finish and ran most of the remaining races in a Chevrolet winning four additional races and taking the NASCAR championship for the seventh and last time by points which was the closest points margin in NASCAR history until br br Petty won two more Daytona s in and In he snapped a race drought winning his sixth Daytona the first to be televised live flag to flag it would become notorious for a fistfight between competitors following the controversial finish Petty won the race as the first and second place cars of Donnie Allison and Cale Yarborough crashed on the last lap Petty held off Darrell Waltrip and A J Foyt The race is also regarded as being the genesis of the current surge in NASCAR s popularity The East Coast was snowed in by a blizzard giving CBS a captive audience The win was part of Petty s seventh and last NASCAR Winston Cup Championship He was able to hold off Waltrip to win the title in br In Petty won two races early in the year at North Wilkesboro and Nashville but a violent crash at Pocono in July ended his championship hopes He finished th in points For NASCAR dictated that all teams had to show up with the new downsized cars of wheel base that Detroit had been building since Though Petty had been successful with the Chevrolet and Oldsmobile cars he had been running he wanted to get back to his Mopar roots After taking a phone call from Lee Iacocca who personally asked Petty to campaign a Dodge for the Petty team built a stunning Dodge Mirada and took it to Daytona in January for high speed tests Petty s fans were also in a large part fans of his Dodges so when word got out about the Mirada testing or so showed up on January at Daytona Speedway to watch Petty put the Dodge through its paces Sadly for the fans the car could do no better than miles per hour about eight miles per hour slower than the GM and Ford cars Petty gave up on returning to Dodge knowing that for the superspeedways the Mirada would not be competitive and bought a Buick Regal for the Daytona race In the Daytona Petty used a fuel only for his last pit stop with laps to go to outfox Bobby Allison and grab his seventh and final Daytona win This win marked a large change in Petty s racing team Dale Inman Petty s longtime crew chief left the team after the Daytona victory Inman would win an eighth championship as crew chief in with Terry Labonte br While the season gave Petty wins he felt the season was a failure and the Regals being ill handling and poor in reliability For he made the move to the Pontiac Grand Prix with the promise of substantial factory support from Pontiac was a repeat of and no victories were to be had At first the Grand Prix behaved much like the Dodge Magnum of with handling and speed problems Toward the end of things improved with several top finishes which opened the door to a successful season with three victories and several top and top finishes In he broke his race winless streak from with a win in the Carolina barely edging out a young Bill Elliott After a controversial win at Charlotte in October recognised by NASCAR as win No Petty left the race team his father founded for the season He spent and driving for Mike Curb before returning to Petty Enterprises in br Because of the Myers Brothers combination race in that Petty finished second in a Grand National Car while winner Bobby Allison drove a Grand American car there is a technical dispute regarding which race is credited as his th win NASCAR did not credit Petty with a class win which was a dispute that affected two other drivers Elmo Langley and Charlie Glotzbach both of whom drove in combination races that season finishing second to Grand American cars Under modern NASCAR combination race rules for various series Petty would be credited with that would be recognized as his th win On May Petty won what under modern regulations would be recognized as his th Cup class win the Budweiser at Dover International Speedway when the Winston Salem class win is recognized br br On July Petty won his officially recognized th and what would turn out to be his final victory race at the Firecracker at Daytona International Speedway The race was memorable On lap Doug Heveron crashed bringing out the yellow caution flag essentially turning lap into the last lap as the two drivers battled back to the start finish line Petty and Cale Yarborough diced it out on that lap with Yarborough drafting and taking an early lead before Petty managed to cross the start finish line only a fender length ahead This is no longer possible because of the rule change freezing the field immediately upon caution Furthermore in the green white checkered rule was created for cases when the yellow flag waved with two laps but not just one remaining Also under current combination race rules Petty would be recognized for his st win President Ronald Reagan was in attendance the first sitting president to attend a NASCAR race Reagan celebrated the milestone with Petty and his family in victory lane br In early Petty traveled to Australia to help promote a NASCAR exhibition race at the then new Calder Park Thunderdome the first NASCAR race outside of North America While he did not compete in the track s inaugural race the Goodyear NASCAR though his son Kyle did Richard Petty in testing at the mi km track which owner Bob Jane had modeled on the Charlotte Motor Speedway set an unofficial lap record of seconds mp h This would have in fact landed him on pole position for the race as the fastest time in official qualifying was by Alabama Gang member Neil Bonnett who recorded a second lap mp h in his Pontiac Grand Prix br br On October Petty announced he would retire after the season Petty s final top ten finish came at the Budweiser at the Glen which was the same race J D McDuffie was killed in a fifth lap accident Petty chose to run the entire season not just selected events as other drivers have done before retirement His year long Fan Appreciation Tour took him around the country participating in special events awards ceremonies and fan related meetings Racing Champions ran a promotional line of diecast cars for every race in Petty s Farewell Tour br At the Pepsi on July Petty qualified on the front row for the first time since Before the start of the race he was honored with a gift ceremony which included a visit from President George H W Bush When the green flag dropped Petty led the opening five laps as the holiday crowd cheered wildly Unfortunately the oppressive heat forced him to drop out after completing just laps br Despite the busy appearance schedule and mediocre race results Petty managed to qualify for all races in On his final visit to each track Petty would lead the field on the pace lap to salute the fans Petty s final race the season ending Hooters at Atlanta Motor Speedway which also marked the start of Jeff Gordon s NASCAR career and the second closest points championship in NASCAR history with six drivers mathematically eligible to win the championship is hailed to this day as the greatest race in NASCAR history A record spectators attended the race and celebrated Petty s farewell In the intense title race the championship contender Davey Allison got mixed up in a crash with Ernie Irvan dashing his title hopes Long shot contenders Mark Martin Kyle Petty and Harry Gant fell behind in the long run which left Bill Elliott and Alan Kulwicki to compete for the title The race went down to the final lap with Elliott winning and Kulwicki taking the championship by points because he had led the most laps one more than Elliott which gave him a five point bonus br Facing intense pressure Petty barely managed to qualify at Atlanta posting the th fastest speed out of cars He would not have been eligible for the provisional starting position and had to qualify on speed On the th lap Petty became tangled up in an accident and his car caught fire Petty pulled the car off the track and climbed out of the burning machine uninjured His pit crew worked diligently with less than laps to go to get the car running again and with two laps to go Petty pulled out of the pits and was credited as running at the finish in his final race He took his final checkered flag finishing in th position After the race Petty circled the track to salute the fans one final time in his trademark STP Pontiac br Thereafter he made a few public show appearances at racetracks On August NASCAR participated in a tire test at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in preparations for the Brickyard Petty drove several laps around the track and then donated his car to the Speedway s museum He would again step into a racecar in on the week of the final race under the Winston banner at Homestead Miami Speedway where he took a solo lap honoring his seven Winston Cup Championships for Winston s salute to the champions In at the Coke Zero in Daytona for the th anniversary of his final th victory in Petty drove one of his s Pontiac racecars during the pace laps leading the field for the first one The field split him and he followed it for one more pace lap before he pulled his car in Finally at the Southern at Darlington Petty led the field through several pace laps in his Plymouth Belvedere He apparently stayed out a lap longer than expected and was humorously black flagged by the starter Petty followed the pace car down pit road at the start of the race br br In later years of his career Petty developed the career of crew leader Robbie Loomis who was at the helm of Petty Enterprises as crew chief in the s and won three races the Checker Auto Parts at Phoenix the ACDelco at North Carolina Speedway both with Bobby Hamilton driving and the Goody s Body Pain at Martinsville Speedway with John Andretti driving Petty remained as operating owner until his son Kyle Petty took over day to day operations a decade later br However in Kyle Petty was released by Petty Enterprises and because of

window br In a race at Pocono Petty slammed the Turn wall nearly flipping the car He barely escaped breaking his neck in the wreck but still raced the next Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway This is unlikely to happen now because of modern NASCAR rules requiring an official series medical liaison to clear a driver after a crash br In the Daytona on Lap Petty got turned by Phil Barkdoll out of turn Petty s car went aloft tumbled many times rode along the catch fence and hurled parts all over the front stretch at the Daytona International Speedway After several flips Petty was t boned by

Allison during the Winston at Talladega Superspeedway and Carl Edwards s Talladega crash in that in all three cases the racers cars became airborne after turning sideways and damaged the spectator
