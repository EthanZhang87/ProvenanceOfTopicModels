Lightning McQueen is a fictional anthropomorphic stock car and the protagonist of the Disney Pixar Cars franchise He was developed by John Lasseter and co director Joe Ranft from a story concept by Jorgen Klubien McQueen s appearances include the feature films Cars Cars and Cars as well as the animated series Cars Toons and Cars on the Road He is also a playable character in each of the Cars video game installments Lightning is recognizable by his red body with yellow and orange lightning bolt stickers featuring his racing number on his sides He is primarily voiced by Owen Wilson br In Cars Lightning begins as a talented but cocky rookie in the Piston Cup racing series who becomes stranded in the small town of Radiator Springs where he learns about humility and friendship from the locals Over his professional racing career he wins several Piston Cup victories In Cars he competes in the World Grand Prix while his friend Tow Mater is unwittingly dragged into a spy mission In Cars he struggles to come to terms with retirement and assumes the role of Cruz Ramirez s mentor br Despite receiving a mixed reaction from critics in the first film Lightning McQueen has become the recognizable face and mascot of the Cars franchise being widely merchandised in the form of branded toy cars and products He has been mentioned in commentary by NASCAR racing drivers including Kyle Busch and Chris Buescher and his achievements have been discussed by sports journalist Stephen A Smith Critics have described him as one of the greatest or most iconic cars in film br br br Development br br br Concept and creation br br The concept for Cars originated in when Danish story development artist Jorgen Klubien had the idea to write an animated feature based on a three wheeled electric car in Denmark that had proven to be unpopular for being ugly He thought of this as The Ugly Duckling by Hans Christian Andersen a character that is not initially accepted but later proves to be a success He began to write the story concept with the title The Yellow Car which was set in a small town populated by cars rather than people The story involved the Yellow Car struggling to be accepted by the local residents due to being different but eventually earning its place in the community Pixar chief creative officer John Lasseter liked the concept of a world inhabited by cars presented by Klubien but felt that the Yellow Car needed to be a stronger character to create conflict in the story He and co director Joe Ranft began developing the various car characters in the story while the Yellow Car was eventually replaced by Lightning McQueen br From the start Pixar s new film project was referred to as Cars Lasseter decided that the main character should be a racing car because it represents speed power and individuality The Pixar team began to focus their research on racing cars with Lasseter attending numerous races to ensure that the film was authentic in every single detail The team visited Lowe s Motor Speedway in Charlotte and met with Richard Petty Story artist Steve Purcell said that meeting die hard fans and experiencing the track first hand was the ideal education needed for the film s development Lasseter took driving lessons at the Infineon Raceway from instructors at the Jim Russell Racing School to get an authentic experience of motorsport which became invaluable for giving direction to Owen Wilson the voice of Lightning McQueen br Lasseter who had previously worked on Toy Story had for many years toyed with the idea of making a film about cars having a particular love of cars and NASCAR racing Lasseter said that he became hooked on cars at an early age after buying Hot Wheels toy cars He cited childhood vacations with his family on Route and the animated films of Japanese producer Hayao Miyazaki as his inspirations In the summer of he and his family went on a two month road trip that avoided interstate highways which forced him to take a slower journey Out of this experience he began to develop the story idea for the film I discovered that the journey in life is the reward he recalled In he and a group of Pixar staff took a trip on Route Over nine days they toured a number of places along the route including Route Museum in Clinton Oklahoma and studied the landscape Lasseter conducted research about automotives befriending design chief J Mays of the Ford Motor Company During development Pixar s animators also benefited from having Porsche coupes delivered to Pixar s offices for inspection Lasseter and the production team also met with General Motors designers in the early s to discuss the new Chevrolet Corvette design At that time the story concept was very different to the final film and according to Pixar producer Darla K Anderson it evolved over time Cars reflects Lasseter s sadness over the decline of small towns on Route which he said died overnight following the construction of interstate highways after World War II br br br Characterization br Pixar s animators found it challenging to inject personality into the characters due to their rigid forms Lasseter was of the opinion that the cars in the film had to feel like they had the weight and movement of real cars In early animation tests the cars featured big smiles and had less rigid tops but Lasseter decided this needed to be changed to reflect the rigidity of real cars The animators spent a lot of time working on the face to ensure that the characters felt like they were alive thus the grill of the car was designed as its mouth For the eyes Lasseter took inspiration from the Disney short film Susie the Little Blue Coupe in which the character s windscreen panes are used for the eyes This brought other challenges in particular how to get the characters facial expressions right In early tests the team found that their eyes were too far from their mouths so the animators worked to improve their expressions by repositioning the lower eyelids br Although most of the car characters were inspired by real models Lightning McQueen was given special treatment Production designer Bob Pauley explained He s the new rookie he s kinda sexy he s fast he s different The team took their favorite parts from different models including GT s and Chargers to create him Directing animator James Ford Murphy said that Lightning McQueen posed a challenge from the start as the team struggled to define his character They knew that it would be difficult to create a character that was both cocky but also likeable To solve this Pauley compiled biographies of celebrities with cocky but likeable personalities including American boxer Muhammad Ali American basketball player Charles Barkley American football player Joe Namath and American musician Kid Rock Pauley said that Lightning McQueen was successfully drawn once they created him as an Owen Wilson character The movement of the cars was also a defining part of their personalities For Lightning McQueen the team wanted to bring beauty to his movement so they took inspiration from surfers snowboarders and athletes like American basketball player Michael Jordan Murphy explained We wanted to have that same type of feeling so that when they re talking about the rookie sensation you re seeing that he is really gifted br Art department manager Jay Ward explained that the theme of the film is expressed in Lightning McQueen s character development He said that as a racing car he is entirely self centered and his goal at the start of the film is to reach the finish line but by spending time in Radiator Springs he has to learn that life is about the journey not the destination He described the racing aspect as the bookends in his story arc the racing world he started in and the racing world he returns to and he is a different character Lightning McQueen is not named after actor and race driver Steve McQueen but after Pixar animator Glenn McQueen who died in br Creating the story for the third film in the franchise presented the creative team with some character issues due to Lightning McQueen already being a champion racer Cars writer Mike Rich explained that everything had gone well for the character s career so far but this was not the best way to begin a story For inspiration they decided to look at real sports celebrities like Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan specifically analysing what athletes do about getting older Their research showed that some dealt with the situation better than others with some refusing to adapt In Cars Lightning McQueen takes the same role as Strip The King Weathers an ageing character from the first film because like him he is threatened by newcomer Jackson Storm For McQueen Storm represents the end of his beloved sport After experiencing a devastating crash McQueen finds the solution in the form of Cruz Ramirez who repeatedly reminds him of his age and helps him learn that he no longer has to train like a young man Story supervisor Scott Morse said that the Pixar team thought it important to show the changes in his character because they felt that children comprehend circumstances above their level McQueen is maturing he s evolving McQueen s a character that kids grew up with For kids in particular to see somebody they re comfortable with going through an evolutionary change it helps them understand how to do that Cars director Brian Fee also cited conversations with retiring racing driver Jeff Gordon alongside his own personal experiences of mentoring his daughters as inspiration for the emotional core of Lightning McQueen feeling pride in helping someone else to win rather than being preoccupied with his own achievements br br br Voice br br American actor Owen Wilson is the voice of Lightning McQueen in the Cars filmography He was cast in the original Cars film and returned to voice the character in Cars and Cars while also voicing him in the television series Cars on the Road He also voices the character in the short film Mater and the Ghostlight and the Cars Toons short The Radiator Springs and the Cars and Cars video games Wilson said that he was cast in the role as a result of Lasseter and his children enjoying Shanghai Noon a film starring Wilson and Jackie Chan When Wilson met with Lasseter he told him about the upcoming animated project and thought that he would be suitable for the role Wilson admitted that he liked the street cred he got from his two sons for voicing the character br br br Design br The Cars production team consulted a variety of experts including racers engineers and historians to ensure that the characters in the film were designed to have the appearance of real cars Lightning McQueen is not based on a particular vehicle Lasseter explained that the shape of NASCAR cars was problematic due to being shaped quite flat for aerodynamics but this meant that their designs were not very interesting Consequently Lightning McQueen is a hybrid based on a stock car and a Le Mans endurance racer which has a more curvaceous body Lasseter added that the character also has some Lola and some Ford GT His number was originally a reference to Lasseter s birth year but was changed to referencing the release year of Pixar s first film Toy Story br In addition to his catchphrase Ka chow Lightning McQueen is recognizable by his red exterior yellow lightning bolt and number displayed on his sides Yet over the course of three films in the Cars filmography he is presented with a variety of appearances In Cars his cocky attitude is illustrated by having stickers for headlights In Cars he again appears in his red paint but with working headlights Pixar updated Lightning McQueen s design for the sequel Lasseter wanted him to stand out next to the other World Grand Prix contestants so flames were added to his body due to them being a common style feature of American hot rods His body work took a year to design and involved many contributors including Chip Foose In Cars his design varies beginning the film with a new Rust Eze logo During his recovery after his near fatal crash he is presented in gray primer In another sequence he secretly goes undercover at a demolition derby with the pseudonym Chester Whipplefilter and is masked by a layer of brown mud His red design is later updated with a vinyl wrap in preparation for the next racing season By the end of Cars he is redesigned with a dark blue paint job in reference to his mentor Doc Hudson br For the Pixar team these design changes are significant parts of his story arc Fee explained that in Cars Lightning McQueen spends a lot of time in the movie trying to be somebody he s not Lasseter explained that when he gets the vinyl wrap it is symbolic of him getting back to who he is Fee considered Doc Hudson and McQueen to be like father and son thus Lightning is very emotional to discover that it meant such a lot to Doc to mentor him For this reason it is Cruz Ramirez who ends up wearing number while Lightning displays Fabulous Lightning McQueen on his side in homage to Doc the Fabulous Hudson Hornet Lasseter explained that his mentoring of Cruz makes Lightning realize that he is in the same position as Doc when he mentored him adding that the color change was temporary and only for fun For a short time he s going to get Cruz going but he ll continue racing br br br Appearances br br br Cars filmography br br br Cars br br Lightning McQueen is a rookie racecar in the Piston Cup series and

in Tokyo but when he approaches him Mater speeds away because of a bomb planted in his engine Lightning catches up and realizes that Mater was telling the truth about being on a spy mission McQueen

disarm the bomb Following the arrest of Axlerod Lightning happily declares that Mater can come to all future races Back in Radiator Springs it is revealed that Lightning s Allinol supply was switched

released a remote controlled animatronic Lightning McQueen which featured a moving mouth and eyes and touch sensitive surfaces br br br Reception br br br Critical response br Lightning McQueen s debut in Cars received a mixed response from critics Lisa Schwarzbaum writing for Entertainment Weekly said that McQueen s story arc in which he learns that loyalty and community are more important than personal advancement was nothing new and had already been done in numerous films including in Over the Hedge and by Michael J Fox in Doc Hollywood Paul Arendt of the BBC also noted the similarity to Doc Hollywood and expressed boredom over an arrogant racing car learning a lesson about community and teamwork Nick Schager of Slant described his story arc as the maturation of narcissistic stock car rookie and thought his character development was a simplistic transition from materialistic self involved jerk to noble role model Philip French of The Guardian described Lightning McQueen as a cocky callow young racing car a flashy red affair but noted the many positive lessons that he learns over the course of the film Mick LaSalle writing for the San Francisco Chronicle opined that the film raises too many questions about the motivations of its protagonist describing him as an armless legless cumbersome creature inhabiting a lonely landscape in which no real connection is possible Conversely Michael Agger of Slate praised the heartwarming on screen bondings in the film particularly scenes involving McQueen and Mater and a dating sequence with Sally The Washington Post s Stephen Hunter found similarities to Lightning McQueen in the boxing stories of the s as a champ who s really a chump who learns lessons in humility and respect He also likened him to American racing driver Jeff Gordon Jeff Otto of IGN found Wilson s vocals a bit irritating and commented on the lack of chemistry between Wilson and Bonnie Hunt s Sally br Film critic Roger Ebert noted that in Cars Lightning McQueen is eclipsed by the supporting character Mater Matt Fowler of IGN also commented on this stating that he is reduced to playing the straight man but thought that giving Mater the main role in the film was a positive move because he felt that McQueen is a dry character He also opined that Pixar had forced him into additional scenes just because he had been the main character in the first film Empire s Ian Freer felt that the relationship between McQueen and Mater is too simple and too direct particularly McQueen s expectations for his friend to change in order to fit into his lifestyle Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy found their friendship to be lacking in warmth A O Scott writing for The New York Times also criticised Lightning s racing exploits being upstaged by Pixar s redneck Jar Jar Binks Peter Travers of Rolling Stone thought that McQueen s determination to not let his career break his friendship with Mater was one of the film s strengths Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the recognizable earnestness in Wilson s vocal performance br Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found the story concept of Cars to be a bit contrived by presenting a story arc about a character that is still a champion but also struggling with the idea of being replaced by a younger generation He noted that Lightning McQueen appears no older than in the first film IGN s Eric Goldman applauded the depth in McQueen s character stating that his story arc is filled with allegory and metaphor and praising the film for its detailed portrayal of what it means to be an ageing athlete Jeremiah Vanderhelm writing for The Michigan Daily commented that his story had already been done in other films like Rocky Balboa and Creed and felt that the film should have spent more time developing McQueen s struggle instead of trying to focus on both him and Cruz Simon Abrams of The Hollywood Reporter questioned whether children could really relate to a character who is being forced into retirement He noted that although the story makes McQueen a sympathetic character due to being soft spoken and neurotically obsessed with going back to his roots children would struggle to relate to him because the newcomer Jackson Storm is too fast to beat Robbie Collins writing for The Telegraph described the film as a profound victory lap for Lightning McQueen noting the emotional significance of losing his mentor Doc Hudson and the touching contemplation of legacies shared with Cruz Julia Alexander of Polygon praised Cars for bringing the franchise back to its roots noting that the film focuses entirely on Lightning McQueen who had been sidelined in Cars She commented that the film makes it clear that he is the star of the universe and felt that it is the righteous conclusion longtime fans have been waiting for br br br Court case br Disney and Pixar won a legal case on November brought by stock car driver Mark Brill who alleged that the design of Lightning McQueen misappropriated his own car The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals upheld the lower court judgement based on the Vanna White v Robot With A Blond Whig case The verdict was based on an analysis of whether the audience would mistake the car in the film for Brill s car The court decided that a fictional talking driver less red race car with the number on it cannot be construed as a likeness of a driver of a similarly colored numbered race car br br br Legacy br Lightning McQueen has been described by critics as one of the greatest or most iconic movie cars In Liam Lacey writing for The Globe and Mail opined that Lightning McQueen should change his catchphrase to ka ching due to the success of Cars merchandise which had earned almost billion from the first film alone In motorsport the Japanese team APR Racing drove the Lightning McQueen based livery No Toyota MR S during the Super GT Series In April fifteen years after the release of Cars Lightning McQueen crocs trended on Twitter after the Crocs shoe company released a limited edition pair of adult crocs designed in the character s likeness In October Wilson appeared in a sketch on Saturday Night Live which involved him recording Lightning McQueen s dialogue for a fourth Cars film In the script the character is increasingly presented as the villain of the story In November he was added as a DLC car in the vehicular soccer video game Rocket League A debate over Lightning McQueen s status as the greatest of all time raged with fans on social media in November eventually involving American sports journalist Stephen A Smith who opined that he could not be regarded as such in comparison to Strip The King Weathers In February NASCAR racing driver Kyle Busch referred to the character after being in the middle car in a three wide finish at Atlanta Motor Speedway He commented I hate that we had a Lightning McQueen style finish there referring to a moment in Cars when the character finishes in a three wide race by sticking his tongue out to reach the finish line In May Chris Buescher made a similar joke after losing to Kyle Larson in a close photo finish at Kansas Speedway by commenting Guess I should ve pulled a Lightning McQueen and stuck out my tongue br br br Notes br br br
