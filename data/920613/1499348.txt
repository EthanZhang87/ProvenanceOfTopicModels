matches the female s song the two penguins mate Norma Jean a female penguin falls for Memphis a male penguin and they become mates They lay an egg which Memphis cares for while Norma Jean leaves with the other females to fish While the males struggle through the harsh winter Memphis briefly drops the egg The resulting chick Mumble is unable to sing but can tap dance Nevertheless he is enamored with Gloria a female penguin who is regarded as the most talented of her age One day Mumble encounters a group of hostile skua with a leader who is tagged with a yellow band which he says is from an alien abduction Mumble narrowly escapes the hungry birds by falling into a crevice br Now a young adult Mumble is frequently ridiculed by the elders and their leader Noah After escaping from a leopard seal attack Mumble befriends five Adelie penguins named Ram n Nestor Lombardo Rinaldo and Raul collectively known as the Amigos who embrace Mumble s dance moves and assimilate him into their group After seeing a hidden human excavator in an avalanche they opt to ask Lovelace a rockhopper penguin about its origin Lovelace has the plastic rings of a six pack entangled around his neck saying that they have been bestowed on him by mystic beings br For the emperor penguins it is mating season and Gloria is the center of attention The Amigos unsuccessfully attempt to help Mumble win her affection by having Ram n sing a Spanish version of My Way behind Mumble with the latter lip syncing After Mumble desperately begins to tap dance in synch with her song she falls for him and the youthful penguins join in for singing and dancing The elders are appalled by Mumble s conduct which they see as the reason for their lean fishing season Memphis begs Mumble to stop dancing for his own sake revealing that when he was still in his egg Memphis dropped Mumble implying that this is the reason for both Mumble s lack of a heartsong and his dancing but when Mumble refuses he is exiled br Mumble and the Amigos return to Lovelace for answers regarding the aliens which Mumble concludes might have knowledge about the fish shortage but find him being choked by the plastic rings Lovelace confesses that they were snagged on him while swimming off the forbidden shores beyond the land of the elephant seals The group decide to take Lovelace with them to remove the rings Not long into their journey Gloria encounters them wishing to become Mumble s mate Fearing for her safety he ridicules Gloria driving her away br At the forbidden shore Mumble Lovelace and the Amigos are attacked by two orcas during which Lovelace is freed from the plastic rings After escaping they find a fishing boat Mumble exhaustingly pursues it alone eventually washing up on the shore of Florida where he is rescued and kept at Marine World with Magellanic penguins After a long and secluded confinement in addition to fruitlessly trying to communicate with the humans Mumble nearly succumbs to madness When a girl attempts to interact with Mumble by tapping the glass he starts dancing which attracts a large crowd br Mumble is returned to the wild with a tracking device attached to his back He returns to his colony and challenges the will of the elders Memphis reconciles with him as a research team arrives verifying Mumble s statements of aliens existing The entire colony engages in dance in front of the research team whose expedition footage prompts a worldwide debate which eventually leads to the banning of all Antarctic overfishing satisfying both the emperor penguins and the Amigos br br br Voice cast br br br Production br As an initial inspiration for the film George Miller cited an encounter with a grizzled old cameraman whose father was Frank Hurley of the Shackleton expeditions during the shooting of Mad Max We were sitting in this bar having a milkshake and he looked across at me and said Antarctica He d shot a documentary there He said You ve got to make a film in Antarctica It s just like out here in the wasteland It s spectacular And that always stuck in my head Happy Feet was also partially inspired by earlier documentaries such as the BBC s Life in the Freezer br In during an otherwise non sequitur meeting Doug Mitchell impulsively presented Warner Bros studio president Alan Horn with an early rough draft of the film s screenplay and asked them to read it while he and Miller flew back to Australia By the time they had landed Warner Bros had decided to provide funding on the film Production was slated to begin sometime after the completion of the fourth Mad Max film Fury Road but geopolitical complications pushed Happy Feet to the forefront in early br The animation is invested heavily in motion capture technology with the dance scenes acted by human dancers The tap dancing for Mumble was provided by Savion Glover who was also co choreographer for the dance sequences The dancers went through Penguin School to learn how to move like a penguin and also wore head apparatus to mimic a penguin s beak br Happy Feet needed an enormous group of computers and Animal Logic worked with IBM to build a server farm with sufficient processing potential The film took four years to make Lighting Supervisor and VFX Department Supervisor Ben Gunsberger said that this was partly because they needed to build new infrastructure and tools The server farm used IBM BladeCenter framework and BladeCenter HS blade servers which are extremely dense separate computer units each with two Intel Xeon processors Rendering took up million CPU hours over a nine month period br According to Miller the environmental message was not a major part of the original script In Australia we re very very aware of the ozone hole he said and Antarctica is literally the canary in the coal mine for this stuff So it sort of had to go in that direction This influence led to a film with a more environmental tone Miller said You can t tell a story about Antarctica and the penguins without giving that dimension br The film is dedicated to the memory of Nick Enright Michael Jonson Robby McNeilly Green and Steve Irwin br br br Music br Happy Feet is a jukebox musical taking previously recorded songs and working them into the film s soundtrack to fit the mood of the scene or character Two soundtrack albums were released for the film one containing songs from and

positive review saying Happy Feet treads material common to kids films and cartoons most notably Dumbo A young animal stands out from his herd or flock because of his inability to perform like the other animals although he seemingly compensates for this defect by demonstrating a certain skill that sets him apart from the others who ostracize him for his weirdness Baumgarten also said that the CGI recreation of Antarctica is stunning allowing the film to shift among glorious long shots of the ice and penguin population and midshots and close ups of the character interactions br James
