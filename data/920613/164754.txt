Stitch br br br Production br br br Development br br In after graduating from California Institute of the Arts Chris Sanders had created the character of Stitch for an unsuccessful children s book pitch He said I wanted to do a children s book about this little creature that lived in a forest It was a bit of a monster with no real explanation as to where it came from But he found it difficult to condense the story and abandoned the project In Walt Disney Feature Animation hired him for their newly formed visual development department His first project was The Rescuers Down Under but he soon transitioned into storyboarding After that Sanders storyboarded sequences for Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King and was promoted to Head of Story on Mulan br In several executives at Disney Feature Animation were invited to a retreat at Michael Eisner s farm in Vermont to discuss the future animation slate beyond adapting preexisting legends folklore or classic novels At the retreat Thomas Schumacher then executive vice president of Disney Feature Animation suggested they produce a film that would be the Dumbo for our generation compared to the large budget Disney animated features they had already done Schumacher approached Sanders about producing the film telling him Everybody wants this next film to be you br During a karaoke dinner at the Walt Disney World Swan Resort Schumacher asked Sanders Is there anything you would like to develop Sanders remembered the children s book project he had initially developed At his next meeting Sanders pitched a remote non urban location with Stitch crash landing into a forest and interacting entirely with woodland animals being ostracized by them and living on his own at a farm in rural Kansas But Schumacher suggested that Stitch should interact with people instead The animal world is already alien to us So if you wanna get the best contrast between this monster and the place where it lives I would recommend you set it in a human world br For three straight days in his Palm Springs Florida hotel room Sanders created a page pitch book drawing conceptual sketches and outlining the film s general story He initially revised it by adding a boy character But as the character of Stitch evolved Sanders decided he needed to be contrasted with a female character I think Stitch represented a male character so the balance would be to put him with a little girl We wanted someone who was going to be in conflict with Stitch and we realized a little boy might be a comrade Sanders then glanced at a map of Hawaii on his wall and recalling he had recently vacationed there he relocated the story there Not well versed in Hawaiian culture Sanders turned to a vacation roadmap and found the names Lilo Lane and Nani there After finishing the booklet he shipped it to Burbank and Schumacher approved the pitch with one condition it has to look like you drew it br br br Writing br br Dean DeBlois who had served as story co head for Mulan was brought on to co write and co direct Lilo Stitch after Thomas Schumacher allowed him to leave production on Atlantis The Lost Empire Meanwhile Disney executive Clark Spencer was assigned as the film s producer Unlike several previous and concurrent Disney Feature Animation productions the film s pre production team remained relatively small and isolated from upper management until the film went into full production br Originally Stitch was the leader of an intergalactic gang and Jumba was one of his former cronies summoned by the Intergalactic Council to capture Stitch Test audience response to early versions of the film led to changing Stitch and Jumba into creation and creator br While the animation team visited Kaua i to research the locale their tour guide explained the meaning of ohana as it applies to extended families This concept of ohana became an important part of the movie DeBlois recalls br br No matter where we went our tour guide seemed to know somebody He was really the one who explained to us the Hawaiian concept of ohana a sense of family that extends far beyond your immediate relatives That idea so influenced the story that it became the foundation theme the thing that causes Stitch to evolve despite what he was created to do which is destroy br The island of Kaua i had also been featured in such films as Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Jurassic Park trilogy Disney s animators faced the daunting task of meshing the film s plot which showed the impoverished and dysfunctional life that many Hawaiians lived during the then recent economic downturn with the island s serene beauty The actors voicing the film s young adults Nani and David were Tia Carrere a local of Honolulu and Jason Scott Lee who is of Hawaiian descent and grew up in Hawaii Both Carrere and Lee assisted with rewriting their characters dialogue in proper colloquial dialect and with adding Hawaiian slang terms br One innovative and unique aspect of the film is its strong focus on the relationship between two sisters At the time a central relationship between sisters as a major plot element was rare in American animated films br br br Casting br Daveigh Chase earned the role of Lilo in the fall of against other candidates br Stitch was initially intended to be a non verbal character but Sanders said he realized he d have to say a few things so we made sure that we kept it to a minimum Instead of hiring a professional actor to voice Stitch DeBlois suggested Sanders take the role According to Sanders Stitch s voice was the one he regularly used just to bother people at the studio I d call people on the phone and do that voice and annoy them br Tia Carrere was originally considered for the title character in Mulan but lost the role to Ming Na Wen After learning Disney was doing a Hawaii set film Carrere sought a voice role and was hired to voice Nani She spent two years recording her part in Los Angeles Paris and Toronto Jason Scott Lee was cast as David after Carrere recommended him for the film br Chris Williams then a storyboard artist suggested Kevin McDonald for the part of Agent Pleakley After McDonald read for the part he was cast Cobra Bubbles was initially envisioned as more of a nebbish with Jeff Goldblum in mind for the role Goldblum declined the role and Bubbles was reconceived as a more intimidating character Sanders and DeBlois recalled Ving Rhames s performance in Pulp Fiction and cast him br During the film s early development Ricardo Montalb n was cast as one of the villains with his vocal performance based on the voice he used for Khan Noonien Singh in Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan However all the lines he recorded were removed and his character was cut after the meeting that lead to the removal of Stitch s gang from the story Eventually the villainous role in the film would be Gantu voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson who is best known for playing villain roles in shows and movies David Ogden Stiers who had previously done voices for Disney in past films was chosen to be the voice of Jumba Australian actress Zoe Caldwell got the role of voicing the Grand Councilwoman the leader of Galactic Federation br br br Design and animation br br In a deviation from several decades worth of Disney features Sanders and DeBlois chose to use watercolor painted backgrounds for Lilo Stitch as opposed to the traditional gouache technique Watercolors had been used for the early Disney animated shorts as well as the early Disney features Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Pinocchio and Dumbo but the technique had been largely abandoned by the mid s in favor of less complicated media such as gouache Sanders preferred that watercolors be used for Lilo Stitch to evoke both the bright look of a storybook and the art direction of Dumbo requiring the background artists to be trained in working with the medium br The animation itself was all based on D work since the budget was too small for computer generated imagery The character designs were based on Sanders s personal drawing style rather than the traditional Disney in house style To assist the animators with adapting Sanders s style Sue C Nichols the film s visual development supervisor created a manual Surfing the Sanders Style Because of the limited budget details like pockets or designs on clothing were avoided in the animation process and since they could not afford to do shadows throughout much of the film many of the scenes took place in shaded areas saving shadows for more pivotal scenes br The film s extraterrestrial elements such as the spaceships were designed to resemble marine life such as whales and crabs One altered scene in the film involved Stitch Nani Jumba and Pleakley hijacking a Boeing jet from Lihue Airport that scrapes against buildings through downtown Honolulu But after the September attacks with only a few weeks left in production the climax was reworked to have them use Jumba s spacecraft instead The location was also shifted to have them fly through the mountains of Kaua i Regardless the final design still has engines that resembled the s jet engines according to Sanders br Even after this adjustment the team had enough budget for about two additional minutes of animation which was used to create the epilogue montage of Lilo Nani and Stitch becoming a new family br br br Release br On June Lilo Stitch premiered at the El Capitan Theatre Alongside the filmmakers and Disney studio executives Priscilla and Lisa Marie Presley Wynonna Judd Phil Collins Gregory Hines and Jodie Foster were also in attendance br br br Marketing br Wanting Stitch to be a central part of the film s marketing campaign Sanders pitched a subversive idea what if Stitch invaded other Disney properties Dick Cook then chairman of Walt Disney Studios loved the idea and allowed for four parody teaser trailers to be made nicknamed Inter stitch als in which Stitch crashes memorable moments of four films from the Disney Renaissance three of which Sanders had worked on The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast Aladdin and The Lion King Most of the original actors reprised their roles in the trailers but they were shocked when asked to act negatively toward Stitch The trailers also include the AC DC song Back in Black br The marketing campaign also included several tie in promotions like Lilo Stitch toys being offered as part of McDonald s Happy Meals In the United Kingdom Lilo Stitch trailers and television ads featured a cover of Elvis s song Suspicious Minds performed by Gareth Gates who became famous on the UK TV program Pop Idol In the U S Hound Dog was used for both theatrical and television trailers The marketing campaign presented Stitch as the sort of Disney Family Black Sheep As a promotional campaign comics of Lilo Stitch ran in Disney Adventures before the film s release The comics detailed events leading up to the film for both title characters including Stitch s creation and escape These events were later contradicted by the sequel Lilo Stitch Stitch Has a Glitch rendering the comics non canonical but the comics are notable for introducing Experiment Reuben who was a main character in the subsequent movies and TV series Most of the comic series have been released as a collective volume Comic Zone Volume Lilo

hid in a clothes dryer which was changed to a commode with a cabinet and pizza box used as a door to avoid influencing children to hide in dryers The UK edit was later used for the film s Disney release and the Blu ray release br br br Reception br br br Box office br Lilo Stitch opened in second place earning million in its first weekend ranking narrowly below Tom Cruise s Minority Report During its second weekend it fell to third place behind Minority Report and Mr Deeds Despite the opening of Men in Black II the week after Lilo Stitch remained in third place br Meanwhile the film continued to draw in families while other major summer blockbusters like Spider Man and Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones were still in wide release Additionally it went on to compete against the Warner Bros live action animated hybrid film Scooby Doo The film earned million in the U S and Canada and million internationally totaling million worldwide br At the end of its theatrical run Lilo Stitch became the second highest grossing animated film of behind th Century Fox s Ice Age They were the only two animated films to approach the million mark that year Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over million tickets during its original run br br br Critical reaction br Lilo Stitch received critical acclaim Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film has an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The site s critics consensus reads Edgier than traditional Disney fare Lilo and Stitch explores issues of family while providing a fun and charming story Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film stars out of writing It s one of the most charming feature length cartoons of recent years funny sassy startling original and with six songs by Elvis It doesn t get sickeningly sweet at the end it has as much stuff in it for grown ups as for kids and it has a bright offbeat look to it Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote Looser and less obviously formulaic in its fresh approach to our hearts the brash film has an unleashed subversive sense of humor that s less corporate and more uninhibited than any non Pixar Disney film has been in time out of mind With its hand drawn characters and its use of watercolors for backgrounds the first time the studio s done that since the s this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema s most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable Richard Corliss of Time magazine felt the film is a bright engaging bauble with half a dozen Elvis Presley songs for Mom and Dad and just enough sass Stitch sticks his tongue into his nose and eats his snot to keep the tweeners giggling after a lag in the early sister scenes Lilo reveals its own very American verve and wit along with a smart story sense that marks the best animated features traditional or computerized br Claudia Puig of USA Today noted the colors are ultra vibrant and rich appropriate to the Hawaiian setting Best of all the movie has an endearingly cheeky attitude sometimes missing from more earnest Disney tales Witty touching and well paced Lilo Stitch is ideal family fare but little more Desson Howe of The Washington Post also praised the film s use of watercolors writing it is appealing It s easy rather than flashy on the eyes And there s some sort of relief in that in this world of hyper powerful computer generated imagery Owen Gleiberman reviewing for Entertainment Weekly argued the animation in Lilo Stitch has an engaging retro simple vivacity and it s nice to see a movie for tots make use of Elvis Presley but the story is witless and oddly defanged Stitch gets discovered by Lilo a temperamental Hawaiian girl who s the whiniest of whiny brats These two become friends in theory only There s so little connection between them that just about the only thing sustaining the movie is its vague E T outline br Todd McCarthy of Variety felt Sanders and DeBlois keep things moving briskly while commendably avoiding any special sentimental We Are a Village point making despite the obvious opportunity Character designs are familiar enough but backgrounds possess an unusual pastel quality that gives the film an inviting atmosphere all its own In contrast Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Gate felt Lilo Stitch was more appropriate for a television series writing the directors find themselves locked into the structure of a feature film They re forced to tell the story of Lilo and Stitch s relationship to give it shape and a sense of arrival Since this is a kid s movie the relationship can only head in the direction of schmaltz So the promising anarchy of the first or minutes is suppressed br Peter M Nichols states that through the character of Nani and her struggles the film appeals to older children better than such attempts by the studio to do so as The Emperor s New Groove Atlantis The Lost Empire and Treasure Planet br br br Soundtrack br br Lilo Stitch An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack is the soundtrack to Disney s animated feature Lilo Stitch It was released by Walt Disney Records on June on Audio CD and Compact Cassette br The
