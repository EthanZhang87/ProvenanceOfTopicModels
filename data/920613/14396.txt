The High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle HMMWV colloquial Humvee is a family of light four wheel drive military trucks and utility vehicles produced by AM General It has largely supplanted the roles previously performed by the original jeep and others such as the Vietnam War era M Jeep the M Gama Goat their M A and M ambulance versions the Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle and other light trucks Primarily used by the United States military it is also used by numerous other countries and organizations and even in civilian adaptations br The Humvee saw widespread use in the Gulf War of where it navigated the desert terrain this usage helped to inspire civilian Hummer versions The vehicle s original unarmored design was later seen to be inadequate and was found to be particularly vulnerable to improvised explosive devices in the Iraq War The U S hastily up armored select models and replaced front line units with the MRAP Under the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle JLTV program in the U S Army selected the Oshkosh L ATV to replace the vehicle in front line U S military service br br br History br br Since the World War II Willys MB reconnaissance truck was used for mass deployment and became known as the jeep the United States military had continued to rely heavily on jeeps as general utility vehicles and as a mass transport for soldiers in small groups Although the U S Army had let Ford redesign the jeep from the ground up during the s and the resulting M jeep incorporated significant innovations it firmly adhered to the original concept a very compact light enough to manhandle low profile vehicle with a folding windshield that a layman could barely distinguish from the preceding Willys jeeps The jeeps were shorter than a Volkswagen Beetle and weighed just over one metric ton seating three to four with an lb kg payload During and after the war the very light ton jeeps were complemented by the ton Dodge WC and Korean War Dodge M models br By the mid s the U S military felt a need to reevaluate their aging light vehicle fleet From the mid s the U S Army had tried to modernize through replacing the larger purpose built Dodge M s by militarized commercial off the shelf COTS trucks initially the M Jeep trucks succeeded in the later s by several CUCV adapted commercial pickup series but these did not satisfy newer requirements either What was wanted was a truly versatile light military truck that could replace multiple outdated vehicles When becoming aware of the U S Army s desire for a versatile new light weapons carrier reconnaissance vehicle as early as FMC Corporation started development on their XR prototype and offered it for testing in At least a dozen of these were built for testing under the High Mobility Combat Vehicle or HMCV program initially much more as an enhanced capability successor to the M jeep than as a general purpose vehicle br br The HMMWV program had its origins in the Combat Support Vehicle CSV program The XM CSV was a proposed platform for the TOW missile launcher Congress ended the program in due to the relatively small requirement of vehicles Adjusting to Congress s expectations the Army increased the scale of the program then called the XM High Mobility Weapons Carrier CSVP to replace multiple other trucks Congress interested in a larger joint services truck program removed the CSVP from the budget The Army restructured the program which was then called High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle br In the U S Army released draft specifications for the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle HMMWV which was to replace all U S Army tactical vehicles in the ton to ton range As well as select vehicles in the U S Marine Corps and U S Air Force Namely these were the M quarter ton jeeps M Gama Goats and the CUCVs as one uniform jack of all trades light tactical vehicle series to better perform the roles of the impractically mixed fleet of outdated existing vehicles The specifications called for a diesel engine excellent on and off road performance the ability to carry a large payload and improved survivability against indirect fire Compared to the jeep it was larger and had a much wider track with a in mm ground clearance double that of most sport utility vehicles The new truck was to climb a percent incline and traverse a percent slope and ford ft m of water and electronics waterproofed to drive through ft m of water were specified The radiator was to be mounted high sloping over the engine on a forward hinged hood br Out of companies that showed interest in the contract five companies submitted proposals before the deadline in April In July the Army awarded contracts to three companies AM General Chrysler Corporation and Teledyne Continental to build eleven HMMWV prototypes each The vehicles six weapon carriers and five utility vehicles were delivered by May br The Teledyne HMMWV was based on the rear engined XR Cheetah Chrysler s HMMWV was based on the Expanded Mobility Truck Chrysler Defense was sold mid competition to General Dynamics Land Systems The AM General HMMWV was developed as a private venture to meet the HMMWV requirement The first prototype a weapons carrier variant was completed in August and sent to the Nevada Automotive Test Center for testing AM General nicknamed the prototypes it delivered for the Army competition Hummer which AM General had the foresight to trademark br The vehicles underwent testing at Aberdeen Proving Ground Maryland and Yuma Arizona The vehicles were subjected to over miles in trials which included off road courses in desert and arctic conditions On March AM General was awarded the contract The vehicle s durability and light weight were factors that led to its selection AM General was awarded an initial contract for vehicles the first batch of a five year contract that would see vehicles delivered to the U S military including vehicles for the Army vehicles had been delivered to the U S and foreign customers by the Persian Gulf War of and had been delivered by the Humvee s th anniversary in Ft Lewis Washington and the nd Battalion th Infantry th Infantry Division was the testing unit to employ HMMWV in the new concept of a motorized division Yakima Training Center Washington was the main testing grounds for HMMWVs from through December when the motorized concept was abandoned and the division inactivated br In June a Pentagon report noted the vehicle s very low reliability averaging miles between failures br In August AM General was awarded a billion contract from the Army to produce HMMWVs br br br Use in combat br HMMWVs first saw combat in Operation Just Cause the U S invasion of Panama in The HMMWV was designed primarily for personnel and light cargo transport behind front lines not as a front line fighting vehicle Like the previous jeep the basic first generation HMMWV has no armor though armament carriers and hard shell ambulances did have modest ballistic protection or protection against chemical biological radiological or nuclear threats Nevertheless losses were relatively low in conventional operations such as the Gulf War Vehicles and crews suffered considerable damage and losses during the Battle of Mogadishu in because of the nature of urban engagement However the chassis survivability allowed the majority of those crews to return to safety though the HMMWV was never designed to offer protection against intense small arms fire much less machine guns and rocket propelled grenades With the rise of asymmetric warfare and low intensity conflicts the HMMWV was pressed into service in urban combat roles for which it was not originally intended br After Operation Restore Hope in Somalia the military recognized a need for a more protected HMMWV AM General developed the M an armored HMMWV to withstand small arms fire The M has been in production since seeing limited use in the Balkans before deployment to the Middle East This design is superior to the M with a larger more powerful turbocharged engine air conditioning and a strengthened suspension system More importantly it boasts a fully armored passenger area protected by hardened steel and bullet resistant glass With the increase in direct attacks and asymmetric warfare in Iraq AM General diverted the majority of its manufacturing power to producing these vehicles br Humvees were sent into Afghanistan following the September attacks where they proved invaluable during initial operations In the early years before IEDs became prevalent the vehicle was liked by troops for its ability to access rough mountainous terrain Some soldiers would remove features from Humvees including what little armor it had and sometimes even entire doors to make them lighter and more maneuverable for off road conditions and to increase visibility With the onset of the Iraq War Humvees proved very vulnerable to IEDs in the first four months of U S troops died in Humvees To increase protection the U S military hastily added armor kits to the vehicles Although this somewhat improved survivability bolting on armor made the Humvee an ungainly beast increasing weight and putting a strain on the chassis which led to unreliability Armored doors that weighed hundreds of pounds were difficult for troops to open and the newly armored turret made Humvees top heavy and increased the danger of rollovers The U S Marine Corps decided to start replacing Humvees in combat with Mine Resistant Ambush Protected MRAP vehicles in and the U S Army stated that the vehicle was no longer feasible for combat in However Humvees have also been used by Taliban insurgents for suicide bombings against the Afghan National Security Forces in the country br The HMMWV has become the vehicular backbone of U S forces around the world Over HMMWVs were employed by coalition forces during the Iraq War The Humvee has been described as a vehicle with the right capability for its era designed to provide payload mobility in protected safe areas However deploying the vehicle to conflict zones where it was exposed to a full spectrum of threat which it was neither designed to operate or be survivable in led to adding protection at the cost of mobility and payload br On April Pentagon Press Secretary John F Kirby described a package of military equipment being transported to Ukraine to assist in its war with Russia including armored Humvee vehicles An additional were promised on August and were delivered at an unknown date A number of Humvees were used in the assault on the Russian oblast of Belgorod on May Ukraine first received Humvees from the U S in and they were used by them in peacekeeping operations in Kosovo that same year br br br Modifications br br In December Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld came under criticism from U S troops and their families for not providing better equipped HMMWVs Rumsfeld pointed out that before the war armor kits were produced only in small numbers per year As the role of American forces in Iraq changed from fighting the Iraqi Army to suppressing the insurgency more armor kits were being manufactured though perhaps not as fast as production facilities were capable Even more advanced kits were also being developed While these kits are much more effective against all types of attacks they weigh from to lb to kg and have some of the same drawbacks as the improvised armor Unlike similar sized civilian cargo and tow trucks which typically have dual rear wheels to reduce sway the HMMWV has single rear wheels because of its independent rear suspension coupled with the body design br Most up armored HMMWVs hold up well against lateral attacks when the blast is distributed in all different directions but offer little protection from a mine blast below the truck such as buried IEDs and land mines Explosively formed penetrators EFPs can also defeat the armor kits causing casualties br br The armor kits fielded include the Armor Survivability Kit ASK FRAG FRAG as well as upgrade kits to the M The ASK was the first fielded in October adding about pounds kg to the weight of the vehicle Armor Holdings fielded an even lighter kit adding only pounds kg to the vehicle s weight The Marine Armor Kit MAK fielded in January offers more protection than the M but also increases weight The FRAG offered even more protection but was still inadequate to stop EFP attacks The FRAG kit is designed to do just that however its increased protection adds over lb kg the vehicle over the FRAG kit and the width is increased by feet cm The doors may also require a mechanical assist device to open and close br br Another drawback of the up armored HMMWVs occurs during an accident or attack when the heavily armored doors tend to jam shut trapping the troops inside As a result the U S Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center developed the Humvee Crew Extraction D ring in The D ring hooks on the door of the HMMWV so that another vehicle can rip the door off with a tow strap chain or cable to free the troops inside The D ring was later recognized as one of the top greatest Army inventions of In addition Vehicle Emergency Escape VEE windows developed by BAE Systems were fielded for use on the M up armored HMMWV with kits ordered br br The soldier manning the exposed crew served weapon on top of the vehicle is extremely vulnerable In response many HMMWVs have been fitted with basic gun shields or turrets as was the case with M APCs after they were first deployed in Vietnam The U S military is currently evaluating a new form of protection developed by BAE Systems as well as systems designed by the Army which are already in theater The new gunner s seat is protected by to feet to cm high steel plates with bullet proof glass windows Additionally some HMMWVs have been fitted with a remotely operated CROWS weapon station which slaves the machine gun to controls in the back seat so it can be fired without exposing the crew The Boomerang anti sniper system was also fielded by some HMMWVs in Iraq to immediately give troops the location of insurgents firing on them br Another weakness for the HMMWV has proven to be its size which limited its deployment in Afghanistan because it is too wide for the smallest roads and too large for many forms of air transport compared to jeeps or Land Rover sized vehicles which are respectively and inches narrower This size also limits the ability of the vehicle to be manhandled out of situations br br br Alternatives br The Army purchased a purpose built armored car the M Armored Security Vehicle also known as an armored personnel carrying vehicle APC in limited numbers for use by the United States Army Military Police Corps In the Marine Corps announced an intention to replace all HMMWVs in Iraq with MRAPs because of high loss rates and issued contracts for the purchase of several thousand of these vehicles which include the International MaxxPro the BAE OMC RG the BAE RG and Caiman and the Force Protection Cougar which were deployed primarily for mine clearing duties Heavier models of infantry mobility vehicles IMV can also be used for patrol vehicles The MaxxPro Line has been shown to have the highest rate of vehicle rollover accidents because of its very high center of gravity and immense weight br br br Replacement and future br br The Humvee replacement process undertaken by the U S military focused on interim replacement with MRAPs and long term replacement with the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle JLTV The HMMWV has evolved several times since its introduction and was used in tactical roles for which it was never originally intended The military pursued several initiatives to replace it both in the short and long terms The short term replacement efforts utilized commercial off the shelf vehicles as part of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected MRAP program These vehicles were procured to replace Humvees in combat theaters The long term replacement for the Humvee is the JLTV which is designed from the ground up The Future Tactical Truck System FTTS program was initiated to analyze potential requirements for a Humvee replacement Various prototype vehicles such as the MillenWorks Light Utility Vehicle and the ULTRA AP have been constructed as part of these efforts The JLTV contract was awarded to Oshkosh in August br The U S Marine Corps issued a request for proposals in for its Humvee sustainment modification initiative to upgrade expanded capacity vehicles ECVs The Marines plan to field the JLTV but do not have enough funding to completely replace all Humvees so they decided to continue sustaining their fleet Key areas of improvement include upgrades to the suspension to reduce the amount of force transferred to the chassis upgrading the engine and transmission for better fuel efficiency enhancements to the cooling system to prevent overheating a central tire inflation system to improve off road mobility and ride quality and increased underbody survivability Testing of upgraded Humvees was to occur in with production and installation occurring from through Older A series Humvees make up half the current fleet and are to be disposed of through foreign military sales and transfers By the Marines light tactical vehicle fleet is to consist of A series Humvees ECV Humvees and JLTVs with vehicles in total Humvees in service with the Marine Corps will be upgraded through The Marines shelved the Humvee modernization effort in March because of budget cuts br Several companies are offering modifications to maintain the remaining U S military Humvee fleets Oshkosh Corporation is offering Humvee upgrades to the Marine Corps in addition to its JLTV offering which are modular and scalable to provide varying levels of capabilities at a range of prices that can be provided individually or as complete packages Their approach is centered around the TAK independent suspension system which delivers greater offroad profile capability improved ride quality an increase in maximum speed greater whole vehicle durability and restored payload capacity and ground clearance Northrop Grumman developed a new chassis and power train for the Humvee that would combine the mobility and payload capabilities of original vehicle variants while maintaining the protection levels of up armored versions The cost to upgrade one Humvee with Northrop Grumman s features is Textron has offered another Humvee upgrade option called the Survivable Combat Tactical Vehicle SCTV that restores mobility and survivability over armored Humvee levels Although the SCTV costs more at per vehicle the company claims it can restore the Humvee for operational use combining Humvee level mobility and transportability with MRAP level underbody protection as a transitional solution until the JLTV is introduced in significant numbers br One suggested future role for the Humvee is as an autonomous unmanned ground vehicle UGV If converted to a UGV the vehicle could serve as a mobile scout vehicle with armor features removed to enhance mobility and terrain accessibility since there would be no occupants needing protection Because there will still be tens of thousands of Humvees in the U S inventory after the JLTV enters service it could be a low cost way to build an unmanned combat vehicle fleet Autonomy features would allow the Humvees to drive themselves and one soldier to control a swarm of several vehicles br Although the Army plans to buy JLTVs and the Marine Corps they are not a one for one replacement for the Humvee and both services will still be left operating large fleets For the Marines JLTVs will replace the Humvees in all active infantry battalions to cover its expeditionary forces The Marine JLTV order is planned to be completed by leaving the remainder of the Corps strong Humvee force scattered around support organizations while soft skinned Humvees will provide support behind the forward deployed Marine Expeditionary Unit The Army does not plan to replace Humvees in the Army National Guard and is considering options on how many of its vehicles will be replaced sustained or modernized Even if half of the force is replaced by JLTVs the entire planned order will not be complete until If upgrades are chosen for the remaining Humvees the cost would likely have to not exceed per vehicle The Humvee is expected to remain in U S military service until at least Ambulance variants of the Humvee will especially remain in active use as the JLTV could not be modified to serve as one due to weight issues br br br Design features br br The Humvee seats four people with an available fully enclosed aluminum cabin with a vertical windshield It has all wheel drive with an independent suspension and helical gear reduction hubs similar to portal axles which attach towards the top rather than the center of each wheel to allow the drivetrain shafts to be raised for in mm ground clearance The body is mounted on a narrow steel frame with boxed rails and five cross members for rigidity The rails act as sliders to protect the drivetrain which is nestled between and above the rails Raising the drivetrain into the cabin area and lowering the seats into the frame creates a chest high transmission hump which separates passengers on each side and lowers the overall center of gravity compared to most trucks where the body and passengers are above the frame br The Humvee uses V powertrains from General Motors Early iterations were issued with the liter Detroit Diesel V Later iterations were fitted with the larger and improved liter Detroit Diesel V Power output for the naturally aspirated version of this engine is hp kW PS and lb ft N m of torque while the turbocharged version produces hp kW PS and lb ft N m br The vehicle has double wishbone suspension with portal gear hubs on all wheels and inboard disc brakes The brake discs are not mounted at the wheels as on conventional cars but are inboard of the half shafts attached outboard of the differentials The front and rear differentials are Torsen type and the center differential is of the lockable type Torque biasing differentials allows forward movement as long as at least one wheel has traction It runs on specialized radial tires with low profile runflat devices Newer HMMWV versions can be equipped with a central tire inflation system CTIS kit in the field While it is optimized for off road mobility it can achieve mph km h at maximum weight with a top speed of mph km h br br HMMWVs are well suited for airmobile operations as they are transportable by C or larger combat transports droppable by parachute and can be sling loaded from helicopters though there are smaller vehicles such as the Growler which were designed to fit into smaller craft such as the V In combat conditions the HMMWV can be delivered by the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System which pulls the vehicle out of the open rear ramp just above the ground without the aircraft having to land br There are at least variants of the HMMWV in service with the U S military HMMWVs serve as cargo troop carriers automatic weapons platforms ambulances four litter patients or eight ambulatory patients M TOW missile carriers M howitzer prime movers M Avenger Pedestal Mounted Stinger platforms MRQ direct air support vehicles S shelter carriers and other roles The HMMWV is capable of fording ft cm normally or ft m with the deep water fording kits installed br br Optional equipment includes a winch maximum load capacity lb kg and supplemental armor The M M and M M armament carriers provide mounting and firing capabilities for the M Minigun the Mk grenade launcher the M heavy machine gun the GAU A B gatling gun the M G B machine gun and M SAW br The M up armored HMMWV introduced in also features a similar weapons mount In addition some M and M up armored and M Armored Security Vehicle models feature a Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station CROWS which allows the gunner to operate from inside the vehicle and or the Boomerang anti sniper detection system Recent improvements have also led to the development of the M model which quickly rendered the previous models obsolete By replacing the M M and earlier armored HMMWV types with a single model the U S Army hopes to lower maintenance costs br The latest iteration of the Humvee series can be seen in the M A and later up armored A versions It has a stronger suspension and larger liter turbo diesel engine to accommodate the weight of up to kg lb of additional armor The armor protection can be installed or taken off depending on the operating environment so the vehicles can move more efficiently without armor when there is no threat of attack There is some underbody armor that moderately protects against mines and roadside bombs Other improvements include Vehicle Emergency Escape VEE windows that can be quickly removed so troops inside can escape in the event of a rollover jammed door or the vehicle catching fire and a blast chimney that vents the force of a bomb blast upwards and away from the occupants The M A has a crew of four can carry lb kg of payload and can tow a lb kg load On roads it has a top speed of km h mph
