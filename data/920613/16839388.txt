score to reviews from mainstream critics gave the film an average score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br The original Cars was not greeted with exceptional warmth said The New York Times but the sequel generated Pixar s first truly negative response br Critics generally criticized the focus on Mater and felt the film lacked warmth and charm while also feeling the film was made as an exercise in target marketing and was too violent to be given a G rating Reviewing the film for The Wall Street Journal Joe Morgenstern wrote This frenzied sequel seldom gets beyond mediocrity Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman said Cars is a movie so stuffed with fun that it went right off the rails What on earth was the gifted director mogul John Lasseter thinking that he wanted kids to come out of this movie was sic more ADD Although Leonard Maltin on IndieWire claimed that he had such high regard for Pixar and its creative team led by John Lasseter he said he found the plot confusing and felt that Mater s voice was annoying saying that he d rather listen to chalk on a blackboard than spend nearly two hours with Tow Mater br Conversely Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film stars out of four and said that the sequel is a tire burning burst of action and fun with a beating heart under its hood He also praised its fluid script and called it a winner Roger Ebert was the most effusive of the more positive reviews praising Lasseter s channeling of childhood playtime for the film s spirit and writing At a time when some grown up action films are relentlessly shallow and stupid here is a movie with such complexity that even the cars sometimes have to pause and explain it to themselves Justin Chang of Variety commented The rare sequel that not only improves on but retroactively justifies its predecessor Ticket buyers also gave the film an A in exit polls on par with other Pixar titles br A central vein of many negative reviews was the theory that the Walt Disney Company forced Cars into production at Pixar out of greed in order to drive merchandising sales Lasseter vehemently denied these claims which he attributed to people who don t know the facts rushing to judge Some theorized that the vitriol was less about the film but more about Pixar s broadened focus to sequels The New York Times reported that although one negatively reviewed film would not be enough to scratch the studio the commentary did dent morale at the studio which until then had enjoyed an unbroken and perhaps unprecedented run of critical acclaim br br br Accolades br Cars marks the first Pixar film not to be nominated for an Oscar It is also the first Pixar film
