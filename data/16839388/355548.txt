Sherry Lynn br br br Production br br br Development br Following the critical and commercial success of The Lion King then Disney chairman and CEO Michael Eisner urged for more animal centric animated features He suggested a North American setting taking particular inspiration from an original landscape painting by Albert Bierstadt that he purchased For the characters the hero would be a bear the king of the forest At the time the original idea which was inspired by King Lear centered around an old blind bear who traveled the forest with his three daughters In veteran animator Aaron Blaise joined the project as director because he wanted to be attached so that he could animate bears and was soon joined by co director Robert Walker Because Blaise desired a more naturalistic story Blaise and producer Chuck Williams produced a two page treatment of a father son story in which the son is transformed into a bear and in the end remains a bear Thomas Schumacher then president of Walt Disney Feature Animation approved the revised story and proclaimed This is the idea of the century Tab Murphy who had co written the screenplays for The Hunchback of Notre Dame Tarzan and Atlantis The Lost Empire came on board to write an early draft of the script br After the project was green lit Blaise Walker and the story artists embarked on a research trip in August to visit Alaska where they traveled on the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes and Kodiak Island They also traveled through Denali National Park and the Kenai Fjords National Park where they visited Exit and Holgate Glacier A year later the production team took additional research trips through the Yellowstone National Park Grand Teton National Park and the Sequoia National Park Around the story evolved into a tale in which the transformed Kenai is taken in by an older bear Grizz who was to be voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan However Blaise explained that we were struggling with the story trying to get some charm into the film So we turned Grizz into a cub named Koda who was voiced by Jeremy Suarez Because Blaise Walker and Williams enjoyed Duncan s vocal performance Tug the de facto leader of the bears at the salmon run was written into the film br br br Casting br In March Joaquin Phoenix confirmed he was cast in the film exclaiming Oh but forget the Oscar nomination for Gladiator The real pinnacle is that I m playing an animated character in a Disney film Isn t that the greatest I play a Native American transformed into a bear It s called The Bears Don t call me a leading man I don t care about that I m a leading bear I am content After the filmmakers heard his audition tapes for Finding Nemo Jeremy Suarez was cast as Koda br As is typical for animation voice acting Suarez and Phoenix voiced their roles separately although they both did a recording session together at least two times Voicing the moose brothers Rutt and Tuke Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis performed simultaneously throughout the recording process Angayuqaq Oscar Kawagley an associate professor who taught courses on Alaska Native philosophy at the University of Alaska Fairbanks claimed he was never given a script but was instead given the dialogue that they had written which was being told by a Native person For his role as the Inuit Narrator Kawagley translated the dialogue in written form into Yup ik and faxed the translation back to the Disney studio He later recorded his translation at an Anchorage studio while being videotaped for animation reference br br br Design and animation br The film is traditionally animated but includes some CG elements such as a salmon run and a caribou stampede Layout artist Armand Serrano speaking about the drawing process on the film said that we had to do a life drawing session with live bear cubs and also outdoor drawing and painting sessions at Fort Wilderness in Florida three times a week for two months In Background supervisor Barry Kooser and his team traveled to Jackson Hole Wyoming and studied with Western landscape painter Scott Christensen where they learned to simplify objects by getting the spatial dimensions to work first and working in the detail later br According to Ruben Aquino supervising animator for the character of Denahi Denahi was originally meant to be Kenai s father later this was changed to Kenai s brother Byron Howard supervising animator for Kenai in bear form said that earlier in production a bear named Grizz who resembles Tug in the film and is voiced by the same actor was supposed to have the role of Kenai s mentor Art Director Robh Ruppel stated that the ending of the film originally showed how Kenai and Denahi get together once a year to play when the northern lights are in the sky br br br Music br br Following the success of the Tarzan soundtrack Phil Collins was offered the opportunity to compose songs for Brother Bear as well as let him co write the score However Collins explained Slowly the bad news started to trickle down that I wouldn t be singing it all It was a bit of a disappointment because I usually write songs that I sing myself While Collins composed six songs for the film he shared vocal performance duties with Tina Turner who sang the opening song the Blind Boys Of Alabama and the Bulgarian Women s Choir who performed the song Transformation Collins s lyrics for the song were first translated into I upiaq The performance was then arranged by score co composers Collins and Mark Mancina and vocal arranger Eddie Jobson br br br Release br Brother Bear was originally slated for a spring release while Home on the Range was scheduled for a release However Disney announced that Brother Bear would be released in fall while Home on the Range was pushed back for a spring

the film would be released on Saturday November br On October Brother Bear premiered at the New Amsterdam Theatre where fellow attendees included New York Governor George Pataki and cast members

score of based on reviews indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br On the syndicated television show At the Movies film critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper both gave the film positive reviews In his print review for the Chicago Sun Times Ebert wrote the film doesn t have the zowie factor of The Lion King or Finding Nemo but is sweet rather than exciting Children and their parents are likely to relate on completely different levels the adults connecting with the transfer of souls from man to beast while the kids are excited by the adventure stuff USA Today film critic Claudia Puig gave the film three out of four stars praising the film for its message of tolerance and respect for nature rings loud and clear And family audiences are treated to a vibrantly hued movie with appealing characters Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a playful movie that celebrates nature and the spirit world with striking imagery and a smooth blend of drama and comedy br Writing for Variety Todd McCarthy summarized that Brother Bear is a very mild animated entry from Disney with a distinctly recycled feel because the film s characters and narrative simply fail to engage strong interest and tale is probably too resolutely serious to enchant small fry in the way the better Disney titles always have Kenneth Turan reviewing for the Los Angeles Times complimented the richness and fluidity of its visuals and the satisfying ending but derided that Brother Bear has an appeal that can t be denied Too often however this film s lack of a fresh dramatic approach and not its technique makes it difficult to embrace as much as we d like to Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt the film was too similar to The Lion King He later wrote This opulent movie with gorgeous rainbow animation is heavy on message but light on humor br Many critics and audiences also noted the use of the film s aspect ratio as a storytelling device The film begins at a standard widescreen aspect ratio of similar to the ratio common in U S cinema or the ratio of HDTV while Kenai is a human in addition the film s art direction and color scheme are grounded in realism After Kenai transforms into a bear twenty four minutes into the picture the film itself transforms as well to an anamorphic aspect ratio of and towards brighter more fanciful colors and slightly more caricatured art direction Brother Bear was the first feature since The Horse Whisperer to do a widescreen shift It was the only animated film to feature this technique until The Simpsons Movie and Enchanted in br br br Box office br In its limited release Brother Bear played only in two selected theaters in Los Angeles California and

Disney Channel The Simpsons veteran Pete Michels was to helm the series and was allowed to watch a copy of the film so that he could construct a pilot The series would have taken place directly after the events of the film and would have seen Kenai and Koda adopt other orphaned animals into their family Jeremy Suarez Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas were to reprise their respective roles while Will Friedle would have replaced Joaquin Phoenix as Kenai While the pilot tested well it was not picked up as Disney Channel executives felt that adapting the film as a series was counterproductive to their goal of trying to reach a tween audience combined with the fact that the movie performed below expectations br br br Sequel br A direct to video sequel called Brother Bear was released on August
