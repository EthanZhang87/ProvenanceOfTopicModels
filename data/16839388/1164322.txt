A tow truck also called a wrecker a breakdown truck recovery vehicle or a breakdown lorry is a truck used to move disabled improperly parked impounded or otherwise indisposed motor vehicles This may involve recovering a vehicle damaged in an accident returning one to a drivable surface in a mishap or inclement weather or towing or transporting one via flatbed to a repair shop or other location br A tow truck is distinct from a car carrier trailer which is used to move multiple new or used vehicles simultaneously in routine transport operations br br br History br br Ferdinand Porsche of Austro Daimler developed an artillery tractor for the Austro Hungarian army in the M One of the batch was constructed as a recovery vehicle for the others with a large winch on the rear platform br The wrecker with lifting jib was invented in by Ernest Holmes Sr of Chattanooga Tennessee a garage worker who was inspired after he needed blocks ropes and six men to pull a car out of a creek After improving his design he began manufacturing them commercially The International Towing and Recovery Hall of Fame and Museum in his home town displays restored antique wreckers tools equipment and pictorial histories of motor vehicle towing a type of work that Holmes originated br br br Types of towing equipment br Five general types of tow truck are in common usage usually based on the type or size of vehicle to be towed br br Boom uses an adjustable boom with a winch to recover vehicles from a ditch over an embankment or any place the vehicle cannot be safely reached by backing up Some booms are fixed some use heavy pivoting A frames others are equipped with hydraulic powered telescopic cylinders The heaviest types of boom can rotate effectively turning the tow truck into a sort of mobile crane called a rotator and are usually reserved for incidents involving heavy vehicles In the past boom trucks used a hook and chain system where chains are looped around the vehicle frame or axle then lifted by a boom winch A towbar with heavy rubberized mats connects the truck and vehicle so it can be towed on its other axle Slings and belt lifts are a further development with rubber straps replacing part of the chains Slings are not used much today because they can scratch the bumpers of cars However they are sometimes used for towing vehicles that have been in an accident or have one or two of the front or rear wheels missing or for pickup trucks and other vehicles that have steel bumpers Cars equipped with all wheel drive cannot be towed with a sling as it can cause problems with the car s drivetrain br Wheel lift also called a spectacle lift or underlift developed from the hook and chain technology to produce a large metal yoke that can be fitted under the front or rear wheels to cradle them drawing the front or rear end of the vehicle clear of the ground by a pneumatic or hydraulic hoist so it can be towed This apparatus generally picks up the drive wheels of the vehicle i e the front wheels if it is front wheel drive the rear wheels if it is rear wheel drive touching only the tires The wheel lift was designed by Arthur W Nelson of Weld Built Body Co in The name spectacle lift is common in the UK the cradle resembles a pair of squared spectacles eyeglasses Medium and heavy trucks use a variation the underlift or chassis lift which lifts the axle or frame instead of the wheels Wheel lift trucks can have adapters which can also lift the chassis br Integrated also called a self loader snatcher quick pick or repo truck boom and wheel lift integrated into one unit Used in light duty trucks to repossess vehicles or move illegally parked vehicles Most have controls for the apparatus inside the cab of the tow truck to make quick pickup possible without the inconvenience of exiting the truck to hook up the vehicle Though similar to a wheel lift truck an integrated truck differs in that the end of its boom features movable arms that can more easily and quickly clamp onto the wheels of a vehicle often controlled from the cabin of the truck On a wheel lift truck the wheels of a vehicle must be manually secured to the yoke by the operator before being lifted There are also heavy duty trucks manufactured with integrated lifts br Flatbed also called a rollback slide or tilt tray the entire back of the truck is fitted with a bed that can be hydraulically inclined and slid back to ground level allowing the vehicle to be placed on it under its own power or pulled on by a winch Because they carry rather than tow the vehicle they can be used on a completely immobile vehicle in the US they are used to carry badly damaged cars from crashes br Lift flatbed a boom uses a wheel lift frame to lift the vehicle vertically and load it on the bed This type of truck can remove vehicles that are parallel parked It is commonly used in Europe br br These are the most common arrangements others also exist such as flatbed units that offer a wheel lift boom trucks that can recover but not tow and wheel lift units that offer a combination boom with sling br There are also several sizes and weight categories of tow truck The lightest models are usually based on light truck and van chassis offering boom and tow weights of around to short tons metric tons making them ideal for car towing Medium duty tow trucks have a boom capacity of to short tons metric tons Heavy duty tow trucks based on chassis used by semi trucks with multiple axles and the ability to tow fully loaded semi truck and trailer combinations have a boom capacity from to short tons metric tons Rotators are the heaviest type of tow truck ranging from to short tons metric tons though lighter models do exist and often come with many other features per customer specification br Most flatbed type vehicles are based on medium duty and heavy duty trucks to provide the chassis strength necessary to carry entire vehicles br br br Operations br br Tow trucks are usually operated by private businesses except for major highways and toll roads where the road authority may operate the tow trucks for that stretch of road Some police departments own tow trucks in the US however it is common to contract police tows to private companies Businesses who operate a large fleet of vehicles such as school bus companies or package delivery services often own one or several tow trucks for the purposes of towing their own vehicles Government departments with large fleets such as the police departments fire departments transportation authorities and departments of public works of major cities may similarly own one or more tow trucks Police department tow trucks may also be used to impound other vehicles Heavy tow trucks are often called to clear semi truck accidents and straighten out jackknifed trucks In rural or unorganized areas companies which operate tow trucks can sometimes also offer additional services appropriate to highway clearance where government provided ones are unavailable such as fire suppression br The military also deploys tow trucks for recovery of stranded vehicles In the US Army a variant of the HEMTT truck is used for this purpose the M wrecker For recovery in combat situations while under fire many armies with large vehicle fleets also deploy armoured recovery vehicles These vehicles fulfill a similar role but are resistant to heavy fire and capable of traversing rough terrain with their tracks as well as towing vehicles beyond the weight limits of wheeled wreckers such as tanks many are based on tank designs for this reason br Each state and territory of Australia has its own regulations and acts for the operation of tow trucks Tow trucks are generally divided into two categories either by standard trade and private towing or accident towing Accident towing tow trucks are clearly identifiable by number plates ending in either ATT or TT Tow trucks that are not endorsed for accident towing may use general number plates of any combination pursuant to each state s own registering system An example of a statute regulating the operation of tow trucks and towing companies in Victoria is the Victorian Accident Towing Services Act br Some jurisdictions may allow Tow Trucks to be considered as emergency vehicles and use sirens with the State of Missouri being a notable example br br br See
