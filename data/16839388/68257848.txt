takes heavy influence from pulp magazines popular fiction from the first half of the th century that was printed on inexpensive wood pulp papers in addition to science fiction works such as Journey to the Center of the Earth Fantastic Voyage and King Kong He also said he loved reading the old issues of pulps growing up They were big adventures in which a group of explorers might discover a hidden world or ancient creatures They ve been a huge inspiration for Strange World br The miracle plant Pando is named after a forest in Utah in America The land of Avalonia was given a warm nostalgic color scheme to contrast with the titular strange world inside the creature for which the filmmakers avoided earth tones and leaned into reds and magentas They also created a way for the character Splat to

the release of a teaser trailer Petrana Radulovic for Polygon felt it was an homage to retro sci fi flicks and similar to Raya and the Last Dragon it definitely seems to lean more into the action than Disney s typical musical fantasies A new trailer was shown at the D Expo and the official trailer was released on September followed by a cast reaction video a day later Lex Briscuso of Film says it honestly looks like a breath of fresh air when it comes to animated family stories A special look trailer was released on October Rafael Motamayor of Film said Though the upbeat song and the focus on laughs kind of sells this as a more formulaic Disney film in terms of tone the prominent use of monsters and big action hopefully makes this more of an inventive film from the studio Two featurettes

Devotion as well as the wide expansions of The Fabelmans and Bones and All and was initially projected to gross million from theaters over its five day opening weekend The film made million on its

than initial re adjustments making million in its opening weekend a five day total of million Overall it ranked in second place at the box office behind Disney s own Black Panther Wakanda Forever Several publications labeled the film a box office bomb with The Hollywood Reporter saying was the worst opening for a Disney Animation Thanksgiving title in modern times and Variety calling it a catastrophic result for Disney The poor box office opening was attributed to poor word of mouth large budget overall the lack of movie theater attendance the expectation of its streaming release on Disney as the result of COVID pandemic rocky company politics conservative backlash over inclusion of gay characters mediocre critical reviews a vague and unremarkable premise and lackluster marketing compared to other Disney animated films Some analysts believe that then Disney CEO Bob Chapek s decision to send three films produced by Pixar Soul Luca and Turning Red straight to Disney so that

Strange World was the first film from Walt Disney Animation to earn lower than A and is considered the lowest CinemaScore rating of all Disney animated films since br Peter Debruge of Variety wrote it s the characters as much as the environment that make this vibrant Journey to the Center of the Earth style adventure movie colorful and diverse in all the best ways Great as the people and places they explore may be however the relatively unimaginative story consigns this gorgeous toon to second tier status instead of cracking the pantheon of Disney classics Lovia Gyarke of The Hollywood Reporter praised the visuals writing it was meticulously and wondrously rendered by the Strange World animators who drew much of their inspiration from pulp magazines of the s and s There s a painterly feel to the landscape which combined with the film s sci fi bent might trigger memories of Disney s Treasure Planet Tracy Brown of the Los Angeles Times also praised the visuals as vibrant weird visually stunning From its lush palette to its cute and deadly flora and fauna this strange mysterious world is very much deserving of its status as the film s title character br Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times wrote while the film is not in the same category as Frozen Zootopia and Encanto it s a family friendly fun fest with the expected ingredients of fast paced action ingenious visuals terrific voice performances and yes some heaping spoonfuls of upbeat messaging about family ties the importance of being true to oneself and how we should all take great measures to take care of not only each other but the world in which we live no matter how STRANGE that world might be Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film three stars out of four stating Strange World is an enjoyable piece of vibrant world building that steps away from the musical bent of recent non Pixar efforts like Encanto and the Frozen flicks Odie Henderson of The Boston Globe praised the film s environmental and father son messages as well as the excellent voice over work plus the score by Henry Jackman make the preachiness palatable and the film fun The look of Avalonia s underworld is a lovely distraction its garish and bright pinks reds and greens look lifted from the colored roofs of a suburban New Jersey neighborhood in the s br For The Washington Post Kristen Page Kirby found the story is too basic and the characters too slight for Strange World to pack a punch The visual beauty of the film isn t enough After all pretty is as pretty does and in Strange World pretty doesn t do much Jacob Stoller of Paste Magazine admitted that while the film can be arresting especially with its inventive setting and bulbous creatures and its attempts at deconstructing the sweaty macho man ethos hawked by its inspiration are admirable But with muddled themes and slight characters remnants of the old dime magazines coordinate to bring Strange World down on the wrong side of familiar Cath Clarke of The Guardian felt the characters aren t half bad but the clunky script feels like it s been re drafted and re drafted to the point of incomprehension blowing any chance of conveying a message However well meaning it makes for a surprisingly dull watch br br br Accolades br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Official website br Strange World at IMDb
