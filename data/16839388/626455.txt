id: 626455
Alternative fuels also known as non conventional and advanced fuels are fuels derived from sources other than petroleum Alternative fuels include gaseous fossil fuels like propane natural gas methane and ammonia biofuels like biodiesel bioalcohol and refuse derived fuel and other renewable fuels like hydrogen and electricity br These fuels are intended to substitute for more carbon intensive energy sources like gasoline and diesel in transportation and can help to contribute to decarbonization and reductions in pollution Alternative fuel is also shown to reduce non carbon emissions such as the release of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide as well as sulfur dioxide and other harmful gases in the exhaust This is especially important in industries such as mining where toxic gases can accumulate more easily br br br Official definitions br br br Definition in the European Union br In the European Union alternative fuel is defined by Directive EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure br br alternative fuels means fuels or power sources which serve at least partly as a substitute for fossil oil sources in the energy supply to transport and which have the potential to contribute to its decarbonisation and enhance the environmental performance of the transport sector They include inter alia br electricity br hydrogen br biofuels as defined in point i of Article of Directive EC br synthetic and paraffinic fuels br natural gas including biomethane in gaseous form compressed natural gas CNG and liquefied form liquefied natural gas LNG and br liquefied petroleum gas LPG br br br Definition in the US br In the US the EPA defines alternative fuel as br br Alternative fuel including gaseous fuels such as hydrogen natural gas and propane alcohols such as ethanol methanol and butanol vegetable and waste derived oils and electricity These fuels may be used in a dedicated system that burns a single fuel or in a mixed system with other fuels including traditional gasoline or diesel such as in hybrid electric or flexible fuel vehicles br br br Definition in Canada br In Canada since Alternative Fuels Regulations SOR Alternative Fuels Act defined alternative fuel br br For the purposes of the definition alternative fuel in subsection of the Act the following when used as the sole source of direct propulsion energy of a motor vehicle are prescribed to be alternative fuels br a ethanol br b methanol br c propane gas br d natural gas br e hydrogen br f electricity br g for the purposes of subsections and of the Act any blended fuel that contains at least per cent of one of the fuels referred to in paragraphs a to e and br h for the purposes of subsections and of the Act any blended fuel that contains one of the fuels mentioned in paragraphs a to e br br br China br In China alternative fuel vehicles should comply with technical guidelines for the local production of alternative fuel vehicles they should have a shelf life of more than kilometres mi and a complete charge should take less than seven hours Up to of a charge must be available after less than minutes of charging In addition pure electric vehicles must consume electric energy of less than kWh km br br br Biofuel br br Biofuels are also considered a renewable source Although renewable energy is used mostly to generate electricity it is often assumed that some form of renewable energy or a percentage is used to create alternative fuels br Research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops Using the current yields vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage br br br Biomass br br Biomass in the energy production industry is living and recently dead biological material which can be used as fuel or for industrial production It has become popular among coal power stations which switch from coal to biomass in order to convert to renewable energy generation without wasting existing generating plant and infrastructure Biomass most often refers to plants or plant based materials that are not used for food or feed and are specifically called nitrocellulose biomass As an energy source biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel br br br Algae fuel br br Algae based biofuels have been promoted in the media as a potential panacea to crude oil based transportation problems Algae could yield more than gallons of fuel per acre per year of production Algae based fuels are being successfully tested by the U S Navy Algae based plastics show potential to reduce waste and the cost per pound of algae plastic is expected to be cheaper than traditional plastic prices br br br Biodiesel br br Biodiesel is made from animal fats or vegetable oils renewable resources that come from plants such as atrophy soybean sunflowers corn olive peanut palm coconut safflower canola sesame cottonseed etc Once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol diesel is produced from this chemical reaction These raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions or used alone Despite one s mixture preference biodiesel will release a smaller number of pollutants carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons than conventional diesel because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently Even with regular diesel s reduced quantity of sulfur from the LSD ultra low sulfur diesel invention biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur free br br br Alcohol fuels br br Methanol and ethanol fuel are primary sources of energy they are convenient fuels for storing and transporting energy These alcohols can be used in internal combustion engines as alternative fuels Butane has another advantage it is the only alcohol based motor fuel that can be transported readily by existing petroleum product pipeline networks instead of only by tanker trucks and railroad cars br br br Ammonia br Ammonia NH can be used as fuel Benefits of ammonia for ships include reducing greenhouse gas emissions Nitrogen reduction is being considered as a possible component for fuel cells and combustion engines through research of conversion of ammonia to nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas br Ammonia is the simplest molecule that carries hydrogen in a liquid form It is carbon free and can be produced using renewable energy Ammonia can become a transitional fuel soon because of its relative easiness of storage and distribution br br br Emulsion fuel br Emulsified fuels include multiple components that are mixed to a water in oil emulsion which are created to improve the fuels combustive properties Diesel can also be emulsified with water to be used as a fuel It helps in improving engine efficiency and reducing exhaust emissions br br br Carbon neutral and negative fuels br Carbon neutral fuel is synthetic fuel such as methane gasoline diesel fuel or jet fuel produced from renewable or nuclear energy used to hydrogenate waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue exhaust gas or derived from carbolic acid in seawater Such fuels are potentially carbon neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases To the extent that carbon neutral fuels displace fossil fuels or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbolic acid and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation Such carbon neutral and negative fuels can be produced by the electrolysis of water to make hydrogen used in the Sabatier reaction to produce methane which may then be stored to be burned later in power plants as synthetic natural gas transported by pipeline truck or tanker ship or be used in gas to liquids processes such as the Fischer Tropsch process to make traditional transportation or heating fuels br br Carbon neutral fuels have been proposed for distributed storage for renewable energy minimizing problems of wind and solar intermittent and enabling transmission of wind water and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines Such renewable fuels could alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles Germany has built a kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to megawatts Audi has constructed a carbon neutral liquefied natural gas LNG plant in Werlte Germany The plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset LNG used in their A Sportback g tron automobiles and can keep metric tons of CO out of the environment per year at its initial capacity Other commercial developments are taking place in Columbia South Carolina Camarillo California and Darlington England br The least expensive source of carbon for recycling into fuel is flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion where it can be extracted for about US per ton Automobile exhaust gas capture has also been proposed to be economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting Since carbonic acid in seawater is in chemical equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied Researchers have estimated that carbon extraction from seawater would cost about per ton Carbon capture from ambient air is more costly at between and per ton and is considered impractical for fuel synthesis or carbon sequestration br Nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day Therefore the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative Off peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the U S averaged cents per kilowatt hour in but only cents kWh during the least expensive six hours of the day Typically wholesale electricity costs to cents kWh during the day Commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce fuel for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than per barrel The U S Navy estimates that shipboard production of jet fuel from nuclear power would cost about per gallon While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue Moreover since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about per gallon shipboard production is already much less expensive However U S civilian nuclear power is considerably more expensive than wind power The Navy s estimate that megawatts can produce gallons of fuel per day indicates that terrestrial production from wind power would cost less than per gallon br br br Hydrogen and formic acid br br Hydrogen is an emissionless fuel The byproduct of hydrogen burning is water although some mono nitrogen oxides NOx are produced when hydrogen is burned with air br br Another fuel is formic acid The fuel is used by converting it first to hydrogen and using that in a fuel cell Formic acid is much more easy to store than hydrogen br br br Hydrogen compressed natural gas mixture br br HCNG or H CNG is a mixture of compressed natural gas and percent hydrogen by energy br Hydrogen could also be used as hydroxy gas for better combustion characteristics of compression ignition engines Hydroxy gas is obtained through electrolysis of water br br br Compressed air br The air engine is an emission free piston engine using compressed air as fuel br br br Propane autogas br br Propane is a cleaner burning high performance fuel derived from multiple sources It is known by many names including propane LPG liquified propane gas LPA liquid propane autogas Autogas and others Propane is a hydrocarbon fuel and is a member of the natural gas family br Propane as an automotive fuel shares many of the physical attributes of gasoline while reducing tailpipe emissions and well to wheel emissions overall Propane is the number one alternative fuel in the world and offers an abundance of supply liquid storage at low pressure an excellent safety record and large cost savings when compared to traditional fuels br Propane delivers an octane rating between and depending on the composition of the butane propane ratios of the mixture Propane autogas in a liquid injection format captures the phase change from liquid to gas state within the cylinder of the combustion engine producing an intercooler effect reducing the cylinder temperature and increasing air density The resultant effect allows more advance on the ignition cycle and a more efficient engine combustion br Propane lacks additives detergents or other chemical enhancements further reducing the exhaust output from the tailpipe The cleaner combustion also has fewer particulate emissions lower NOx due to the complete combustion of the gas within the cylinder higher exhaust temperatures increasing the efficiency of the catalyst and deposits less acid and carbon inside the engine which extends the useful life of the lubricating oil br Propane autogas is generated at the well alongside other natural gas and oil products It is also a by product of the refining processes which further increase the supply of Propane to the market br Propane is stored and transported in a liquid state at roughly bar psi of pressure Fueling vehicles are similar to gasoline in the speed of delivery with modern fueling equipment Propane filling stations only require a pump to transfer vehicle fuel and do not require expensive and slow compression systems when compared to compressed natural gas which is usually kept at over psi bar br In a vehicle format propane autogas can be retrofitted to almost any engine and provide fuel cost savings and lowered emissions while being more efficient as an overall system due to the large pre existing propane fueling infrastructure that does not require compressors and the resultant waste of other alternative fuels in well to wheel lifecycles br br br Compressed natural gas br Compressed natural gas CNG and liquefied natural gas LNG are two cleaner combustible alternatives to conventional liquid automobile fuels br br br Compressed natural gas fuel types br CNG vehicles can use both renewable CNG and non renewable CNG br Conventional CNG is a fossil fuel New technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to economically access unconventional gas resources appear to have increased the supply of natural gas in a fundamental way br Renewable natural gas or biogas is a methane based gas with similar properties to natural gas that can be used as transportation fuel Present sources of biogas are mainly landfills sewage and animal agri waste Based on the process type biogas can be divided into the following biogas produced by anaerobic digestion landfill gas collected from landfills treated to remove trace contaminants and synthetic natural gas SNG br br br Practicality br CNG powers more than million vehicles worldwide and just over of these are in the U S American usage is growing at a dramatic rate br br br Environmental analysis br Because natural gas emits less smog forming pollutants than other fossil fuels when combusted cleaner air has been measured in urban localities switching to natural gas vehicles Tailpipe CO can be reduced by compared to gasoline diesel The greatest reductions occur in medium and heavy duty light duty and refuse truck segments br CO reductions of up to are possible by using biogas br Natural gas and hydrogen are both lighter than air and can be mixed together br br br Nuclear power and radiothermal generators br br br Nuclear reactors br Nuclear power is any nuclear technology designed to extract usable energy from atomic nuclei via controlled nuclear reactions Currently the only controlled method uses nuclear fission in a fissile fuel with a small fraction of the power coming from subsequent radioactive decay Use of nuclear fusion for controlled power generation is not yet practical but is an active area of research br Nuclear power generally requires a nuclear reactor to heat a working fluid such as water which is then used to create steam pressure which is converted into mechanical work for the purpose of generating electricity or propulsion in water Today more than of the world s electricity comes from nuclear power and over nuclear powered naval vessels have been built br In theory electricity from nuclear reactors could also be used for propulsion in space but this has yet to be demonstrated in a space flight Some smaller reactors such as the TOPAZ nuclear reactor are built to minimize moving parts and use methods that convert nuclear energy to electricity more directly making them useful for space missions but this electricity has historically been used for other purposes Power from nuclear fission has been used in a number of spacecraft all of them uncrewed The Soviets up to orbited nuclear reactors in RORSAT military radar satellites where electric power generated was used to power a radar unit that located ships on the Earth s oceans The U S also orbited one experimental nuclear reactor in in the SNAP A mission br br br Thorium fuelled nuclear reactors br Thorium based nuclear power reactors have also become an area of active research in recent years It is being backed by many scientists and researchers and Professor James Hansen the former Director at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies has reportedly said After studying climate change for over four decades it s clear to me that the world is heading for a climate catastrophe unless we develop adequate energy sources to replace fossil fuels Safer cleaner and cheaper nuclear power can replace coal and is desperately needed as an essential part of the solution Thorium is times more abundant within nature than uranium and its ore monazite is commonly found in sands along bodies of water Thorium has also gained interest because it could be easier to obtain than uranium While uranium mines are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners thorium is taken from open pits Monazite is present in countries such as Australia the United States and India in quantities large enough to power the earth for thousands of years As an alternative to uranium fuelled nuclear reactors thorium has been proven to add to proliferation produces radioactive waste for deep geological repositories like technetium half life over years and has a longer fuel cycle br For a list of experimental and presently operating thorium fueled reactors see Thorium fuel cycle List of thorium fueled reactors br br br Radiothermal generators br In addition radioisotopes have been used as alternative fuels on both lands and in space Their use on land is declining due to the danger of theft of isotope and environmental damage if the unit is opened The decay of radioisotopes generates both heat and electricity in many space probes particularly probes to outer planets where sunlight is weak and low temperatures is a problem Radiothermal generators RTGs which use radioisotopes as fuels do not sustain a nuclear chain reaction but rather generate electricity from the decay of a radioisotope br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br Alternative Fuels Data Center U S DOE br
