will become a real boy When Jiminy reveals himself the Blue Fairy assigns him to be Pinocchio s conscience Geppetto awakens upon hearing the commotion from Pinocchio falling and is overjoyed to discover that he is alive and will become a real boy br The next morning while walking to school Pinocchio is led astray by con artist fox Honest John and his sidekick Gideon the Cat Honest John convinces him to join Stromboli s puppet show despite Jiminy s protestations Pinocchio becomes Stromboli s star attraction but when he tries to go home Stromboli locks him in a bird cage and leaves to tour the world with Pinocchio After Jiminy unsuccessfully tries to free his friend the Blue Fairy appears and an anxious Pinocchio lies about what happened causing his nose to grow The Blue Fairy

naughty boys for him to take to Pleasure Island a notorious and infamous place Honest John despite the legal risks and the Coachman s implication of what happens to the boys persuades Pinocchio to take a vacation on Pleasure Island On the way to the island Pinocchio befriends Lampwick a delinquent boy At Pleasure Island without rules or authority to enforce their activity Pinocchio Lampwick and many other boys soon engage in vices such as vandalism fighting smoking and drinking Jiminy eventually finds Pinocchio in a bar smoking and playing pool with Lampwick and the two have a falling out

Geppetto had sailed to Pleasure Island in search of Pinocchio He was swallowed by a gigantic and vicious sperm whale called Monstro and is now trapped in its belly Determined to rescue his father Pinocchio jumps into the Mediterranean Sea with Jiminy and is soon swallowed by Monstro where he reunites with Geppetto Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze and allow them to escape but the whale chases them and destroys their raft with his tail Pinocchio selflessly pulls Geppetto to safety in a cove just as Monstro crashes into it and Pinocchio is killed br Back at home Geppetto

In September during the production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs animator Norman Ferguson brought a translated version of Carlo Collodi s Italian children s novel The Adventures of Pinocchio to the attention of Walt Disney After reading the book Walt was busting his guts with enthusiasm as Ferguson later recalled Disney then commissioned storyboard artist Bianca Majolie to write a new story outline for the book but after reading it he felt her outline was too faithful Pinocchio was intended to be the studio s third feature after Bambi However due to difficulties with Bambi adapting the story and animating the animals realistically Disney announced that Bambi would be postponed while Pinocchio would move ahead in production Ben Sharpsteen was then re assigned to supervise the production while Jack Kinney was given directional reins br br br Writing and design br Unlike Snow White which was a short story that the writers could expand and experiment with Pinocchio was based on a novel with a very fixed although episodic story Therefore the story went through drastic changes before reaching its final incarnation In the original novel Pinocchio is a cold rude ungrateful inhuman brat that often repels sympathy and only learns his lessons the hard way The writers decided to modernize the character and depict him similar to Edgar Bergen s dummy Charlie McCarthy but equally as rambunctious as the puppet in the book The story was still being developed in the early stages of animation br br Early scenes animated by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston show that Pinocchio s design was exactly like a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose a peaked cap and bare wooden hands Disney however was not impressed with the work that was being done on the film He felt that no one could really sympathize with such a character and called for an immediate halt in production Fred Moore redesigned the character slightly to make him more appealing but the design still retained a wooden feel br Young and upcoming animator Milt Kahl felt that Thomas Johnston and Moore were rather obsessed with the idea of this boy being a wooden puppet and felt that they should forget that he was a puppet and get a cute little boy you can always draw the wooden joints and make him a wooden puppet afterwards Co supervising director Hamilton Luske suggested to Kahl that he should demonstrate his beliefs by animating a test sequence br Kahl then showed Disney an animation test scene in which Pinocchio is underwater looking for his father From this scene Kahl re envisioned the character by making him look more like a real boy with a child s Tyrolean hat and standard cartoon character four fingered or three and a thumb hands with Mickey Mouse type gloves The only parts of Pinocchio that still looked more or less like a puppet were his arms legs and little button wooden nose Disney embraced Kahl s scene and immediately urged the writers to evolve Pinocchio into a more innocent na ve somewhat coy personality reflecting Kahl s design br However Disney discovered that the new Pinocchio was too helpless and was far too often led astray by deceiving characters Therefore in the summer of Disney and his story team established the character of the cricket Originally the talking cricket was only a minor character whom Pinocchio abruptly killed by squashing with a mallet and who later returned as a ghost Disney dubbed the cricket Jiminy and made him a character who would try to guide Pinocchio into the right decisions Once the character was expanded he was depicted as a realistic cricket with toothed legs and waving antennae but Disney wanted something more likable Ward Kimball had spent several months animating two sequences a soup eating musical number and a bed building sequence in Snow White which was cut from the film due to pacing reasons Kimball was about to quit when Disney rewarded him for his work by promoting him to the supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket Kimball then conjured up the design for Jiminy Cricket whom he described as a little man with an egg head and no ears Jiminy was a cricket because we called him a cricket Kimball later joked br br br Casting br br Due to the huge success of Snow White Walt Disney wanted more famous voices for Pinocchio which marked the first time an animated film had used celebrities as voice actors He cast popular singer Cliff Edwards also known as Ukulele Ike as Jiminy Cricket Disney rejected the idea of having an adult play Pinocchio and insisted that the character be voiced by a real child He cast year old child actor Dickie Jones who had previously been in Frank Capra s Mr Smith Goes to Washington He also cast Frankie Darro as Lampwick Walter Catlett as Honest John Foulfellow the Fox Evelyn Venable as the Blue Fairy Charles Judels as both the villainous Stromboli and the Coachman and Christian Rub as Geppetto whose design was even a caricature of Rub Another actor voiced Geppetto originally but Disney recast him with Rub after feeling that his voice was too harsh br Another voice actor recruited was Mel Blanc best remembered for voicing many of the characters in Warner Bros cartoon shorts including Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies Blanc recorded the voice of Gideon the Cat in sixteen days However it was eventually decided that Gideon would be mute so all of Blanc s recorded dialogue was subsequently deleted except for a solitary hiccup which was heard three times in the finished film br br br Animation br br Animation on the film began in January but work on Pinocchio s animation was discontinued as the writers sought to re work his characterization and the film s narrative structure However animation on the film s supporting characters started in April Animation would not resume again with the revised story until September br During the production of the film story artist Joe Grant formed a character model department which would be responsible for building three dimensional clay models of the characters in the film known as maquettes These models were then given to the staff to observe how a character should be drawn from any given angle desired by the artists The model makers also built working models of Geppetto s elaborate cuckoo clocks designed by Albert Hurter as well as Stromboli s gypsy wagon and wooden cage and the Coachman s carriage However owing to the difficulty of animating a realistic moving vehicle the artists filmed the carriage maquettes on a miniature set using stop motion animation Then each frame of the animation was transferred onto animation cels using an early version of a Xerox The cels were then painted on the back and overlaid on top of background images with the cels of the characters to create the completed shot on the rostrum camera Like Snow White live action footage was shot for Pinocchio with the actors playing the scenes in pantomime supervised by Luske Rather than tracing which would result in stiff unnatural movement the animators used the footage as a guide for animation by studying human movement and then incorporating some poses into the animation though slightly exaggerated br Pinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation led by Joshua Meador In contrast to the character animators who concentrate on the acting of the characters effects animators create everything that moves other than the characters vehicles machinery and natural effects such as rain lightning snow smoke shadows and water as well as the fantasy or science fiction type effects like the pixie dust of Peter Pan The influential abstract animator Oskar Fischinger who mainly worked on Fantasia contributed to the effects animation of the Blue Fairy s wand Effects animator Sandy Strother kept a diary about his year long animation of the water effects which included splashes ripples bubbles waves and the illusion of being underwater To help give depth to the ocean the animators put more detail into the waves on the water surface in the foreground and put in less detail as the surface moved further back After the animation was traced onto cels the assistant animators would trace it once more with blue and black pencil leads to give the waves a sculptured look To save time and money the splashes were kept impressionistic These techniques enabled Pinocchio to be one of the first animated films to have highly realistic effects animation Ollie Johnston called it one of the finest things the studio s ever done as Frank Thomas said The water looks so real a person can drown in it and they do br br br Music br br The songs in Pinocchio were composed by Leigh Harline with lyrics by Ned Washington Harline and Paul J Smith composed the incidental music score The climactic Whale Chase was co composed by Edward H Plumb The soundtrack was first released on February Jiminy Cricket s song When You Wish Upon A Star became a major hit and is still identified with the film and later as the theme song of The Walt Disney Company itself The soundtrack won an Academy Award for Best Original Score br br br Themes br br M Keith Booker considers the film to be the most down to earth of the Disney animated films despite its theme song and magic and notes that the film s protagonist has to work to prove his worth which he remarked seemed more in line with the ethos of capitalism than most of the Disney films Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid Walsh believe that the male protagonists of films like Pinocchio and Bambi were purposefully constructed by Disney to appeal to both boys and girls Mark I Pinsky said that it is a simple morality tale cautionary and schematic ideal for moral instruction save for some of its darker moments and noted that the film is a favorite of parents of young children br Nicolas Sammond argues that the film is an apt metaphor for the metaphysics of midcentury American child rearing and that the film is ultimately an assimilationist fable He considered it to be the central Disney film and the most strongly middle class intended to relay the message that indulging in the pleasures of the working class of vaudeville or of pool halls and amusement parks led to a life as a beast of burden For Sammond the purpose of Pinocchio is to help convey to children the middle class virtues of deferred gratification self denial thrift and perseverance naturalized as the experience of the most average American br Author and illustrator Maurice Sendak who saw the film in theaters in called the film superior to Collodi s novel in its depiction of children and growing up The Pinocchio in the film is not the unruly sulking vicious devious albeit still charming marionette that Collodi created Neither is he an innately evil doomed to calamity child of sin He is rather both lovable and loved Therein lies Disney s triumph His Pinocchio is a mischievous innocent and very naive little wooden boy What makes our anxiety over his fate endurable is a reassuring sense that Pinocchio is loved for himself and not for what he should or shouldn t be Disney has corrected a terrible wrong Pinocchio he says is good his badness is only a matter of inexperience and also that Pinocchio s wish to be a real boy remains the film s underlying theme but becoming a real boy now signifies the wish to grow up not the wish to be good br Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson has spoken about the film in his lectures extensively citing it as an example of the manner in which great mythological and archetypal themes inform and permeate narrative br br br Home media br On July it was released on VHS Betamax CED and LaserDisc in North America for the first time as part of the Walt Disney Classics label the second title with the Classics label after Robin Hood which was released the previous December It would become the best selling home video title of the year selling units at each It

Times gave the film five out of five stars saying Pinocchio is here at last is every bit as fine as we had prayed it would be if not finer and that it is as gay and clever and delightful a fantasy as any well behaved youngster or jaded oldster could hope to see Time magazine gave the film a positive review stating In craftsmanship and delicacy of drawing and coloring in the articulation of its dozens of characters in the greater variety and depth of its photographic effects it tops the high standard Snow White set The charm humor and loving care with which it treats its inanimate characters puts it in a class by itself br Variety praised the animation as superior to Snow White s writing the a nimation is so smooth that cartoon figures carry impression of real persons and settings rather than drawings to onlooker In summary they felt Pinocchio will stand on its own as a substantial piece of entertainment for young and old providing attention through its perfection in animation and photographic effects The Hollywood Reporter wrote Pinocchio is entertainment for every one of every age so completely charming and delightful that there is profound regret when it reaches the final fade out Since comparisons will be inevitable it may as well be said at once that from a technical standpoint conception and production this picture is infinitely superior to Snow White br br br Box office br At first Pinocchio was not a box office success The box office returns from the film s initial release were both below Snow White s unprecedented success and below studio expectations Of the film s million negative cost twice the cost of Snow White Disney only recouped million by late with studio reports of the film s final original box office take varying between million and million Animation historian Michael Barrier notes that Pinocchio returned rentals of less than one million by September and in its first public annual report Walt Disney Productions charged off a million loss to the film Barrier relays that a Pinocchio balance sheet listed total receipts to the studio of million This was primarily due to the fact that World War II and its aftermath had cut off the European

Distribution division The re issue was digitally restored by cleaning and removing scratches from the original negatives one frame at a time eliminating soundtrack distortions and revitalizing the
