Production br br br Development br During The Walt Disney Company s earnings call in November CEO Bob Iger announced that a new series set in the universe of Monsters Inc was in development for their planned streaming service Disney The series is produced by Disney Television Animation Longtime Disney Television producer Bobs Gannaway served as showrunner for the first season He was asked to work on the series after development began due to his experience on both TV animation and films having directed the spin off of Pixar s Cars franchise Planes Fire Rescue br During the D Expo Gannaway and producer Ferrell Barron revealed that employees from Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar were also involved in the production to create a series that Barron described as unique and special Monsters Inc filmmakers including director and Pixar s chief creative officer Pete Docter provided the team with both used and unused concept art from the film with the unused concept art being recycled for the series Gannaway stated that the creative leaders at Pixar were very supportive of the show and additionally stated they were also very much like Go out and create new characters and have fun So it wasn t by any means any kind of policing situation It was go have fun in the world with your new characters br In February Stephen J Anderson revealed that he would serve as one of the directors on the series Anderson joined the series eight months before Disney Television Animation was temporarily closed due to the COVID pandemic after being approached personally by Gannaway he ultimately did not direct any of the episodes In early Billy Crystal revealed that production had slightly slowed down due to the COVID pandemic but that it should be released later that year br In September cast member Henry Winkler indicated that a second season was in development The second season was officially announced at Annecy International Animation Film Festival with Kevin Deters and Stevie Wermers the Prep Landing shorts Olaf s Frozen Adventure replacing Gannaway and Anderson as showrunner and supervising director respectively br br br Writing br According to Anderson Pixar assisted the producers on the series by providing notes during its writing and early storyboarding process in order to keep them on track as far as the legacy of the project He also said that the series would differ from the films by further exploring different areas of Monsters Inc and that the series would further explore the transition in the company from screams to laughs seen at the end of the first film Anderson also said that the series would feature an overarching story but certain episodes would focus more on character development than the overall arc br The series expands the role of the female characters in the original film with receptionist Celia Mae being promoted to Laugh Floor supervisor in order to move a female character up into a leadership role as well as featuring trainer Ms Flint s reaction to the transition from scares to laughter The series also features a new character named Roze who is Roz s twin sister as the producers felt that due to the latter being revealed as the head of the Child Detection Agency at the end of the first film she wouldn t be back outside the laugh floor In addition Bob Peterson story supervisor on Monsters Inc serves as a creative consultant for the first season br According to Gannaway it took the producers almost a year to conceive the series premise He also compared Tylor s struggles with the transition with the current world status due to the COVID pandemic feeling that both the character and the audiences had the universe throw them a curveball which he felt made Tylor a more relatable character by having flaws the audience could connect with Gannaway also said he wanted the series to have the sort of feel of a Pixar story by making the audience care about Tylor and his personal journey br Gannaway was originally not going to include the characters of Smitty and Needleman out of respect for their voice actor Dan Gerson who died in However he eventually incorporated them into the series when he felt Gerson would want the characters to continue Gannaway paid an homage to Gerson by including a Gerson Industries logo in the trash cans the duo push br In order to get a sense of what it was like working in a factory the production team visited two power plants and interviewed the workers about their day Gannaway stated You want to tether everything to truth You can t make a movie about a power plant if you haven t walked one otherwise you re just making stuff up br br br Casting and recording br John Goodman and Billy Crystal reprise their roles for the series alongside John Ratzenberger Jennifer Tilly and Bob Peterson with the new cast including Ben Feldman Kelly Marie Tran Henry Winkler Lucas Neff Alanna Ubach Stephen Stanton and Aisha Tyler In February Anderson
