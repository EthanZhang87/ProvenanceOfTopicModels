The Pixar Image Computer is a graphics computer originally developed by the Graphics Group the computer division of Lucasfilm which was later renamed Pixar Aimed at commercial and scientific high end visualization markets such as medicine geophysics and meteorology the original machine was advanced for its time but sold poorly br br br History br br br Creation br When George Lucas recruited people from NYIT in to start their Computer Division the group was set to develop digital optical printing digital audio digital non linear editing and computer graphics Computer graphics quality was just not good enough due to technological limitations at the time The team then decided to solve the problem by starting a hardware project building what they would call the Pixar Image Computer a machine with more computational power that was able to produce images with higher resolution br br br Availability br About three months after their acquisition by Steve Jobs on February the computer became commercially available for the first time and was aimed at commercial and scientific high end visualization markets such as medical imaging geophysics and meteorology The machine sold for but also required a workstation from Sun Microsystems or Silicon Graphics in total equivalent to in The original machine was well ahead of its time and generated many single sales for labs and research However the system did not sell in quantity br In Pixar redesigned the machine to create the P II second generation machine which sold for In an attempt to gain a foothold in the medical market Pixar donated ten machines to leading hospitals and sent marketing people to doctors conventions However this had little effect on sales despite the machine s ability to render CAT scan data in D to show perfect images of the human body Pixar did get a contract with the manufacturer of CAT Scanners which sold machines By Pixar had only sold Pixar Image Computers br In Pixar began the development of the PII a nine slot version of the low cost P II This machine was coupled with a very early RAID model a high performance bus a hardware image decompression card processors called Chaps or channel processors very large memory cards VME sized card full of memory high resolutions video cards with bit DACs which were programmable for a variety of frame rates and resolutions and finally an overlay board which ran NeWS as well as the slot chassis A full up system was quite expensive as the GiB RAID was alone At this time in history most file systems could only address GiB of disk This system was aimed at high end government imaging applications which were done by dedicated systems produced by the aerospace industry and which cost a million dollars a seat The PII and the associated software became the prototype of the next generation of commercial low cost workstations br br br Demise and legacy br In the Pixar Image Computer was defining the state of the art in commercial image processing Despite this the government decided that the per seat cost was still too high for mass deployment and to wait for the next generation systems to achieve cost reductions This decision was the catalyst for Pixar to lay off its hardware engineers and sell the imaging business There were no high volume buyers in any industry Fewer than Pixar Image Computers were ever sold br br It was built to be part of a pipeline but as we developed it we realized we were competing with Moore s law with CPU and we probably couldn t get far enough ahead of it to justify it so we actually stopped the hardware effort br The Pixar computer business was sold to Vicom Systems in for Vicom Systems filed for Chapter within a year afterwards br Many of the lessons learned from the Pixar Image Computer made it into the Low Cost Workstation LCWS and Commercial Analyst Workstation CAWS program guidelines in the early and mid s The government mass deployment that drove the PII development occurred in the late s in a program called Integrated Exploitation Capability IEC br br br Design br The P II could have two Channel Processors or Chaps The chassis could hold cards The PII could hold cards Chaps video processors Off Screen Memory OSM cards and an Overlay Board for the NeWS windowing system NeWS was extended to control the image pipeline for roaming image comparison and stereo image viewing br Each Chap is a way parallel RGBA image computer This was a SIMD architecture which was good for imagery and video applications It processed four image channels in parallel one for red one for green one for blue and one for the alpha channel whose inventors have connections to Pixar Images were stored with bits per color channel or bits per pixel The bit data represented an unusual for today fixed point format that ranged from to using bits for the integer portion meaning the range from to had bit accuracy br A Unix host machine was generally needed to operate it to provide a keyboard and mouse for user input The system could communicate image data externally over an M per second Yapbus or a M per second multibus to other hosts data sources or disks and had a performance measured equivalent to VUPS or times the speed of a VAX br br br Use br br In the early s the Pixar Computer was used for medical imaging including MRI and CT scans at Georgetown University and mammography at University of California br Walt Disney Feature Animation whose parent company later purchased Pixar in used dozens of the Pixar Image Computers for their Computer Animation Production System CAPS and was using them in production up through Pocahontas in br br br br br br External links br Pixar Image Computer on Flickr
