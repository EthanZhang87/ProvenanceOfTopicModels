The Wii WEE is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo It was released on November in North America and in December for most other regions of the world It is Nintendo s fifth major home game console following the GameCube and is a seventh generation console alongside Microsoft s Xbox and Sony s PlayStation br In developing the Wii Nintendo president Satoru Iwata directed the company to avoid competing with Microsoft and Sony on computational graphics and power and instead to target a broader demographic of players through novel gameplay Game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda led the console s development under the codename Revolution The primary controller for the Wii is the Wii Remote a wireless controller with both motion sensing and traditional controls which can be used as a pointing device towards the television screen or for gesture recognition The Wii was Nintendo s first home console to directly support Internet connectivity supporting both online games and for digital distribution of games and media applications through the Wii Shop Channel The Wii also supports wireless connectivity with the Nintendo DS handheld console for selected games Initial Wii models included full backward compatibility support for GameCube games and most accessories Later in its lifecycle two lower cost Wii models were produced a revised model with the same design as the original Wii but removed the GameCube compatibility features and the Wii Mini a compact budget redesign of the Wii which further removed features including online connectivity and SD card storage br Because of Nintendo s reduced focus on computational power the Wii and its games were less expensive to produce than its competitors The Wii was extremely popular at launch causing the system to be in short supply in some markets A bundled game Wii Sports was considered the killer app for the console other flagship games included entries in the Super Mario Legend of Zelda Pok mon and Metroid series Within a year of launch the Wii became the best selling seventh generation console and by had surpassed over million units sold Total lifetime sales of the Wii had reached over million units making it Nintendo s best selling home console until it was surpassed by the Nintendo Switch in As of the Wii is the fifth best selling home console of all time br The Wii repositioned Nintendo as a key player in the video game console marketplace The introduction of motion controlled games via the Wii Remote led both Microsoft and Sony to develop their own competing products the Kinect and PlayStation Move respectively Nintendo found that while the Wii had broadened the demographics that they wanted the core gamer audience had shunned the Wii The Wii s successor the Wii U sought to recapture the core gamer market with additional features atop the Wii The Wii U was released in and Nintendo continued to sell both units through the following year The Wii was formally discontinued in October though Nintendo continued to produce and market the Wii Mini through and offered a subset of the Wii s online services through br br br History br br br Development br br Shortly after the release of the GameCube Nintendo began conceptualizing their next console The company s game designer Shigeru Miyamoto said that in the early stages they decided they would not aim to compete on hardware power and would instead prioritize new gameplay concepts The console was firstly named GameCube Next as a placeholder The price of the new console was originally envisioned to be as low as euros but the NAND flash memory desired by Satoru Iwata would force that price to slightly more than the double br Miyamoto cited Dance Dance Revolution s unique game controllers as inspiration for developing new input devices Later in September Nintendo began working with Gyration Inc a firm that had developed several patents related to motion detection to prototype future controllers using their licensed patents br Over the next two years sales of the GameCube languished behind its competitors Sony s PlayStation and Microsoft s Xbox Satoru Iwata who had been promoted to Nintendo s president in May following Hiroshi Yamauchi s retirement recognized that Nintendo had not been keeping up with trends in the video game industry such as adapting to online gaming He also thought that video gaming had become too exclusive and wanted Nintendo to pursue gaming hardware and software that would appeal to all demographics Nintendo s market analysis found that their focus on novel hardware had created consoles that made it difficult for third party developers to create games for hampering their position One of the first major steps Iwata had made based on the company s research was directing the development of the Nintendo DS a handheld incorporating dual screens including a touchscreen to revitalize their handheld console line br In Iwata met with Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda to discuss their market research Iwata instructed Takeda to go off the tech roadmap for this console but said it had to be appealing to mothers Iwata wanted their next console to be capable of playing past Nintendo games eliminating clutter in houses Takeda led the team building the console s hardware components and Miyamoto spearheaded the development of a new type of controller based on Gyration s motion sensing technology Iwata had proposed that this new console use motion sensing to simplify the gaming interface increasing appeal to all audiences An initial prototype was completed within six months br The Nintendo DS was said to have influenced the Wii s design as the company found that the DS s novel two screen interface had drawn in non traditional players and wanted to replicate that on the new console Designer Ken ichiro Ashida noted We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii We thought about copying the DS s touch panel interface and even came up with a prototype The idea was eventually rejected because of the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical Miyamoto also stated if the DS had flopped we might have taken the Wii back to the drawing board br br br Announcements br Prior to E Iwata had referred to Nintendo s upcoming console offering as the GameCube Next GCNext or GCN Iwata first unveiled some details of Nintendo s new home console at E under the codename Revolution as Iwata believed the console would revolutionize the gaming industry BBC News technology editor Alfred Hermida wrote that Nintendo s struggle to match Sony and Microsoft in the home console market made success crucial br The console still named Revolution was formally presented to the public at E The motion controller interface had not yet been completed and was omitted from the unveiling Iwata held the console above him with one hand to emphasize its size relative to its rivals A smaller device meant it would draw on less power as to not overheat and thus appealed to parents who were willing to have an attractive small power efficient device in the living room Iwata reportedly used a stack of three DVD cases as a size guide The prototype held by Iwata was black but at release the following year the console was only available in white In their book on the console two Loyola University Chicago professors suggested that Nintendo was inviting comparisons with Apple s first iPod line br Iwata later unveiled and demonstrated their current prototype of the Revolution controller at the Tokyo Game Show in September At this stage the controller unit resembled the final Wii Remote device along with the separate Nunchuk attachment Iwata demonstrated its motion sensing gameplay capabilities and incorporated commentary from developers such as Hideo Kojima and Yuji Horii who had tested the controller and believed people would be drawn in by it br br The console s name was formally announced as the Wii in April a month prior to E Nintendo s spelling of Wii with two lower case i characters was intended to represent both two people standing side by side and the Wii Remote and its Nunchuk In the company s announcement they stated Wii sounds like we which emphasizes that the console is for everyone Wii can easily be remembered by people around the world no matter what language they speak No confusion br The name resulted in criticism and mockery Forbes expressed a fear that the console would be seen as juvenile BBC News reported the day after the name was announced that a long list of puerile jokes based on the name had appeared on the Internet Some video game developers and members of the press stated that they preferred Revolution over Wii Nintendo of America s Vice President of Corporate Affairs Perrin Kaplan defended the choice President of Nintendo of America Reggie Fils Aim justified the new name over Revolution by saying that they wanted something short distinctive and easily pronounceable for all cultures br The Wii was made available for a press demonstration at E Planned launch titles were announced at a press conference alongside the unveiling At the same conference Nintendo confirmed its plans to release the console by the end of br br br Launch br br Nintendo announced the launch plans and prices for the Wii in September The console was first launched in the United States on November for US Other regional release dates and prices included Japan on December for followed by Australasia on December for A and was later launched on December in the United Kingdom for and for the majority of Europe for Nintendo planned to have around Wii games available by the end of and anticipated shipping over million consoles before the end of the year br As part of its launch campaign Nintendo promoted the Wii in North America through a series of television advertisements directed by Academy Award winner Stephen Gaghan its Internet ads used the slogans Wii would like to play and Experience a new way to play The ads began in November and had a budget of over million for the year The ads targeted a wider demographic compared to ads for other consoles inviting parents and grandparents to play on the Wii Nintendo hoped that its console would appeal to a wider demographic than that of others in the seventh generation In December Satoru Iwata said that Nintendo did not think of themselves as fighting Sony but were focused on how they could expand the gaming demographic br It took several years for the Wii to launch in other regions It was released in South Korea on April Taiwan on July and Hong Kong on December Nintendo had planned work with its localization partner iQue to release the Wii in China in but failed to meet the requirements to circumvent the ban on foreign made consoles the Chinese government had put in place br br br Successor and discontinuation br br Nintendo announced the successor to the Wii the Wii U at E Nintendo had recognized that the Wii had generally been shunned by the core gaming audience as it was perceived more as a casual gaming experience The Wii U was aimed to draw the core audience back in with more advanced features atop the basic Wii technology The Wii U features the Wii U GamePad a controller with an embedded touchscreen and output p high definition graphics that serves as a secondary screen alongside the television The Wii U is fully backward compatible with Wii games and peripherals for the Wii including the Wii Remote Nunchuk controller and Wii Balance Board and select Wii U games including support for these devices The Wii U was first released on November in North America November in Europe and Australia and December in Japan br Nintendo continued to sell the revised Wii model and the Wii Mini alongside the Wii U during the Wii U s first release year During Nintendo began to sunset certain Wii online functions as they pushed consumers towards the Wii U as a replacement system or towards the offline Wii Mini though the Wii Shop Channel remained available Nintendo discontinued production of the Wii in October after selling over million units worldwide though the company continued to produce the Wii Mini unit primarily for the North American market The WiiConnect service and several channels based on that service were shuttered in June Support for online multiplayer games via the Nintendo Wi Fi Connection were discontinued in May while the Wii Shop was closed in January effectively ending all online services for the console The Wii Mini continued to be manufactured and sold until br Despite the Wii s discontinuation some developers continued to produce Wii games well beyond Ubisoft released Just Dance games for the Wii up to Just Dance Vblank Entertainment s Shakedown Hawaii along with Retro City Rampage DX are the most recent Wii games which were released on July more than years after the Wii s launch On January Nintendo announced that it will no longer repair any faulty Wii consoles in Japan starting on February due to a scarcity of spare parts br br br Hardware br br br Console br br In building the Wii Nintendo did not aim to outpace the performance of their competitors Unlike the company s previous consoles they built the Wii from commercial off the shelf hardware rather than seek out customized components This helped to reduce the cost of the Wii system to consumers Miyamoto said Originally I wanted a machine that would cost My idea was to spend nothing on the console technology so all the money could be spent on improving the interface and software br The console s central processing unit is a bit IBM PowerPC based processor named Broadway with a clock frequency of MHz The reduced size of Broadway based on a nm process compared to the nm process used in the GameCube s CPU resulted in lowered power consumption The Wii s GPU is a system on a chip produced by ATI and named Hollywood the core processor runs at MHz MB of texture memory digital signal processors and input output functions Additionally the GPU included an additional MB of T SRAM and an additional MB of T SRAM on the motherboard totaling to MB of memory for the console The Wii s computational power was roughly to times as powerful as the GameCube but was the least powerful of the major home consoles of its generation br The Wii s motherboard has a WiFi adapter which supports IEEE b g modes and a Bluetooth antenna that communicates with its controllers A USB based LAN adapter can connect the Wii to a wired Ethernet network br The Wii reads games from an optical media drive located in the front of the device The drive is capable of reading Nintendo s proprietary discs the cm Wii discs and cm GameCube discs but cannot read other common optical media namely DVD Video DVD Audio or compact discs Although Nintendo had planned on incorporating this feature into later revisions of the Wii the demand for the console meant a delay in their schedule until the feature lost interest The slot of the optical drive is backed by LED lights which show the system s status For example it will pulse blue when the system is communicating with the WiiConnect service or when reading a disc after being inserted br The Wii includes MB of internal flash memory for storing saved games and downloaded content from the Wii channels Users could expand their storage for downloaded games and saved games as well as provide photos and music that could be used with some games and Wii channels through SD cards and later SDHC cards inserted into an external slot on the console located under a front panel A later system update added the ability to launch Wii channels and play Virtual Console and WiiWare games directly from SD cards br The rear of the console features the unit s video output and power connections along with two USB ports The top of the console when placed vertically includes a panel that includes four ports for GameCube controllers and two GameCube memory cards br The Wii was Nintendo s smallest home console at the time the current smallest is hybrid home portable console Nintendo Switch when in portable mode it measures mm in wide mm in tall and mm in deep in its vertical orientation slightly larger than three DVD cases stacked together The included stand measures mm in wide mm in tall and mm in deep The system weighs kg lb making it the lightest of the three major seventh generation consoles The Wii may stand horizontally or vertically br br br Wii Remote br br The Wii Remote is the primary controller for the console The remote contains a MEMS based three dimension accelerometer along with infrared detection sensors located at the far end of the controller The accelerometers allow the Wii Remote to recognize its orientation after being moved from a resting position translating that motion into gesture recognition for a game For example the pack in game Wii Sports includes a ten pin bowling game that had the player hold the Wii Remote and perform a delivery of a ball the Wii Remote could account for the player s position relative to the Sensor Bar and their arm and wrist rotation to apply speed and spin to the virtual ball s delivery on screen The infrared detectors are used to track emissions from LEDs in the included Sensor Bar which is placed just above or below the television display as to track the relative orientation of the Wii Remote towards the screen This gives the Wii Remote the ability to act as a pointing device like a computer mouse on the television screen with an approximate feet m range for accurate detection In addition the Wii Remote features traditional controller inputs including a directional pad d pad three face action buttons and a shoulder trigger and four system related buttons include a power switch The Wii Remote connects to the Wii through Bluetooth with an approximate feet m range communicating the sensor and control information to the console unit The Wii Remote includes an internal speaker and a rumble pack that can be triggered by a game to provide feedback directly to the player s hand Up to four Wii Remotes could connect wirelessly to a Wii with LED lights on each remote indicating which controller number the Remote had connected as The remote is battery operated and when the Remote is not powered on these LED lights can display the remaining battery power br A wrist mounted strap is included with the Wii Remote with one end affixed to the bottom of the unit Nintendo strongly encouraged players to use the strap in case the Wii Remote accidentally slipped out of their hands Nintendo recalled the original straps in December and provided a free stronger strap as a replacement as well as packaging the new strap in future bundles after the company faced legal challenges from users that reported damage to their homes from the Wii Remote slipping from their hands while playing In October Nintendo also added a silicon based Wii Remote Jacket to shipments of the Wii and Wii Remote as well as a free offering for existing users The Jacket wraps around the bulk of the remote but leaves access to the various buttons and connectors providing a stickier surface in the user s grip to further reduce the chance of the Remote falling out of the player s hand br Accessories can be connected to a Wii Remote through a proprietary port at the base of the controller The Wii shipped with the bundled Nunchuk a handheld unit with an accelerometer analog stick and two trigger buttons which connected to this port on the Wii Remote via a feet m cable Players hold both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in separate hands to control supported games br The Wii MotionPlus accessory plugs into the port at the base of the Wii Remote and augments the existing sensors with gyroscopes to allow for finer motion detection The MotionPlus accessory was released in June with a number of new games directly supporting this new functionality including Wii Sports Resort which included the accessory as part of a bundle The MotionPlus functionality was later incorporated into a revision of the controller called the Wii Remote Plus first released in October br A number of third party controller manufacturers developed their own lower cost versions of the Wii Remote though these generally were less accurate or lacked the sensitivity that Nintendo s unit had br br br Other controllers and accessories br br The Classic Controller is an extension for the Wii Remote released alongside the Wii in November Its form factor is similar to classic gamepads such as that for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System with a d pad four face buttons Start and Select buttons alongside the Wii connection button and two shoulder buttons Players can use it with older games from the Virtual Console in addition to games designed for the Wii In Nintendo released the Wii Classic Controller Pro which was modelled after the GameCube s form factor and included two analog sticks br The Wii Balance Board was released alongside Wii Fit in December It is a wireless balance board accessory for the Wii with multiple pressure sensors used to measure the user s center of balance Wii Fit offers a number of different exercise modes which monitored the player s position on the board as well as exercise gamification as to encourage players to exercise daily In addition to use in Nintendo s Wii Fit Plus that expanded the range of exercises using the Wii Balance Board the accessory can be used in other third party games that translated the player s balance on the unit into in game controls such as Shaun White Snowboarding and Skate It Namco Bandai produced a mat controller a simpler less sophisticated competitor to the Balance Board br One of Iwata s initiatives at Nintendo was focused on quality of life products those that encouraged players to do other activities beyond simply sitting and playing video games as to promote physical wellbeing The use of motion controls in the Wii served part of this but Nintendo developed additional accessories to give awareness of one s health as a lead in for the company to break into the health care field At E Nintendo had presented a Vitality Sensor accessory that would be used to measure a player s pulse as a lead in to a larger quality of life initiative but this product was never released In a Q A Satoru Iwata revealed that the Vitality Sensor had been shelved as internal testing found that the device did not work with all users and its use cases were too narrow Despite this Nintendo has continued Iwata s quality of life program with further products on later consoles and games br A number of first and third party accessories were developed that the Wii Remote could be slotted into and then used in a more physical manner that took advantage of the accelerometer and gyroscopic functions of the controller Some copies of Mario Kart Wii shipped with the Wii Wheel a plastic steering wheel frame with the Wii Remote could be inserted into so that players could steer more effectively in game Rhythm games that used plastic instruments such as Guitar Hero III shipped with instruments that the Wii Remote could be slotted into the remote powered the various buttons on the controller and relayed that to the Wii br br br Variants and bundles br The Wii launch bundle included the console a stand to allow the console to be placed vertically a plastic stabilizer for the main stand one Wii Remote a Nunchuk attachment for the Remote a Sensor Bar and a removable stand for the bar to mount on a television set an external power adapter and two AA batteries for the Wii Remote The bundle included a composite A V cable with RCA connectors and in appropriate regions such as in Europe a SCART adapter was also included A copy of the game Wii Sports was included in most regional bundles br Although Nintendo showed the console and the Wii Remote in white black silver lime green and red before it was released it was only available in white for its first two and a half years of sales Black consoles were available in Japan in August in Europe in November and in North America in May A red Wii system bundle was available in Japan on November commemorating the th anniversary of Super Mario Bros The European version of the limited edition red Wii bundle was released on October which includes the original Donkey Kong game pre installed onto the console New Super Mario Bros Wii and Wii Sports The red Wii bundle was released in North America on November with New Super Mario Bros Wii and Wii Sports All of the red Wii system bundles feature the Wii Remote Plus with integrated Wii MotionPlus technology br br br Revisions br The prefix for the numbering scheme of the Wii system and its parts and accessories is RVL for its codename Revolution The base Wii console had a model number of RVL for example br br br Redesigned model br br A cost reduced variant of the Wii model RVL was released late into the platform s lifespan that removed all GameCube functionality including the GameCube controller ports and memory card slots found on the original model This model is sometimes referred to as the Wii Family Edition the name given to the bundle in which it was first sold in Europe Additionally it does not include a stand as it is intended to be positioned horizontally Nintendo announced the new revision in August as a replacement for the original Wii model which it was discontinuing in certain regions including Europe and the United States The new unit in its bundles was priced at a further reduction for the Wii s MSRP at the time of established in September br The console was first released in North America on October in a black finish bundled with a black Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk along with New Super Mario Bros Wii and a limited edition soundtrack for Super Mario Galaxy It was released in Europe on November in a white finish bundled with a white Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk along with Wii Party and Wii Sports A special bundle featuring a blue version of the revised Wii model and Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk with the inclusion of Mario Sonic at the London Olympic Games was released in Europe on November in collaboration with Sega Nintendo later revised the North American bundle by replacing the prior pack in game and soundtrack with the original Wii Sports duology the new bundle was released on October br br br Wii Mini br br The Wii Mini model RVL is a smaller redesigned Wii with a top loading disc drive In addition to the lack of GameCube support the Wii Mini removes Wi Fi support and online connectivity along with the removal of the SD card slot It also removed support for p and component video output According to Nintendo of Canada s Matt Ryan they stripped these features to bring down the price of the console further as to make it an option for those consumers that had not yet gotten a Wii or for those who wanted a second Wii in a different location Ryan stated that while removing the online functionality would prevent some games from being played most Wii games could still be played without it The Wii Mini is styled in matte black with a red border and includes a red Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk According to Ryan the red coloring was indicative of the planned exclusive release in Canada A composite A V cable wired Sensor Bar and power adapter are also included br The Wii Mini was first released on December exclusively in Canada with a MSRP of CA It was later released in Europe on March and in the United States on November The Canadian and European releases did not include a game while Mario Kart Wii had been included in all launch bundles in the United States Nintendo added several best selling and critically acclaimed Wii games to its Nintendo Selects label and marketed those alongside the Wii Mini s release br br br Software br br The console has many internal features made available from its hardware and firmware components The hardware allows for extendability via expansion ports while the firmware and some software could receive periodic updates via the WiiConnect service br br br Wii Menu br br The development of the Wii Menu the main user interface for the Wii was led by Takashi Aoyama of Nintendo s Integrated Research Development Division The project named the Console Feature Realization Project was to figure out what the Wii interface could show running in a low power mode on an around the clock schedule that would be of interest for people to look at if they were not playing games The idea of having continually updated weather and news reports made logical sense from testing and this led to the idea of presenting these similar to a row of televisions each set to a different television channel as if in an electronics shop creating the channels concept A user can navigate to any channel window to bring that to the forefront whether to launch the game or application or to get more information that was being displayed For example the Forecast Channel would display a brief summary of the local area s temperature and short term weather forecast while clicking on the channel brought up an interactive globe that the user could manipulate with the Wii Remote to explore real time weather conditions across the Earth br The Wii launched with six channels the Disc Channel which was used to launch Wii and GameCube titles from an optical disc the Mii Channel to create Mii avatars the Photo Channel which could be used to view and edit photos stored on an SD card the Wii Shop Channel to purchase new games and applications the Forecast Channel and the News Channel In addition to default channels that came with the Wii new channels could be added through system updates downloaded applications from the Wii Shop Channel or added by games themselves Shortly after launch other free channels created by Nintendo were made available to users including the Internet Channel a modified version of the Opera web browser for the Wii which supports USB keyboard input and Adobe Flash Player br The Wii Menu channels feature music composed by video game composer Kazumi Totaka br br br Mii br br The Wii introduced the use of player customized avatars called Miis which have been continued to be used by Nintendo in the Wii U the Nintendo DS family and to a lesser extent the Nintendo Switch Each player on a Wii console was encouraged to create their own Mii via the Mii Channel to be used in games like Wii Sports and some of the system software like the Mii Channel For example players would select their Mii in Wii Sports creating their in game avatar for the game Miis could be shared with other players through the Mii Channel br br br Nintendo DS connectivity br The Wii system supports wireless connectivity with the Nintendo DS without any additional accessories This connectivity allows the player to use the Nintendo DS microphone and touchscreen as inputs for Wii games The first game utilizing Nintendo DS Wii connectivity is Pok mon Battle Revolution Players with either the Pok mon Diamond or Pearl Nintendo DS games are able to play battles using the Nintendo DS as a controller Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time released on both Nintendo DS and Wii features connectivity in which both games can advance simultaneously Nintendo later released the Nintendo Channel which allows Wii owners to download game demos of popular games such as Mario Kart DS or additional data to their Nintendo DS in a process similar to that of a DS Download Station The console is also able to expand Nintendo DS games br br br Online connectivity br br The Wii console connects to the Internet through its built in b g Wi Fi or through a USB to Ethernet adapter either method allows players to access the Nintendo Wi Fi Connection service The service has several features for the console including Virtual Console WiiConnect the Internet Channel the Forecast Channel the Everybody Votes Channel the News Channel and the Check Mii Out Channel The Wii can also communicate and connect with other Wii systems through a self generated wireless LAN enabling local wireless multi playing on different television sets Battalion Wars first demonstrated this feature for non split screen multi playing between two or more televisions br br br Third party applications br Third party media apps were added to the Wii s online channels typically offered as free downloads but requiring subscriber logins for paid services Among some of these included the BBC iPlayer in November Netflix in November Hulu in February YouTube in December Amazon Prime Video in January and Crunchyroll in October In June YouTube ended support for its Wii channel In January Nintendo ended support for all streaming services on the Wii br br br Parental controls br The console features parental controls which can be used to prohibit younger users from playing games with content unsuitable for their age level When one attempts to play a Wii or Virtual Console game it reads the content rating encoded in the game data if this rating is greater than the system s set age level the game will not load without a password Parental controls may also restrict Internet access which blocks the Internet Channel and system update features Since the console is restricted to GameCube functionality when playing GameCube Game Discs GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental control settings br The Wii also includes a system that records the playtime based on any game or app on the system While Nintendo decided against a profile system that would require each user to identify themselves they kept the cumulative playtime tracking system which cannot be erased or altered to give parents the means to review their children s use of the Wii br br br Games br br Retail copies of games are supplied on proprietary DVD type Wii optical discs which are packaged in keep cases with instructions In Europe the boxes have a triangle at the bottom corner of the paper sleeve insert side The triangle is color coded to identify the region for which the title is intended and which manual languages are included The console supports regional lockout software available in a region can be only played on that region s hardware br Twenty one games were announced for launch day in North and South America with another twelve announced for release later in Among the system s launch titles in all regions included Wii Sports which was bundled in all Wii packages except in Japan and South Korea The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess Sega s Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz and Ubisoft s Red Steel Metroid Prime Corruption had been slated as a Wii launch title but was pushed into a few months before the Wii s launch Nintendo had also planned to release Super Smash Bros Brawl as a launch title but its director Masahiro Sakurai stated there were difficulties in adapting the format to the Wii s motion controls to require more time for the game s development br New Wii games included those from Nintendo s flagship franchises such as The Legend of Zelda Super Mario Pok mon and Metroid Nintendo has received third party support from companies such as Ubisoft Sega Square Enix Activision Blizzard Electronic Arts and Capcom with more games being developed for Wii than for the PlayStation or Xbox Nintendo also launched the New Play Control line a selection of enhanced ports of first party GameCube games that have been updated to capitalize on the Wii s motion controls br br br Backward compatibility br br The original launch Wii consoles are backward compatible with all GameCube software memory cards and controllers although Korean Wii consoles are not backward compatible at all Software compatibility is achieved by the slot loading drive s ability to accept GameCube discs A Wii console running a GameCube disc is restricted to GameCube functionality and a GameCube controller is required to play GameCube titles A GameCube memory card is also necessary to save game progress and content since the Wii internal flash memory will not save GameCube games Also backward compatibility is limited in some areas For example online and LAN enabled features for GameCube titles are unavailable on the Wii since the console lacks serial ports for the GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter The revised Wii model and the Wii Mini lack the GameCube backward compatibility features br br br Virtual Console br br The Virtual Console service allowed Wii owners to play games originally released for Nintendo s older consoles including the Nintendo Entertainment System Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Nintendo Later updates included games from third party consoles and computers including the Sega Genesis Mega Drive and Sega Mark III Master System NEC TurboGrafx PC Engine SNK Neo Geo the Commodore computer the MSX computer only in Japan and various arcade games through Virtual Console Arcade Virtual Console games were distributed over broadband Internet via the Wii Shop Channel and were saved to the Wii internal flash memory or to a removable SD card Once downloaded Virtual Console games can be accessed from the Wii Menu as individual channels or from an SD card via the SD Card Menu br br br WiiWare br br WiiWare was Nintendo s foray into digital distribution on the Wii comparable to the existing Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network The service allowed players to purchase games digitally through the Wii Shop downloading the games to their local memory cards to be run from them Besides facilitating this form of distribution WiiWare was also envisioned to help support smaller and independent game developers offering these teams a less expensive route to produce Wii games without having to go through retail production and distribution channels The WiiWare channel launched on March and remained active including through the Wii U s lifetime until the Wii Shop Channel was discontinued in br br br Reception br br br Critical reviews br The system was well received after its exhibition at E winning the Game Critics Awards for Best of Show and Best Hardware Later in December Popular Science named the console a Grand Award Winner in home entertainment The game proceeded to win multiple awards the console was awarded Spike TV s Video Games Award a Golden Joystick from the Golden Joystick Awards and an Emmy Award for game controller innovation from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences IGN and The Guardian named the Wii the th greatest video game console of all time out of and GameSpot chose the console as having the best hardware in its Best and Worst awards br The Wii was praised for its simple yet responsive controls as well as its simplicity that appeals to broader audiences Although Dan Grabham of Tech Radar enjoyed its simple mechanics stating how even grandparents can pick things up pretty quickly he also enjoyed the depth of content carried over from the GameCube CNET likened the no brainer setup and the easy to navigate home screen Will Wright the creator of The Sims called the Wii the only next gen system I ve seen and rather considered the PS and the Xbox as simply successors with incremental improvement He believed that the Wii did not only improve on graphics but also complimented how it hits a completely different demographic Reviewers were fond of the compact design with Ars Technica comparing it to an Apple product br By two years after the Wii s release Nintendo acknowledged several limitations and challenges with the system such as the perception that the system catered primarily to a casual audience and was unpopular among hardcore gamers Miyamoto admitted that the lack of support for high definition video output on the Wii and its limited network infrastructure also contributed to the system being regarded separately from its competitors systems the Xbox and PlayStation Miyamoto originally defended Nintendo s decision to not include HD graphics in the Wii stating that the number of HDTV s in people s homes at the time was really not that high yet Of course I think five years down the road it would be pretty much a given that Nintendo would create an HD system but right now the predominant television set in the world is a non HD set In Miyamoto said in an interview with Japanese video game website Gamer that Even for the Wii no matter how much it made the system cost it would have been great if it were HD in the first place br At the same time criticism of the Wii Remote and Wii hardware specifications had surfaced Former GameSpot editor and Giantbomb com founder Jeff Gerstmann stated that the controller s speaker produces low quality sound while Factor co founder Julian Eggebrecht stated that the console has inferior audio capabilities and graphics UK based developer Free Radical Design stated that the Wii hardware lacks the power necessary to run the software it scheduled for release on other seventh generation consoles Online connectivity of the Wii was also criticized Matt Casamassina of IGN compared it to the entirely unintuitive service provided for the Nintendo DS br Although the Wii Mini was met with praise for being cheap considering it was bundled with a Wii Remote Nunchuk and a copy of Mario Kart Wii it was considered inferior compared to the original console Critics were disappointed in the lack of online play and backward compatibility with GameCube games and also believed the hardware was still rather quite large being about half the size of the Wii Eurogamer s Richard Leadbetter thought the Wii Mini was not any more living room friendly as he believed the bright red plastics make it stand out much more than the more neutral blacks and whites of existing model s casing He stated that the overall design was rough in texture and seemed to have been built with emphasis on durability Nintendo Life reviewer Damien McFerran said that the lightweight design of the Wii Mini makes it feel a little cheaper and less dependable with empty space inside the shell CNET criticized the pop open lid for inserting disks to be cheap feeling br br br Third party development br The Wii s success caught third party developers by surprise due to constraints of the hardware s distinct limitations this led to apologies for the quality of their early games In an interview with Der Spiegel Ubisoft s Yves Guillemot and Alain Corre admitted that they made a mistake in rushing out their launch titles promising to take future projects more seriously An executive for Frontline Studios stated that major publishers were wary of releasing exclusive titles for the Wii due to the perception that third party companies were not strongly supported by consumers UP com editor Jeremy Parish stated that Nintendo was the biggest disappointment for him in Commenting on the lack of quality third party support he stated that the content was worse than its predecessors resulting in bargain bin trash br Additionally the lack of third party support also came from the fact that first party games released by Nintendo were too successful and developers were having issues with competing Game developers such as Rod Cousens CEO of Codemasters were having issues with the slow sales on the Wii The Nikkei Business Daily a Japanese newspaper claimed that companies were too nervous to start or continue making games for the console some of which considering the Wii to be a fad that will eventually die down in popularity Nintendo considered why this was the case was due to the fact that they know the Wii s special characteristics better than anyone and began developing the games for the console long before its release giving them a head start br Due to struggling sales during developers began creating alternative options Capcom took note of the difficulty of making money on the Wii and shifted their content to making less games but with higher quality According to Sony many third party developers originally making games for the Wii started focusing attention more of the PlayStation and Xbox br br br Sales br br Initial consumer reaction to the Wii appears to have been positive with commentators judging the launch to have been successful The launch of the Wii in November was considered the largest console launch by Nintendo in the Americas Japan Europe and Australia The console outsold combined sales of the PlayStation and Xbox in several regions in its launch period The Wii remained in short supply through the first year The company had already shipped nearly million units worldwide by the end of and worked to raise production amounts to million through but warned consumers that there would be shortages of the Wii through that year Wii sales surpassed Xbox sales by September To meet further demand Nintendo increased production rates of the Wii from million to around million units per month in planning to meet the continued demand for the console br At the March Game Developers Conference Iwata reported that the Wii had reached million sales Nintendo announced its first price reductions for the console in September dropping the MSRP from to The price cut had come days after both Sony and Microsoft announced similar price cuts on the PlayStation and Xbox consoles Nintendo stated that the price reduction was in anticipation of drawing in more consumers who still cautious about buying a video game console The Wii became the best selling home video game console produced by Nintendo during with sales exceeding million units br In sales of the Wii began to decline falling by percent from the previous year The drop in sales was considered to be due to a combination of the introduction of the PlayStation Move and Kinect motion control systems on the PlayStation and Xbox systems and the waning fad of the Wii system Wii sales also weakened into as third party support for the console waned major publishers were passing over the Wii which was underpowered and used non standard development tools and instead focused on games for the PlayStation Xbox and personal computers Publishers were also drawn away from the Wii with the promise of the more powerful Wii U in the near future Wii sales continued to decline into falling by half from the previous year After its release in Canada on December the Wii Mini had sold units by January br The Wii surpassed million units sold worldwide during the second quarter of The Wii had total lifetime sales of million consoles worldwide as of March the last reported data for the console by Nintendo At least million consoles were sold in North America million in Japan and million in all other regions As of the Wii is the fifth best selling home console of all time surpassed by the original PlayStation million units the PlayStation million units the Nintendo Switch million units and the PlayStation million units As of the Wii is Nintendo s second best selling home console having been outsold by the Nintendo Switch at million units br As of September nine Wii games had sold over ten million units globally which included Wii Sports million including pack in copies Mario Kart Wii million Wii Sports Resort million New Super Mario Bros Wii million Wii Play million Wii Fit million Wii Fit Plus million Super Smash Bros Brawl million and Super Mario Galaxy million A total of million titles had been sold for the Wii by June The popularity of Wii Sports was considered part of the console s success making it a killer app for the Wii as it drew those that typically did not play video games to the system br br br Legal issues br br There were a number of legal challenges stemming from the Wii and Wii Remote Several of these were patent related challenges from companies claiming the Wii Remote infringed on their patents Most of these were either dismissed or settled out of court One challenge was from iLife Technologies Inc who sued Nintendo over their Wii Remote s motion detection technology for patent infringement in iLife initially won a US million judgement against Nintendo in The case was overturned in with the appellate court ruling that iLife s patents were too broad to cover the specific motion detection technologies developed by Nintendo br There were lawsuits against Nintendo claiming physical damage done by ineffective wrist straps on the Wii Remote when they slipped out of players hands and broke television screens or windows The first class action suit filed in December led Nintendo to issue a product recall for the existing wrist straps and send out new versions that had an improved securing mechanism for the wrist A second class action lawsuit was filed by a mother in Colorado in December claiming the updated wrist straps were still ineffective This suit was dismissed by September finding for Nintendo that the wrist straps were not knowingly faulty under Colorado consumer protection laws br br br Legacy br br br Impact on Nintendo br The Wii has been recognized as Nintendo s blue ocean strategy to differentiate itself from its competitors Sony and Microsoft for the next several years The Wii has since become seen as a prime example of an effective blue ocean approach While Sony and Microsoft continued to innovate their consoles on hardware improvements to provide more computational and graphics power Nintendo put more effort towards developing hardware that facilitated new ways to play games This was considered a key part to the success of the console measured by sales over its competitors during that console generation However Nintendo did not maintain this same blue ocean approach when it took towards designing the Wii U by which point both Sony and Microsoft had caught up with similar features from the Wii These factors partially contributed towards weak sales of the Wii U br Part of the Wii s success was attributed to its lower cost compared to the other consoles While Microsoft and Sony have experienced losses producing their consoles in the hopes of making a long term profit on software sales Nintendo reportedly had optimized production costs to obtain a significant profit margin with each Wii unit sold Soichiro Fukuda a games analyst at Nikko Citigroup estimated that in Nintendo s optimized production gave them a profit from each unit sold ranging from in Japan to in the United States and in Europe The console s final price at launch of made it comparatively cheaper than the Xbox which had been available in two models priced at and and the then upcoming PlayStation also to be available in two models priced at and Further Nintendo s first party games for the Wii were set at an retail price of about less expensive than average games for Nintendo s competitors Iwata stated they were able to keep the game price lower since the Wii was not as focused on high resolution graphics in comparison to the other consoles thus keeping development costs lower averaging about million per game compared to million required for developing on the Xbox or PlayStation br br br Health effects br The Wii was marketed to promote a healthy lifestyle via physical activity It has been used in physical rehabilitation and its health effects have been studied for several conditions The most studied uses of Wii for rehabilitation therapy are for stroke cerebral palsy Parkinson s disease and for balance training The potential for adverse effects from video game rehabilitation therapy for example from falls has not been well studied as of br A study published in the British Medical Journal stated that Wii players use more energy than they do playing sedentary computer games but Wii playing was not an adequate replacement for regular exercise Some Wii players have experienced musculoskeletal injuries known as Wiiitis Wii knee Wii elbow similar to tennis elbow or nintendinitis from repetitive play a small number of serious injuries have occurred but injuries are infrequent and most are mild br In May Nintendo gave the American Heart Association AHA a million gift the AHA endorsed the Wii with its Healthy Check icon covering the console and two of its more active games Wii Fit Plus and Wii Sports Resort br br br Homebrew hacking and emulation br br The Wii has become a popular target for homebrewing new functionality and video games since its discontinuation For example homebrew projects have been able to add DVD playback to unmodified Wii consoles The Wii also can be hacked to enable an owner to use the console for activities unintended by the manufacturer Several brands of modchips are available for the Wii br The Wii Remote also became a popular unit to hack for other applications As it connected through standard Bluetooth interfaces programmers were able to reverse engineer the communications protocol and develop application programming interfaces for the Wii Remote for other operating systems and subsequently games and applications that used the Wii Remote on alternate platforms Further hacks at the hardware level typically taking apart the Wii Remote and Sensor Bar and reconfiguring its components in other configurations led to other applications such as remote hand and finger tracking digital whiteboards and head tracking for virtual reality headsets br The Wii has been a popular system for emulation while the act of creating such emulators in a cleanroom type approach have been determined to be legal the actions of bringing the Wii system software and games to other systems has been of questionable legality and Nintendo has actively pursued legal action against those that distribute copies of their software The open source Dolphin project has been able to successfully emulate the Wii and GameCube through several years of cleanroom efforts br br br Music br Joe Skrebels of IGN has argued that the Wii s greatest and longest lasting legacy is that of the music composed by Totaka for the console writing Motion controls Miis and balance boards have all been removed or diminished as Nintendo moved on but take a quick look across YouTube TikTok or Twitter and I guarantee it won t take all that long to hear a Wii track Covers and memes featuring music from the Wii are everywhere Music written for the Wii has taken on a new life as a cultural touchstone and inspired people far beyond the confines of the little white wedge it was composed for The Washington Post s Michael Andor Brodeur described the Mii Channel music as a cultural touchstone while Martin Robinson of Eurogamer called the theme of the Wii Shop Channel a song so infectious it went on to become a meme both the Mii Channel theme and Wii Shop Channel theme have inspired jazz covers br br br Notes br br
