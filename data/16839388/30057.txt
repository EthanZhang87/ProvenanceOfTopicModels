Tokyo Japanese T ky to k o officially the Tokyo Metropolis T ky to is the capital city of Japan and one of the most populous cities in the world with a population of over million residents as of The Greater Tokyo Area which includes Tokyo and parts of six neighbouring prefectures is the most populous metropolitan area in the world with million residents as of Tokyo is known as the city that on the night of March during a raid by the US Armed Forces was subjected to the most destructive and deadly non nuclear bombing in human history br Located at the head of Tokyo Bay Tokyo is part of the Kant region on the central coast of Honshu Japan s largest island Tokyo serves as Japan s economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers Tokyo s central special wards which formerly made up Tokyo City various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands Despite most of the world recognising Tokyo as a city since its governing structure has been more akin to a prefecture with an accompanying Governor and Assembly taking precedence over the smaller municipal governments which make up the metropolis Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace Shinjuku the city s administrative center and Shibuya a commercial cultural and business hub in the city br Before the th century Tokyo then known as Edo was mainly a fishing village It gained political prominence in when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate By the mid th century Edo was among the world s largest cities with over a million residents Following the Meiji Restoration in the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo and the city was renamed Tokyo lit Eastern Capital In Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kant earthquake and the city was later badly damaged by allied bombing raids during World War II Beginning in the late s Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion that contributed to the era s so called Japanese economic miracle in which Japan s economy propelled to the second largest in the world at the time behind that of the United States As of the city is home to of the world s largest companies listed in the annual Fortune Global br In the th and st centuries Tokyo became the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics and Paralympics in and again in and it also hosted three G summits in and Tokyo is an international research and development hub and an academic center with several major universities including the University of Tokyo the top ranking university in the country Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen Japan s high speed railway network and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world s busiest train station The city is home to the world s tallest tower Tokyo Skytree The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line which opened in is the oldest underground metro line in Asia Pacific br Tokyo s nominal gross domestic output was trillion yen or US trillion in FY and accounted for of the country s total economic output which converts to million yen or US per capita Including the Greater Tokyo Area Tokyo is the second largest metropolitan economy in the world after New York with a gross metropolitan product estimated at US trillion Although Tokyo s status as a leading global financial hub has diminished with the Lost Decades since the s when the Tokyo Stock Exchange was the world s largest with a market capitalisation about times that of the NYSE the city is still a large financial hub and the TSE remains among the world s top five major stock exchanges Tokyo is categorized as an Alpha city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network The city is also recognized as one of the world s most livable ones it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking published in Tokyo being the largest urban agglomeration on Earth by population is considered the safest city in the world br br br Etymology br br Tokyo was originally known as Edo a kanji compound of e cove inlet and to entrance gate door The name which can be translated as estuary is a reference to the original settlement s location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay During the Meiji Restoration in the name of the city was changed to Tokyo from t east and ky capital when it became the new imperial capital in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital in the name of the capital city for example Kyoto Keij Beijing Nanjing and Xijing During the early Meiji period the city was sometimes called T kei an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing Tokyo making it a kanji homograph Some surviving official English documents use the spelling Tokei however this pronunciation is now obsolete br br br History br br br Pre Edo period br br Tokyo was originally a village called Edo part of the old Musashi Province Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan in the late twelfth century In ta D kan built Edo Castle to defend the region from the Chiba clan After D kan was assassinated in the castle and the area came to be possessed by several feudal lords In Tokugawa Ieyasu was granted the Kant region by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and moved there from his ancestral land of Mikawa Province He greatly expanded the castle which was said to have been abandoned and in tatters when he moved there and ruled the region from there When he became sh gun the de facto ruler of the country in the whole country came to be ruled from Edo While the Tokugawa shogunate ruled the country in practice the Imperial House of Japan was still the de jure ruler and the title of sh gun was granted by the Emperor as a formality The Imperial House was based in Kyoto from to so Edo was still not the capital of Japan br br During the Edo period the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the Pax Tokugawa and in the presence of such peace the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city The absence of war inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires earthquakes and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population reaching one million by the th century br This prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C Perry in Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations especially in the form of the smashing of rice establishments Meanwhile supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption caused by widespread rebellious demonstrations to further consolidate power which resulted in the overthrow of the last Tokugawa sh gun Yoshinobu in After years the Pax Tokugawa came to an end In May Edo castle was handed to the Emperor supporting forces after negotiation the Fall of Edo Some forces loyal to the shogunate kept fighting but with their loss in the Battle of Ueno on July the entire city came under the control of the new government br br br br br After the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate for the first time in a few centuries the Emperor ceased to be a mere figurehead and became both the de facto and de jure ruler of the country Hisoka Maejima advocated for the relocation of the capital functions to Tokyo recognising the advantages of the existing infrastructure and the vastness of the Kanto Plain compared to the relatively small Kyoto basin After being handed over to the Meiji government Edo was renamed Tokyo Eastern Capital on September The Emperor Meiji visited the city once at the end of that year and eventually moved there in Tokyo had already been the nation s political center for nearly three centuries and the emperor s residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace br br Government ministries such as the Ministry of Finance were also relocated to Tokyo by and the first railway line in the country was opened on October connecting Shimbashi Shiodome and Yokohama Sakuragicho which is now part of the Tokaido line The s saw the establishment of other institutions and facilities that now symbolise Tokyo such as Ueno Park the University of Tokyo and the Tokyo Stock Exchange The rapid modernisation of the country was driven from Tokyo with its business districts such as Marunouchi filled with modern brick buildings and the railway network serving as a means to help the large influx of labour force needed to keep the development of the economy The City of Tokyo was officially established on May The Imperial Diet the national legislature of the country was established in Tokyo in and it has ever since been operating in the city br br On September the Great Kanto Earthquake struck the city and the earthquake and subsequent fire killed an estimated citizens The loss amounted to per cent of the country s economic output On the other hand the destruction provided an opportunity to reconsider the planning of the city which had changed its shape hastily after the Meiji Restoration The high survival rate of concrete buildings promoted the transition from timber and brick architecture to modern earthquake proof construction The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa the first underground railway line built outside Europe and the American continents was completed on December br br Although Tokyo recovered robustly from the earthquake and new cultural and liberal political movements such as Taish Democracy spread the s saw an economic downturn caused by the Great Depression and major political turmoil Two attempted military coups d tat happened in Tokyo the May incident in and the February incident in This turmoil eventually allowed the military wings of the government to take control of the country leading to Japan joining the Second World War as an Axis power Due to the country s political isolation on the international stage caused by its military aggression in China and the increasingly unstable geopolitical situations in Europe k had to give up hosting the Summer Olympics in Rationing started in June as the nation braced itself for another world war while the th Centenary of the Enthronement of Emperor Jimmu celebrations took place on a grand scale to boost morale and increase the sense of national identity in the same year On December Japan attacked the American bases at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii entering the Second World War against the Allied Powers The wartime regime greatly affected life in the city br br br br br In Tokyo City merged with Tokyo Prefecture to form the Tokyo Metropolis T ky to This reorganisation aimed to create a more centralised and efficient administrative structure to better manage resources urban planning and civil defence during wartime The Tokyo Metropolitan Government thus became responsible for both prefectural and city functions while administering cities towns and villages in the suburban and rural areas br br Although Japan enjoyed significant success in the initial stages of the war and rapidly expanded its sphere of influence the Doolittle Raid on April marked the first direct foreign attack on Tokyo Although the physical damage was minimal the raid demonstrated the vulnerability of the Japanese mainland to air attacks and boosted American morale Large scale Allied air bombing of cities in the Japanese home islands including Tokyo began in late when the US seized control of the Mariana Islands From these islands newly developed long range B bombers could conduct return journeys The bombing of Tokyo in and is estimated to have killed between and civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed br br The deadliest night of the war came on March the night of the American Operation Meetinghouse raid Nearly incendiary bombs were dropped on the east end of the city shitamachi an area with a high concentration of factories and working class houses Two fifths of the city were completely burned more than buildings were destroyed civilians were killed and more were injured Numerous Edo and Meiji era buildings of historical significance were destroyed including the main building of the Imperial Palace Sens ji Z j ji Sengaku ji and Kabuki za Between and the population of Tokyo dwindled from to less than as soldiers were sent to the front and children were evacuated br br br br br After the war Tokyo became the base from which the Allied Occupational Forces under Douglas MacArthur an American general administered Japan for six years The original rebuilding plan of Tokyo was based on a plan modelled after the Metropolitan Green Belt of London devised in the s but cancelled due to the war However due to the monetary contraction policy known as the Dodge Line named after Joseph Dodge the neoliberal economic advisor to MacArthur the plan had to be reduced to a minimal one focusing on transport and other infrastructure In the pre war special wards were reorganised into the current wards Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until around when heavy industry output returned to pre war levels br Since around the time the Allied occupation of Japan ended in Tokyo s focus shifted from rebuilding to developing beyond its pre war stature From the s onwards Tokyo s Metro and railway network saw significant expansion culminating in the launch of the world s first dedicated high speed railway line the Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka in The same year saw the development of other transport infrastructure such as the Shuto Expressway to meet the increased demand brought about by the Tokyo Olympics the first Olympic Games held in Asia Around this time the metre height restriction imposed on all buildings since was relaxed due to the increased demand for office buildings and advancements in earthquake proof construction Starting with the Kasumigaseki Building metres in skyscrapers began to dominate Tokyo s skyline br br br Present br br Although the Oil Crisis put an end to the rapid post war recovery and development of Japan s economy its position as the world s second largest economy had seemed secure by that point remaining so until when it was surpassed by China Tokyo s development was sustained by its status as the economic political and cultural hub of such a country In after years of the intense Sanrizuka Struggle Narita International Airport opened as the new gateway to the city while the relatively small Haneda Airport switched to primarily domestic flights West Shinjuku which had been occupied by the vast Yodobashi Water Purification Centre until became the site of an entirely new business district characterised by skyscrapers surpassing metres during this period br br The American led Plaza Accord in which aimed to depreciate the US dollar had a devastating effect on Japan s manufacturing sector particularly affecting small to mid size companies based in Tokyo This led the government to adopt a domestic demand focused economic policy ultimately causing an asset price bubble Land redevelopment projects were planned across the city and real estate prices skyrocketed By the estimated value of the Imperial Palace surpassed that of the entire state of California The Tokyo Stock Exchange became the largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalisation with the Tokyo based NTT becoming the most highly valued company globally br br After the bubble burst in the early s Japan experienced a prolonged economic downturn called the Lost Decades which was charactised by extremely low or negative economic growth deflation stagnant asset prices Tokyo s status as a world city is said to have depreciated greatly during these three decades Nonetheless Tokyo still saw new urban developments during this period Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place Tenn zu Isle Shiodome Roppongi Hills Shinagawa and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station Land reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries The most prominent is the Odaiba area now a major shopping and entertainment center Various plans have been proposed for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country These plans have been controversial within Japan and have yet to be realized br br On September the IOC selected Tokyo to host the Summer Olympics Thus Tokyo became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice However the Olympic Games were postponed and held from July to August as a result of the COVID pandemic br br br Administration br br Under Japanese law the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a to translated as metropolis Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest with inhabitants per square kilometer sq mi by geographic area it is the third smallest above only Osaka and Kagawa Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan s other prefectures The special wards tokubetsu ku which until constituted the city of Tokyo are self governing municipalities each having a mayor a council and the status of a city br In addition to these special wards Tokyo also includes more cities shi five towns ch or machi and eight villages son or mura each of which has a local government The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward br br br Municipalities br br Since the completion of the Great Mergers of Heisei in Tokyo consists of municipalities special wards cities towns and villages All municipalities in Japan have a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly each elected on independent four year cycles The Special Wards cover the area that had been Tokyo City until other municipalities are located in the Tama area and the remeining are on Tokyo s outlying islands br br The special wards tokubetsu ku of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City Each special ward has used the word city in their official English name in recent times e g Chiyoda City but their status is more akin to boroughs in London or New York Certain municipal functions such as waterworks sewerage and fire fighting are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government rather than each ward To pay for the added administrative costs the Metropolitan Government collects municipal taxes which would usually be levied by each ward The three central wards of Tokyo Chiyoda Ch and Minato are the business core of the city with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population Chiyoda Ward is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government and the Emperor of Japan yet is one of the least populated wards br To the west of the special wards Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities towns and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan While serving as bed towns for those working in central Tokyo some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base such as Tachikawa Collectively these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district gun of Nishi Tama Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization The highest mountain in Tokyo Mount Kumotori is m ft high other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu m ft Odake m ft and Mitake m ft Lake Okutama on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture is Tokyo s largest lake and serves as the primary reservoir for Tokyo s water supply The district is composed of three towns Hinode Mizuho and Okutama and one village Hinohara The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachi ji Tachikawa Machida me and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area br Tokyo has numerous outlying islands which extend as far as km mi from central Tokyo Because of the islands distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku local subprefectural branch offices administer them The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji Hakone Izu National Park The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are Izu shima Toshima Nii jima Shikine jima K zu shima Miyake jima Mikurajima Hachij jima and Aogashima The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures Izu shima and Hachijojima are towns The remaining islands are six villages with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village The Ogasawara Islands include from north to south Chichi jima Nishinoshima Haha jima Kita Iwo Jima Iwo Jima and Minami Iwo Jima Ogasawara also administers two small outlying islands Minami Torishima the easternmost point in Japan and at km mi the most distant island from central Tokyo and Okinotorishima the southernmost point in Japan Japan s claim on an exclusive economic zone EEZ surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population but hosts Japan Self Defense Forces personnel Local populations are only found on Chichi Jima and Haha Jima The islands form both Ogasawara Subprefecture and the village of Ogasawara Tokyo br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br National parks br br As of March of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as

phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government the annual mean temperature has increased by about C F over the past years Tokyo has been cited as a convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate br In Tokyo enacted the Year Project for Green Tokyo to be realized by It set a goal of increasing roadside trees in Tokyo to

borders it to the east Yamanashi to the west Kanagawa to the south and Saitama to the north Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards occupying the eastern half and the Tama area stretching westwards Tokyo has a latitude of near the th parallel north which makes it more southern than Rome Madrid New York City and Beijing br Within the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south the Izu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands which stretch more than km mi away from the mainland Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west Tokyo s overall population density figures far under represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo br br br Climate br The former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone K ppen climate classification Cfa with hot humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells The region like much of Japan experiences a one month seasonal lag The warmest month is August which averages C F The coolest month is January averaging C F The record low temperature was C F on January The record high was C F on July br The record highest low temperature is C F on August making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over C F br Annual rainfall averages nearly millimeters in with a wetter summer and a drier winter The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about days from around mid February to early January Snowfall is sporadic and occurs almost annually Tokyo often sees typhoons every year though few are strong The wettest month since records began in was October with millimeters in of rain including mm in on the ninth of that

of typhoons a year compared to in mainland Kant br br br Natural disasters br br br Earthquakes br br Tokyo is near the boundary of three plates making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat although epicenters within mainland Tokyo excluding Tokyo s km mi long island jurisdiction are quite rare It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes magnitudes that can be felt in a single year something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well They rarely cause much damage sometimes a few injuries as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki br Tokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in and much more indirectly with some liquefaction in landfill zones in the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity The earthquake with an estimated magnitude of killed people the last time the urban area was directly hit br br br Volcanic eruptions br br Mount Fuji is about km mi southwest of Tokyo There is a low risk of eruption The last recorded was the H ei eruption which started on December and ended about January days During the H ei eruption the ash amount was cm in southern Tokyo bay area and cm to cm in central Tokyo Kanagawa had cm to cm ash and Saitama to cm If the wind blows north east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis According to the government less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas power lines and cause temporary power outages The affected areas would need to be evacuated br br br Floods br br Tokyo is located on the Kant Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season Important rivers are Edogawa Nakagawa Arakawa Kandagawa Megurogawa and Tamagawa In Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo destroying homes and killing people In Typhoon Ida dropped mm in of rain in a single week causing streets to flood In the s and s the government invested of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction A huge system of dams levees and tunnels was constructed The purpose is to manage heavy rain typhonic rain and river floods Tokyo has currently the world s largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel MAOUDC It took years to build and was completed in The MAOUDC is a km mi long system of tunnels meters ft underground with meter ft tall cylindrical tanks each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty During floods excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River Low lying areas of K t Edogawa Sumida Katsushika Tait and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding br br br Architecture br Tokyo s buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any specific archtectural style but it can be generally said that a majority of extant structures were built in the past a hundred years twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins first in the Great Kant earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II br br br Early modern br br The oldest known extant building in Tokyo is Shofukuji in Higashi Murayama The current building was constructed in during the Muromachi period Although greatly reduced in number by later fires earthquakes and air raids a considerable number of Edo era buildings survive to this day The Tokyo Imperial Palace which was occupied by the Tokugawa Shogunate as Edo Castle during the Edo Period has many gates and towers dating from that era although the main palace buildings and the tenshu tower have been lost br br Numerous temple and shrine buildings in Tokyo date from this era the Ueno Toshogu still maintains the original building built by the third shogun Iemitsu Tokugawa Although partially destroyed during the Second World War Zojo ji which houses the Tokugawa family mausoleum still has grand Edo era buildings such as the Sangedatsu gate Kaneiji has grand th century buildings such as the five storey pagoda and the Shimizudo The Nezu Shrine and Gokokuji were built by the fifth shogun Tsunayoshi Tokugawa in the late s All feudal lords daimyo had large Edo houses where they stayed when in Edo at one point these houses amounted to half the total area of Edo None of the grand Edo era daimyo houses still exist in Tokyo as their vast land footprint made them easy targets for redevelopment programmes for modernisation during the Meiji Period Some gardens were immune from such fates and are today open to the public Hamarikyu Kofu Tokugawa family Shibarikyu Kishu Tokugawa family Koishikawa Korakuen Mito Tokugawa family Rikugien Yanagisawa family and Higo Hosokawa Garden Hosokawa family The Akamon which is now widely seen as a

occupies their former edo estate br br br Modern br br The Meiji era saw a rapid modernisation in architectual styles as well until the Great Kanto Earthquake in exposed their weakness to seimic shocks grand brick buildings were constantly built across the city Tokyo Station the Ministry of Justice building and Mistubishi building one rebuilt in are some of the few brick suvivors from this period It was regarded as fashionable by some members of the Japanese aristocracy to build their Tokyo residences in grand and modern styles and some of these buildings still exist although most are in private hands and open to the public on limited occasions Aristocratic residences today open to the public include the Marquess Maeda residence in Komaba the Baron Iwasaki residence in Ikenohata and the Baron Furukawa residence in Nishigahara br br The Great Kanto Earthquake in ushered in an era of concrete architecture Surviving reinforced concrete buildings from this era include the Meiji

This spread of earthquake and fire resistant architecture reached council housing too most notably the D junkai apartments br The s saw the rise of styles that combined characteristics of both traditional Japanese and modern designs Chuta Ito was a leading figure in this movement and his extant works in Tokyo include Tsukiji Hongan ji The Imperial Crown Style which often features Japanese
