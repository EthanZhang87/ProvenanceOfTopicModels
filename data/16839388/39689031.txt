br br br Production br According to director co writer Roberts Bobs Gannaway The first film directed by Klay Hall was a race film I wanted to look at a different genre in this case an action disaster film Production on Planes Fire Rescue began six months after the start of the previous film We ve been working on this film for nearly four years The filmmakers researched the world of air attack teams and smokejumpers by working with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and sent a crew to the US Forest Services annual training exercises for smokejumpers Gannaway explained We actually hooked cameras onto their helmets and had them drop out of the airplane so we could catch it on film Nearly a year of research was done before the filmmakers started work on the story The idea of Dusty becoming a fire and rescue plane was based on reality Gannaway stated that during their research they discovered that in cropdusters were among the first planes to be used in aerial fire fighting There was a group of cropdusters who reworked their planes so they could drop water Gannaway also noted that in the first film Dusty is doing things to his engine that should not be done to it he is stressing the engine out and causing severe damage It s great that the first movie teed this up without intending to We just built on it and the results were remarkable Producer Ferrell Barron stated I think we ve all experienced some kind of loss at some point in our lives an end of an era a lost love a failed career We ve all had to recalibrate In Planes Fire Rescue Dusty can t go back to being a crop duster he left that behind He has to move forward Prana Studios provided work on visual effects animation and compositing br A pre release screening of the film was conducted at

Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review saying Beautiful to look at this is nothing more than a Little Engine That Could story refitted to accommodate aerial action and therefore unlikely to engage the active interest of anyone above the age of about or at the most Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review saying There are honestly stirring moments to be found in the movie s heartfelt tribute to the virtues of teamwork courage and sacrifice and in its soaring D visuals Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star Ledger gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying There are enough silly jokes and simple excitement here to keep the youngest ones interested and a few mild puns to occasionally make the adults smile Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice gave the film a negative review saying There s a fire And a rescue And lots of static TV quality scenes that drably cut from one car or plane to another as they sit in garages and discuss the importance of believing in yourself Soren Anderson of The Seattle Times gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying Disney s Planes Fire Rescue isn t half bad Kids should enjoy it and their parents won t be bored Sara Stewart of the New York Post gave the film two out of four stars saying It s generic stuff unless you re a kid who s really into playing with toy planes and trains and cars Stephan Lee of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B saying Canny references to s television and some genuinely funny moments will give grown ups enough fuel to cross the finish line A A Dowd of The A V Club gave the film a C saying It s nice to look at easy to watch and impossible to remember for the length of a car ride home br Joe Williams of the St Louis Post Dispatch gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying Without the kindling of character development Planes Fire and Rescue is no smoldering success but if Disney s flight plan is to share Pixar s airspace it s getting warmer Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of four stars saying It s not a poor movie But it s definitely a better movie for the kids Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars saying With the lackluster quality of its characters aircraft a smattering of trucks RVs and motorcycles the movie makes Pixar s Cars and its sequel look like masterpieces Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying There are a scattering of inside gags asides and blink and you missed it details for the parents The film s focus though is pleasing the milk and cookies crowd Mark Feeney of The Boston Globe gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying Most DisneyToons releases are direct to video That lowly status shows here in the pokey storytelling dreadful score and generally tired comedy Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review saying What this Disney feature lacks in the title department it makes up for with fluid visuals and fast moving action of the yes firefighting variety Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying For the most part Planes Fire Rescue is more about chuckles than big guffaws coupled with thrilling D flight and firefighting action scenes and lessons about friendship respect and loyalty Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times gave the film a mixed review saying In D the firefighting scenes are visually striking with plumes of smoke and chemical dust though the backgrounds like other aspects of the film lack dimension br Bill Zwecker of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three out of four stars saying Planes Fire Rescue is a good improvement over Planes which Disney released last year The story is stronger there are some wonderful additions to the voice talent and the D cinematography is well utilized James Rocchi of The Wrap gave the film three out of four stars saying As it is in the merchandising aisle so it is on the big screen Planes Fire and Rescue is precisely long competent and entertaining enough to be sold and sold well David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film one and a half stars out of four saying The animation in Planes Fire Rescue is considerably better the landscapes grander and the D flight and firefighting scenes more exciting But you get the same lame puns wedged into a succession of situations rather than a story Jordan Hoffman of the New York Daily News gave the film two out of five stars saying The meek action plays to the under crowd but the groaner puns will play only to masochists Meanwhile the D ticket upcharge here is a big ripoff the extra dimension is unnecessary Lisa Kennedy of The Denver Post gave the film a positive review saying Vivid and folksy Fire Rescue nicely exceeds expectations dampened by last summer s stalled out Planes Catherine Bray of Time Out gave the film one out of five stars saying Displaying a weird lack of memorable or endearing characters this animated effort feels more like a direct to video job from the s than a fully fledged John Lasseter exec produced theatrical release br br br Box office br Planes Fire Rescue
