involvement since one of the shorts Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree was released during his lifetime and he was involved in the production of Blustery Day It was always Walt Disney s intention to create a feature film but he decided to make shorts instead after production had begun to familiarize U S audiences with the characters All three shorts as well as future feature films boast classic songs by the Sherman Brothers including Winnie the Pooh and The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers br The character Gopher which does not appear in the Milne stories was created because Disney wanted an all American character that could appeal to the children and also add an element of comedy br For the character Piglet hand gestures and other movements were used by the animators to create expressiveness since he and Pooh had the appearance of dolls or stuffed animals with relatively simple button eyes The scene where Rabbit deals with Pooh s rump being part of the decor of his home was not in the original book but was reportedly contemplated by Disney when he first read the book br br br Release br br br Reception br The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh holds a unanimous critic
