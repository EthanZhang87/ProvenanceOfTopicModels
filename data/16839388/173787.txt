IMAX is a proprietary system of high resolution cameras film formats film projectors and theaters known for having very large screens with a tall aspect ratio approximately either or and steep stadium seating with the ratio format being available only in few selected locations br Graeme Ferguson Roman Kroitor Robert Kerr and William C Shaw were the co founders of what would be named the IMAX Corporation founded in September as Multiscreen Corporation Ltd and they developed the first IMAX cinema projection standards in the late s and early s in Canada br IMAX GT is the premium large format The digital format uses dual laser projectors which can show digital content when combined with a screen The film format uses very large screens of by metres by feet and unlike most conventional film projectors the film runs horizontally so that the image width can be greater than the width of the film stock It is called the format They can be purpose built theaters and dome theaters and many installations of this type limit themselves to a projection of high quality short documentaries br The dedicated buildings and projectors required high construction and maintenance costs necessitating several compromises in the following years To reduce costs the IMAX SR and MPX systems were introduced in and respectively to make IMAX available to multiplex and existing theaters The SR system featured slightly smaller screens than GT theatres though still in purpose built auditoriums with a aspect ratio The MPX projectors were solely used to retrofit existing multiplex auditoriums losing much of the quality of the GT experience br Later came the introduction of the IMAX Digital K and IMAX with Laser K in and respectively still limited in respect to the megapixels of equivalent resolution of the original film Both technologies are purely digital and suitable to retrofit existing theaters Since the Laser system has been employed to retrofit full dome installations with limited results due to the large area of a dome screen br br br History br br The IMAX film standard uses mm film run through the projector horizontally This technique produces an area that is about times as large as the mm format and about times as large as mm film run through the projector vertically br The desire to increase the visual impact of film has a long history In Fox introduced Fox Grandeur the first mm film format but it quickly fell from use In the s the potential of mm film to provide wider projected images was explored in the processes of CinemaScope and VistaVision following multi projector systems such as Cinerama While impressive Cinerama was difficult to install and maintain requiring careful alignment and synchronization of the multiple projectors During Expo in Montreal the National Film Board of Canada s In the Labyrinth and Ferguson s Man and the Polar Regions both used complex multi projector multi screen systems Each encountered technical difficulties that led them to found a company called Multiscreen with the goal of developing a simpler approach br br br Multiscreen Corporation br The single projector single camera system they eventually settled upon was designed and built by Shaw based upon a novel Rolling Loop film transport technology purchased from Peter Ronald Wright Jones a machine shop worker from Brisbane Australia Film projectors do not continuously flow the film in front of the bulb but instead stutter the film travel so that each frame can be illuminated in a momentarily paused still image This requires a mechanical apparatus to buffer the jerky travel of the film strip The older technology of running mm film vertically through the projector used only five sprocket perforations on the sides of each frame however the IMAX method used fifteen perforations per frame The previous mechanism was inadequate to handle this intermittent mechanical movement that was three times longer and so Jones s invention was necessary for the novel IMAX projector method with its horizontal film feed As it became clear that a single large screen image had more impact than multiple smaller ones and was a more viable product direction Multiscreen changed its name to IMAX Co founder Graeme Ferguson explained how the name IMAX originated br br the incorporation date of the company was September The name change came a year or two later We first called the company Multiscreen Corporation because that in fact was what people knew us as After about a year our attorney informed us that we could never copyright or trademark Multivision It was too generic It was a descriptive word The words that you can copyright are words like Kleenex or Xerox or Coca Cola If the name is descriptive you can t trademark it so you have to make up a word So we were sitting at lunch one day in a Hungarian restaurant in Montreal and we worked out a name on a placemat on which we wrote all the possible names we could think of We kept working with the idea of maximum image We turned it around and came up with IMAX br The name change actually happened more than two years later because a key patent filed on January was assigned under the original name Multiscreen Corporation Limited IMAX Chief Administration Officer Mary Ruby was quoted as saying Although many people may think IMAX is an acronym it is in fact a made up word br br br IMAX Corporation br br Tiger Child the first IMAX film was demonstrated at Expo in Osaka Japan The first permanent IMAX installation was built at the Cinesphere theatre at Ontario Place in Toronto It debuted in May showing the film North of Superior The installation remained in place during Ontario Place s hiatus for redevelopment The Cinesphere was renovated while Ontario Place was closed and re opened on November with IMAX mm and IMAX with laser illumination br During Expo in Spokane Washington an IMAX screen that measured by metres ft ft was featured in the US Pavilion the largest structure in the expo It became the first IMAX Theatre to not be partnered with any other brand of movie theatres About five million visitors viewed the screen which covered the viewer s total visual field when looking directly forward This created a sensation of motion in most viewers and motion sickness in some br Another IMAX D theatre was also built in Spokane however its screen size is less than half Due to protests the City of Spokane officials decided to work with the IMAX Corporation to demolish the theatre under the condition they renovate the former US Pavilion itself into IMAX s first permanent outdoor giant screen theatre The plan was to use material on the inside of the structure similar to that used when first constructed However it was expected to last only five years due to weather conditions destroying previous materials Concept art has been released in videos featured on Spokane s renovation site and its budget revealed that seating is planned for more than br The first permanent IMAX Dome installation the Eugene Heikoff and Marilyn Jacobs Heikoff Dome Theatre at the Reuben H Fleet Science Center opened in San Diego s Balboa Park in It doubles as a planetarium theater The first permanent IMAX D theatre was built in Vancouver British Columbia for Transitions at Expo and was in use until September It was located at the tip of Canada Place a Vancouver landmark br br br Digital projection br br In IMAX extended its brand into traditional theaters with the introduction of Digital IMAX a lower cost system that uses two K digital projectors to project on a aspect ratio screen This lower cost option which allowed for the conversion of existing multiplex theater auditoriums helped IMAX to grow from screens worldwide at the end of to over screens by the end of As of September there were IMAX theatres located in countries of which were in commercial multiplexes br The switch to digital projection came at a steep cost in image quality with K projectors having roughly an order of magnitude less resolution than traditional IMAX film projectors Maintaining the same story screen size would only make this loss more noticeable so many new theaters were instead built with significantly smaller screens These newer theaters with much lower resolution and much smaller screens soon began to be referred to by the derogatory name LieMAX particularly because the company still marketed the new screens similarly to the old ones without making the major differences clear to the public going so far as to market the smallest IMAX screen having times less area similarly to the largest while persisting with the same brand name br Since some feature films have been converted into IMAX format for displaying in IMAX theatres and some have also been partially shot in IMAX By late IMAX theatre systems were installed in commercial multiplexes commercial destinations and institutional settings in countries with less than a quarter of those having the capability to show mm film at the resolution of the large format as originally conceived br br br Technical aspects br br br Camera br br br Film cameras br The IMAX cinema process increases the image resolution by using a larger film frame in relative terms a frame of IMAX format film has three times the theoretical horizontal resolution of a frame of mm film To achieve such increased image resolution which IMAX estimates at approximately lines line pair modulations of horizontal resolution K mm film stock passes horizontally through the IMAX movie camera perforations at a time At frames per second this means that the film moves through the camera at meters ft per minute just over km h In a conventional mm camera the film passes vertically through the camera five perforations at a time or meters ft per minute In comparison in a conventional mm camera mm film passes vertically through the camera at four smaller perforations at a time which translates to meters ft per minute br In the Todd AO mm format of widescreen cinema the image area of a mm film frame is mm mm in in in the IMAX format of widescreen cinema the film frame dimensions are mm mm in in To match the standard image resolution of the moving image produced with the film speed of frames per second an IMAX film requires three times the length of negative film stock required for a mm film of comparable scope and cinematic technique br In March IMAX announced a new initiative in cooperation with Kodak Panavision and FotoKem to develop a new fleet of next generation IMAX film cameras with a goal to deploy the first four units in the next two years Christopher Nolan and Jordan Peele are among a group of advisors made up of filmmakers and cinematographers assisting in identifying new specs and features for the prototype development phase br In a May interview with Collider IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond revealed that there will be four new identical cameras that will be quieter than the existing cameras The Wall Street Journal revealed that the new cameras will be made out of carbon fiber and titanium and they will feature a five inch color display along with wireless capability br br br Phantom IMAX D digital camera br In IMAX announced a K D digital camera The camera was developed alongside Vision Research and AbelCine integrating two Phantom engines A prototype camera was used for the documentary Born to be Wild in which approximately of the finished film was shot with the system The company has said they have no intention of replacing the higher resolution film cameras with the new digital camera but the latter can be used in scenes that require a lightweight or relatively small D camera While IMAX has completed the production camera and has placed it in service on several films they have no plans to produce an IMAX film solely with the new digital system Transformers Age of Extinction is the first feature film partially filmed with the Phantom IMAX D camera br br br ARRI Alexa IMAX digital camera br In IMAX announced a D digital camera that was developed alongside Arri the camera being based on the latter company s Arri Alexa technology The first production to use the camera was Captain America Civil War The Russo brothers have stated that they solely used the Arri Alexa IMAX on Avengers Infinity War and Avengers Endgame br For Transformers The Last Knight two ARRI Alexa IMAX cameras were combined in a rig to provide native D with the film containing of IMAX footage br br br IMAX certified cameras br In September IMAX launched the Filmed for IMAX program which certifies high quality digital cameras that can be used to create IMAX format films As the scope of certified cameras expands it will be easier for filmmakers to create films to meet the projection needs of the IMAX giant screen theater br br Top Gun Maverick shot with the Sony CineAlta Venice and Dune shot with the Arri Alexa LF and Mini LF were among the first films that used IMAX certified cameras Other films between and that captured with this program are The Suicide Squad shot with the Red Ranger Monstro and Komodo Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings shot with the Arri Alexa LF and Mini LF The Battle at Lake Changjin and The Battle at Lake Changjin II shot with the Red Ranger Monstro Eternals shot with the Arri Alexa LF and Mini LF Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness shot with Panavision Millennium DXL Thor Love and Thunder shot with the Arri Alexa LF and Mini LF Black Panther Wakanda Forever shot with the Sony CineAlta Venice Guardians of the Galaxy Vol shot with the Red V Raptor The Marvels shot with the Arri Alexa LF and Mini LF and Dune Part Two shot with the Arri Alexa LF and Mini LF br br br Film stock br The IMAX format is generically called film the name referring to the sprocket holes or perforations per frame The film s bulk and weight require horizontal platters rather than conventional vertically mounted film reels IMAX film is fed through the projector horizontally and the film is drawn from the inner circumference of the platter not from the outer circumference like in conventional film reels A system is in place to keep the film in the outer circumference from flying outwards due to centrifugal force while the platter is spinning IMAX film is shipped to theaters in several small reels that are spliced into one continuous length that is then wound into a platter a process that may take hours to complete Films may be several kilometers in length Avatar which was hours in duration was close to km mi long Platters are handled using special forklifts IMAX platters range from to m to ft diameter to accommodate to hours of film Platters with a hour feature film weigh kg lb IMAX uses ESTAR based print film in their rolling loop film projection systems ESTAR based print film provides greater precision The chemical development process does not change the size or shape of ESTAR print film and IMAX s pin registration system especially that of the camera mechanism does not tolerate either sprocket hole or film thickness variations but the film can still swell or shrink under varying temperature and humidity This requires projection booths to be kept at a temperature of between and C and a humidity of The film is too large to be moved using its sprockets so they are instead used for registration to aid in aligning the film A feature film platter can cost US to print The camera negative is actually mm film stock but it runs horizontally and with perforations per frame The camera like the projector has a vacuum system this makes the camera noisy forbidding the sync sound recording of quiet scenes The camera has enough film for three minutes of shooting The large frame of the film also imposes optical limitations such as an extremely shallow depth of field when shooting with an open aperture br br br Soundtrack double system br To use more of the image area IMAX film does not include an embedded soundtrack Instead the IMAX system specifies a separate six channel mm in magnetic film recorded and played back on a film follower locked to picture just as Vitaphone had been utilizing inch RPM electrical transcription discs in the early th century and was the same technology used to provide the channel soundtrack accompanying films photographed and exhibited in the Cinerama process in the mid s By the early s a separate DTS based track digital sound system was used similarly locked to the projector by a SMPTE time code synchronization apparatus the audio played off a series of proprietarily encoded CD ROM discs In the late s IMAX upgraded this system to use a hard drive that carries a single uncompressed audio file These are converted directly to analogue rather than processed through a decoding method such as DTS The new generation of IMAX with Laser Projectors use IMAX channel sound while and Xenon Projectors use IMAX channel br Like conventional theatres IMAX theatres place speakers both directly behind the acoustically transparent screen and around the theatre to create a surround sound effect IMAX also provides a top center speaker in addition to the centre speaker found in conventional theatres This extra channel allows the sound mix engineers to take advantage of the screen s greater height br br br Projectors br br Transporting the large film stock through the optical system presented challenges for both the camera and the projector Conventional mm systems were not steady enough for the magnification On the projector side William Shaw adapted an Australian patent no for film transport called the rolling loop by adding a compressed air puffer to accelerate the film and put a cylindrical lens in the projector s aperture block The rolling loop mechanism is used to move the film in projectors and cameras the sprockets in the film are only used for registration as the film is too large to be moved with sprockets at the necessary speeds for projection and filming without damage br The projector uses a vacuum to pull the film into contact with this lens Thus the field flattener flattens the image field The lens is twice the height of the film and connects to a pneumatic piston so it can be moved up or down while the projector is running This way if a piece of dust comes off the film and sticks to the lens the projectionist can switch to a clean portion of the lens at the push of a button The lens also has wiper bars made of a felt or brush like material that wipes dust off the lens as it moves up or down The projector uses a vacuum to keep the film flat and oriented correctly for projection The shutter of an IMAX projector is also kept open for longer than a mm projector shutter to increase image brightness br IMAX projectors are pin stabilized this means that four registration pins engage the perforations at the corners of the projected frame to ensure perfect alignment Shaw added cam controlled arms to decelerate each frame to eliminate the microscopic shaking as the frame settled onto the registration pins The projector s shutter is open around longer than in conventional equipment and the light source is brighter The xenon short arc lamps are made with a thin envelope of fused quartz and contain xenon gas at a pressure of about atmospheres psi kPa Because of this projectionists are required to wear protective body armor when changing or handling the lamp in case it breaks e g due to a drop to the floor because of the danger from flying quartz shards propelled by the high pressure of the xenon gas within this applies to all projection xenon lamps An IMAX xenon lamp runs on DC power lasts for hours and requires its own pump and water cooler The projector s optics also require compressed air cooling An IMAX projector weighs up to tonnes short tons and is over cm ft tall and cm ft long The projector is raised and locked into position before each screening br IMAX Corporation has released four projector types that use its perforation mm film format GT Grand Theatre GT D dual rotor SR Small Rotor and MPX which was designed for retrofitted theatres In July the company introduced a digital projection system which it has not given a distinct name or brand designed for multiplex theatres with screens no wider than m ft All IMAX projectors except the standard GT system can project D images GT D projectors require two separate lamps and polarized projection optics br br br Digital projection br br The digital cinema IMAX projection system debuted in is designed for use with shorter aspect ratio screens The system uses two K projectors that can present either D or D content in DCI or IMAX Digital Format IDF which in itself is a superset of DCI IDF initially used K resolution Christie xenon projectors with a Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing DLP engine but in IMAX announced that they would be switching to Barco as their primary supplier The two K images are projected superimposed on each other with a half pixel offset using super resolution imaging to increase the perceived resolution to approximately K br For D presentations one projector is used to display the image for each eye while D presentations use the superimposed images to allow for a brighter cd m image The Digital IMAX projection system includes a proprietary IMAX Image Enhancer that modifies the output of the digital media server based on feedback from cameras and microphones in the auditorium and maintains alignment with sub pixel accuracy br Mainly because the system facilitates inexpensive distribution of IMAX features the company announced in February that they were renovating specially selected locations around the world to present both mm analog as well as digital presentations To do so IMAX developed a rail system that moves the projectors in and out to accommodate either a full frame film print or a digital only release These theaters were prepared in time for the release of The Dark Knight Rises in July br br br Laser projection br In April IMAX began testing a new K laser projection system based on patents licensed from Eastman Kodak Like the D film and digital systems it used two projectors but it improved over the smaller digital screens by retaining the traditional IMAX aspect ratio and let films be shown on screens m ft wide or more In December IMAX began rolling out its new dual K laser projector system dubbed IMAX with Laser and known as IMAX GT with the first installation occurring at the Cineplex Scotiabank Theatre in Toronto The system allows digital projection of the aspect ratio surface of a traditional IMAX screen but can also be used on other screens such as the aspect ratio TCL Chinese Theater br The system replaces the xenon arc lamp of a traditional digital projector with a laser light source and is capable of fps with percent greater brightness than the Digital Cinema Initiatives spec a contrast ratio double that of IMAX mm film projection and higher than the contrast ratio of IMAX s xenon lamp based projection systems and displaying the full Rec color gamut The system also features a new channel surround sound system which adds an additional speaker on either side of the theater as well as four new overhead speakers br While still not matching the theoretical resolution of traditional IMAX film which is estimated at up to lines of horizontal resolution on the mm camera negative K and approximately on a mm release print K the new laser system features dual K resolution projectors each capable of displaying four times the detail of one Digital IMAX projector Like Digital IMAX images from the two projectors are projected superimposed on each other with a half pixel offset using super resolution imaging which makes the perceived resolution greater than K In theater cameras and microphones are used to automatically calibrate the projectors and sound system between showings For D presentations one projector is used to display the image for each eye while D presentations use the superimposed images to allow for a brighter image For D presentations IMAX with Laser systems use dichroic filter glasses similar to those used by Dolby D as opposed to the linear polarization glasses used in Digital IMAX theaters br On April IMAX announced that they would begin rolling out a new single unit version of their laser projector system later that year with this iteration designed to replace the IMAX Xenon digital projection system for screens br br br Theatres br IMAX theatres are described as either Classic Design purpose built structures or Multiplex Design retrofitted auditoriums Classic IMAX theatre construction differs significantly from conventional theatres The increased resolution lets the audience be much closer to the screen Typically all rows are within one screen height conventional theatre seating runs to screen heights Also the rows of seats are set at a steep angle up to in some domed theatres so that the audience is facing the screen directly br The world s largest IMAX screen currently stands in Leonberg near Stuttgart Germany and measures by m by ft Until the Leonberg IMAX opened in the largest operating IMAX screen was located within the Melbourne Museum in Melbourne Australia measuring m m ft ft Until its demolition in the world s largest IMAX screen had been in Darling Harbour Sydney Australia measuring m m ft ft It reopened on October with a screen measuring square meters by m by ft within The Ribbon building after years of extensive redevelopment making it the world s third largest screen br br br Variations br br br Dome and Omnimax br br In the late s the San Diego Hall of Science now known as the Reuben H Fleet Science Center began searching North America for a large format film system to project on the dome of their planned m ft tilted dome planetarium The standard IMAX projector was unsuitable for use inside a dome because it had a m ft tall lamp house on top IMAX Corporation redesigned its system adding an elevator to lift the projector to the center of the dome from the projection booth below Spectra Physics designed a suitable lamphouse that took smaller cm in lamps and placed the bulb behind the lens instead of above the projector In Ernst Leitz Canada Ltd now ELCAN Optical Technologies won a contract to develop and manufacture a fisheye lens projection system optimized to project an image onto a dome instead of a flat screen br The dome system which the San Diego Hall of Science called Omnimax uses films shot with a camera equipped with a fisheye lens that squeezes a highly distorted anamorphic field of view onto the mm IMAX film The lens is aligned below the center of the frame and most of the bottom half of the circular field falls beyond the edge of the film The part of the field that would fall below the edge of the dome is masked When filming the camera is aimed upward at an angle that matches the tilt of the dome When projected through a matching fisheye lens onto a dome the original panoramic view is recreated Omnimax wraps horizontally above the horizon and below the horizon for a viewer at the center of the dome Omnimax premiered in showing Voyage to the Outer Planets produced by Graphic Films and Garden Isle by Roger Tilton Films on a double bill Later in the s a successful Omnimax center was built at Caesars Palace Las Vegas and ran strongly through the s and s eventually being closed and rebuilt br IMAX has since renamed its Omnimax system IMAX Dome but some theaters primarily those opened before the s continue to call it Omnimax br IMAX Dome theatres are used in theme parks and many North American museums particularly those with a scientific focus where the technical aspects of the system may be highlighted as part of the attraction The projection room is often windowed to allow public viewing of the equipment in operation and it is often accompanied by informational placards like other exhibits For some theaters before the show begins the screen can be backlit to show the speakers and girders behind it br The screen may be a permanent fixture such as at the Museum of Science and Industry Henry Crown Space Center in Chicago Illinois the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia Pennsylvania the St Louis Science Center Boston s Museum of Science Richmond s Science Museum of Virginia the Charlotte Observer IMAX Dome Theatre at Discovery Place Charlotte North Carolina Birmingham Alabama s McWane Science Center US Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville Alabama the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland Ohio the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto Ontario and Science World in Vancouver British Columbia br Alternatively the dome may be lowered and raised as needed such as at the Science Museum of Minnesota and the former installation at the Canadian Museum of History where it shared an auditorium with a standard IMAX screen all replaced with a Barco CINE digital theatre system in The entire dome could be raised to show flat screen features and repositioned for immersive features br While the majority of museum installations focus on educational and documentary films on special occasions entertainment films are also shown such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry The largest screen in North America is at the Science World in Vancouver British Columbia which has a dome screen metres ft in size br Due to the age of the IMAX Dome format as well as its entirely analogue nature some theatres may opt to replace their existing IMAX Dome systems with newer more versatile digital systems Examples of former IMAX Dome theatres that have had their IMAX equipment replaced with newer equipment include Tietomaa Science Centre in Oulu Finland which replaced its IMAX equipment from with a Barco DP K B K projection system in the Omni Theatre at Science Centre Singapore the National Museum of Natural Science in Taichung Taiwan which both had their original IMAX Dome projection systems installed respectively in and replaced with Evans Sutherland Digistar K digital systems in and the Jennifer Chalsty Planetarium at Liberty Science Center in Jersey City New Jersey which replaced its IMAX Dome projection system from when built was the largest IMAX Dome OMNIMAX theatre in the world with an Evans Sutherland Digistar True K digital system in br In November the Hackworth IMAX dome in The Tech Museum now The Tech Interactive replaced its mm IMAX projector with a K IMAX Laser projector It became the first digital IMAX Laser dome theater in the world br br br D br br To create the illusion of depth the IMAX D process uses two separate camera lenses that represent the left and right eyes The lenses are separated by a distance of mm in the average distance between a human s eyes Two separate rolls of film are used to capture the images they produce The IMAX D camera weighs over kg lb By projecting the two films superimposed on the screen and using one of several available methods to direct only the correct image to each eye viewers see a D image on a D screen One method is to use polarizing filters to oppositely polarize the light used in projecting each image The viewer wears glasses with polarizing filters oriented to match the projector filters so that the filter over each eye blocks the light used to project the images intended for the other eye In another method the two projections rapidly alternate While one image is being shown the projection of its mate is blocked Each frame is shown more than once to increase the rate and suppress flicker The viewer wears shutter glasses with liquid crystal shutters that block or transmit light in sync with the projectors so each eye sees only the images meant for it br Several of the early films that had been produced in digital D for release in conventional theaters were also presented in IMAX D including Avatar Gravity and The Amazing Spider Man The first full color IMAX D film was the short documentary Transitions produced for Expo in Vancouver br br br HD br Variations on IMAX included the frames per second IMAX HD process which sought to produce smoother more lifelike motion while also reducing the blurring of moving objects by doubling the normal film rate The IMAX HD system was tested in at the Canada Pavilion of the Seville Expo with the film Momentum Higher production costs and the high wear and tear on the prints and projectors doomed the IMAX HD system but not before many theatres had been retrofitted to project at frames especially in Canada in order to play Momentum In the s theme parks in Thailand Germany and Las Vegas used IMAX HD for their Motion Simulator rides The Disney parks attraction Soarin Over California features a modification of both IMAX HD and IMAX Dome projecting in frames per second br br br Digital br br Because mm film and projectors are costly difficult to produce en masse and the size of auditoriums that house full size IMAX screens make them expensive to construct IMAX debuted a digital projection system in to use with shorter aspect ratio screens It uses two K resolution projectors that can present either D or D content in DCI or IMAX Digital Format IDF which in itself is a superset of DCI The digital installations have caused some controversy as many theaters have branded their screens as IMAX after merely retrofitting standard auditoriums with IMAX digital projectors The screen sizes in these auditoriums are much smaller than those in the purpose built auditoriums of the original IMAX format and are limited to the aspect ratio Another disadvantage is the much lower resolution of digital IMAX The technology has a maximum perceived resolution of K compared to traditional IMAX mm projection which has an estimated resolution of K Some reviewers have also noted that many non IMAX theaters are projecting films at K resolution through competing brands such as Dolby Cinema and UltraAVX br IMAX has held to a uniform branding of The IMAX Experience across various underlying technologies and screen sizes Some have criticized the company s marketing approach with the format being dubbed Lie MAX The company has defended the format by saying it has a bigger screen brighter picture and better sound than standard theatres Despite the differences with digital IMAX the cost effective format has aided in the company s worldwide growth especially in Russia and China br br br IMAXShift br In May IMAX announced the test launch of IMAXShift a multimedia indoor cycling concept but decided to discontinue it June br br br Virtual reality br On September IMAX announced plans to include virtual reality VR into the IMAX theater experience with the opening of a new VR center in Los Angeles that would use a new StarVR headset created by Acer The VR experience was intended for short but interactive videos IMAX opened a total of seven IMAX VR centers and established a US million fund for the creation of VR content as well as partnering with Google for the production of IMAX VR cameras However as of May all seven IMAX VR centers have closed br br br Films br br br Entertainment br br In the US IMAX has mostly been used for specialty applications The expense and logistical challenges of producing and presenting IMAX films have led to approximately minutes shorter running times than conventional films Most are documentaries suited for institutional venues such as museums and science centers IMAX cameras have been used while orbiting the Earth climbing Mount Everest exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and visiting the Antarctic A film about the Mars Exploration Rovers titled Roving Mars used exclusive data from the rovers br An early attempt at presenting mainstream entertainment in IMAX format was The Rolling Stones Live at the Max an minute compilation of concert footage filmed in IMAX during the rock band s Steel Wheels tour edited to give the impression of a single concert In the s more entertainment short films were created notably T Rex Back to the Cretaceous in and Haunted Castle in both in D In French director Jean Jacques Annaud directed Wings of Courage the first dramatic picture shot for IMAX In and More and The Old Man and the Sea became the first short films produced using the IMAX format both earned Academy Award nominations with Old Man and the Sea becoming the only IMAX film to win an Oscar In Disney produced Fantasia the first full length animated feature initially released exclusively in the IMAX format br br br Use in Hollywood productions br Before the end of the s theatrical features were deemed impossible to run in IMAX venues at the time as there was a technical limitation on the size of the film reel where films had to run around two hours Originally IMAX and Pixar considered releasing Toy Story in IMAX D but test results showed that the render resolution could not match the size of the IMAX image DreamWorks in the early s wanted to re release Shrek in IMAX D but this too was canceled as a result of creative changes in the studio These failed attempts at re releases did inspire IMAX to experiment and improve their ability in presenting computer animation in their theaters Their compilation CyberWorld was the result which contained new original animation and IMAX presented versions of computer animated tests and music videos Cyberworld even presented open matte D versions of the bar sequence from Antz and the Homer segment from The Simpsons both coincidentally were animated at Pacific Data Images br Walt Disney Pictures became the first studio to release theatrical films in the IMAX process Released on New Year s Day in Fantasia was the studio s first IMAX release and the first theatrical feature presented in IMAX theaters It was originally planned as a standard theatrical release but in agreeing with the company to release the film the IMAX sound system incorporated a multi channel and multi layer stereo system for the orchestrated soundtrack similar to the Fantasound system Walt Disney had envisioned for the original film in The company agreed to Disney s terms and conditions to gain the exclusive first showings of the film These included a limited engagement of four months from January to April and of the box office receipts Not all IMAX cinemas were prepared to accept Disney s terms to present the film however following the IMAX release a standard mm run followed in June at regular theaters br Although Fantasia had a lukewarm financial run the critical praise for its use of the IMAX format convinced Disney to put more releases in the giant screen format in the pipeline In IMAX re issues of Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King were released in select theaters over the winter and Christmas seasons of that year New digital masters were created from the original CAPS production files and select scenes of animation were cleaned up to make use of the high resolution IMAX film negatives Treasure Planet was also released in select IMAX theaters and was the first theatrical film released in regular and IMAX theaters simultaneously But all of these releases had underwhelming box office returns and Disney canceled later big screen re releases including Aladdin br With the unveiling of the DMR process see below Warner Bros Pictures especially embraced the format beginning in with the two Matrix sequels Reloaded and Revolutions Since The Prisoner of Azkaban in Warner Bros began releasing the Harry Potter film franchise in IMAX to strong financial success Also in the studio released Robert Zemeckis motion capture film The Polar Express in IMAX D Polar Express became the most successful film released in IMAX theaters producing at least a quarter of the film s gross of million from fewer than IMAX screens Success for Warner Bros and IMAX followed in later years with I Am Legend Happy Feet Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Progressively other studios became further interested in releasing films in IMAX through the DMR process and have earned success through it In May J J Abrams s Star Trek was released in IMAX venues for the initial two weeks of its theatrical run and opened to million The IMAX opening weekends of The Avengers and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part have since grossed million br Though they were not filmed with IMAX cameras Skyfall and The Amazing Spider Man were optimized for IMAX digital screens when they were released Both movies were filmed in high resolution cameras and the digital negative ratio was equal to that of the IMAX Digital frame Skyfall increased the visual information of the entire film while Amazing Spider Man optimized the finale battle with the Lizard When James Cameron s Titanic was restored and re released in theaters there was also specially made an open matte version for IMAX In after years of successful IMAX DMR releases Warner Bros signed a deal to release up to feature films in IMAX up to including educational documentaries that were in production br In May Marvel Studios announced that its next two Avengers films Avengers Infinity War and Avengers Endgame would be filmed entirely in IMAX the first Hollywood feature films to do so using a modified version of Arri s Alexa digital camera The camera was used first to film select sequences in another Marvel production s Captain America Civil War br br br DMR Digital Media Remastering br br IMAX s proprietary DMR Digital Media Remastering process up converts conventional films to IMAX format This special digital intermediate technology let IMAX venues show films shot on mm for conventional theaters In Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones and an IMAX format re release of the film Apollo were the first official applications of the DMR process Because of projection limitations at the time the studios had to edit Apollo and Attack of the Clones to have a shorter playing time As IMAX updated the system and expanded the size of the platters the later DMR releases did not have this limitation current platters provide a run time of up to minutes Reviewers have generally praised the results of the DMR blowup process which are visually and audibly superior to the same films projected in mm But some filmmakers such as producer Frank Marshall point out that DMR blowups are not comparable to films created directly in the mm perf IMAX format and that directors Ron Howard and George Lucas expected better They note that the decline of Cinerama coincided roughly with its replacement by a simpler cheaper technically inferior version and view DMR with alarm IMAX originally reserved the phrase the IMAX experience for true mm productions but now allows its use on DMR productions as well br After The Lion King in no Hollywood studio engaged in re releasing and restoring classic films through the IMAX DMR process until although ongoing conversion of new releases continued and continued to grow in number James Cameron s Titanic underwent both D conversion and DMR conversion to D in as did Men in Black In August IMAX and Paramount Pictures announced a one week exclusive re release of Raiders of the Lost Ark on September to promote the release of the Blu Ray collection The film before it underwent DMR was already restored in a K digital intermediate with surround sound from the original negative The process for IMAX theaters like with the complete restoration was supervised by Steven Spielberg and sound designer Ben Burtt I didn t know if the print would stand up to a full IMAX transfer so I came expecting a sort of grainy muddy and overly enlarged representation of the movie I had made years ago Spielberg said I was blown away by the fact that it looked better than the movie I had made years ago br br br Feature films br br Many recent features have employed IMAX cameras for select scenes however before no full length feature film was shot entirely using IMAX cameras due to the numerous difficulties presented with the format the cameras were much larger and heavier than standard cameras and the noise they produced made dialogue recording difficult The cameras have short film loads ranging from seconds to two minutes and the cost of the film stock was much greater than standard mm film However these issues have been minimized thanks to the digital Arri Alexa IMAX camera with two films having been shot entirely with the camera br The Dark Knight features six sequences a total of minutes shot using IMAX According to the film s press notes this was the first time ever that a major feature film has been even partially shot using IMAX cameras Even before Dark Knight Nolan had wanted to shoot a film in the IMAX format and he also used it for quiet scenes that it would make pictorially interesting Nolan said that he wished that it were possible to shoot the entire film in IMAX if you could take an IMAX camera to Mount Everest or outer space you could use it in a feature movie Nolan chose to edit some of the IMAX sequences using the original camera negative to eliminate generation loss while scenes that were digitally mastered were scanned and printed out at thousand lines of horizontal resolution K When the film opened in IMAX venues in all of them were sold out for the opening weekend br A year later director Michael Bay was inspired by IMAX s use in The Dark Knight to feature big screen sequences in Transformers Revenge of the Fallen The film s co writer Roberto Orci suggested that the IMAX footage would be D but Bay later said that considering himself an old school filmmaker he found D gimmicky and added that shooting in IMAX was easier than using stereoscopic cameras The IMAX version of the film in the end contained almost ten minutes of IMAX filmed footage out of the two and a half hour film Bay later partially filmed the third Transformers film Dark of the Moon in D but without IMAX Bay returned to IMAX for the fourth film Age of Extinction in It was the first feature film shot using digital IMAX D cameras He again used IMAX D cameras while shooting the fifth film Transformers The Last Knight filming of the film with Alexa IMAX cameras attached together to a special mount br Two years later Terrence Malick s The Tree of Life filmed select sequences using IMAX cameras and often used natural light The film used a mix of mm film and regular mm and the IMAX mm format The set of guidelines they fine tuned for this film included an edict to achieve maximum resolution whenever possible We would have preferred to shoot the entire movie in IMAX says cinematographer of the film Emmanuel Lubezki When the mm and IMAX scenes do appear in the movie they give you a jolt It s a feeling of enhancement and majesty It s almost as if someone cleaned off the window you were looking through However the film wasn t screened on any IMAX screen br After The Tree of Life Brad Bird s Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol included minutes of footage shot using IMAX cameras Bird believed that using IMAX format would bring back a level of showmanship to the presentation of Hollywood films which he believes the industry has lost due to its emphasis on screening films in multiplexes as opposed to grand theaters and vetoing first runs in favor of wider initial releases He also added that the IMAX format offered the viewer more immersion than digital D due to its brighter higher quality image which is projected on a larger screen without the need for specialised glasses Ghost Protocol opened on December in almost IMAX venues worldwide a week before its wide release where it earned third place in the box office and million br As with The Dark Knight Christopher Nolan decided to film sequences of the sequel The Dark Knight Rises in mm IMAX Nolan elected not to film in D and stated that he intends to focus on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format In a then Hollywood record The Dark Knight Rises featured minutes of footage shot in mm IMAX roughly times that of The Dark Knight s minutes however this record was later overtaken by another Nolan film Dunkirk which featured minutes of IMAX Because of the considerable noise IMAX cameras make they used standard mm cameras to shoot dialogue scenes and dubbed dialogue in scenes shot with IMAX cameras Chairman and president of the IMAX Corporation Greg Foster stated that IMAX plans to run the film in its theaters for two months despite only being contractually committed to run the film for two weeks in some theaters br J J Abrams s Star Trek Into Darkness Francis Lawrence s The Hunger Games Catching Fire Luc Besson s Lucy and

the entirety of Chen Kaige Tsui Hark and Dante Lam s The Battle at Lake Changjin and The Battle at Lake Changjin II with IMAX certified Red Ranger Monstro cameras in and br Christopher Nolan used IMAX cameras again on his next film Dunkirk However unlike the previous films where he used the cameras for select sequences Nolan used IMAX as the primary shooting format with about minutes of the minute film featuring footage shot in mm IMAX breaking the aforementioned record that a previous Nolan film The Dark Knight Rises held This was possible due to the sparsity of dialogue in the film as mm IMAX cameras are notoriously noisy a few dialogue heavy scenes were shot with regular mm film cameras from Panavision IMAX cameras were also used hand held for the first time as Nolan was advised by both Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard that it was the best way to shoot on vessels Dunkirk received the widest release on mm IMAX since his last film Interstellar with the film being released on the format in theaters around the world The director s film Tenet filmed minutes with mm IMAX cameras the rest of the film was shot with regular mm film cameras from Panavision The film s six minute opening

camera in its production and the first animated film to captured it We created a virtual IMAX camera with aspect ratio and developed a pipeline to allow us to simultaneously shoot the film for IMAX and then crop down for our standard format Jane Yen Lightyear visual effects supervisor revealed during a press conference One of the two director s of photography Jeremy Lasky later said I think this is the first that has been made for IMAX in this way There s about a third of the film that was shot for IMAX And the easy answer is that we have a set of lenses And when I say lenses I mean CG made A set of lenses that recreate the look of an anamorphic lens which is your typical wide screen You ll notice things out of focus in the background instead of being round are like stretched a little bit There s like that blue lens flare that you see It s anamorphic lenses where the way to shoot wide screen in the sixties seventies and then later got phased out a little bit but they re still used today But those effects call to a period of sci fi that we were looking at which is why those same lenses or versions of those lenses were used on WALL E Later he recommend So for the or so minutes of the movie in IMAX we shot with those lenses opened up to the aspect ratio and composed for that while keeping the composition as clear and as solid for a crop from the center So the wide screen image is pulled out of the IMAX image Which all sounds really technical but all it really means is when you re watching it an IMAX screen we were thinking about those scenes as IMAX And it wasn t just some after the film was done blow up of the movie br In December it was announced that IMAX have certified the Red V Raptor as a new certified camera and that James Gunn s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol will
