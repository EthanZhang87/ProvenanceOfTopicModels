Disney on September br br br Plot br br Ten year old Carl Fredricksen idolizes famed explorer Charles Muntz who is discredited when a giant bird skeleton he brought back from Paradise Falls in South America is deemed a fake Muntz travels back to the falls vowing to not return until he can bring back a live specimen br Carl befriends Ellie another young Muntz fan who keeps a scrapbook of her adventures and dreams of moving her clubhouse an abandoned house to Paradise Falls Carl and Ellie eventually marry renovate the clubhouse and move in They work at the city zoo as a balloon salesman and zookeeper respectively Ellie suffers a miscarriage and it is implied that she cannot have children Though the couple saves money for a trip to Paradise Falls they must repeatedly spend their savings on more pressing needs Many years later a now elderly Carl decides to surprise Ellie with tickets to South America but she falls ill and is hospitalized Ellie gives Carl her scrapbook before she dies br Now in his late s Carl holds out while the neighborhood around him is redeveloped After unintentionally injuring a construction worker Carl is deemed a public menace by the court and ordered to move to an assisted living facility However Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie to move their house to Paradise Fall and attaches thousands of balloons to it to fly there Russell a young Wilderness Explorer scout attempting to earn his final merit badge for assisting the elderly becomes an accidental stowaway Before Carl can land and send Russell home a storm propels the house all the way to South America br The house lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still buoyant house and begin to tug it across the mesa Along the way they encounter a giant flightless female bird whom Russell names Kevin and Dug a Golden Retriever whose collar has a device that translates his thoughts into human speech After failed attempts to get rid of the animals Carl reluctantly allows both to join the party br A pack of dogs all wearing collar translators surrounds them The dogs master is revealed to be a year old Charles Muntz Muntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his airship and talks about his quest to capture a bird Carl s initial excitement over meeting his hero fades as he becomes aware that Muntz s obsession has driven him insane After Muntz shows them a skeleton of the bird Russell notes its resemblance to Kevin Turning hostile Muntz shows Carl the skulls of travelers he suspected of also seeking the bird Carl Russell and Dug flee pursued by Muntz s dogs they are rescued by Kevin who gets injured in the process br Hearing Kevin call out to her chicks Carl agrees to take her home However Muntz captures her and starts a fire beneath Carl s home Forced to choose Carl saves his home allowing Muntz to take Kevin away Russell is distraught and Dug leaves br Disheartened Carl looks through his wife s scrapbook and discovers that she filled in blank pages with photos of their life together and wrote Thanks for the adventure now go have a new one Reinvigorated he goes outside only to see Russell setting out after Kevin

hiding on Carl s back porch board the dirigible and free him and Kevin Muntz pursues them and traps Russell Kevin and Dug inside the house Carl saves them just as the tether breaks Muntz leaps after

Muntz s airship Russell receives his Assisting the Elderly badge and Carl presents Russell with a grape soda bottle cap Ellie gave Carl when they first met which he dubs The Ellie Badge Unbeknownst to Carl the house lands on the cliff overlooking Paradise Falls fulfilling his promise to Ellie br br br Voice cast br br Ed Asner as Carl Fredricksen an elderly widower and retired balloon salesman Docter and Rivera noted Asner s television alter ego Lou Grant had been helpful in writing for Carl because it guided them in balancing likable and unlikable aspects of the curmudgeonly character The appearance of Carl was designed to resemble Spencer Tracy as he appeared in his final film Guess Who s Coming to Dinner When they met Asner and presented him with a model of his character he joked I don t look anything like that They tailored his dialogue for him with short sentences and more consonants which cemented the notion that Carl post Ellie is a disgruntled bear that s been poked awake during hibernation br Jordan Nagai as Russell an eight year old Wilderness Explorer Throughout most of the film he makes several comments to Carl that suggest that Russell s father and mother are separated or divorced br Christopher Plummer as Charles Muntz an elderly explorer and Carl s childhood idol whose long search for the Monster of Paradise Falls has driven him murderously insane The name of his airship the Spirit of Adventure may have been inspired by Charles Lindbergh s airplane Spirit of St Louis In various interviews Pete Docter mentioned Howard Hughes and real life adventurers Lindbergh and Percy Fawcett as inspirations for Muntz Reviewers noted his resemblance to Kirk Douglas br Bob Peterson as Dug a talking Golden Retriever Peterson knew he would voice Dug when he wrote his line I have just met you and I love you which was based on what a child told him when he was a camp counselor in the s The DVD release of the film features a short called Dug s Special Mission which follows Dug just before his first meeting with Carl and Russell Dug previously appeared in Ratatouille as a shadow on a wall that barks at Remy br Delroy Lindo Jerome Ranft and Peterson voiced Muntz s dogs Beta Gamma and Alpha respectively John Ratzenberger played construction foreman Tom and David Kaye the newsreel announcer Pete Docter s daughter Elie and Jeremy Leary voiced younger versions of Ellie and Carl respectively Other cast members include Mickie T McGowan as police officer Edith Danny Mann as construction worker Steve Donald Fullilove credited as Don and Jess Harnell as Shady Oaks nurses George and A J Josh Cooley as Muntz s dog Omega and Docter himself credited as camp master Strauch and uncredited as Kevin br br br Production br br br Development br br Originally titled Heliums Up was conceived in by director Pete Docter He developed the fantasy of a flying house on the idea of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up When Bob Peterson had to leave the project for three months to work on Ratatouille as a co director which had been struggling with story problems actor and writer Tom McCarthy stepped in to work with Docter on the story while Peterson was gone and came up with the character Russell Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons The two men thought an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt their experiences and the way they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor Docter was not concerned about an elderly protagonist stating that children would relate to Carl the way they relate to their grandparents br Early concepts differed from the final film The initial version featured a floating city on an alien planet populated with muppet like creatures with two brothers vying to inherit their father s kingdom and when the brothers fell to Earth they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other But the story just didn t seem to work properly and Docter and Peterson realized that the most intriguing element was the isolation of the floating city Yet the people living there would consist of a whole community and were therefore not really isolated So the whole city was stripped down to a single flying house with just a single occupant where balloons replaced the magic which kept the floating city up After that they got the idea to use an old person and found the contrast between the elderly grumpy man and the happy balloons in Docter s drawing appealing inspiring them to work out his backstory The next concept introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing Another idea Docter added then removed was magic fountain of youth eggs laid by the bird in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl but they decided this subplot was too distracting and people would forgive the minor inconsistency Also the biggest single influence on Up early on was The Station Agent by Tom McCarthy br Docter noted the film reflects his friendships with Disney veterans Frank Thomas Ollie Johnston and Joe Grant who all died before the film s release and thus the film was dedicated to them Grant gave the script his approval as well as some advice before his death in Docter recalled Grant would remind him the audience needed an emotional bedrock because of how wacky the adventure would become here it is Carl mourning for his wife Docter felt Grant s personality influenced Carl s deceased wife Ellie more than the grouchy main character and Carl was primarily based on Spencer Tracy Walter Matthau James Whitmore and their own grandparents because there was something sweet about these grumpy old guys Docter and Jonas Rivera noted Carl s charming nature in spite of his grumpiness derives from the elderly hav ing this charm and almost this old man license to say things that other people couldn t get away with It s like how we would go to eat with Joe Grant and he would call the waitresses honey I wish I could call a waitress honey br Docter revealed the filmmakers first story outline had Carl just want ing to join his wife up in the sky It was almost a kind of strange suicide mission or something And obviously that s a problem Once he gets airborne then what So we had to have some goal for him to achieve that he had not yet gotten As a result they added the plot of going to South America The location was chosen due to both Docter s love of tropical locations but also in wanting a location Carl could be stuck with a kid due to the inability to leave him with an authority such as a police officer or social worker They implemented a child character as a way to help Carl stop being stuck in his ways br Dug was created by Docter and Peterson for a different project that never materialized and brought him over to Up Docter felt it would be refreshing to show what a dog thinks rather than what people assume it thinks Knowledge of canine communication body language and pack behaviors for the artists and animators to portray such thoughts came from consultant Dr Ian Dunbar veterinarian dog behaviorist and trainer The idea for Alpha s voice derived from thinking about what would happen if someone broke a record player and it always played at a high pitch The talking dog collars were invented to give Carl someone to talk with in the absence of human companions as Dug and Kevin were added to the story at an earlier stage than Russell The presence of Russell as well as that of the construction workers helped make the story feel less episodic br Docter auditioned boys in a nationwide casting call for the part of Russell Nagai who is Japanese American showed up to an audition with his brother who was actually the one auditioning Docter realized Nagai behaved and spoke non stop like Russell and chose him for the part Nagai was eight years old when cast Docter encouraged Nagai to act physically as well as vocally when recording the role lifting him upside down and tickling him for the scene where Russell encounters Kevin East Asian Americans have positively noted Pixar s first casting of an East Asian lead character in contrast to the common practice of casting non East Asians in East Asian parts particularly in the role of an all American boy without any stereotypes typically seen with East Asian characters such as martial arts br Carl s relationship with Russell reflects how he s not really ready for the whirlwind that a kid is as few of us are Docter added he saw Up as a coming of age tale and an unfinished love story with Carl still dealing with the loss of his wife He cited inspiration from Casablanca and A Christmas Carol which are both resurrection stories about men who lose something and regain purpose during their journey Docter and Rivera cited inspirations from the Muppets Hayao Miyazaki Dumbo and Peter Pan They also saw parallels to The Wizard of Oz and tried to make Up not feel too similar There is a scene where Carl and Russell haul the floating house through the jungle A Pixar employee compared the scene to Fitzcarraldo and Docter watched that film and The Mission for further inspiration br Charles Muntz comes from Howard Hughes and Errol Flynn In the DVD extra The Many Endings of Muntz Docter and his team talked about their struggle to figure out the character s ultimate fate They considered having him redeem himself or survive unrepentant but eventually decided that as almost a representation of Carl s old self Muntz has to die br Overall the budget was approximately million br br br Animation br br Docter made Venezuela the film s setting after Ralph Eggleston gave him a video of the tepui mountains of Canaima National Park tepuis were previously featured in another Disney film Dinosaur In Docter and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days reaching Monte Roraima by airplane by jeep and by helicopter They also spent three nights there painting and sketching and encountering ants mosquitoes scorpions frogs and snakes They then flew to Matawi Tepui and climbed to Angel Falls Docter felt we couldn t use the rocks and plants we saw Reality is so far out if we put it in the movie you wouldn t believe it The film s creatures were also challenging to design because they had to fit in the surreal environment of the tepuis but also they had to be realistic because those mountains exist in real life The filmmakers then visited the Sacramento Zoo to observe a Himalayan monal for Kevin s animation The animators designed Russell as an Asian American and modeled Russell after similar looking Peter Sohn a Pixar storyboard artist who is Korean American The Pixar employees frequently sketch each other during meetings and a drawing of Sohn became the model for Russell br While the studio usually designs their characters to be caricatured Carl was even more so being only at least three heads high He was not given elderly features such as liver spots or hair in his ears to keep him appealing yet giving him wrinkles pockmarks on his nose a hearing aid and a cane to make him appear elderly Docter wanted to push a stylized feel particularly the way Carl s head is proportioned he has a squarish appearance to symbolize his containment within his house while Russell is rounded like a balloon The challenge on Up was making these stylized characters feel natural although Docter remarked the effect came across better than animating the realistic humans from Toy Story who suffered from the uncanny valley Cartoonists Al Hirschfeld Hank Ketcham and George Booth influenced the human designs Simulating realistic cloth on caricatured humans was harder than creating the balloons flying the house New programs were made to simulate the cloth and for Kevin s iridescent feathers To animate old people Pixar animators would study their own parents or grandparents and also watched footage of the Senior Olympics The directors had various rules for Carl s movements he could not turn his head more than degrees without turning his torso as well nor could he raise his arms high However they also wanted him to grow more flexible near the end of the film transforming into an action hero br A technical director calculated that to make Carl s house fly he would require million balloons but Docter realized that such a high number made the balloons look like small dots Instead the balloons created were made to be twice Carl s size There are balloons for shots of the house just flying balloons for the lift off sequence and a varying number in other scenes br br br Music br br Up is the third Pixar film to be scored by Michael Giacchino after The Incredibles and Ratatouille What Pete Docter wanted most importantly out of the music was the emotion so Giacchino wrote a character theme based score that producer Jonas Rivera thought enhanced the story At the beginning of the movie when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz the first piece of music heard is Muntz s Theme which starts out as a celebratory theme and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears years later Ellie s Theme is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions for instance during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement Giacchino has compared the film to opera since each character has a unique theme that changes during a particular moment in the story br The score was released as a digital download on May three days before the film opened in theaters It won the Academy Award for Best Original Score the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music It is the first score for a Pixar film to win the Oscar Randy Newman also won for Monsters Inc and Toy Story but in the category of Best Original Song br br br Release br The minute film Up opened the nd Cannes Film Festival on May the first animated film to do so followed by a premiere on May at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood Los Angeles Up was initially scheduled for release on June but was later moved up to May The film was also released in D format a first for a Pixar film Despite Pixar s track record Target Corporation and Walmart stocked few Up items while its regular collaborator Thinkway Toys did not produce any merchandise claiming the film s story was unusual and would be hard to promote Disney acknowledged not every Pixar film would have to become a franchise In Colombia unexpected publicity for the film was generated due to the uncanny similarity of Carl with Colombian ex president Julio C sar Turbay Ayala Docter intended for audiences to take a specific point from the film saying br br Basically the message of the film is that the real adventure of life is the relationship we have with other people and it s so easy to lose sight of the things we have and the people that are around us until they are gone More often than not I don t really realize how lucky I was to have known someone until they re either moved or passed away So if you can kind of wake up a little bit and go Wow I ve got some really cool stuff around me every day then that s what the movie s about br Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released Up on Blu ray and DVD on

flying adventure is a tidy minute distillation of all the signature touches that came before it Although the San Francisco Chronicle noted that the film contains many boring stretches of mindless freneticism and bland character interaction it also declared that there are scenes in Up of such beauty economy and poetic wisdom that they belong in any anthology of great movie moments to watch Up with any attention is to be moved and astonished by the economy with which specific visuals are invested with emotion throughout the film Variety enthused that Up is an exceptionally refined picture unlike so many animated films it s not all about sensory bombardment and volume Unsurprisingly no one puts a foot wrong here Vocal performances exude a warm enthusiasm and tech specifications could not be better Michael Giacchino s full bodied traditional score is superlative The Globe and Mail stated that Up is the kind of movie that leaves you asking How do people come up with this stuff along with an overall positive review of the film despite it being predictable br The character of Carl Fredricksen has received mostly positive reception Bill Capodagli author of Innovate the Pixar Way praised Carl for his ability to be a jerk and likable at the same time Wall Street Journal editor Joe Morgenstern described Carl as gruff comparing him to Buster Keaton but adds that this begins to wear thin as the movie progresses He has been compared with Spencer Tracy an influence on the character by The Washington Post editor Ann Hornaday and Empire editor Ian Freer who describes him as similar to a Guess Who s Coming to Dinner era Tracy Entertainment Weekly editor Lisa Schwarzbaum described his appearance as a cross between Tracy and an eccentric out of a George Booth cartoon Time editor Richard Corliss also makes the comparison calling him a trash compacted version of Tracy He has also been compared to Walter Matthau another inspiration for the character s design by LA Weekly editor Scott Foundas suggesting that actor Ed Asner was channeling him while performing the role of Carl Variety editor Todd McCarthy described Carl as a combination of both Tracy and Matthau br The relationship between Carl and his wife Ellie has been praised in several media outlets In his book Disney Pixar and the Hidden Message of Children s Films author M Keith Booker described the love between Carl and Ellie as touching While also describing the scene of the two of them aging as a masterpiece of its own kind he was not sure how much children would appreciate the scene commenting that his son was squirming in his seat during the scene Reelviews editor James Berardinelli praised their relationship stating that it brought a tear to his eye in a way no animated film has done including anything by famed anime director Hayao Miyazaki Ann Hornaday praised the prologue describing it as worthy of Chaplin in its heartbreaking poignancy Chicago Tribune editor Michael Phillips praised the scene describing it as an emotional and cinematic powerhouse and that he also was nearly moved to tears However Salon editor Stephanie Zacharek criticized the love between Carl and Ellie describing their marriage as resembling a dental adhesive commercial more than a real relationship br Asner was praised in several media outlets for his portrayal of Carl San Francisco Chronicle editor Mick LaSalle praised Asner as a great choice due to having a grumpiness to his voice that is not truly grumpy but rather coming from a protective stance Entertainment Weekly editor Lisa Schwarzbaum praised Asner s acting stating that he has a Lou Grant authority to his voice Time editor Richard Corliss stated that Asner had the gruffness and deadpan comic timing to bring Carl to life The Boston Globe editor Ty Burr concurred with this stating that his Lou Grant like voice had not diminished with time USA Today editor Claudia Puig praised Asner s delivery describing it as superb br The formulation of Russell as an Asian American character along with the casting of an Asian American in the role was met positively as well Both Nagai and the film were awarded by the East West Players for the depiction of Russell EWP lauded Pixar for the creation of the character stating We are proud to honor a very progressive film company like Pixar who cast an Asian American character alongside an elderly one to play the leads in a feature film The character is noted as Pixar s first lead Asian character and was further positively received within the added context of historical non Asian castings for Asian roles in entertainment Asian American organizations and entertainment websites such as media watchdog Media Action Network for Asian Americans MANAA Racebending com and Angry Asian Man praised the character and Pixar for its diverse character depictions noting the general lack of Asian American lead characters and Asian actors cast in entertainment In an interview with NPR in Angry Asian Man s Phil Yu reflected on the character s lack of typical Asian stereotyping stating You know he just happens to be Asian and he s you know really adorable character But that kid could ve been of any ethnicity but they made the effort to make him Asian just a little color you know and it s really wonderful when that kind of thing happens where they don t have to play that up and make it like a thing or a joke which happens a lot br Up was included on a number of best of lists It appeared on professional rankings from Empire based on retrospective appraisal as one of the
