and a wall of mist trapped everyone in the forest Agnarr barely escaped helped by an unknown savior br Three years after her coronation Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna the snowman Olaf the iceman Kristoff and Kristoff s reindeer Sven One night Elsa hears a mysterious voice calling her She follows it unintentionally awakening the elemental spirits who are forcing everyone in the kingdom to evacuate The Rock Troll colony arrives and Grand Pabbie tells the sisters they must set things right by uncovering the truth about the past Elsa Anna Olaf Kristoff and Sven follow the mysterious voice and travel to the Enchanted Forest br The mist parts at Elsa s touch while the air spirit appears as a tornado catching everyone in its vortex until Elsa stops it by turning the

Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another Anna and Elsa arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother Queen Iduna was a Northuldran who had saved the Arendellian Agnarr The Northuldra tell them about a fifth spirit who is meant to reunite the people with the magic of nature br While Kristoff and Sven stay with the Northuldra Elsa Anna and Olaf continue north They find their parents wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan a mythical river said to explain the past Elsa sends Anna and Olaf to safety and continues alone She encounters and tames the N kk the water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her is the memory of young Iduna and that her powers are a gift from nature because of Iduna s selfless saving of Agnarr She learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce Northuldran resources because of Runeard s contempt for the tribe s connection with magic and that he began the conflict by murdering the Northuldran leader in cold blood Elsa sends this information to Anna before she becomes frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan This also causes Olaf to fade away from existence br Upon discovering the truth Anna concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored and the forest to be freed She awakens the earth spirit J tunn and lures it towards the dam The massive rock giants hurl boulders destroying the dam and sending a flood down the fjord towards the kingdom Elsa is released and rides the water spirit to Arendelle where she freezes the flood and saves the kingdom As the mist disappears she rejoins Anna and revives Olaf Realizing she is the fifth spirit herself Elsa explains to Anna that they are the

created by Elsa br br br Production br br br Conception br br Producer Peter Del Vecho said on March that he Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee collaborated well and he envisioned another Frozen related project The following month Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F Horn said that a sequel would not be immediately forthcoming because the studio was focusing on a Broadway musical adaptation of Frozen In a May CNBC interview with David Faber the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said that the company would not force the development of a sequel because it was concerned about not living up to the first film Iger said that the Frozen franchise is something that is kind of forever for the company similar to The Lion King br On June Lee confirmed that Walt Disney Studios CCO John Lasseter had authorized her and Buck to explore a possible sequel While working on the short film Frozen Fever they realized that they missed the characters Meanwhile Del Vecho had been asked by fans about Frozen s future Lee Buck and Del Vecho discussed the possibility of a sequel Buck later said The one thing that we did right away was to figure out what would be satisfying for Anna and Elsa at the end of the movie They decided on ending the sequel with Anna becoming the queen of Arendelle while Elsa would be free br br br Development br br Iger Lasseter and actor Josh Gad announced at Disney s March annual shareholders meeting in San Francisco that Frozen II a full length sequel was in development Buck and Lee would return as directors and Del Vecho as producer The production team traveled to Norway Finland and Iceland for background research they decided to make Elsa a mythic hero with magic ice powers and Anna a fairytale hero who lives in a magical world but has no magic powers They concluded that the first film successfully combined the two elements Allison Schroeder was hired to assist Lee with the script in August after Lee succeeded Lasseter as Disney Animation s CCO Lee was credited as the film s screenwriter and Schroeder was credited with additional screenplay material The film s story contributions were made by Lee Buck Marc Smith Kristen Anderson Lopez and Robert Lopez Overall the budget was approximately million br Voice recording began in September although Menzel started a couple of weeks later due to a concert tour That month Gad announced his role in the sequel with Buck Lee Del Vecho and Lasseter In July Variety reported that Wood and Brown were in talks to join the cast Their roles were later disclosed as Iduna and Lieutenant Destin Mattias Wood was cast because her voice resembled Menzel and Bell s The voice of Agnarr was changed from Maurice LaMarche to Molina The Voice s four note call derived from the Latin sequence Dies irae is delivered in a manner resembling the Scandinavian music form kulning br Frozen II s first completed scenes were test screened at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in June where Becky Bresee and effects animation head Marlon West said that the film was still in production with seven weeks of animation to be completed and weeks of special effects The filmmakers collaborated with S mi experts on the depiction of the Northuldra tribe with Verdett an advisory group which was the result of an agreement between the Walt Disney Company the transnational Saami Council and the S mi parliaments of Finland Norway and Sweden Anderson Lopez confirmed that Elsa would have no female love interest in the film despite some fans desire for one Lee later explained to The New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd that Elsa s main audience did not seem ready for such a relationship Lee also stated in a press conference that Frozen II would not acquire elements from the television series Once Upon a Time s Frozen storyline which was part of its fourth season br Frozen II underwent significant revisions after its first test screening in San Diego Disney Animation discovered that although adults liked the film children found it hard to follow The production team realized they needed to clarify the identity of the Voice and the point of Elsa s transformation and add more comedy and shots of Bruni the fire salamander A scene of expository dialogue in which the lead characters explained to the people trapped in the Enchanted Forest why they had come there was replaced with Olaf s humorous recap of Frozen Due to the changes the animators needed to create new shots and redo another An undisclosed number of shots were cut from the finished film about a dozen animators and artists worked for two months on an elaborate resurrection scene for Olaf before it was cut br The last major animation scene completed before the production team locked the picture was Show Yourself the musical number in which Elsa enters Ahtohallan and learns all the secrets she has been seeking According to Del Vecho the scene required all of the resources at the studio to get the film done on time Lopez said that the first draft of Show Yourself was very different from its final version Megan Harding directed an official documentary series on the production of Frozen II which depicted the process of Del Vecho and Lopez determining The Voice s identity Once the production team settled on Queen Iduna the lyrics of Show Yourself finally began to come together but then the studio s artists designers and animators needed to quickly figure out how to stage the dramatic culmination of Elsa s journey towards becoming the Snow Queen The film was edited by Jeff Draheim br br br Design br Costume and character designs underwent several revisions before they were finalized According to designer Griselda Sastrawinata Lemay the process was the most intricate of any animated film Technological advancements allowed the designer to create more detailed outfits with extra beads and sequins The team used Marvelous Designer a computer generated imagery CGI program to drape each character s clothing br Anna s outfit was inspired by the Norwegian folk bunad worn during the s and s Typically made of wool it had decorative embroidery Anna lost the pigtail braid she had in Frozen because she is three years older in Frozen II and it was replaced by a braid across the back of her head Aging Elsa three years was inspired by artists Alexander McQueen and Elie Saab Saab s designs had long trains and cumbersome floor length hemlines the designers instead created a tailored coat with a double panel cape and epaulettes highlighting Elsa s strength br The animation team used a curve based method for the intricate embroidery A program interpreted two dimensional visual designs as line strokes rendering them as curves This allowed quick changes minimizing manual work during design modifications It also supported free form stitching with threads of various widths colors and densities crucial to the production of a variety of embroidery styles br br br Animation br About people of them animators were involved in the production of Frozen II Tony Smeed and Becky Bresee were the film s heads of animation Hyun Min Lee replaced Bresee as supervising animator for Anna while Wayne Unten again served as supervising animator for Elsa as he had done on Frozen Steve Golberg was the supervising animator for visual effects Scott Beattie was the director of cinematography layout while Mohit Kallianpur was the director of cinematography lighting br Frozen II made use of advancements in technology artistic performance and skeletal animation Before the animation began Unten showed scenes of superheroes like Frozone to Elsa s animators as examples of what to avoid Creating the personal flurry effect was so difficult for the animators that the directors had Elsa put a permafrost coating on Olaf in Frozen II instead Elsa s graceful movements were modeled on Frozen and modern dance particularly Martha Graham s work br In accordance with Disney s preference for a different style for each film and the directors and production designer s artistic vision the multi departmental animation team was instructed to reconstruct the characters so they were slightly different in tone and style from Frozen They differed in very subtle ways with a through line from the first movie to the second As well as making the Enchanted Forest vegetation autumnal the effects team applied two internally developed applications Vegetation Asset and Fire Tree to enhance the film s vegetation and fire animation Lighting and special effects were applied to glacial ice spirit magic and memory br The first step for the animation team was to study the screenplay and understand the characters Blocking creating key poses was next followed by CGI and layout Effects were proposed for layout before animation process to choreograph the dam collapse scene Although Frozen s greatest difficulty for Frozen was the winter snow Frozen II is set in fall its main challenge was how to consistently depict the wind and pass that downstream br Frozen II s animation software was influenced by the software in several other Disney films Anna s hair was animated with Quicksilver developed for Moana to deal with wind for Elsa s hair the lighting software Beast was used A vocal coach instructed the animators on how a singer would breathe The animators then spent about eight months creating N kk which has a liquid appearance with effects supervised by Erin Ramos J tunns had a long rigging process to avoid making rocks distracting The water simulation was intended to be more realistic than in Moana To create Gale the wind spirit a tool called Swoop was developed They later received real time feedback from the supervisors directors and producer br br br Music br br Lopez and Anderson Lopez returned from Frozen to write songs for the sequel and Christophe Beck returned as composer The soundtrack album was released on November after the release of Panic at the Disco s version of one of the film s songs Into the Unknown The seven song album also contains a remix of Reindeer s Are Better Than People from Frozen br Beck said that the score conveys Elsa and Anna s emotional growth matured and introduc ing more sophisticated musical concepts and thematic elements He wanted it to reflect the film s complex intense imagery Anderson Lopez described the album s theme as a meta story Although Harding sent a camera crew to the Lopez home in Brooklyn to document their songwriting and composing the composers found the crew intrusive and did most of their work off camera br br br Thematic analysis br br The indigenous S mi people were historically associated with reindeer and identified with the animals strength Trude Fonneland wrote that a female divinity emphasized female contributions with themes including unity courage hope friendship and truth Elsa attempted to send Anna away because she was concerned about her sister s safety br In animation female characters embody female images as a whole The film s female characters are emotionally diverse motivated by social status and awakening of feminism The elegant noble Elsa wants to be free and live a normal life and Anna is dreamy cheerful and enthusiastic both acted to defend their kingdom from danger br Frozen II has been interpreted as a critique of colonialism and as advocating reparation Before Elsa and Anna were born their grandfather King Runeard built a dam for the Northuldra tribe Ostensibly a gift the dam weakens the tribe s magical power Runeard s plot fails after he murders the leader of Northuldra and war breaks out The forest spirits which preside over Northuldra shroud it in an impenetrable mist preventing anyone from leaving or entering The Northuldra are modeled on the S mi people indigenous to Scandinavia and northwestern Russia who experienced discrimination as pagans reputed to be skilled in magic and witchcraft In King Christian IV of Denmark wrote that the S mi were adept at magic and no mercy should be granted in cases involving S mi sorcery Nordic missionaries confiscated or destroyed religious items and sites and built churches to supplant S mi shamanism br br br The Northuldra dam reflects S mi history A hydroelectric power station was built on the Altaelva river in Norway from to the controversial Virdnej vr Dam flooded a S mi village disrupting traditional hunting and herding Slate critic Inkoo Kang said that although Frozen II was obviously influenced by S mi history the Northuldra may also be interpreted as representing displaced Native Americans Arendelle can be seen as representing the United States colonial past evocative of the embellished life of Pocahontas The Northuldra are presented in an appealing way romanticized as a people with magical power who live in harmony with the spiritual and physical worlds br While Elsa attempts to find out who was calling her Anna destroys the dam to make amends to the Northuldra for Arendelle s mistakes Elsa s last minute intervention prevents the destruction of the kingdom but Anna destroys the dam in the belief that Elsa is dead According to Kang the film promotes reparations for past atrocities Matt Goldberg wrote that the symbolism of the film s ending is undercut by having Elsa save Arendelle instead of rebuilding the kingdom elsewhere br Racial issues in Frozen II are mitigated by making Elsa and Anna half Northuldran and their mother is depicted as a heroine who saved their father King Agnarr from death during the battle br Jennifer Baldwin described Frozen II as a film about trauma transformation and faith communities more active role in environmental repair Environmental trauma is caused by the dam which weakens the elemental spirits Olaf describes the forest as a place of transformation including venturing into the unknown befriending the spirits and the indigenous Northuldra and confronting trauma Elsa gains the trust of the spirits each leading her closer to the truth and her transformation into one of the elements Anna employs the giants symbolic of the earth to break the dam symbolic of trauma and mistrust and gains her own strength independent of her relationship with Elsa According to Baldwin this encourages the audience to adopt more sustainable practices make amends and work together to preserve the natural world The film can introduce young children to environmental issues such as climate change br Sociologist Lauren Dundes describes Elsa s relationship with the mythological horse N kk and concludes that her skills as a horse whisperer do not threaten men s ascendancy These themes show how Disney balked at modernizing Elsa retreating to outdated conceptions of gender roles Nia Kurniawati wrote that Frozen II s feminist message was subtle and realistic br br br Marketing and release br Disney released the first trailer for Frozen II on February Viewed million times in its first hours it was the most watched animated film trailer until the teaser of Inside Out surpassed that record in November At the release of the preview poster American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson commented that water crystals have hexagonal six fold symmetry shown correctly in Frozen but the poster had a four sided snowflake Lee replied that it was not really a snowflake the four sides represented the four elemental spirits and its center represented Elsa the fifth spirit Disney partnered with other brands worldwide to promote Frozen II the highest number of brands for a Disney animated film They marketed Frozen
