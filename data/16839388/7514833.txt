produce the graphics processing unit for the new console a deal that was publicly announced two days later Before the launch of the Xbox several Alpha development kits were spotted using Apple s Power Mac G hardware This was because the system s PowerPC processor was running the same PowerPC architecture that the Xbox would eventually run under IBM s Xenon processor The cores of the Xenon processor were developed using a slightly modified version of the PlayStation s Cell Processor PPE architecture According to David Shippy and Mickie Phipps the IBM employees were hiding their work from Sony and Toshiba IBM s partners in developing the Cell Processor Jeff Minter created the music visualization program Neon which is included with the Xbox br br br Launch br br The Xbox was released on November in the United States and Canada December in Europe and December in Japan It was later launched in Mexico Brazil Chile Colombia Hong Kong Singapore South Korea Taiwan Australia New Zealand South Africa India and Russia In its first year in the market the system was launched in countries more countries than any other console has launched in a single year br br br Critical reception br In IGN named the Xbox the sixth greatest video game console of all time out of a field of Although not the best selling console of the seventh generation the Xbox was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential by emphasizing digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live and by popularizing game achievement awards PC Magazine considered the Xbox the prototype for online gaming as it proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space Five years after the Xbox s debut the well received Kinect motion capture camera was released which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history and extended the life of the console Edge ranked Xbox the second best console of the period stating It had its own social network cross game chat new indie games every week and the best version of just about every multiformat game Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza but it s not about the exclusives there s nothing to trump Naughty Dog s PS output after all Rather it s about the choices Microsoft made back in the original Xbox s lifetime The PC like architecture meant the early EA Sports games ran at fps compared to only on PS Xbox Live meant every dedicated player had an existing friends list and Halo meant Microsoft had the killer next generation exclusive And when developers demo games on PC now they do it with a pad another industry benchmark and a critical one br br br Sales br br The Xbox began production only days before launch on September and Microsoft was not able to supply enough systems to meet initial consumer demand in Europe or North America selling out completely upon release in all regions except in Japan Forty thousand units were offered for sale on auction site eBay during the initial week of release of the total supply By year s end Microsoft had shipped million units including in North America in Europe and in Japan br In May Microsoft announced that million Xbox s had been sold and that it was the first current generation gaming console to surpass the million figure in the US In the US the Xbox was the leader in current generation home console sales until June when it was surpassed by the Wii By the end of March Xbox sales in the US had reached million units Between January and October the Xbox was the best selling console in the United States for these consecutive months By the end of Xbox sales had surpassed sales of the Wii making the Xbox the best selling th generation console in the US once again In Canada the Xbox has sold a total of units as of August br In Europe the Xbox has sold seven million units as of November The Xbox took weeks to reach million units sold in the UK generating m in revenue Sales in the United Kingdom would reach million units by January per GfK Chart Track The million unit mark was crossed in the UK by February Sales of the Xbox would overtake the Wii later that year topping million units making the Xbox the best selling th generation console in the UK as well as making it the third best selling console of all time in the region behind the PS and Nintendo DS Over million units were sold in Spain across the console s lifecycle br The Xbox crossed the million units sold in Japan in March and the million units sold in June Lifetime sales of the Xbox in Japan stand at million units While the Xbox has sold poorly in Japan it improved upon the sales of the original Xbox which had total sales of units Furthermore the Xbox managed to outsell both the PlayStation and Wii the week ending September as well as the week ending February when the Japanese Xbox exclusives Infinite Undiscovery and Star Ocean The Last Hope were released those weeks respectively Ultimately Edge magazine would report that Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals Sony and Nintendo adding that lackluster sales in Japan had led to retailers scaling down and in some cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox completely The significance of Japan s poor sales might be overstated in the media in comparison to overall international sales br br br Legacy br The Xbox sold much better than its predecessor and although not the best selling console of the seventh generation it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well established rivals The inexpensive Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third party software support in its later years and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in The PlayStation struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality games making it far less dominant than its predecessor the PlayStation and it took until late in the PlayStation s lifespan for its sales and games to reach parity with the Xbox TechRadar proclaimed that Xbox passes the baton as the king of the hill a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor Xbox One br The Xbox s advantage over its competitors was due to the release of high profile games from both first party and third party developers The Game Critics Awards honored the platform with nominations and wins more than any other platform By March the Xbox had reached a software attach rate of games per console in the US the rate was in Europe while its competitors were PS and Wii according to Microsoft At the Game Developers Conference Microsoft announced that it expected over games available for Xbox by the end of the year As well as enjoying exclusives such as additions to the Halo franchise and Gears of War the Xbox has managed to gain a simultaneous release of games that were initially planned to be PS exclusives including Devil May Cry Ace Combat Virtua Fighter Grand Theft Auto IV Final Fantasy XIII Tekken Metal Gear Rising Revengeance and L A Noire In addition Xbox versions of cross platform games were generally considered superior to their PS counterparts in and due in part to the difficulties of programming for the PS br TechRadar deemed the Xbox as the most influential game system through its emphasis of digital media distribution Xbox Live online gaming service and game achievement feature During the console s lifetime the Xbox brand has grown from gaming only to encompassing all multimedia turning it into a hub for living room computing environment br Microsoft announced the successor to the Xbox the Xbox One on May On April Microsoft announced the end of production of new Xbox hardware though the company will continue to provide hardware and software support for the platform as selected Xbox games are playable on Xbox One The Xbox continued to be supported by major publishers with new games well into the Xbox One s lifecycle New titles were still being released in The Xbox continues to have an active player base years after the system s discontinuation Speaking

Originally the Xbox was equipped with only MB of RAM but Epic the Gears of War developer demonstrated to Microsoft that the console should have MB of RAM to deliver much better performance When asked about this Epic Games Executive Vice President Mark Rein said in So the day they made the decision we were apparently the first developer they called we were at Game Developers Conference was it two years ago and then I got a call from the chief financial officer of MGS and he said I just want you to know you cost me a billion dollars and I said we did a favour for a billion gamers br Various

S PDIF br br br Timeline br br br United States br br br Technical problems br br The original model of the Xbox has been subject to a number of technical problems Since the console s release in users have reported concerns over its reliability and failure rate br To aid customers with defective consoles Microsoft extended the Xbox s manufacturer s warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate a General Hardware Failure error report A General Hardware Failure is recognized on all models released before the Xbox S by three quadrants of the ring around the power button flashing red This error is often known as the Red Ring of Death In April the warranty was extended to also cover failures related to the E error code The warranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures that do not generate these specific error codes br br After these problems surfaced Microsoft attempted to modify the console to improve its reliability Modifications included a reduction in the number size and placement of components the addition of dabs of epoxy on the corners and edges of the CPU and GPU as glue to prevent movement relative to the board during heat expansion and a second GPU heatsink to dissipate more heat With the release of the redesigned Xbox S the warranty for the newer models does not include the three year extended coverage for General Hardware Failures The newer Xbox S and E models indicate system overheating when the console s power button begins to flash red unlike previous models where the first and third quadrant of the ring would light up red around the power button if overheating occurred The system will then warn the user of imminent system shutdown until the system has cooled whereas a flashing power button that alternates between green and red is an indication of a General Hardware Failure unlike older models where three of the quadrants would light up red br br br Software br br br Games br br The Xbox
