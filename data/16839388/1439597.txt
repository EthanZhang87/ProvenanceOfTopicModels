November br In February when Disney bought Jumbo Pictures along with the cartoon they decided to revive the project for the Doug film This film was originally planned as a direct to video release

Daisy Duck from the television series Mickey Mouse Works br br br Critical reception br The film garnered a approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with of a total reviews being determined as positive The critical consensus reads Doug s st Movie may entertain very young fans of its main character but essentially amounts to a forgettable feature length episode of his show Critics were harsh to Doug s st Movie when it was released theatrically Many noted that the film felt too much like an extended episode of the show story and animation wise and many mention that the film should have stayed a direct to video release Most of the criticism came from the plot writing and music though they praised the animation voice acting and ending Screenit com awarded the film out of determining that it was mediocre and did not have that magic or cinematic feel to warrant the big screen treatment and it felt like the regular series br Roger Ebert gave the film out of stars quoting Doug s st Movie is a thin and less than thrilling feature length version of a Saturday morning animated series unseen by me Chatter on the Web suggests it was originally intended to go straight to video but was rechanneled into theaters after the startling success of The Rugrats Movie Since Doug originally started on Nickelodeon where Rugrats resides the decision made sense or would have if this had been a better movie br br br Box office br Doug s st Movie opened at in its opening weekend with for an average of from a very wide theaters While this may be deemed as low for an average Hollywood film Doug only cost million to make due to its direct to video budget and a somewhat low key promotional campaign As such the film still managed to gross in ticket sales barely creating a large profit for
