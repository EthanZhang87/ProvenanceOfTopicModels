On July Pixar announced a new film titled Luca as an Italy set coming of age story with Enrico Casarosa directing and Andrea Warren producing It is the feature length directorial debut of Casarosa who has previously directed the Academy Award nominated short film La Luna It is the first Pixar film to be made almost exclusively at crew members homes because of the closing of Pixar campus in Emeryville California due to the COVID pandemic However Casarosa stated it took five years to complete the development of Luca br Casarosa has described Luca as a deeply personal story being inspired by his childhood in Genoa Italy with the title character based on himself and Alberto on his best friend Alberto Surace who voices a fisherman in the Italian dub version Casarosa has stated my summers were spent on beaches I met my best friend when I was I was really shy and I found this troublemaker of a kid who had a completely different life I wanted to make a movie about those kinds of friendships that help you grow up br He also declared that the film s core is a celebration of friendship br br Childhood friendships often set the course of who we want to become and it is those bonds that are at the heart of our story in Luca So in addition to the beauty and charm of the Italian seaside our film will feature an unforgettable summer adventure that will fundamentally change Luca br According to Casarosa the result is a film that pays homage to Federico Fellini and other classic Italian filmmakers with a dash of Miyazaki in the mix too In addition of Fellini and Miyazaki s works the films La Terra Trema Stromboli and Stand by Me were also cited as source of inspiration and Aardman Animations and Wes Anderson s stop motion films influenced Casarosa s artistic sensibilities br During earlier drafts of the film Casarosa stated that the chief creative officer of Pixar at the time John Lasseter pushed for the film to be bigger scaled which included a climax where the town of Portorosso was threatened by a giant kraken Casarosa stated that Lasseter had great instincts but it was a little more dogmatic After Lasseter departed Pixar in Casarosa was allowed and encouraged to pursue the smaller intimate film he wanted to make as well as experiment with the animation by Lasseter s replacement and the film s executive producer Pete Docter The approach of using more personable stories for the film due to Docter s oversight shifted the direction that the studio took with both storytelling and film production br To prepare for the film Pixar sent several of the film s artists to the Italian Riviera for a research trip during which they took photos of the area s landscape and peoples The film is rooted in the s and s that Casarosa has described as a golden age that feels timeless with the music and designs inspired from that period to capture a little bit of this timelessness of summer br The sea monsters featured in the film were pulled from Italian myths and regional folklore including the Tellaro octopus and local little legends about sea dragons creatures that either come to help or get into trouble Casarosa said I always found the old sea monsters on maps really fascinating The mystery of the sea was so represented in the weird creatures that we used to draw And that area has a lot of wonderful myths Production designer Daniela Strijleva stated We were really inspired by old sea maps Some design details that carried through to the final film are things like the shapes of the fins of the sea monsters how decorative their scales are and the curves of their tails Casarosa also stated that the sea monster is a metaphor for feeling different br Disney filed for copyright registry of the names Portorosso and Isola del mare Sea island In the final film Luca s surname is Paguro Italian for Hermit crab while Portorosso is the name of the village in which the film is set br br br Animation and design br br To create the setting of the movie Portorosso the studio sent several of the film s artists to the Italian Riviera for a research trip including on the Cinque Terre during which they took photos of the area s landscape and peoples During the research trip Deanna Marsigliese the film s art director noted that they were watched by curious onlookers and chose to incorporate that into the character designs Isola del mare is inspired by the Italian island Tino br According to production designer Daniela Strijleva it took a year to design Luca because they wanted to get to know him Enrico always wanted Luca to be a bit of an introvert and someone who was curious but it took us a bit longer to figure out that Luca is a dreamer He has a strong imagination and a really evolved inner life That s when the character came to life for me A clay figure of sea monster Luca was sculpted to assist with the design process for the character br Casarosa described the characters transformation scenes as a big effort due to the many iterations done He also stated that another big effort was finding a different look So you re using the same tools roughly and you re not completely reinventing but you re trying to bring some warmth some texture some imperfection The computer naturally kind of wants to be a little bit realistic and perfect So for me it was like why don t we bring some painterly vibes to our pictures How do we bring texture so that it s a little more imperfect And watercolor paper I love to draw and I love to see the hand of the artist showing through and being a little bit expressive in the world because we were also wanting to take people to see Italy in this wonderfully enhanced and stylized way but also in performances and the characters wanting to make them feel a little bit handmade br Animation supervisor Mike Venturini stated Enrico as a director and as an artist was inspired in his youth largely by Miyazaki s film library starting with one of his first projects Future Boy Conan That was one of Enrico s favorite things as a kid So initially we watched a lot of episodes of that show And they use a multi limb style it s boys being silly with a really broad physicality He really liked that and hoped we could be influenced by that in some way Then we kind of expanded our universe into the rest of Miyazaki s film library which a lot of the animators on the show were already familiar with So on a larger feature film scale we were looking at what were some of Miyazaki s characteristics That s what inspired us to try things In addition of Miyazaki s works Casarosa stated that Aardman and Anderson s stop motion movies also influenced his artistic sensibilities Some of that ends up in my drawings that sketchy and expressive style We wanted to bring that to the film because it felt like this is a kid s world This is a playful world And it felt true to the story to go in that direction I love the immersion of D but I sometimes I feel it can go towards coldness So I wanted to bring the warmth of imperfection That s why some of the silly drawings made us laugh when we started boarding them and then put them on a screen br Casarosa and the team began testing new animation concepts hoping to bring playful silliness to the characters by taking away some of the typically large amount of detail Areas of immediate focus were using a more D pose style wider mouths with rounded rather than angled corners and multi limb motions that brought a sillier feel to character movement Referring to the multi limb motion Casarosa said It s an old fashion cartoon technique in some ways It came out of the drawings the essence of someone running extremely fast We wanted to use the multi limb technique in areas of the film where the characters were doing extreme physicality where it would add to the personality of the silliness of the moment There were only so many chances to use it I wish there were more But it was so much fun to use it when we could br br br Writing br On July Jones announced that he would co write the screenplay with Andrews and that he was proud of it br It is the first Pixar film to involve Andrews while Jones had previously co written Soul and is also credited as a Senior Story and Creative Artist at the studio br Jones stated To force a writing partnership is not an easy thing Jesse and I ended up having a really great meeting of the minds about what we really wanted to say with this movie Jesse had been on it for two years before me He had really put in the time This is about the greatest summer in these two boys lives and Jesse s voice with both of those boys was just so wonderful and hilarious and special and emotional I felt in many ways that I m just helping Jesse plus that by trying to kind of apply a little bit more of story foundation br br br Casting br br On February with the release of the teaser trailer and poster Tremblay Grazer Berman Rudolph Barricelli Raimondo it and Gaffigan were announced as part of the cast Martin and Gianniotti were announced on April after the official trailer and poster were released br Tremblay voices the title character Casarosa stated that working with him was such a pleasure and I love how earnest and innocent he is naturally And he s playful and he s not afraid to try stuff so it was so much fun to improvise with him he s actually one of the few actors we had time to work with before the pandemic so there it was so much fun According to Tremblay Luca really wants to explore the world and I can really relate to that especially now I really want to get back out there and just learn about different cultures just like Luca He really wants to go to this town in Italy and learn about their culture and become part of it br Casarosa stated that Grazer who voiced Alberto brings a natural confidence and vulnerability to the character who s a free spirited teen sea monster with unbridled enthusiasm for the human world Giulia an outsider misfit girl is voiced by newcomer Berman Rudolph and Gaffigan playing Daniela and Lorenzo did get the chance to improvise with Casarosa highlighting the depth and warmth they bring to the roles She s a stern mother She s a difficult and very controlling mother but there s this other warmth to her that balances it br Luca s supporting cast includes actual Italian actors Raimondo voices Ercole Barricelli who has a booming voice voices Massimo Gianniotti voices Giacomo Lorenzo Crisci voices Guido Massironi voices Mrs Marsigliese Gino La Monica voices Tommaso and Francesca Fanti voices a cop br Raimondo was chosen by Casarosa after seeing his Netflix stand up comedy show Saverio Raimondo Il satiro parlante Raimondo compared Ercole to the character Odd Henderson from the short story The Thanksgiving Visitor and voicing him he was inspired by Giuseppe Anatrelli s performance as Luciano Calboni from the Fantozzi film series br Tremblay stated that the relationship between Luca and Alberto is gonna bring back a lot of memories when people watch this and I m hoping that when people watch this they ll be able to forget about COVID It s so cool I get to be part of someone else s childhood I think especially now the story is really special because for me I haven t really been able to see my friends because of COVID of course and this movie is all about friendship So when people see it in theaters I hope they ll be able to remember hanging out with friends during summer vacation and just having a blast br br br Themes and inspirations br Casarosa stated that the movie is a celebration of friendship and a love letter to the summers of our youth those formative years when you re finding yourself inspired by his childhood in Genoa Casarosa based the title character on himself while Alberto is based on his best friend Alberto Surace to whom the film is dedicated and who also voices a fisherman in the Italian dub Casarosa stated My best friend Alberto was a bit of a troublemaker while I was very timid and had a bit of a sheltered life we couldn t have been more different Alberto pushed me out of my comfort zone and pushed me off many cliffs metaphorically and not I probably would not be here if I didn t learn to chase my dreams from him It s these types of deep friendships that I wanted to talk about in Luca and that is what s at the heart of this film br The sea monsters based on old Italian myths and regional folklore were defined by Casarosa as a metaphor for feeling different explaining We were also a bit of outsiders so it felt right to use sea monsters to express the idea that we felt a little different and not cool as kids Casarosa stated I always found the old sea monsters on maps really fascinating The mystery of the sea was so represented in the weird creatures that we used to draw And that area has a lot of wonderful myths Producer Andrea Warren expanded We always liked the idea that the metaphor of being a sea monster can apply to so many different things There is a theme of openness showing oneself and self acceptance as well as community acceptance Confronting the idea that there s more to sea monsters than they realized You know that they ve only seen it through one perspective one lens and so I think that that s a wonderful theme in the film which is that those ideas weren t right and that there s more to learn Casarosa agreed We hope that sea monster could be a metaphor for all manners of feeling different like being a teen or even pre teen any moment where you feel odd It felt like a wonderful way to talk about that and having to accept ourselves first whatever way we feel different br Some have seen Luca and Alberto hiding their true sea monster identities as an allegory for people who are members of the LGBTQ community feeling as though they need to hide their true selves in order to be accepted Casarosa said this was unintentional and that his original vision for the film was to explore the time in a child s life before romance while stating but it is a kind of love right There s a lot of hugging and it s physical and my experience as a straight man certainly wasn t that He has welcomed the interpretation after the film s release also stating While I identify with pronouns he him and I am a straight man the themes of diversity acceptance and inclusion in our movie are dear to my heart br Casarosa has stated that some people have interpreted the story as being a metaphor for refugees and immigrants as well While he stated that this was unintentional too he was welcome to all interpretations We were aware making the movie that this was a wonderful journey of owning your own identity and coming out with it whichever that identity is I thought that everyone would bring their own identity to it br Casarosa later stated that the film was intended to be a metaphor for race and while romance was only briefly discussed it was never meant to be a focal point to the story some people seem to get mad that I m not saying yes or no but I feel like well this is a movie about being open to any difference br br br Music br br On April Dan Romer was revealed to

assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews br Alonso Duralde of the TheWrap wrote Luca is sweet and affecting capturing the bond that strangers can build over a summer and how that friendship can endure And like its shape shifting protagonists it s got plenty going on beneath the surface From The Hollywood Reporter David Rooney said that the real magic of Luca is its visuals The character designs are appealing both in the marine world and on land and the richness of the settings in both realms is a constant source of pleasure The play of light on the gloriously blue water s surface is almost photorealistic at times while a sunset spreading its orange glow over rocks on the shoreline makes you yearn to be there br Charlie Ridgely writing for ComicBook com praised the film for its uniqueness feeling that it highly deviated from Pixar s usual narrative formula and clich s but it didn t make it lesser than other of the company s classics like Toy Story and Up highlighting the animation the design of the Italian Riviera the score and the story br Conversely Phil De Semlyen writing for Time Out branded the film a letdown writing Charming but slight Luca definitely isn t Pixar firing on all cylinders The studio s trademark daring pin sharp sight gags and big ideas are missing from a fishy coming of age yarn that s a little damp around the edges br br br Accolades br br br Short film br br A short film sequel to Luca titled Ciao Alberto was released on Disney on November It is written and directed by McKenna Jean Harris
