James Brolin and Uzo Aduba in supporting roles The film follows Buzz Lightyear Evans operating as a space ranger who after being marooned on the hostile planet T Kani Prime with his commander and crew tries to find a way back home while encountering a threat to the universe s safety br The concept of a human Buzz Lightyear who exists in a fictional universe within a fictional universe was first introduced in the direct to video film Buzz Lightyear of Star Command The Adventure Begins which was the pilot for the TV series Buzz Lightyear of Star Command MacLane an avid science fiction fan pitched the idea of a film featuring Buzz Lightyear at Pixar after finishing work on Finding Dory The project was officially announced in an investor meeting held by Disney in December The animators gave the film a cinematic and chunky look evoking the science fiction films MacLane grew up watching To design the vehicles of the film MacLane used Lego pieces to build various ships and pitch them to the designers and artists For its IMAX scenes the team used two virtual cameras a regular camera with a mm equivalent sensor and a larger sensor equivalent to millimeters a procedure earlier initiated by Pixar in WALL E Development on Lightyear lasted for five and a half years on an approximate million budget Michael Giacchino composed the film s score while Ren Klyce served as its sound designer br Lightyear premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood Los Angeles on June and was theatrically released in the United States on June in RealD D DX Dolby Cinema and IMAX formats It became the first Pixar film to be released in theaters worldwide since Onward in March and the first to include scenes specifically formatted for IMAX theaters Analysts considered the film to be a box office bomb grossing million worldwide and losing the studio an estimated million br br br Plot br br A Star Command exploration vessel changes course to investigate signs of life on the unknown world T Kani Prime Woken from hibernation Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear and his commanding officer and best friend Alisha Hawthorne explore with a new recruit They are forced to retreat to their exploration vessel after discovering that the planet hosts hostile lifeforms Blaming himself for damages the vessel sustained during the retreat forcing the crew to return to the surface Buzz volunteers as the test pilot for the hyperspace fuel crystal they will need to develop to return home br One year later the crew has constructed a new colony to conduct repairs However after a four minute test flight Buzz finds that four years have passed on T Kani Prime due to the effects of time dilation from having traveled at relativistic speeds Buzz is introduced to an orange robotic feline Sox and continues testing the hyperspace fuel With every test four more years pass on T Kani Prime until eventually over sixty six years have passed During this time the colony develops with Alisha raising a son with her wife Kiko subsequently dying of old age while Sox improves the fuel s composition allowing it to obtain faster than light speeds br Against the orders of Alisha s successor Commander Cal Burnside Buzz uses the new fuel composition for a successful hyperspace test However he skips another twenty two years into the future during which T Kani Prime has been invaded by Zyclops robots led by Zurg the robots commander Buzz meets up with members of the colony s defense forces including Alisha s now adult granddaughter Izzy Hawthorne Mo Morrison a fresh na ve recruit Darby Steel an elderly paroled convict and the robot DERIC While initially reluctant to work with them Buzz eventually warms to them after they escape from a nest of insects and investigate a mining facility to repair their ship Together they plan to destroy the invading force at Zurg s mothership br As they head back to the ship Zurg intervenes and captures Buzz then reveals himself to be an older version of Buzz from an alternate timeline which split upon Buzz s return to the planet after the successful hyperspace test without the robot army to detain them soldiers from the colony attempted to arrest Buzz under Burnside s orders forcing him to flee into space This Buzz and his Sox escaped at full speed and via time dilation flew hundreds of years into the far future where he encountered and stole extremely advanced technology and eventually developed a way to travel back in time to prevent himself from stranding the Star Command crew upon the planet Having worn out his own fuel Zurg needs fresh fuel to travel further into the past and complete his mission so he requests it from his younger self Realizing this would erase Alisha and Kiko s life together along with Izzy and the lives of all the other colonists Buzz refuses br Aided by Zurg s Sox Buzz and the cadets escape Zurg s ship and set it to self destruct On their return to the planet via a crash landing Zurg attacks and takes the fuel for himself Buzz ejects to shoot the fuel causing an explosion that seemingly kills Zurg With the fuel gone Buzz finally accepts T Kani Prime as his home Burnside arrests the group with the intention of detaining them for their reckless actions but relents in light of Buzz s bravery against the robot armada Allowed to revive the Space Ranger Corps Buzz unexpectedly selects Izzy Mo Darby and Sox as his first trainees With a new fuel crystal created using the computer left behind during the mutiny Buzz and his team embark on a new adventure br In a post credits scene Zurg is shown to have

a worker at the mission control center br br br Production br br br Development br br Development on Lightyear began following the production of Finding Dory in After co directing Finding Dory with Andrew Stanton Angus MacLane was allowed to pitch the idea of making a Buzz Lightyear film having always wondered what movie Andy Davis saw in the original Toy Story to get interested in a Buzz Lightyear action figure MacLane a science fiction fan had felt attracted to the character of Buzz since he started working at Pixar feeling that the film s story was very personal for him whose favorite movie since childhood had been Star Wars An aspect present in the Toy Story films that Lightyear explores is Buzz s disagreement over the nature of reality which coupled with his heroic ideals made an amalgam of sci fi clich s that MacLane intended to make more than just a punchline br In February Tim Allen who voiced Buzz in the films expressed interest in doing another film as he did not see any reason why they would not do it while in that May on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Tom Hanks who voiced Woody said that Toy Story would be the final installment in the franchise but producer Mark Nielsen disclosed a possibility of a fifth film as Pixar was not ruling out that possibility In December at a Disney Investor Day meeting Lightyear was announced as a spin off film depicting the in universe origin of the human Buzz Lightyear character with Chris Evans providing the character s voice br When asked about the relationship between Lightyear and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command a Toy Story spin off series that also serves as an in universe production starring the Buzz character MacLane who directed the CG opening sequence for Star Command said that he did not have it in mind while working on the film but always pictured the series being developed in universe after a trilogy of Lightyear films He later explained that Lightyear serves as a live action film within the Toy Story universe whereas Star Command serves as a hand drawn animated series based on the film from which the toy versions of Buzz and Zurg derive On May production of Lightyear was completed after spending five and a half years in development The budget was approximately million br br br Casting br br Producer Galyn Susman said that the creative team did not discuss bringing back the original voice actor for Buzz Lightyear Tim Allen in any capacity for this film because they believed that his voice would have tied the film too closely to Toy Story when the film aims to be its own stand alone story while also saying Tim really is the embodiment of the toy Buzz and this isn t the toy world so it really doesn t make sense There s not really a role It would just cause more confusion for audiences instead of helping them understand the movie we re trying to tell br Chris Evans was announced as the voice of the human Buzz Lightyear along with the project s announcement in December Evans was the first and only choice MacLane had for Buzz MacLane defended the recasting as Tim s version of Buzz Lightyear is a little goofier and is a little dumber and so he is the comic relief In this film Buzz is the action hero He s serious and ambitious and funny but not in a goofy way that would undercut the drama Chris Evans has the gravitas and that movie star quality that our character needed to separate him and the movie from Tim s version of the toy in Toy Story br Evans visited Pixar s offices one day and they pitched him the project during a visit he accepted the offer immediately given his love for animation Evans credited Tim Allen as his guideline and also wanted to create his own understanding of the character and try to make some fresh tracks in the snow while paying homage to his work in the film He eventually felt comfortable with his own interpretation and had to lower his voice for the role br Keke Palmer Dale Soules Uzo Aduba James Brolin Mary McDonald Lewis Efren Ramirez and Isiah Whitlock Jr were reported to have been cast in supporting roles in February following the release of the official trailer On May European Space Agency astronaut Tim Peake was revealed to have a cameo as Tim from Mission Control On May it was revealed that Formula One drivers Carlos Sainz Jr and Charles Leclerc would cameo in the film both playing the same undisclosed character for the Spanish and Italian dubs of the film respectively br br br Animation and design br The animators wanted the film to look cinematic and chunky in order to evoke the feeling of the science fiction films MacLane grew up with In order to achieve this they asked a former Industrial Light Magic employee to build a spaceship model for them from which the animators drew inspiration this technique was inspired by designers for early science fiction films using models as inspiration for their sets and props MacLane said the animation took several visual lessons from early science fiction and space opera films such as those of the Star Wars franchise though without intentionally imitating such films Perception helped with the opening and end credits of the film To design the vehicles of the film MacLane used Lego pieces to build various ships such as the Armadillo and pitch them to the designers and artists to match the chunky feel within the film Originally like Lego films the world sets within the film via design and concept art However for the film this is the first Pixar film to use Lego as part of their pipeline than what Lego does MacLane already made a Lego design for WALL E for the Lego Ideas set Zurg was redesigned for the film influenced by anime robots to look more grounded and menacing than his previous appearances which MacLane believed were too comical br Korean animators Chun Sung uk and Lee Chae yeon worked on the animation process in their homes during the COVID pandemic They said that it is overwhelming to see the full scale of what computer animation can do on the big screen The animation team went to NASA to research about spaceships space suits and overall set pieces as they wanted everything to look like a live action film rather than an animation According to Lee a D animator who also worked on Toy Story and said The director wanted to make a film that felt true so he asked for a much more toned down version of Buzz s personality Being part of the team required an enormous amount of responsibility but it was really exciting for me professionally br br For the IMAX release Lightyear is the first ever animated feature film to have its aspect ratio opened up from to for select sequences of the film Jane Yen who served as the film s visual effects supervisor spoke to Film stating that the team had developed virtual IMAX cameras to shoot the sequences in and then would be cropped to standard definition The film includes minutes of IMAX animation The team shot this footage using two different virtual cameras a regular camera with a mm equivalent sensor and a mm equivalent sensor which was earlier initiated by Pixar in WALL E br br br Music br br Recurrent Pixar composer Michael Giacchino was announced to compose the score for the film marking his eighth collaboration with the studio and the second time he would score an installment to a film franchise from Pixar that is traditionally scored by Randy Newman after Cars He earlier scored for the Toy Story television specials Toy Story of Terror and Toy Story That Time Forgot the former was written and directed by MacLane br br br Marketing br Following the announcement of the film a first look was shown at the Disney Investor Day on December The marketing campaign for Lightyear began on October with the release of a teaser trailer set to David Bowie s Starman that received million views in its first hours Compared to other Pixar films the teaser s viewership ranks second behind a teaser for Incredibles million It was positively reviewed by commentators with CNN based editor Leah Asmelash writing the trailer filled many millennials with sentimentality The first trailer was released online on February and was then aired at Super Bowl LVI on February ComicBook com s Aaron Perine opined that the animated movie will be as comedic as expected of these family movies and further stated Chris Evans version of the Space Ranger takes shape as he gets used to some alien surroundings Also of note would be Lightyear s new companion a robot cat that will also end up being comedic relief played by Peter Sohn Aaron Couch of The Hollywood Reporter had stated The Lightyear trailer reveals that Buzz is sent on a rescue flight after he and a group of people are stranded on a planet After a year of hard work they ve managed to send Buzz off world for help br On April the first minutes of the film was premiered at CinemaCon along with the second trailer which released online six days earlier It was positively received by critics who referred to the film as Pixar s Star Wars and a beautifully animated fun and emotional journey and appreciated the cinematic qualities including animation and visuals Critics further went on to praise the robotic cat Sox voiced by Sohn and called him the standout performer CNBC s Sarah Whitten compared Sox with K SO of Rogue One and Baymax from Big Hero attributing the character with a dry sense of humor and blunt vocal delivery and also an innocence and caring nature On May a poster stills from the film and a special look trailer was released online br Fandango Media s managing editor Erik Davis and John Rocha film critic for Outlaw Nation predicted a demand for Sox toys even before the film s release Mattel which had the master toy license for Toy Story franchise had announced a new Lightyear toy line consisting of action figures playsets and vehicles After Sox s character in the film received praise from insiders Mattel created an animatronic interactive version which costs apart from the plush and action figures Mattel s executive lead PJ Lewis had said We knew he was much more than a sidekick and offered multiple ways to drive product innovation for the Lightyear line Plus we have a few cat people on the team who were smitten br Lego released three sets based on scenes from the film which were released on April On May Ferrari announced that Lightyear would be a sponsor on their cars starting at the Monaco Grand Prix In addition Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Jr would also be cast for roles in the film respectively

pandemic Lightyear also became Pixar s first film to have virtual IMAX cameras in its progress br br br Ban and censorship br br Lightyear was banned in the Muslim world including Bahrain Brunei Egypt Iraq Jordan Kazakhstan Kuwait Lebanon Malaysia Oman Palestine Qatar Saudi Arabia Syria Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates due to a scene featuring a same sex kiss between Uzo Aduba s female character Alisha Hawthorne and her partner Kiko The People s Republic of China PRC also requested that the scene in question be removed however Disney declined to make the cuts Indonesia stated that they did not ban the film but suggested the owner of the movie think about their audience in Indonesia where an LGBT kissing scene is still considered sensitive In Singapore the scene resulted in the film being allowed only for people above years of age NC Despite bans across most of the Arab world Morocco refused to ban the film and showed it in cinemas despite a petition requesting a ban on the film br The specific scene was initially cut from the film in mid March but following then Disney CEO Bob Chapek s response to Florida s Parental Rights in Education bill and the internal polarizing uproar it caused within Disney the scene was reinstated Speaking to Variety s Angelique Jackson Evans had stated about the scene saying I ve been asked the question a few times it s nice and it s wonderful it makes me happy It s tough to not be a little frustrated that it even has to be a topic of discussion The goal is that we can get to a point where it is the norm and that this doesn t have to be some uncharted waters that eventually this is just the way it is That representation across the board is how we make films br br br Home media br Lightyear was made available on Disney on August

Lightyear grossed million in the United States and Canada and million in other territories for a worldwide total of million It was the fourth highest grossing animated film of in the U S and the fifth worldwide Deadline Hollywood calculated the film lost the studio million when factoring together all expenses and revenues br In the United States and Canada Lightyear was projected to gross million from theaters in its opening weekend with some estimates reaching as high as million However after making million on its first day including million from Thursday night previews estimates were lowered to million It went on to debut to million finishing second behind holdover Jurassic World Dominion Additionally the film earned million from international markets bringing its worldwide three day debut to million In its second weekend Lightyear declined to million the second lowest sophomore drop for a Pixar film after Onward which opened at the onset of the pandemic br Both Deadline Hollywood and Variety attributed the performance to competition from Jurassic World Dominion and Top Gun Maverick though ultimately noted it as a disappointment given the brand strength of both Pixar and the Toy Story franchise Los Angeles Times writer Ryan Faughnder believed that the film was at a disadvantage since as a spin off film it did not have well known Toy Story characters such as Woody He also noted that spin offs tend to not gross as much as the main franchise installments and compared the film to the spin off films Solo A Star Wars Story and Hobbs Shaw Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that in addition to competition from Jurassic World Dominion and Top Gun Maverick the lackluster opening was attributed to brand confusion in the film s marketing McClintock Martha Ross of The Mercury News and The Washington Post s Sonny Bunch also questioned if the response from people over the inclusion of a lesbian couple kissing and the decision not to cast Tim Allen in the role of Buzz Lightyear were the reasons for the film s low opening Other box office analysts believed family audiences might have not shown up to theaters after becoming accustomed to the availability of Pixar films at home after their three previous films Soul Luca and Turning Red were released directly to Disney during the pandemic Some box office analysts theorized that family audiences were reluctant to attend theaters in general due to COVID concerns although this was disproven after Minions The Rise of Gru opened to million in the U S and Canada two weeks later br br br Critical response br On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes of critics reviews are positive with an average rating of The website s consensus reads Lightyear settles for being a rather conventional origin story instead of reaching for the stars but this gorgeously animated adventure ably accomplishes its mission of straightforward fun It is the lowest rated film of the Toy Story franchise on Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of including an average out of stars with saying they would definitely recommend it br Peter Bradshaw s four star review for The Guardian stated This cracking origin story for Toy Story s spaceman hero is fun and clever and reminds us why we loved Pixar in the first place David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called it a funny spinoff with suspense and heart a captivatingly spirited toon take on splashy live action retro popcorn entertainment Emma Stefansky of Thrillist said There s plenty in Lightyear to enjoy and it s one of Pixar s better efforts over the last years but it ultimately feels half done It feels like it ought to be the beginning of something like its narrative is a prologue stretched into a feature awaiting the much more interesting second and third and fifth installments down the road RogerEbert com based critic Odie Henderson praised the score who called it as one of Giacchino s best scores and a delectable spoof of bombastic space movie music that elevates every scene it plays under Valerie Complex of Deadline Hollywood stated Lightyear does not rely too much on Toy Story lore to build its world but it would have benefited from showing some connection to that part of the franchise instead of using title cards She further praised the technical aspects and wrote The animation is gorgeous and hyper realistic The art department put their all into designing this universe and its characters and robotic villains but criticized the screenplay saying sometimes the story becomes convoluted and drags on almost like there was a need to pad the runtime causing Lightyear to get into even more trouble and creating a never ending slew of trampling obstacles br Variety s Owen Gleiberman wrote Lightyear in its eminently conventional and likable way is a far less audacious movie than that For what is surely not the first time Buzz s I can do anything myopic bravado has failed part of that may be that in the Toy Story films he is a toy that s part of the joke one that Buzz is never quite in on He thinks he s a real Space Ranger So when you actually turn Buzz Lightyear into a Space Ranger you enlarge him and diminish him at the same time In contrast BBC s Nicholas Barber wrote The story is thin repetitive and almost entirely dependent on the heroes being clumsy and gave the film two stars David Ehrlich of IndieWire wrote Lightyear remains firmly stuck in the past even as it hurtles toward the future And while screenwriters Jason Headley and Angus MacLane need that push pull in order to tell a story about reconciling the lure of nostalgia with the potential for something new it s hard for a movie to sell us on living in the moment when every scene feels like it s settling for less Kaleem Aftab of Time Out called the film a franchise low Pixar s meta Toy Story spin off gets lost in space The film has received criticism from some conservatives who have argued that the film s scene with a same sex kiss is inappropriate for children saying that Disney sexualizes them br When asked about Lightyear in Pixar s chief creative officer Pete Docter stated that while the studio love s the characters and the premise he believed we asked too much of the audience When they hear Buzz they re like great where s Mr Potato Head and Woody and Rex And then we drop them into this science fiction film that they re like What so I think there was a disconnect between what people wanted expected and what we were giving to them br br br
