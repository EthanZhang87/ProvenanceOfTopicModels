previously acted in television commercials and later made her stage debut in a production of Peter Pan at the Scala Theatre There she caught the attention of Disney s talent scouts br br br Filming br Filming took place at the Disney studios in Burbank California from early March to June The coastal scenes featuring German soldiers were shot on location at a nearby California beach Additional scenes were shot on location in Corfe Castle in Dorset England Filming lasted fifty seven days while the animation and special effects required five months each to complete br For the Naboombu soccer sequence the sodium vapor process was used which was developed by Petro Vlahos in the s Animator and director Ward Kimball served as the animation director over the sequence Directing animator Milt Kahl had designed the characters but he was angered over the inconsistencies in the character animation This prompted Kimball to send a memo dated on September to adhere to animation cohesiveness to the animation staff Because of the heavy special effects the entire film had to be storyboarded in advance shot for shot which Lansbury later said resulted in her acting being very by the numbers br br br Release br Bedknobs and Broomsticks had an original runtime of minutes and was scheduled to premiere at Radio City Music Hall However in order to accommodate for the theater s elaborate stage show the film had to be trimmed down to under two hours and minutes were ultimately removed from the film The removed scenes included a minor subplot involving Roddy McDowall s character which was reduced to one minute and three entire musical sequences titled A Step in the Right Direction With a Flair and Nobody s Problems Additionally almost three minutes were removed from the Portobello Road sequence and the song Eglantine was also shortened br When the film was reissued theatrically on April an additional twenty minutes of footage were deleted br br br restoration br Intrigued with Lansbury s song A Step in the Right Direction on the original soundtrack album Scott MacQueen then senior manager of Disney s library restoration set out to restore the film in conjunction with the film s th anniversary Most of the deleted film material was found but some segments of Portobello Road had to be reconstructed from work prints with digital re coloration to match the film quality of the main content The footage for A Step in the Right Direction was unrecoverable but the sequence was reconstructed for inclusion as a supplemental feature on home media releases of the film by linking the original music track up to existing production stills The edit included several newly discovered songs including Nobody s Problems performed by Lansbury The number had been cut before the premiere of the film Lansbury had only made a demo recording singing with a solo piano because the orchestrations would have been added when the picture was scored When the song was cut the orchestrations had not yet been added therefore it was finally orchestrated and put together when it was placed back into the film br The soundtrack for some of the spoken tracks was unrecoverable Therefore Lansbury and McDowall re dubbed their parts while other actors made ADR dubs for those who were unavailable Even though David Tomlinson was still alive when the film was being reconstructed he was in ill health and unavailable to provide ADR for Emelius Browne so he was replaced by Jeff Bennett br The restored version of the film premiered on September at the Motion Picture Academy of

release increased its North American rentals to million br br br Critical reaction br Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the film is a tricky cheerful aggressively friendly Walt Disney fantasy for children who still find enchantment for pop up books plush animals by Steiff and dreams of independent flight He further highlighted the Naboombu live action animated sequence as the best of Disney going back all the way to the first Silly Symphonies Variety wrote that what it may lack in the charm of Mary Poppins it more than measures in inventiveness Indeed it is doubtful if special effects or animation have been ever bettered or used to greater advantage Alone they are a reason for seeing the film and the reviewer praised the Naboombu sequence as containing not only sheer delights but technical masterpieces Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times awarded the film two and a half stars out of four claiming that while the film has the same technical skill and professional polish as Mary Poppins i t doesn t have much of a heart though and toward the end you wonder why the Poppins team thought kids would like it much Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave Bedknobs two stars out of four calling the film a mishmash of story ideas and film styles He further added that the live action animated sequence was one bright spot in the story but felt the difference between scenes of sea horses and storm troopers is so great that probably no story could manage it Bedknobs tries and fails br Pauline Kael reviewing for The New Yorker panned the film writing that there is no logic in the style of the movie and the story dribbles on for so long that it exhausts the viewer before that final magical battle begins She concluded her review by stating This whole production is a mixture of wizardry and ineptitude the picture has enjoyable moments but it s as uncertain of itself as the title indicates Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film was pleasant enough and harmless enough It is also long almost two hours and slow The songs are perfunctory nothing supercalifragi whatever and the visual trickeries splendid as they are are sputtery to get the picture truly airborne By the standards Disney has set for itself it s a disappointing endeavor br On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on
