most populous Its capital is Bras lia and its most populous city is S o Paulo The federation is composed of the union of the states and the Federal District It is the only country in the Americas to have Portuguese as an official language Brazil is one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world br Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east Brazil has a coastline of kilometers mi It borders all other countries and territories in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers roughly half of the continent s land area Its Amazon basin includes a vast tropical forest home to diverse wildlife a variety of ecological systems and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats This unique environmental heritage positions Brazil at number one of megadiverse countries The country s natural richness is also the subject of significant global interest as environmental degradation through processes such as deforestation has direct impacts on global issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss br The territory which would become known as Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing of explorer Pedro lvares Cabral in Then the land was claimed for the Portuguese Empire Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro In the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal Brazil and the Algarves Independence was achieved in with the creation of the Empire of Brazil a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system The ratification of the first constitution in led to the formation of a

American States Organization of Ibero American States and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries Brazil is also an observer state of the Arab League br br br Etymology br br The word Brazil probably comes from the Portuguese word for brazilwood a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast In Portuguese brazilwood is called pau brasil with the word brasil commonly given the etymology red like an ember formed from brasa ember and the suffix il from iculum or ilium It has alternatively been suggested that this is a folk etymology for a word for the plant related to an Arabic or Asian word for a red plant As brazilwood produces a deep red dye it was highly valued by the European textile industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil Throughout the th century massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples mostly Tupi along the Brazilian coast who sold the timber to European traders mostly Portuguese but also French in return for assorted European consumer goods br The official Portuguese name of the land in original Portuguese records was the Land of the Holy Cross Terra da Santa Cruz but European sailors and merchants commonly called it the Land of Brazil Terra do Brasil because of the brazilwood trade The popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official Portuguese name Some early sailors called it the Land of Parrots br In the Guaran language an official language of Paraguay Brazil is called Pindorama meaning land of the palm trees br br br History br br br Pre Cabraline era br br Some of the earliest human remains found in the Americas Luzia Woman were found in the area of Pedro Leopoldo Minas Gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least years br The earliest pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the Amazon basin of Brazil and radiocarbon dated to years ago BC The pottery was found near Santar m and provides evidence that the region supported a complex prehistoric culture The Marajoara culture flourished on Maraj in the Amazon delta from AD to developing sophisticated pottery social stratification large populations mound building and complex social formations such as chiefdoms br Around the time of the Portuguese arrival the territory of current day Brazil had an estimated indigenous population of million people mostly semi nomadic who subsisted on hunting fishing gathering and migrant agriculture The population comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups e g the Tupis Guaranis G s and Arawaks The Tupi people were subdivided into the Tupiniquins and Tupinamb s br Before the arrival of the Europeans the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture language and moral beliefs These wars also involved large scale military actions on land and water with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war While heredity had some weight leadership was a status more won over time than assigned in succession ceremonies and conventions Slavery among the indigenous groups had a different meaning than it had for Europeans since it originated from a diverse socioeconomic organization in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations br br br Portuguese colonization br br Following the Treaty of Tordesillas the land now called Brazil was claimed for the Portuguese Empire on April with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro lvares Cabral The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several ethnic societies most of whom spoke languages of the Tupi Guarani family and fought among themselves Though the first settlement was founded in colonization effectively began in when King John III of Portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincies br However the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincies proved problematic and in the Portuguese king restructured them into the Governorate General of Brazil in the city of Salvador which became the capital of a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America In the first two centuries of colonization Indigenous and European groups lived in constant war establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other br By the mid th century cane sugar had become Brazil s most important export while slaves purchased in Sub Saharan Africa in the slave market of Western Africa not only those from Portuguese allies of their colonies in Angola and Mozambique had become its largest import to cope with sugarcane plantations due to increasing international demand for Brazilian sugar Brazil received more than million slaves from Africa between the years and br By the end of the th century sugarcane exports began to decline and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the s would become the new backbone of the colony s economy fostering a gold rush which attracted thousands of new settlers to Brazil from Portugal and all Portuguese colonies around the world This increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers br Portuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually expanded Brazil s original colonial frontiers in South America to its approximately current borders In this era other European powers tried to colonize parts of Brazil in incursions that the Portuguese had to fight notably the French in Rio during the s in Maranh o during the s and the Dutch in Bahia and Pernambuco during the Dutch Portuguese War after the end of Iberian Union br The Portuguese colonial administration in Brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of Portugal s wealthiest and largest colony to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance such as the Quilombo of Palmares and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence such as the Minas Gerais Conspiracy br br br Elevation to kingdom br br In late Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental Portugal causing Prince Regent John in the name of Queen Maria I to move the royal court from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro There they established some of Brazil s first financial institutions such as its local stock exchanges and its National Bank additionally ending the Portuguese monopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil s ports to other nations In in retaliation for being forced into exile the Prince Regent ordered the conquest of French Guiana br With the end of the Peninsular War in the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent John return to Portugal deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony In to justify continuing to live in Brazil where the royal court had thrived for six years the Crown established the United Kingdom of Portugal Brazil and the Algarves thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state However the leadership in Portugal resentful of the new status of its larger colony continued to demand the return of the court to Lisbon see Liberal Revolution of In acceding to the demands of revolutionaries who had taken the city of Porto John VI departed for Lisbon There he swore an oath to the new constitution leaving his son Prince Pedro de Alc ntara as Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil br br br Independent empire br br Tensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased and the Portuguese Cortes guided by the new political regime imposed by the Liberal Revolution tried to re establish Brazil as a colony The Brazilians refused to yield and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them declaring the country s independence from Portugal on September A month later Prince Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil with the royal title of Dom Pedro I resulting in the founding of the Empire of Brazil br The Brazilian War of Independence which had already begun along this process spread through the northern northeastern regions and in the Cisplatina province The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on March Portugal officially recognized Brazilian independence on August br On April worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissent with both liberal and conservative sides of politics including an attempt of republican secession and unreconciled to the way that absolutists in Portugal had given in the succession of King John VI Pedro I departed for Portugal to reclaim his daughter s crown after abdicating the Brazilian throne in favor of his five year old son and heir Dom Pedro II br br As the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he came of age a regency was set up by the National Assembly In the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power during this period a series of localized rebellions took place such as the Cabanagem in Gr o Par the Mal Revolt in Salvador the Balaiada Maranh o the Sabinada Bahia and the Ragamuffin War which began in Rio Grande do Sul and was supported by Giuseppe Garibaldi These emerged from the provinces dissatisfaction with the central power coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar to a vast slaveholding and newly independent nation state This period of internal political and social upheaval which included the Praieira revolt in Pernambuco was overcome only at the end of the s years after the end of the regency which occurred with the premature coronation of Pedro II in br During the last phase of the monarchy internal political debate centered on the issue of slavery The Atlantic slave trade was abandoned in as a result of the British Aberdeen Act and the Eus bio de Queir s Law but only in May after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country was the institution formally abolished with the approval of the Golden Law br The foreign affairs policies of the monarchy dealt with issues with the countries of the Southern Cone with whom Brazil had borders Long after the Cisplatine War that resulted in the independence of Uruguay Brazil won three international wars during the year reign of Pedro II the Platine War the Uruguayan War and the devastating Paraguayan War the largest war effort in Brazilian history br Although there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country s form of government on November in disagreement with the majority of the Imperial Army officers as well as with rural and financial elites for different reasons the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup A few days later the national flag was replaced with a new design that included the national motto Ordem e Progresso influenced by positivism November is now Republic Day a national holiday br br br Early republic br br The early republican government was a military dictatorship with the army dominating affairs both in Rio de Janeiro and in the states Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power Not until following an economic crisis and a military one did civilians take power remaining there until October br If in relation to its foreign policy the country in this first republican period maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries only broken by the Acre War and its involvement in World War I followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the League of Nations Internally from the crisis of Encilhamento and the Navy Revolts a prolonged cycle of financial political and social instability began until the s keeping the country besieged by various rebellions both civilian and military br Little by little a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate the defeated opposition presidential candidate Get lio Vargas supported by most of the military successfully led the Revolution of Vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily but instead closed down Congress extinguished the Constitution ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states governors with his own supporters br In the s three attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power failed The first was the Constitutionalist Revolution in led by the S o Paulo s oligarchy The second was a Communist uprising in November and the last one a putsch attempt by local fascists in May The uprising created a security crisis in which Congress transferred more power to the executive branch The coup d tat resulted in the cancellation of the election and formalized Vargas as dictator beginning the Estado Novo era During this period government brutality and censorship of the press increased br During World War II Brazil remained neutral until August when the country suffered retaliation by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in a strategic dispute over the South Atlantic and therefore entered the war on the allied side In addition to its participation in the battle of the Atlantic Brazil also sent an expeditionary force to fight in the Italian campaign br With the Allied victory in and the end of the fascist regimes in Europe Vargas s position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup with democracy reinstated by the same army that had ended it years earlier Vargas committed suicide in August amid a political crisis after having returned to power by election in br br br Contemporary era br br Several brief interim governments followed Vargas s suicide Juscelino Kubitschek became president in and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of Bras lia inaugurated in Kubitschek s successor J nio Quadros resigned in less than a year after taking office His vice president Jo o Goulart assumed the presidency but aroused strong political opposition and was deposed in April by a coup that resulted in a military dictatorship br br The new regime was intended to be transitory but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in Oppression was not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime but also reached institutional opponents artists journalists and other members of civil society inside and outside the country through the infamous Operation Condor Like other brutal authoritarian regimes due to an economic boom known as the economic miracle the regime reached a peak in popularity in the early s br Slowly however the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas The inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made an opening policy inevitable which from the regime side was led by Generals Ernesto Geisel and Golbery do Couto e Silva With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in Brazil began a slow return to democracy which was completed during the s br br Civilians returned to power in when Jos Sarney assumed the presidency He became unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and hyperinflation he inherited from the military regime Sarney s unsuccessful government led to the election in of the almost unknown Fernando Collor who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in Collor was succeeded by his vice president Itamar Franco who appointed Fernando Henrique Cardoso Minister of Finance In Cardoso produced a highly successful Plano Real that after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation finally stabilized the Brazilian economy Cardoso won the election and again in br The peaceful transition of power from Cardoso to his main opposition leader Luiz In cio Lula da Silva elected in and re elected in was seen as proof that Brazil had achieved a long sought political stability However sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades from corruption police brutality inefficiencies of the political establishment and public service numerous peaceful protests erupted in Brazil from the middle of first term of Dilma Rousseff who had succeeded Lula after winning election in and again in by narrow margins br Rousseff was impeached by the Brazilian Congress in halfway into her second term and replaced by her Vice president Michel Temer who assumed full presidential powers after Rousseff s impeachment was accepted on August Large street protests for and against her took place during the impeachment process The charges against her were fueled by political and economic crises along with evidence of involvement with politicians from all the primary political parties In the Supreme Court requested the investigation of Brazilian lawmakers and nine ministers of President Michel Temer s cabinet who were allegedly linked to the Petrobras corruption scandal President Temer himself was also accused of corruption According to a poll of the population said that corruption was Brazil s biggest problem br In the fiercely disputed elections the controversial conservative candidate Jair Bolsonaro of the Social Liberal Party PSL was elected president winning in the second round Fernando Haddad of the Workers Party PT with the support of of the valid votes In the early s Brazil became one of the hardest hit countries during the COVID pandemic receiving the second highest death toll worldwide after the United States In May Luiz In cio Lula da Silva stated that he would run for a third term in the Brazilian general election against Bolsonaro On October Lula was in first place in first round with of the support from the electorate and received of the votes in the second round On January a week after Lula s inauguration a mob of Bolsonaro s supporters attacked Brazil s federal government buildings in the capital Bras lia after several weeks of unrest br br br Geography br br Brazil

Bolivia and Peru to the west Colombia to the northwest and Venezuela Guyana Suriname and France French overseas region of French Guiana to the north It shares a border with every South American country except Ecuador and Chile br The brazilian territory also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos such as Fernando de Noronha Rocas Atoll Saint Peter and Paul Rocks and Trindade and Martim Vaz Its size relief climate and natural resources make Brazil geographically diverse Including its Atlantic islands Brazil lies between latitudes N and S and longitudes and W br Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world and third largest in the Americas with a total area of km sq mi including km sq mi of water North to South Brazil is also the longest country in the world spanning km mi from north to south and the only country in the world that has the equator and the Tropic of Capricorn running through it It spans four time zones from UTC comprising the state of Acre and the westernmost portion of Amazonas to UTC in the western states to UTC in the eastern states the national time and UTC in the Atlantic islands br br br Climate br br The climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography but most of the country is tropical According to the K ppen system Brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes desert equatorial tropical semiarid oceanic and subtropical The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central Brazil Many regions have starkly different microclimates br An equatorial climate characterizes much of northern Brazil There is no real dry season but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls Temperatures average C F with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons Over central Brazil rainfall is more seasonal characteristic of a savanna climate This region is as extensive as the Amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude In the interior northeast seasonal rainfall is even more extreme South of Bahia near the coasts and more southerly most of the state of S o Paulo the distribution of rainfall changes with rain falling throughout the year The south enjoys subtropical conditions with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding C F winter frosts and snowfall are not rare in the highest areas br The semiarid climatic region generally receives less than millimeters in of rain most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year and occasionally less than this creating long periods of drought Brazil s Grande Seca Great Drought the worst in Brazil s history caused approximately half a million deaths A similarly devastating drought occurred in br In the government of Brazil pledged to reduce its annual greenhouse gases emissions by by It also set as indicative target of reaching carbon neutrality by if the country gets billion dollars per year br br br Topography and hydrography br br Brazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills mountains plains highlands and scrublands Much of the terrain lies between meters ft and meters ft in elevation The main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country The northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad rolling terrain broken by low rounded hills br The southeastern section is more rugged with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to meters ft These ranges include the Mantiqueira and Espinha o mountains and the Serra do Mar In the north the Guiana Highlands form a major drainage divide separating rivers that flow south into the Amazon Basin from rivers that empty into the Orinoco River system in Venezuela to the north The highest point in Brazil is the Pico da Neblina at meters ft and the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean br Brazil has a dense and complex system of rivers one of the world s most extensive with eight major drainage basins all of which drain into the Atlantic Major rivers include the Amazon the world s second longest river and the largest in terms of volume of water the Paran and its major tributary the Igua u which includes the Iguazu Falls the Negro S o Francisco Xingu Madeira and Tapaj s rivers br br br Biodiversity and conservation br br The wildlife of Brazil comprises all naturally occurring animals plants and fungi in the South American country Home to of the Amazon rainforest which accounts for approximately one tenth of all species in the world Brazil is considered to have the greatest biodiversity of any country on the planet containing over of all animal and plant species catalogued Brazil has the most known species of plants freshwater fish and mammals over It also ranks third on the list of countries with the most bird species and second with the most reptile species The number of fungal species is unknown but is large Brazil is second only to Indonesia as the country with the most endemic species br Brazil s large territory comprises different ecosystems such as the Amazon rainforest recognized as having the greatest biological diversity in the world with the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado sustaining the greatest biodiversity In the south the Araucaria moist forests grow under temperate conditions The rich wildlife of Brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats Scientists estimate that the total number of plant and animal species in Brazil could approach four million mostly invertebrates Larger mammals include carnivores pumas jaguars ocelots rare bush dogs and foxes and herbivores peccaries tapirs anteaters sloths opossums and armadillos Deer are plentiful in the south and many species of New World monkeys are found in the northern rain forests br br More than one fifth of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has been completely destroyed and more than mammals are endangered The threat of extinction comes from several sources including deforestation and poaching Extinction is even more problematic in the Atlantic Forest where nearly of the forest has been cleared Of the endangered animals in Brazil are in the Atlantic Forest The Amazon rainforest has been under direct threat of deforestation since the s because of rapid economic and demographic expansion Extensive legal and illegal logging destroy forests the size of a small country per year and with it a diverse series of species through habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation Since over square kilometers sq mi of the Amazon rainforest have been cleared by logging br In preserved native vegetation occupies of the Brazilian territory Agriculture occupied only of the national territory and pastures In terms of comparison in although of the entire European continent has forests only of the total forest area in Europe is of native forest Brazil has a strong interest in conservation as its agriculture sector directly depends on its forests br br br Government and politics br br The form of government is a democratic federative republic with a presidential system The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four year term with the possibility of re election for a second successive term The current president is Luiz In cio Lula da Silva The President appoints the Ministers of State who assist in government br Legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil The National Congress is the Federation s bicameral legislature consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively In the Economist Intelligence Unit s Democracy Index categorized Brazil as a flawed democracy ranking th in the report and Freedom House classified it as a free country at Freedom in the World report br The political administrative organization of the Federative Republic of Brazil comprises the Union the states the Federal District and the municipalities The Union the states the Federal District and the municipalities are the spheres of government The federation is set on five fundamental principles sovereignty citizenship dignity of human beings the social values of labor and freedom of enterprise and political pluralism br The classic tripartite branches of government executive legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system are formally established by the Constitution The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state and Federal District spheres All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected br For most of its democratic history Brazil has had a multi party system with proportional representation Voting is compulsory for the literate between and years old and optional for illiterates and those between and or beyond The country has around registered political parties Twenty political parties are represented in Congress It is common for politicians to switch parties and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly br br br Law br br Brazilian law is based on the civil law legal system and civil law concepts prevail over common law practice Most of Brazilian law is codified although non codified statutes also represent a substantial part playing a complementary role Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines however they are seldom binding on other specific cases Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams br The legal system is based on the Federal Constitution promulgated on October and the fundamental law of Brazil All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules As of July there have been amendments The highest court is the Supreme Federal Court States have their own constitutions which must not contradict the Federal Constitution Municipalities and the Federal District have organic laws leis org nicas which act in a similar way to constitutions Legislative entities are the main source of statutes although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities although in rare situations the Federal Constitution allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments There are also specialized

Geraes class dreadnoughts sparking a naval arms race between Argentina Brazil and Chile Today it is a green water force and has a group of specialized elite in retaking ships and naval facilities GRUMEC unit specially trained to protect Brazilian oil platforms along its coast As of it is the only navy in Latin America that operates a helicopter carrier NAM Atl ntico and one of twelve navies in the world to operate or have one under construction br The Air Force is the largest in Latin America and has about crewed aircraft in service and effective about personnel br br br Foreign policy br br Brazil s international relations are based on Article of the Federal Constitution which establishes non intervention self determination international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as the guiding principles of Brazil s relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations According to the Constitution the President has ultimate authority over foreign policy while the Congress is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and international treaties as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy br Brazil s foreign policy is a by product of the country s position as a regional power in Latin America a leader among developing countries and an emerging world power Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of multilateralism peaceful dispute settlement and non intervention in the affairs of other countries Brazil is a founding member state of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries CPLP also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth an international organization and political association of Lusophone nations br An increasingly well developed tool of Brazil s foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries Brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all a quiet non confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels Total aid is estimated to be around billion per year which includes In addition Brazil already managed a peacekeeping mission in Haiti million and makes in kind contributions to the World Food Programme million This is in addition to humanitarian assistance and contributions to multilateral development agencies The scale of this aid places it on par with China and India The Brazilian South South aid has been described as a global model in waiting br br br Law enforcement and crime br br In Brazil the Constitution establishes six different police agencies for law enforcement Federal Police Department Federal Highway Police Federal Railroad Police Federal District and State Penal Police included by the Constitutional Amendment No of Military Police and Civil Police Of these the first three are affiliated with federal authorities the last two are subordinate to state governments and the Penal Police can be subordinated to the federal or state district government All police forces are overseen by the executive branch of the federal or state government The National Public Security Force also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country br The country has high levels of violent crime such as gun violence and homicides In the World Health Organization WHO estimated the number of deaths per inhabitants one of the highest rates of homicide of the world The number considered acceptable by the WHO is about homicides per inhabitants In Brazil had a record murders However there are differences between the crime rates in the Brazilian states While in S o Paulo the homicide rate registered in was deaths per inhabitants in Alagoas it was homicides per inhabitants br Brazil also has high levels of incarceration It had the third largest prison population in the world of approximately prisoners as of June which put it only behind the United States and China The high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the Brazilian prison system leading to a shortfall of about accommodations br br br Human rights br br LGBT rights are generally supported within Brazil and same sex marriage has been fully recognised since However police violence and gender based discrimination remain prevalent throughout the nation Brazil has one of the highest Gini coefficient rankings in Latin America br br br Political subdivisions br br Brazil is a federation composed of states one federal district and the municipalities States have autonomous administrations collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice Despite this states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in other federal states such as the United States For example criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country br The states and the federal district are grouped into regions Northern Northeast Central West Southeast and Southern The Brazilian regions are merely geographical not political or administrative divisions and they do not have any specific form of government Although defined by law Brazilian regions serve mainly statistical purposes and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects br Municipalities as the states have autonomous administrations collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the federal and state government Each has an elected mayor and legislative body but no separate Court of Law Indeed a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called comarca county br Brazil s constitution also provides for the creation of federal territories which are administrative divisions directly controlled by the federal government However there are currently no federal territories in the country as the Constitution abolished the last three Amap and Roraima which gained statehood status and Fernando de Noronha which became a state district of Pernambuco br br br Economy br br Brazil s upper middle income mixed market economy is rich in natural resources It has the
