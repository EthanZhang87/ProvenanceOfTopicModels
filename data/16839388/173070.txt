work in described the editorial pages as rigidly neoconservative while noting that the news coverage has enjoyed a sterling reputation among readers of all political stripes br In July more than Journal journalists and Dow Jones staff members wrote a letter to new publisher Almar Latour to criticize the opinion pages lack of fact checking and transparency and its apparent disregard for evidence adding that opinion articles often make assertions that are contradicted by WSJ reporting The editorial board responded that its opinion pages won t wilt under cancel culture pressure and that the objective of the editorial content is to be independent of the Journal s news content and offer alternative views to the uniform progressive views that dominate nearly all of today s media The board s response did not address issues regarding fact checking that had been raised in the letter br br br Editorial positions br br br Economic br During the Reagan administration the newspaper s editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for supply side economics Under the editorship of Robert Bartley it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the capital gains tax could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity br In the economic argument of exchange rate regimes one of the most divisive issues among economists the Journal has a tendency to support fixed exchange rates over floating exchange rates br br br Political br br The Journal s editorial pages and columns run separately from the news pages have a conservative bent and are highly influential in establishment conservative circles Despite this the Journal refrains from endorsing candidates and has not endorsed a candidate since br The editorial board has long argued for a pro business immigration policy br The Journal s editorial page was seen as critical of many aspects of Barack Obama s presidency In particular it has been a prominent critic of the Affordable Care Act legislation passed in and has featured many opinion columns attacking various aspects of the bill The Journal s editorial page has also criticized the Obama administration s energy policies and foreign policy br On October the editorial board called for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to resign from the investigation into Russian interference in the United States elections and accused Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign of colluding with Russia In December the editorial board repeated its calls for Mueller s resignation The editorials by the editorial board caused fractures within The Wall Street Journal as reporters say that the editorials undermine the paper s credibility br In October the Journal published a letter from former President Donald Trump in the Letters to the Editor section of the editorial pages Other news sources described the contents of the letter as false and debunked claims about the presidential election The next day the editorial board published their own critique of Trump s letter br br br Scientific br The Journal editorial pages were described as a forum for climate change denial in due to columns that attacked climate scientists and accused them of engaging in fraud A study found that the Journal was alone among major American print news media in how mainly in its editorial pages it adopted a false balance that overplayed the uncertainty in climate science or denied anthropogenic climate change altogether That year the Associated Press described the Journal s editorial pages as a place friendly to climate change skeptics In the editorial board and other opinion writers vocally criticized President Obama s plan to address climate change mostly without mentioning climate science A study found The Wall Street Journal was the newspaper that was least likely to present negative effects of global warming among several newspapers It was also the most likely to present negative economic framing when discussing climate change mitigation policies tending to take the stance that the cost of such policies generally outweighs their benefit br Climate Feedback a fact checking website on media coverage of climate science determined that multiple opinion articles range between low and very low in terms of scientific credibility The Partnership for Responsible Growth stated in that of the guest editorials on climate change presented the results of mainstream climate science while the majority did not The Partnership also determined that none of the editorials concerning climate change that were published in The Wall Street Journal since conceded that the burning of fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change br In the s and s the Journal published numerous columns opposing and misrepresenting the scientific consensus on the harms of second hand smoke acid rain and ozone depletion in addition to public policy efforts to curb pesticides and asbestos The Journal later recognized that efforts to curb acid rain through cap and trade had been successful a decade after the Clean Air Act Amendments br br br Political views br Its reporting has been described as small c conservatism Some of the Journal s former reporters say that the paper has adopted a more conservative tone since Rupert Murdoch s purchase br br br Bias in news pages br br br Pre Murdoch ownership br The Journal s editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters According to CNN in the Journal s newsroom staff has a reputation for non partisan reporting Ben Smith of the New York Times described the Journal s news reporting as small c conservative and noted that its readership leans further to the right than other major newspapers br In a study Tim Groseclose and Jeffrey Milyo argue the Journal s news pages have a pro liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks They calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks They found that the news reporting of the Journal was the most liberal more liberal than NPR or The New York Times The study did not factor in editorials Mark Liberman criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that the model starts with a very peculiar assumption about the relationship between political opinion and the choice of authorities to cite The authors assume that think tank ideology only matters to liberals br The company s planned and eventual acquisition by News Corp in led to significant media criticism and discussion br about whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under Rupert Murdoch An August editorial responded to the questions by asserting that Murdoch intended to maintain the values and integrity of the Journal br br br During Trump presidency br In and the Journal leadership under Baker came under fire from critics both from the outside and from within the newsroom who viewed the paper s coverage of President Donald Trump as too timid Particularly controversial was the Journal s November front page headline that repeated Trump s false claim that millions of people had voted illegally in the election only noting that the statement was without corroboration br Also controversial was a January note from Baker to Journal editors directing them to avoid using the phrase seven majority Muslim countries when writing about Trump s executive order on travel and immigration Baker later sent a follow up note clarifying that there was no ban on the phrase but that the publication should always be careful that this term is not offered as the only description of the countries covered under the ban br At a town hall style meeting with Journal staff in February Baker defended the paper s coverage saying that it was objective and protected the paper from being dragged into the political process through a dispute with the Trump administration br A survey conducted by Gallup and the Knight Foundation found that The Wall Street Journal was considered the third most accurate and fourth most unbiased news organization among the general public tenth among Democrats and second among Republicans br On February China announced the revoking of the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters based in Beijing China accused the paper of failing to apologize for publishing articles that criticized China s efforts to fight the COVID pandemic and failing to investigate and punish those responsible br In June following the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests journalists at the Journal sent a letter to editor in chief Matt Murray demanding changes to the way the paper covers race policing and finance The reporters stated that they frequently meet resistance when trying to reflect the accounts and voices of workers residents or customers with some editors voicing heightened skepticism of those sources credibility compared with executives government officials or other entities br br br Notable stories br The Journal has won Pulitzer Prizes in its history Staff journalists who led some

World Trade Center on September Its headquarters at One World Financial Center was severely damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Center just across the street Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue for the first time in the paper s year history They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor s home while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones s South Brunswick Township New Jersey corporate campus where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the World Trade Center bombing The paper was on the stands the next day albeit in scaled down form Perhaps the most compelling story in that day s edition was a first hand account of the Twin Towers collapse written by then Foreign Editor John Bussey who holed up in a ninth floor Journal office literally in the shadow of the towers from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed shattering all the windows in the Journal s offices and filling them with dust and debris The Journal won a Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day s stories br The Journal subsequently conducted a

state investment company to the personal accounts of Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak at AmBank the fifth largest lender in Malaysia Razak responded by threatening to sue the New York based

written by the Journal s John Carreyrou alleged that blood testing company Theranos technology was faulty and founder Elizabeth Holmes was misleading investors According to Vanity Fair a damning report published in The Wall Street Journal had alleged that the company was in effect a sham that its vaunted core technology was actually faulty and that Theranos administered almost all of its blood tests using competitors equipment The Journal has subsequently published several more reports questioning Theranos and Holmes credibility In May Carreyrou released a book about Theranos Bad
