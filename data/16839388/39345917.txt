Hiro meets Tadashi s closest friends there Go Go Tomago Wasabi Honey Lemon and Frederick Fred Frederickson IV Tadashi also introduces Baymax an inflatable healthcare robot he invented and his mentor Professor Robert Callaghan Hiro applies to the university impressing the school s showcase with his project a swarm of tiny microbots that can link together in any configuration using a neural transmitter He is accepted but the celebration is short lived when a fire breaks out with Callaghan caught in it Tadashi rushes back into the building to save him but an explosion occurs A funeral is subsequently held for Tadashi and Callaghan br Two weeks later Hiro who has isolated himself in grief inadvertently activates Baymax Hiro s only remaining microbot begins to move on its own and he and Baymax follow it to an abandoned warehouse where they discover a Kabuki masked man known as Yokai mass producing the microbots He tries to dispose of the duo but they narrowly escape Hiro suspects that Yokai caused the fire to cover up the theft of the microbots Determined to avenge Tadashi Hiro equips Baymax with armor and a chip programmed with martial arts for defense Baymax contacts Tadashi s friends who meet up with Hiro Yokai pursues the group through the streets but Baymax saves them At Fred s family home Hiro upgrades Baymax s armor and the group weaponizes their own inventions to combat Yokai br Believing Yokai is tech mogul Alistair Krei who had wanted to buy Hiro s microbots the group tracks him to an abandoned Krei Tech laboratory on a remote island They discover the laboratory was used for teleportation research however the government shut down the lab after a test pilot disappeared inside an experimental portal The group are soon ambushed by Yokai but Hiro knocks off his mask Yokai is revealed to be Callaghan who had faked his death by using the microbots to protect himself from the explosion Realizing that Tadashi died in vain an enraged Hiro violates Baymax s healthcare protocol by removing his healthcare chip and orders Baymax to terminate Callaghan despite his friends objections Baymax obeys Hiro s commands before Honey manages to reinsert his healthcare chip returning him to his usual personality as Callaghan escapes Feeling betrayed by his friends actions Hiro flies off with Baymax still intent on avenging Tadashi br Back at home Hiro tries to remove the healthcare chip again but Baymax recognizes Hiro s impulsivity and blocks his access port He then shows Hiro footage of how Tadashi developed him reminding Hiro that Tadashi s goal was to help others Hiro apologizes to Baymax and his friends through research they discover that the lost test pilot was Callaghan s daughter Abigail Having stolen the microbots to seek revenge on Krei Callaghan reactivates the teleportation portal to demolish his company s headquarters but Hiro Baymax and their friends defeat him and save Krei br Baymax detects that Abigail is still alive inside the portal Despite Krei s protests about the portal being too unstable Baymax and Hiro enter the portal and find Abigail trapped in hyper sleep Baymax is struck by debris causing his armor to break and forcing Hiro to leave him behind After a sad goodbye Baymax uses his rocket fist to propel Hiro and Abigail out of the portal before it is destroyed In the aftermath Abigail is taken to the hospital while her father is arrested Sometime later after beginning his tenure at the institute with his friends Hiro discovers Baymax s healthcare chip clenched in the rocket fist He rebuilds Baymax and they and their friends continue to protect the city as a team of high tech superheroes known as Big Hero br In a post credits scene Fred stumbles upon a secret superhero lair in his home and is reunited with his father br br br Voice cast br br Scott Adsit as Baymax an inflatable robot built by Tadashi as a medical assistant Co director Don Hall said Baymax views the world from one perspective he just wants to help people he sees Hiro as his patient Producer Roy Conli said The fact that his character is a robot limits how you can emote but Scott was hilarious He took those boundaries and was able to shape the language in a way that makes you feel Baymax s emotion and sense of humor Scott was able to relay just how much Baymax cares br Ryan Potter as Hiro Hamada a year old robotics prodigy Speaking of the character Hall said Hiro is transitioning from boy to man it s a tough time for a kid and some teenagers develop that inevitable snarkiness and jaded attitude Luckily Ryan is a very likeable kid So no matter what he did he was able to take the edge off the character in a way that made him authentic but appealing br Daniel Henney as Tadashi Hamada Hiro s older brother and Baymax s creator On Tadashi and Hiro s relationship Conli said We really wanted them to be brothers first Tadashi is a smart mentor He very subtly introduces Hiro to his friends and what they do at San Fransokyo Tech Once Hiro sees Wasabi Honey Go Go and Fred in action he realizes that there s a much bigger world out there that really interests him br T J Miller as Frederick Flamarian Fred Frederickson IV a comic book fan and slacker who is also a team mascot at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology Speaking of Miller co director Chris Williams said He s a real student of comedy There are a lot of layers to his performance so Fred ended up becoming a richer character than anyone expected both literally and metaphorically br Jamie Chung as Go Go Tomago a tough and athletic student who specializes in electromagnetics Hall said She s definitely a woman of few words We looked at bicycle messengers as inspiration for her character br Damon Wayans Jr as Wasabi a smart and slightly neurotic youth who specializes in lasers On the character Williams said He s actually the most conservative cautious he sic the most normal among a group of brazen characters So he really grounds the movie in the second act and becomes in a way the voice of the audience and points out that what they re doing is crazy br Genesis Rodriguez as Honey Lemon a chemistry enthusiast at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology Williams said She s a glass is half full kind of person But she has this mad scientist quality with a twinkle in her eye there s more to Honey than it seems br Rodriguez reprised her role in the Latin American Spanish dubbing of the movie br James Cromwell as Robert Callaghan Yokai the head of a robotics program at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology who becomes an extremely powerful masked supervillain to exact revenge on Krei br Alan Tudyk as Alistair Krei a pioneer entrepreneur tech guru and the CEO of Krei Tech who is always on the hunt for the next big thing br Maya Rudolph as Cass Hamada Hiro and Tadashi s aunt and guardian br Katie Lowes as Abigail Callaghan the daughter of Professor Callaghan and a test pilot for Krei Tech br Daniel Gerson as Desk Sergeant Gerson the desk sergeant for the San Fransokyo Police Department br Paul Briggs as Yama a notorious gangster who seeks revenge on Hiro after he defeats his robot in a clandestine robot fight with illegal betting br David Shaughnessy as Heathcliff Fred s family butler br Billy Bush as a newscaster br Stan Lee as Fred s father who appears during the tour of Fred s home in a family portrait and briefly appears in the film s post credits scene where it is revealed that he was once a superhero br br br Production br br After the Walt Disney Company s acquisition of Marvel Entertainment in CEO Bob Iger encouraged the company s divisions to explore Marvel s properties for adaptation concepts By deliberately picking an obscure title it would give them the freedom to come up with their own version While directing Winnie the Pooh director Don Hall was scrolling through a Marvel database when he stumbled upon Big Hero a comic he had never heard of before I just liked the title he said He pitched the concept to John Lasseter in as one of five ideas for possible productions for Walt Disney Animation Studios and this particular idea struck a chord with Lasseter Hall and Chris Williams br In June Disney confirmed that Walt Disney Animation Studios was adapting Marvel Comics series and that the film had been commissioned into early stages of development Because they wanted the concept to feel new and fresh head of story Paul Briggs who also voices Yama in the film only read a few issues of the comic while screenwriter Robert L Baird admitted he had not read the comic at all br Big Hero was produced solely by Walt Disney Animation Studios although several members of Marvel s creative team were involved in the film s production including Joe Quesada Marvel s chief creative officer and Jeph Loeb head of Marvel Television According to an interview with Axel Alonso by Comic Book Resources Marvel did not have any plans to publish a tie in comic Disney planned to reprint the Marvel version of Big Hero themselves but reportedly Marvel disagreed They eventually came to agreement that Yen Press would publish the Japanese manga version of Big Hero for Disney br Conversely Lasseter dismissed the idea of a rift between the two companies and producer Roy Conli stated that Marvel allowed Disney complete freedom in structuring the story Disney Animation Studio President Andrew Millstein stated Hero is one example of what we ve learned over the years and our embracing some of the Pixar DNA Regarding the film s story Quesada stated The relationship between Hiro and his robot has a very Disney flavor to it but it s combined with these Marvel heroic arcs The production team decided early on not to connect the film to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and instead set the film in a stand alone universe br br With respect to the design of Baymax Hall mentioned in an interview I wanted a robot that we had never seen before and something to be wholly original That s a tough thing to do we ve got a lot of robots in pop culture everything from The Terminator to WALL E to C PO on down the line and not to mention Japanese robots I won t go into that So I wanted to do something original Even if they did not yet know what the robot should look like artist Lisa Keene came up with the idea that it should be a huggable robot Other sources of inspiration cited by the team include Japanese anime such as Hayao Miyazaki films including Spirited Away and The Wind Rises and Pok mon as well as Shogun Warriors toys Mecha designer Shigeto Koyama who previously did design work for mecha anime such as Gunbuster Eureka Seven Gurren Lagann and Rebuild of Evangelion worked on the concept design for Baymax br Early on in the development process Hall and the design team took a research trip to Carnegie Mellon University s Robotics Institute where they met a team of DARPA funded researchers who were pioneering the new field of soft robotics using inflatable vinyl which ultimately inspired Baymax s inflatable vinyl truly huggable design Hall stated that I met a researcher Chris Atkeson who was working on soft robots It was an inflatable vinyl arm and the practical app would be in the healthcare industry as a nurse or doctor s assistant He had me at vinyl This particular researcher went into this long pitch but the minute he showed me that inflatable arm I knew we had our huggable robot Hall stated that the technology will have potential probably in the medical industry in the future making robots that are very pliable and gentle and not going to hurt people when they pick them up br Hall mentioned that achieving a unique look for the mechanical armor took some time and just trying to get something that felt like the personality of the character Williams stated A big part of the design challenge is when he puts on the armor you want to feel that he s a very powerful intimidating presence at the same time design wise he has to relate to the really adorable simple vinyl robot underneath Baymax s face design was inspired by a copper suzu bell that Hall noticed while at a Shinto shrine br According to Conli Lasseter initially disliked Baymax s description while low on battery power of Hiro s cat as a hairy baby but Williams kept the line in anyway and at the film s first test screening Lasseter admitted that Williams was correct br According to Williams Baymax was originally going to be introduced rather late in the film but then story artist John Ripa conceived of a way for Baymax to meet Hiro much earlier The entire film became much stronger by establishing the relationship between Hiro and Baymax early on but the filmmakers ended up having to reconstruct a fair amount of the first act in order to make that idea work br About ninety animators worked on the film at one point or another some worked on the project for as long as two years In terms of the film s animation style and settings the film combines Eastern world culture predominantly Japanese with Western world culture predominantly California In May Disney released concept art and rendered footage of San Fransokyo from the film San Fransokyo the futuristic mashup of San Francisco and Tokyo was described by Hall as an alternate version of San Francisco Most of the technology is advanced but much of it feels retro Where Hiro lives it feels like the Haight I love the Painted ladies We gave them a Japanese makeover we put a cafe on the bottom of one They live above a coffee shop The house that Hiro s family lives in is based on a Victorian house at the corner of Haight Street and Masonic Avenue in the Haight Ashbury According to production designer Paul Felix The topography is exaggerated because what we do is caricature I think the hills are times exaggerated I don t think you could really walk up them When you get to the downtown area that s when you get the most Tokyo fied that pure layered dense kind of feeling of the commercial district there When you get out of there it becomes more San Francisco with the Japanese aesthetic It s a bit like Blade Runner but contained to a few square blocks You see the skyscrapers contrasted with the hills br The reason why Disney wanted to merge Tokyo which is where the comic book version takes place with San Francisco was partly because San Francisco had not been used by Marvel before partly because of all the city s iconic aspects and partly because they felt its aesthetics would blend well with Tokyo The filmmakers idea was that San Fransokyo is based on an alternative history in which San Francisco was largely rebuilt by Japanese immigrants in the aftermath of the earthquake although this premise is not stated in the film br To create San Fransokyo as a detailed digital simulation of an entire city Disney purchased the actual assessor data for the entire city and county of San Francisco The final city contains over buildings and vehicles br A software program called Denizen was used to create over distinctive characters that populate the city Another one named Bonzai was responsible for the creation of the city s trees while a new rendering system called Hyperion offered new illumination possibilities like light shining through a translucent object e g Baymax s vinyl covering Pixar s RenderMan was considered as a Plan B for the film s rendering if Hyperion was not able to meet production deadlines br Development on Hyperion started in and was based upon research into multi bounce complex global illumination originally conducted at Disney Research in Z rich Disney in turn had to assemble a new super computing cluster just to handle Hyperion s immense processing demands which consists of over Linux workstations distributed across four data centers three in Los Angeles and one in San Francisco Each workstation as of included a pair of GHz Intel Xeon processors GB of memory and a pair of GB solid state drives configured as a RAID Level array i e to operate as a single GB drive This was all backed by a central storage system with a capacity of five petabytes which holds all digital assets as well as archival copies of all Disney Animation films Cinematographer Robert Richardson was brought on as a visual consultant to assist in the creation of realistic lighting br The emotional climax takes place in the middle of a wormhole portal which is represented by the stylized interior of a mandelbulb br The post credits scene was only added to the film in August late in production after Hall and his crew went to see Marvel Studios Guardians of the Galaxy He stated that i t horrified us that people were sat waiting for an end credits thing because of the Marvel DNA We didn t want people to leave the movie disappointed br br br Music br br Henry Jackman composed the score for the film The soundtrack features an original song titled Immortals written and recorded by American rock band Fall Out Boy which was released by Walt Disney Records on October The soundtrack album was digitally released by Walt Disney Records on November and had a CD release on November While not part of the soundtrack a brief instrumental section of Eye of the Tiger plays in the film For the Japanese release of the album a previously unreleased English version of Japanese American singer Ai s

short Feast br For the South Korean release of the film it was retitled Big Hero to avoid the impression of being a sequel and edited to remove indications of the characters Japanese origin This is owing to the tense relations between Korea and Japan For instance the protagonist s name Hiro Hamada was changed to Hero Armada and Japanese language signage onscreen was changed to English Nonetheless the film caused some online controversy in South Korea because of small images resembling the Rising Sun Flag in the protagonist s room br The film was released in China on February Disney

mainland Chinese title of the film is which is usually interpreted as super power marines while the character which means land is also six in Chinese numerals so this title can translate to super
