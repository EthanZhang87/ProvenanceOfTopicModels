The Seas with Nemo Friends formerly The Living Seas is a pavilion located in the World Nature section of Epcot a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake Florida The pavilion is themed as an oceanic exploration base called SeaBase Alpha with several exhibits devoted to oceanic study The building includes an aquarium and its attached dark ride attraction a talk show type attraction called Turtle Talk with Crush and the Coral Reef Restaurant With million US gallons of tank volume the pavilion is also the second largest aquarium in the U S and the sixth largest in the world br The Living Seas opened in but had been planned as part of the park since its opening in The pavilion was re themed in as The Seas with Nemo Friends after the film Finding Nemo br br br History br br br The Living Seas br br The Living Seas opened to the public on January It housed the largest saltwater tank in the world at its completion holding million US gallons L of water but was surpassed in with the opening of the Georgia Aquarium The concept of the building was to take visitors under the ocean to Sea Base Alpha Guests viewed a short movie about the formation of the oceans entitled The Sea which was followed by an elevator ride to the ocean floor aboard a Hydrolator in reality guests rode a stationary hydraulic elevator while moving walls sound effects and a vibrating floor gave the effect of traveling a long distance downward Guests then boarded a Seacab on the Caribbean Coral Reef Ride and rode through the middle of the tank They then disembarked into the main exhibit area where they could interact with various multimedia displays Once finished guests leaving the pavilion would then board another Hydrolator to the surface which similar to the first set of elevators simulated upward motion br The Living Seas was sponsored by United Technologies from its opening until After the departure of United Technologies as the sponsor of The Living Seas significant changes were made to the pavilion All sponsorship references were removed from the pavilion Preshow theatre was removed and a corridor was built through its space allowing guests to bypass the preshow if they wished to go directly to the Hydrolators br On October as a result of declining patronage following the September attacks the Seacabs closed down and were walled off The queue of the Seacab ride was left intact and the Seacabs were still visible to guests through the ocean tank windows After they closed guests leaving the Hydrolators walked along the former wheelchair bypass corridor to Sea Base Alpha Now guests had the option of viewing the preshow or going directly to the Hydrolators and simply walking to Sea Base Alpha br br br The Seas with Nemo Friends The Seas present br br In December Disney began to re theme The Living Seas into a new pavilion based on the recently released Pixar film Finding Nemo The majority of the transformation began with exterior elements but in January the interior began to change as well On November Turtle Talk with Crush opened in what was once Module C or the Earth Systems exhibit The show s unexpected success overwhelmed the pavilion causing the development of plans to move Turtle Talk with Crush to a larger area in the pavilion br Turtle Talk with Crush was only the beginning of changes to The Living Seas On August The Living Seas closed for its transformation into The Seas with Nemo Friends Parts of the pavilion reopened in late November Outside the pavilion the facade and mural were changed and depictions of sea life seen in Finding Nemo were added The exit Hydrolators had been removed and were replaced with glass doors that served as an exit and temporary entrance Sea Base Alpha had been re themed to Finding Nemo and the entire original preshow area was in the process of being rebuilt Decor and signage were replaced and scientific displays were replaced by ones themed to Finding Nemo Turtle Talk with Crush remained as popular as it was before the transformation br Throughout construction walls hid the preshow area which was undergoing reconstruction With the former Sea Base Alpha open work progressed on the new queue areas and the Seacabs were being rebuilt as a new Clamobile attraction The remaining Living Seas preshow theater entrance Hydrolators holding areas and Seacabs queue were all completely removed and replaced by a new themed queue area Hydrolator Three and Theater were replaced by a number of new dark ride sets The former Seacabs ride was lengthened by feet m through the space formerly used by the preshow theatre but the final section still took place inside the tank A new projection technology was added to the tank and the new show scenes The existing Seacabs were given a clamshell shape and renamed Clamobiles Three Audio Animatronic seagulls were also added to the entrance They periodically flap their wings and say Mine Mine Mine just like the seagulls do in Finding Nemo br On October the construction walls in front of the entrance to The Living Seas now The Seas with Nemo Friends were removed The temporary entrance was removed from the exit Turtle Talk With Crush was removed from Module C and relocated to the second preshow theater which had been unused since when it had been broken up by the bypass corridor following United Technologies discontinuation of sponsorship Module A was turned into a pre show space for the expanded Turtle Talk With Crush with its exhibits moving to C while a new queue line corridor was built from the module into the existing theater space using a backstage fire exit The Seas with Nemo Friends was rededicated on January br It was the first Epcot Pavilion to be based on a Disney animated movie property and only the second Epcot attraction to use characters from the movies The Lion King based Circle of Life An Environmental Fable at The Land Pavilion s Harvest Theater was the first opening in replacing Symbiosis br In late new directory signage was installed in Seabase Alpha restoring the former Living Seas logo as the pavilion was now renamed The Seas Pavilion br In September the three audio animatronic seagulls found at the entrance were removed The characters on the facade of the attraction were also removed and the pavilion was repainted back to its original color scheme during this time br br br Pavilion br br br Attractions br The Seas with Nemo Friends Guests board Clamobiles and venture into the sea to join Marlin Dory and other characters from the film Finding Nemo as they search for Nemo who has gotten lost again Guests first journey through a coral reef where they find Marlin searching for Nemo Farther along the reef they come across Mr Ray and his students setting out to explore and look for Nemo Dory soon joins Marlin in the search and they come upon a group of jellyfish An anglerfish comes out of the darkness and begins to chase them frantically Guests dive deeper and come upon the wreck of a massive submarine that sits in the center of a deadly minefield Peeking out from the wreck is Bruce a great white shark and Chum a mako shark trying to coax Nemo out from his hiding spot Anchor a hammerhead shark is not included in the ride They assure him in their sneaky voices that fish are friends not food The Clamobiles are then swept up into the East Australian Current with Nemo Crush and Squirt The current empties the guests out into a massive aquarium where Nemo is reunited once again with his friends As they sing a closing song In the Big Blue World although the ride opened first this song was adapted from the Disney s Animal Kingdom show Finding Nemo The Musical these animated Pixar characters swim in the actual aquarium with real fish through the use of special effect glass The Clamobiles then return to the surface br Sea Base Main viewing area of the aquarium A smaller aquarium features a pair of rescued West Indian manatees Other small tanks feature a

floor to ceiling windows into the aquarium The room also has an acrylic glass see through piano br br br Technology and effects br Although fairly simple technology there are some amazing effects throughout the pavilion In the room where Marlin gets chased by an anglerfish there are robotic arms holding the animatronics together so they look like they re chasing each other Another effect is in the finale where a projector from the ceiling projects the fictional fish into the real aquarium so it looks like Nemo and his friends are swimming with the real fish Turtle Talk with Crush features an effect where there are hidden cameras along with a cast member using a puppet to simulate the movement of the digital turtle Whenever a guest raises a hand or asks a question the cast member looks through the hidden camera and reacts to the guest moving the puppet to simulate the digital turtle br br br Voice cast br Anthony DeMarco as Nemo br Jess Harnell as Marlin br Jennifer Hale as Dory br
