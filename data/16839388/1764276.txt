The Autobahn IPA a to ba n German plural Autobahnen pronounced a to ba n n is the federal controlled access highway system in Germany The official German term is Bundesautobahn abbreviated BAB which translates as federal motorway The literal meaning of the word Bundesautobahn is Federal Auto mobile Track br Much of the system has no speed limit for some classes of vehicles However limits are posted and enforced in areas that are urbanised substandard accident prone or under construction On speed unrestricted stretches an advisory speed limit Richtgeschwindigkeit of kilometres per hour mph applies While driving faster is not illegal in the absence of a speed limit it can cause an increased liability in the case of a collision which mandatory auto insurance has to cover courts have ruled that an ideal driver who is exempt from absolute liability for inevitable tort under the law would not exceed the advisory speed limit br A report by the Federal Road Research Institute reported that in of the Autobahn network had only the advisory speed limit had temporary speed limits due to weather or traffic conditions and had permanent speed limits Measurements from the German state of Brandenburg in showed average speeds of km h mph on a lane section of Autobahn in free flowing conditions br br br Names br Only federally built controlled access highways with certain construction standards including at least two lanes per direction are called Bundesautobahn They have their own white on blue signs and numbering system In the s when construction began on the system the official name was Reichsautobahn Various other controlled access highways exist on the federal Bundesstra e state Landesstra e district and municipal level but are not part of the Autobahn network and are officially referred to as Kraftfahrstra e with rare exceptions like A Munich Giesing Brunntal until These highways are considered autobahn hnlich autobahn like and are sometimes colloquially called Gelbe Autobahn yellow autobahn because most of them are Bundesstra en federal highways with yellow signs Some controlled access highways are classified as Bundesautobahn in spite of not meeting the autobahn construction standard for example the A near Pirmasens br Similar to some other German words the term autobahn when used in English is usually understood to refer specifically to the national highway system of Germany whereas in German the word autobahn is applied to any controlled highway in any country For this reason in German the more specific term Bundesautobahn is strongly preferred when the intent is to make specific reference to Germany s Autobahn network br br br Construction br br Similar to high speed motorways in other countries autobahns have multiple lanes of traffic in each direction separated by a central barrier with grade separated junctions and access restricted to motor vehicles with a top speed greater than km h mph Nearly all exits are to the right rare left hand exits result from incomplete interchanges where the straight on leads into the exit The earliest motorways were flanked by shoulders about centimetres in in width constructed of varying materials right hand shoulders on many autobahns were later retrofitted to centimetres in in width when it was realized cars needed the additional space to pull off the autobahn safely In the postwar years a thicker asphaltic concrete cross section with fully paved hard shoulders came into general use The top design speed was approximately km h mph in flat country but lower design speeds were used in hilly or mountainous terrain A flat country autobahn that was constructed to meet standards during the Nazi period could support speeds of up to km h mph on curves br br br Numbering system br br The current autobahn numbering system in use in Germany was introduced in All autobahns are named by using the capital letter A which simply stands for Autobahn followed by a blank and a number for example A The main autobahns going all across Germany have a single digit number Shorter autobahns that are of regional importance e g connecting two major cities or regions within Germany have a double digit number e g A connecting Berlin and Hamburg The system is as follows br br A to A are in eastern Germany Berlin Saxony Anhalt parts of Saxony and Brandenburg br A to A are in northern and northeastern Germany br A to A are in Lower Saxony northwestern Germany and Thuringia br A to A are in the Rhine Ruhr to Frankfurt Rhine Main br A to A are in the Lower Rhine region to Cologne br A to A are in Rhineland Palatinate Saarland Hesse and northern Baden W rttemberg br A to A are in Thuringia northern Bavaria and parts of Saxony br A is in Baden W rttemberg br A to A are in southern Bavaria br A is in Baden W rttemberg br There are also some very short autobahns built just for local traffic e g ring roads or the A from Cologne to Bonn that usually have three digits for numbering The first digit used is similar to the system above depending on the region br East west routes are even numbered north south routes are odd numbered The north south autobahns are generally numbered from west to east that is to say the more easterly roads are given higher numbers Similarly the east west routes are numbered from north lower numbers to south higher numbers br br br History br br br Early years br br The idea for the construction of the autobahn was first conceived in the mid s during the days of the Weimar Republic but the construction was slow and most projected sections did not progress much beyond the planning stage due to economic problems and a lack of political support One project was the private initiative HaFraBa which planned a car only road crossing Germany from Hamburg in the north via central Frankfurt am Main to Basel in Switzerland Parts of the HaFraBa were completed in the late s and early s but construction eventually was halted by World War II The first public road of this kind was completed in between Cologne and Bonn and opened by Konrad Adenauer Lord Mayor of Cologne and future Chancellor of West Germany on August Today that road is the Bundesautobahn This road was not yet called Autobahn and lacked a centre median like modern motorways but instead was termed a Kraftfahrstra e motor vehicle road with two lanes each direction without intersections pedestrians bicycles or animal powered transportation br br br s br br Just days after the Nazi takeover Adolf Hitler enthusiastically embraced an ambitious autobahn construction project appointing Fritz Todt the Inspector General of German Road Construction to lead it By workers were directly employed in construction as well as an additional in the supply chain for construction equipment steel concrete signage maintenance equipment etc In rural areas new camps to house the workers were built near construction sites The job creation program aspect was not especially important because full employment was almost reached by However according to one source autobahn workers were often conscripted through the compulsory Reich Labor Service and thereby removed from the unemployment registry br The autobahns were not primarily intended as major infrastructure improvement of special value to the military as sometimes stated Their military value was limited as all large scale military transportation in Germany was done by train to save fuel The propaganda ministry turned the construction of the autobahns into a major media event that attracted international attention br The autobahns formed the first limited access high speed road network in the world with the first section from Frankfurt am Main to Darmstadt opening in This straight section was used for high speed record attempts by the Grand Prix racing teams of Mercedes Benz and Auto Union until a fatal accident involving popular German race driver Bernd Rosemeyer in early The world record of kilometres per hour mph set by Rudolf Caracciola on this stretch just prior to the accident remains one of the highest speeds ever achieved on a public motorway In the s a ten kilometre stretch of what is today Bundesautobahn just south of Dessau called the Dessauer Rennstrecke had bridges with no piers and was designed for cars like the Mercedes Benz T to attempt to make land speed records The T was to make a record attempt in January but plans were abandoned after the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September br br br World War II br During World War II many of Germany s workers were required for various war production tasks Therefore construction work on the autobahn system increasingly relied on forced workers and concentration camp inmates and working conditions were very poor As of when the war turned against the Third Reich only km mi out of a planned km mi of autobahn had been completed br Meanwhile the median strips of some autobahns were paved over to allow their conversion into auxiliary airstrips Aircraft were either stashed in numerous tunnels or camouflaged in nearby woods However for the most part during the war the autobahns were not militarily significant Motor vehicles such as trucks could not carry goods or troops as quickly or in as much bulk and in the same numbers as trains could and the autobahns could not be used by tanks as their weight and caterpillar tracks damaged the road surface The general shortage of petrol in Germany during much of the war as well as the low number of trucks and motor vehicles needed for direct support of military operations further decreased the autobahn s significance As a result most military and economic freight was carried by rail After the war numerous sections of the autobahns were in bad shape severely damaged by heavy Allied bombing and military demolition Furthermore thousands of kilometres of autobahns remained unfinished their construction brought to a halt by due to the increasing demands of the war effort br br br West Germany br In West Germany FRG most existing autobahns were repaired soon after the war During the s the West German government restarted the construction program It invested in new sections and in improvements to older ones Finishing the incomplete sections took longer with some stretches opened to traffic by the s Some sections cut by the Iron Curtain in were only completed after German reunification in Others were never completed as more advantageous routes were found An example is Strecke between Bad Br ckenau and Gem nden am Main on the Fulda W rzburg route which was replaced by A br br br East Germany br br The autobahns of East Germany GDR were neglected in comparison to those in West Germany after East German autobahns were used primarily for GDR military traffic and for state owned farming or manufacturing vehicles The speed limit on the GDR autobahns was kilometres per hour mph however lower speed limits were frequently encountered due to poor or quickly changing road conditions The speed limits on the GDR autobahns were rigorously enforced by the Volkspolizei whose patrol cars were frequently found hiding under camouflage tarpaulins waiting for speeders br br br Reunification present day br The last kilometres mi of the remaining original Reichsautobahn a section of A northeast of Berlin near Gartz built in the westernmost remainder of the never finished Berlinka was scheduled for replacement around Roadway condition is described as deplorable the metres ft long concrete slabs too long for proper expansion are cracking under the weight of the traffic as well as the weather br br br Length br Germany s autobahn network has a total length of about kilometres mi in and a density of motorway kilometres per thousand square kilometers Eurostat which ranks it among the densest and longest controlled access systems in the world and fifth in density within the EU in Netherlands Finland Longer similar systems can be found in the United States kilometres mi and in China kilometres mi However both the U S and China have an area nearly times bigger than Germany which demonstrates the high density of Germany s highway system br br br German built Reichsautobahnen in other countries br The first autobahn in Austria was the West Autobahn from Wals near Salzburg to Vienna Building started by command of Adolf Hitler shortly after the Anschluss in It extended the Reichsautobahn from Munich the present day A however only km mi including the branch off of the planned Tauern Autobahn was opened to the public on September Construction works discontinued the next year and were not resumed until br There are sections of the former German Reichsautobahn system in the former eastern territories of Germany i e East Prussia Farther Pomerania and Silesia these territories became parts of Poland and the Soviet Union with the implementation of the Oder Neisse line after World War II Parts of the planned autobahn from Berlin to K nigsberg the Berlinka were completed as far as Stettin Szczecin on September After the war they were incorporated as the A autostrada of the Polish motorway network A single carriageway section of the Berlinka east of the former Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig opened in today it forms the Polish S expressway from Elbl g Elbing to the border with the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast where it is continued by the R regional road Also on September a section from Breslau Wroc aw to Liegnitz Legnica in Silesia was inaugurated which today is part of the Polish A autostrada followed by the single vehicle Reichsautobahn from Bunzlau Boles awiec to Sagan aga the next year today part of the Polish A autostrada br After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia plans for a motorway connecting Breslau with Vienna via Brno Br nn in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia were carried out from until construction works discontinued in A section of the former Strecke near Brno is today part of the D motorway of the Czech Republic Also there is the isolated and abandoned twin carriageway Borovsko Bridge southeast of Prague on which construction started in July and halted after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich by former Czechoslovak army soldiers at the end of May br br br Current density br br As of Germany s autobahn network has a total length of about kilometres mi From Germany has embarked on a massive widening and rehabilitation project expanding the lane count of many of its major arterial routes such as the A in the southwest and A going east west br Most sections of Germany s autobahns have two or three sometimes four lanes in each direction in addition to an emergency lane hard shoulder A few sections have only two lanes in each direction without emergency lanes and short slip roads and ramps br The motorway density in Germany is kilometers per thousand square kilometer in close to that of the smaller countries nearby Netherlands Belgium Luxembourg Switzerland Slovenia br br br Facilities br br br Emergency telephones br br About emergency telephones are distributed at regular intervals all along the autobahn network with triangular stickers on the armco barriers pointing the way to the nearest one Despite the increasing use of mobile phones there are still about calls made each day on average after some in This still equals four calls per kilometre each year The location of the caller is automatically sent to the operator br br br Parking rest areas and truck stops br br For breaks during longer journeys parking sites rest areas and truck stops are distributed over the complete Autobahn network Parking on the autobahn is prohibited in the strictest terms outside these designated areas There is a distinction between managed and unmanaged rest areas German bewirtschaftet unbewirtschaftet br br Unmanaged rest areas are basically only parking spaces sometimes with toilets They form a part of the German highway system the plots of land are federal property Autobahn exits leading to such parking areas are marked at least metres ft mostly metres ft in advance with a blue sign with the white letter P They are usually found every few kilometres Some of them bear local or historic names br A managed rest area German Autobahnrastst tte or Rastst tte German ast t t for short usually also includes a filling station charging station lavatories toilets and baby changes Most rest areas also have restaurants shops public telephones Internet access and a playground Some have hotels Mandated every kilometres mi or so rest areas are usually open all night br Both kinds of rest areas are directly on the autobahn with their own exits and any service roads connecting them to the rest of the road network are usually closed to general traffic Apart from rare exceptions the autobahn must not be left nor entered at rest areas br br Truck stops German Autohof German a to ho f plural Autoh fe German a to h f are large filling stations located at general exits usually at a small distance from the autobahn combined with fast food facilities and or restaurants but have no ramps of their own They mostly sell fuel at normal price level while the Rastst tten fuel prices are significantly higher br br Rest areas and truck stops are marked several times as motorists approach starting several kilometres in advance and include large signs that often include icons announcing what kinds of facilities travellers can expect such as hotels filling stations rest areas etc br br br Speed limits br br Germany s autobahns are famous for being among the few public roads in the world without blanket speed limits for cars and motorcycles As such they are important German cultural identifiers often mentioned in hushed reverential tones by motoring enthusiasts and looked at with a mix of awe and terror by outsiders Some speed limits are implemented on different autobahns br Certain limits are imposed on some classes of vehicles br br Additionally speed limits are posted at most on and off ramps and interchanges and other danger points like sections under construction or in need of repair br Where no general limit exists the advisory speed limit is km h mph referred to in German as the Richtgeschwindigkeit The advisory speed is not enforceable however being involved in an accident driving at higher speeds can lead to the driver being deemed at least partially responsible due to increased operating danger Erh hte Betriebsgefahr br The Federal Road Research Institute Bundesanstalt f r Stra enwesen solicited information about speed regulations on autobahns from the sixteen States and reported the following comparing the years and br br Except at construction sites the general speed limits where they apply are usually between km h mph and km h mph construction sites usually have a speed limit of km h mph but the limit may be as low as km h mph In rare cases sections may have limits of km h mph or on one ramp km h mph Certain stretches have lower speed limits during wet weather Some areas have a speed limit of km h mph in order to reduce noise pollution during overnight hours usually pm am or because of increased traffic during daytime am pm br br Some limits were imposed to reduce pollution and noise Limits can also be temporarily put into place through dynamic traffic guidance systems that display the corresponding message More than half of the total length of the German autobahn network has no speed limit about one third has a permanent limit and the remaining parts have a temporary or conditional limit br Some cars with very powerful engines can reach speeds of well over km h mph Major German car manufacturers except Porsche follow a gentlemen s agreement by electronically limiting the top speeds of their cars with the exception of some top of the range models or engines to km h mph These limiters can be deactivated so speeds up to km h mph might arise on the German autobahn but due to other traffic such speeds are generally not attainable except during certain times like between p m and a m or on Sundays when truck drivers have to rest by law Furthermore there are certain autobahn sections which are known for having light traffic making such speeds attainable during most days especially some of those located in Eastern Germany Most unlimited sections of the autobahn are located outside densely populated areas br Vehicles with a top speed less than km h mph such as quads low end microcars and agricultural construction equipment are not allowed to use the autobahn nor are motorcycles and scooters with low engine capacity regardless of top speed mainly applicable to mopeds which are typically limited to kilometres per hour mph or kilometres per hour mph anyway To comply with this limit heavy duty trucks in Germany e g mobile cranes tank transporters etc often have a maximum design speed of km h mph usually denoted by a round black on white sign with on it along with flashing orange beacons to warn approaching cars that they are travelling slowly There is no general minimum speed but drivers are not allowed to drive at an unnecessarily low speed as this would lead to significant traffic disturbance and an increased collision risk br br br Public debate br German national speed limits have a historical association with war time restrictions and deprivations the Nazi era and the Soviet era in East Germany After the Nazi dictatorship German society was happy to overcome the traumas of war by freeing itself from most government restrictions prohibitions and regulations Free driving for free citizens freie Fahrt f r freie B rger a slogan promoted by the German Auto Club since the s is a popular slogan among those opposing autobahn speed restrictions Tarek Al Wazir head of the Green Party in Hesse and currently the Hessian Transport Minister has stated that the speed limit in Germany has a similar status as the right to bear arms in the American debate At some point a speed limit will become reality here and soon we will not be able to remember the time before It s like the smoking ban in restaurants br br br Early history br The Weimar Republic had no federally required speed limits The first crossroads free road for motorized vehicles only now A between Bonn and Cologne had a km h mph limit when it opened in In October the Nazis instituted the first national maximum speed limit throttling speeds to km h mph in order to conserve gasoline for the war effort After the war the four Allied occupation zones established their own speed limits until the divided East German and West German republics were constituted in initially the Nazi speed limits were restored in both East and West Germany br br br After the World Wars br In December the West German legislature voted to abolish all national speed limits reverting to State level decisions National limits were reestablished incrementally The km h mph urban limit was enacted in effective in The km h mph limit on rural roads except autobahns became effective in br br br Oil crisis of the s br Just prior to the oil crisis Germany Switzerland and Austria all had no general speed restriction on autobahns During the crisis like other nations Germany imposed temporary speed restrictions for example km h mph on autobahns effective November Automakers projected a plunge in sales which they attributed in part to the lowered speed limits The km h limit championed by Transportation Minister Lauritz Lauritzen lasted days Adjacent nations with unlimited speed autobahns Austria and Switzerland imposed permanent km h mph limits after the crisis br However after the crisis eased in the upper house of the German parliament which was controlled by conservative parties successfully resisted the imposition of a permanent mandatory limit supported by Chancellor Brandt The upper house insisted on a km h mph recommended limit until a thorough study of the effects of a mandatory limit could be conducted Accordingly the Federal Highway Research Institute conducted a multiple year experiment switching between mandatory and recommended limits on two test stretches of autobahn In the final report issued in the Institute stated the mandatory speed limit could reduce the autobahn death toll but there would be economic impacts so a political decision had to be made due to the trade offs involved At that time the federal government declined to impose a mandatory limit The fatality rate trend on the German autobahn mirrored those of other nations motorways that imposed a general speed limit br br br Environmental concerns of the s br In the mid s acid rain and sudden forest destruction renewed debate on whether or not a general speed limit should be imposed on autobahns A car s fuel consumption increases with high speed and fuel conservation is a key factor in reducing air pollution Environmentalists argued that enforcing limits of km h mph limit on autobahns and km h mph on other rural roads would save lives as well as the forest reducing the annual death toll by lives on autobahns and lives on rural roads the German motor vehicle death toll was about at the time The federal government sponsored a large scale experiment with a km h mph speed limit in order to measure the impact of reduced speeds on emissions and compliance Afterward again the federal government declined to impose a mandatory limit deciding the modest measured emission reduction would have no meaningful effect on forest loss By all restrictions on test sections had been removed even in Hesse where the state government was controlled by a red green coalition br br br German reunification br Prior to German reunification in eastern German states focused on restrictive traffic regulation such as a km h mph autobahn speed limit and of km h mph on other rural roads Within two years after the opening availability of high powered vehicles and a increase in motorized traffic led to a doubling of annual traffic deaths despite interim arrangements which involved the continuation of the speed limit of km h mph on autobahns and of km h mph outside cities An extensive program of the four Es enforcement education engineering and emergency response brought the number of traffic deaths back to pre unification levels after a decade of effort while traffic regulations were conformed to western standards e g km h mph freeway advisory limit km h mph on other rural roads and percent BAC br br br Since reunification br In the Social Democratic Green Party coalition controlling the State of Hesse experimented with a km h mph limit on autobahns and km h mph on other rural roads These limits were attempts to reduce ozone pollution br During his term of office to as Chancellor of Germany Gerhard Schr der opposed an autobahn speed limit famously referring to Germany as an Autofahrernation a nation of drivers br In October at a party congress held by the Social Democratic Party of Germany delegates narrowly approved a proposal to introduce a blanket speed limit of km h mph on all German autobahns While this initiative is primarily a part of the SPD s general strategic outline for the future and according to practices not necessarily meant to affect immediate government policy the proposal had stirred up a debate once again Germany s chancellor since Angela Merkel and leading cabinet members expressed outspoken disapproval of such a measure br In the Social Democratic Green Party coalition controlling Germany s smallest state the paired City State of Bremen and Bremerhaven imposed a kilometre per hour mph limit on its last kilometres mi of speed unlimited autobahn in hopes of leading other States to do likewise br In the first ever Green minister president of any German state Winfried Kretschmann of Baden W rttemberg initially argued for a similar state level kilometres per hour mph limit However Baden W rttemberg is an important location for the German motor industry including the headquarters of Daimler AG and Porsche the ruling coalition ultimately decided against a state level limit on its kilometres mi of speed unlimited roads arguing for nationwide speed limit instead br In the conservative liberal ruling coalition of Saxony confirmed its rejection of a general speed limit on autobahns instead advocating dynamic traffic controls where appropriate Between and in the State of Hesse transportation ministers Dieter Posch and his successor Florian Rentsch both members of the Free Democratic Party removed or raised speed limits on several sections of autobahn following regular year reviews of speed limit effectiveness some sections just prior to the installation of Tarek Al Wazir Green Party as Transportation Minister in January as part of an uneasy CDU green coalition government In the left green coalition government of Thuringia declared that a general autobahn limit was a federal matter Thuringia would not unilaterally impose a general statewide limit although the Thuringian environmental minister had recommended a kilometres per hour mph limit br In late Winfried Hermann Baden W rttemberg s Green minister of transportation promised to impose a trial speed limit of kilometres per hour mph on about of the state s autobahns beginning in May However the ruling Green Social Democratic coalition lost its majority in the March elections while Mr Hermann retained his post in the new Green Christian Democratic government he put aside preparations for a speed limit due to opposition from his new coalition partners br In the Green Party introduced a motion to introduce a hard km h speed limit on the autobahn but it was defeated in the Bundestag A second attempt to reopen debate on the issue was made by the Left Party in rejected by the majority of the opposition CDU CSU and Alternative for Germany AfD and the governing Free Democratic Party FDP However Alliance The Greens and the SPD were obliged by their traffic light coalition with the FDP to reject the proposal br br br Safety br In autobahns carried of motorized road traffic while accounting for of Germany s traffic deaths The autobahn fatality rate of deaths per billion travel kilometres compared favorably with the rate on urban streets and rate on rural roads However these types of roads are not comparable according to German traffic researcher Bernhard Schlag You don t have some of the problems that are accident prone there at all No cyclists no pedestrians no crossing traffic hardly any direct oncoming traffic In that sense it s not surprising that autobahns are relatively safe roads compared to other road types br According to official statistics from unlimited highways in Germany claimed about of fatalities on highways However autobahns without speed limits also account for of the entire autobahn network which puts the high proportion of collision fatalities on stretches without speed limits into perspective The often resulting thinking that speed limits would not make roads significantly safer however is a fallacy since it is precisely those roads that have a high volume of traffic and thus a high risk of collisions that are given speed limits br According to Schlag unsafe and older drivers in particular would avoid the autobahn because they perceive the high speed differentials and very fast drivers as scary and instead congregate on rural roads where the risk of collisions is higher anyway br In contrast to other road types where the number of collisions has continuously decreased the number of collisions on autobahns has remained relatively stable or even increased for several years since br According to a report by the Federal Statistical Office fast driving is the main cause of collisions on autobahns br According to the edition of the European Road Safety Observatory s Traffic Safety Basic Facts report an above average number of accidents end in fatalities on a kilometer stretch of highway in Germany compared to other EU countries br Although Germany has a very low total traffic related death rate if only the mortality rate on highways is considered Germany is in the rear midfield in a Europe wide comparison of the number of traffic fatalities per thousand kilometers driven on highways in br An evaluation by the Deutscher Verkehrssicherheitsrat shows that in statistically fewer people died on autobahns with a speed limit per kilometer than on autobahns without A similar trend could be observed in the number of serious injuries br Between and overall German road fatalities decreased by almost from to over the same time period autobahn deaths halved from to deaths Statistics for show total German traffic deaths had declined to the lowest count ever recorded on autobahns a representative of the Federal Statistical Office attributed the general decline to harsh winter weather that delayed the start of the motorcycle riding season In there was a total of road fatalities while autobahn deaths dropped to br br per travel kilometres br In the leading cause of autobahn accidents was excessive speed for conditions so called speed related crashes claimed the lives of people which represents almost half of autobahn fatalities that year However excessive speed does not mean that a speed limit has been exceeded but that police determined at least one party travelled too fast for existing road or weather conditions On autobahns people died per injury crashes a lower rate than the deaths per injury accidents on conventional rural roads which in turn is five times higher than the risk on urban roads speeds are higher on rural roads and autobahns than urban roads increasing the severity potential of a crash br br br Safety international comparison br A few countries publish the safety record of their motorways the Federal Highway Research Institute provided IRTAD statistics for the year br br For example a person yearly traversing kilometres mi on regular roads and kilometres mi on motorways has an approximately in chance of dying in a car accident on a German road in any particular year in on an autobahn compared to in in Czech Republic in in Denmark or in in the United States br However there are many differences between countries in their geography economy traffic growth highway system size degree of urbanization and motorization and so on br The European Union publishes statistics reported by its members br br br Travel speeds br The federal government does not regularly measure or estimate travel speeds One study reported in a transportation engineering journal offered historical perspective on the increase in travel speeds over a decade br br Source Kellermann G Geschwindigkeitsverhalten im Autobahnnetz Stra e Autobahn Issue br The Federal Environmental Office reported that on a free flowing section in the recorded average speed was km h mph with of drivers exceeding the recommended speed br In speeds were recorded using automated detection loops in the State of Brandenburg at two points on a six lane section of A near Niemegk with a km h mph advisory speed limit and on a four lane section of A bypassing Berlin near Gro Kreutz with a km h mph mandatory limit The results were br br At peak times on the free flowing section of A over of road users exceeded the recommended km h mph maximum speed more than of motorists exceeded km h mph and more than exceeded km h mph in other words the so called th percentile speed was in excess of km h br br br Toll roads br On January a new system came into effect for mandatory tolls Mautpflicht on heavy trucks those weighing more than t while using the German autobahn system LKW Maut The German government contracted with a private company Toll Collect GmbH to operate the toll collection system which has involved the use of vehicle mounted transponders and roadway mounted sensors installed throughout Germany The toll is calculated depending on the toll route as well as based on the pollution class of the vehicle its weight and the number of axles on the vehicles Certain vehicles such as emergency vehicles and buses are exempt from the toll An average user is charged per kilometre or about per mile Toll Collect br br br Traffic laws and enforcement br Driving in Germany is regulated by the Stra enverkehrs Ordnung road traffic regulations abbreviated StVO Enforcement on the federal Autobahnen is handled by each state s highway patrol Autobahnpolizei often using unmarked police cars and motorcycles and usually equipped with video cameras thus allowing easier enforcement of laws such as tailgating br br br Notable laws br The right lane should be used when it is free Rechtsfahrgebot and the left lane is generally intended only for overtaking unless traffic is too dense to justify driving only on the right lane It is legal to give a short horn or light signal flashing headlights or Lichthupe in order to indicate the intention of overtaking but a safe distance to the vehicle in front must be maintained otherwise this might be regarded as an act of coercion br Trucks only drive on the right lane this is common throughout Europe wherever two travel lanes in a direction are present They are well known for doing the Elephant Race Elefantenrennen ele fantn n n which has little to do with actual elephants This occurs when one truck tries to overtake another with a minimum speed difference However on sections with three or more travel lanes in a direction trucks are prohibited from using the far left lane In some places which are indicated by signs truck drivers are not allowed to overtake at all br Penalties for tailgating were increased in May to a maximum of now and three months license suspension drivers must keep a distance in metres that is equal to half their speed For example a driver going km h on the autobahn must keep a distance of at least metres feet The penalty increase followed uproar after an infamous fatal crash on Autobahn in In a traffic jam drivers must form a rescue lane Rettungsgasse t s as to allow emergency services to reach the scene of an accident This emergency corridor is to be created on the dividing line between the two leftmost lanes following the guiding principle of if on the left drive left else drive right vehicles may cross into another lane if need be br It is unlawful to stop for any reason on the autobahn except for emergencies and when unavoidable like traffic jams or being involved in an accident This includes stopping on emergency lanes Running out of fuel is considered an avoidable occurrence as by law there are petrol stations directly on the autobahn approximately every km mi Drivers may face fines and up to six months suspension should it come to a stop that was deemed unnecessary by the police In some cases if there is a direct danger to life and limb or property e g cars and highway infrastructure it may also be considered a crime and the driver could receive a prison sentence up to years br Overtaking on the right undertaking is strictly forbidden except when stuck in traffic jams Up to a speed of km h mph if the left lane is crowded or driving slowly it is permitted to pass cars on the right side if the speed difference is not greater than km h mph or the vehicle on the left lane is stationary This is not referred to as overtaking but driving past Even if the car overtaken is illegally occupying the left hand lane it is not an acceptable excuse in such cases the police will routinely stop and fine both drivers However exceptions can and have sometimes been made br br br In popular culture br br br Film and television br Alarm f r Cobra Die Autobahnpolizei Alarm for Cobra The Autobahn Police a famous German TV series focusing on the work
