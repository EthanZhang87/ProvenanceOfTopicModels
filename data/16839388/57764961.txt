superheroine but also a very strong protective instinct when it comes to her children and an innate desire to save others br Regarding the choice to make Helen the star of Incredibles Bird insisted that it was unrelated with the MeToo movement and was instead a choice that came naturally with how the writers wanted to progress the story br br br Animation br The Incredibles was the first Pixar film with an all human cast which posed significant challenges for the technical crew The muscular movements of Helen was a particularly difficult subject as the character needs to be able to stretch bend and fold into various shapes Character supervisor Bill Wise stated that Helen s was likely the most complex rig Pixar had ever done to that point A specific program was written so that she could twist and turn as needed The original animation system had become obsolete by Incredibles and as a result all characters including Helen were rebuilt using a new tool box Her expanded role in the sequel meant additional work but also new opportunities for the animators The tentacle rigs for Hank in Finding Dory were used as inspiration in order for Helen to stretch much beyond what she did in the first film br br br Powers and abilities br Elastigirl s primary superpower is elasticity which allows her to stretch various parts of her body to many different sizes This ability can extend to shapeshifting as she can use elasticity to change her form and density as when she morphed into a boat and a parachute She can achieve superhuman levels of strength durability and agility using her elasticity powers Her only weakness is extremely cold air Upon being captured by Evelyn in Incredibles she is put in a refrigerated room and warned that she will break if she tries to stretch br In

artist br In order to determine the Parr family s superpowers Bird drew inspiration from the roles of typical nuclear family members Helen s powers mirror society s expectations of a mother who according to Bird is always juggling a million things and pulled in a million directions br br br Appearances br In The Incredibles Helen is seen as Elastigirl in the time before superheroes are banned She marries Bob Parr Mr Incredible and starts a family Violet Dash and Jack Jack She gives up her vigilante job to become a housewife while her husband works When Bob starts to act sneakily
