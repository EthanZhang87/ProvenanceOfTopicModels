This was Wickes final acting performance as she died a year before its release at age Jane Withers provided Laverne s remaining dialogue for the film br David Ogden Stiers as the Archdeacon br br br Production br br br Development br The idea to adapt The Hunchback of Notre Dame came from development executive David Stainton in who was inspired to turn Victor Hugo s novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame into an animated feature film after reading the Classics Illustrated comic book adaptation Stainton then proposed the idea to then studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg After the release of Beauty and the Beast Gary Trousdale had taken a sabbatical break from directing instead spending several months developing storyboards for The Lion King Following this Trousdale and his directing and writing partner Kirk Wise subsequently developed an animated feature based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice titled A Song of the Sea adapting it to make the central character a humpback whale and setting it in the open ocean While they were working on the project they were summoned to meet with Katzenberg During that time explained Trousdale while we working on it we got a call from Jeffrey He said Guys drop everything you re working on Hunchback now According to Wise they believed that it had a great deal of potential great memorable characters a really terrific setting the potential for fantastic visuals and a lot of emotion br Production on The Hunchback of Notre Dame began in the summer of In October directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise art director David Goetz Roy Conli Ed Ghertner Will Finn Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz took a trip to Paris for ten days three days were devoted to exploring the Notre Dame cathedral where the team took photographs and sketched areas of the religious site included passageways stairwells towers and a hidden room The team also located books that documented the cathedral s restricted areas including one about Victor Hugo s watercolor paintings Goetz stated It turned out that his paintings were very similar in tone to what we were coming with for our early visual development work We were a little tentative because it seemed like an un Disney thing Then we went to Paris and saw the Hugo paintings and the work of other illustrators of the time We felt they were so similar that we were really on a track that was appropriate We thought heck let s go with it The team also visited the Palace of Justice and an original location of the Court of Miracles br br br Writing br br Tab Murphy was brought on board to write the screenplay and it was decided early on that Quasimodo would be the center of the story as he was in preceding live action film adaptations In the early drafts Quasimodo served as a Cyrano between Phoebus and Esmeralda but it was discarded to focus more on Quasimodo Meanwhile a love story between Quasimodo and Esmeralda was also conceived according to Murphy but we decided to make Phoebus more heroic and central to the story Out of that decision grew the idea of some sort of a triangle between Quasimodo Esmeralda and Phoebus Some of the novel s key characters were jettisoned entirely The gargoyles of Notre Dame were added to the story by Trousdale and Wise Their portrayal as comedic friends and confidantes of Quasimodo was inspired by a portion of the novel which reads The other statues the ones of monsters and demons felt no hatred for Quasimodo The saints were his friends and blessed him the monsters were his friends and protected him Thus he would pour out his heart at length to them br One of the first changes made to accommodate Disney s request was to turn the villainous Claude Frollo into a judge rather than an archdeacon thus avoiding religious sensibilities in the finished film As we were exploring the characters especially Frollo we certainly found a lot of historical parallels to the type of mania he had the Confederate South Nazi Germany take your pick explained Wise Those things influenced our thinking Producer Don Hahn evaluated that one inspiration for Frollo was found in Ralph Fiennes s performance as Amon Goeth in Schindler s List who had murdered Jews yet lusted after his Jewish maid br For the opening sequence Disney story veteran Burny Mattinson constructed an effective sequence that covered much exposition although Katzenberg felt something was missing Following Stephen Schwartz s suggestion to musicalize the sequence French animators Paul and Ga tan Brizzi storyboarded the sequence to Menken and Schwartz s music resulting in The Bells of Notre Dame Lyricist Stephen Schwartz also worked closely with the writing team even suggesting that the audience should be left wondering what the outcome of what Phoebus would do before he extinguishes the torch in water in retaliation against Frollo Another was the film s conclusion While Frollo s death was made more explicit Quasimodo and Esmeralda were both spared their fates and given a happy ending This revised ending was based in part on Victor Hugo s own libretto to a Hunchback opera in which he had permitted Captain Phoebus to save Esmeralda from her execution br br br Casting br In late pop singer Cyndi Lauper was the first actor cast during the film s initial stages She had been hired one week after reading for a part with the directors who felt her performance was hilarious and sweet Thinking she had been cast as Esmeralda Lauper was startled to learn she was to voice a gargoyle named Quinn The development team had come up with the names of Chaney Laughton and Quinn named after the actors who portrayed Quasimodo in preceding Hunchback film adaptations However Disney s legal department objected to the proposed names of the gargoyles fearing that the estates of Lon Chaney Charles Laughton or Anthony Quinn who was still alive at the time would file a lawsuit over the unauthorized use of their names so the idea was dropped Trousdale and Wise then suggested naming the characters Lon Charles and Anthony which would have resulted in the same legal concern Instead they would name the first two gargoyles after Victor Hugo and the third gargoyle after Andrews Sisters singer LaVerne Andrews as suggested by Wise br Now cast as Laverne Lauper was deemed too youthful for a friend who would provide wise counsel to Quasimodo At the same time Sam McMurray best known for his work on The Tracey Ullman Show was hired for Hugo Meanwhile Charles Kimbrough was cast as Victor who was initially unimpressed at an animated adaptation of Hunchback but later became rather impressed at the level of research that went into the film and how the story ideas transitioned from the novel to the screen After several recording sessions and test screenings Lauper and McMurray were called by the directors who released them from their roles At one point Jeffrey Katzenberg had considered Arsenio Hall David Letterman and Jay Leno to voice the gargoyles but he eventually cast Jason Alexander due to his previous role in The Return of Jafar After a suggestion by supervising animator Will Finn Laverne was then re envisioned into a wiser mature character with Mary Wickes cast in the role Following Wickes death in October Jane Withers was hired to voice her six remaining lines br br Katzenberg had also wanted Meat Loaf for the role of Quasimodo but he passed on the role after Disney could not come to an agreement with his record company Mandy Patinkin was also approached for the title role but his style of portraying Quasimodo collided with the producers demands and Patinkin stated I was just there at the audition and I said I can t do this Tom Hulce was cast as Quasimodo following his first audition for the role and according to the actor he noticed during the audition that the Disney executives producers and directors were staring at the floor It looked like everyone was at a memorial service until he noticed the floor was lined with storyboard sketches According to Wise the filmmakers like to audition the voices with our eyes closed so we see the character s face Quasimodo was originally portrayed as older and with more of a speech impediment during the early rehearsals but Hulce commented that we experimented endlessly At one point I was ready to call in and say Things just aren t happening Ultimately the directors desired to portray Quasimodo with a younger voice different from the previous portrayals since Victor Hugo described Quasimodo as Additionally Hulce was permitted to do his own singing after performing a demo recording of Out There br Due to her deeper voice than actresses who had previously played Disney heroines Demi Moore was cast as Esmeralda and met with Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz on singing After several singing demos the actress said You d better get someone else according to Schwartz New York City cabaret singer Heidi Mollenhauer was selected to provide the singing voice For the role of Phoebus co director Kirk Wise explained that As we re designing the characters we form a short list of names to help us find the personality of the character Subsequently the filmmakers modeled his portrayal on the personalities of Errol Flynn and John Wayne and One of the names on the top of the list all the time was Kevin Kline Moore and Kline were the only actors to have the role directly offered to them instead of auditioning British actor Tony Jay who declared his role as Frollo as his bid for immortality was cast after the directors had worked with him in Beauty and the Beast Anthony Hopkins was originally considered for the role but he turned down the offer After watching his portrayal as Uncle Ernie in the musical The Who s Tommy Broadway actor Paul Kandel was selected to voice Clopin br br br Animation br Alongside Pocahontas storyboard work on The Hunchback of the Notre Dame was among the first to be produced for an animated film on the new Disney Feature Animation building adjacent to the main Disney lot in Burbank which was dedicated in However most animators were occupied with The Lion King and Pocahontas at the time and as a result more animators were hired from Canada and United Kingdom to join the production team for the film As the development phase furthered along most of the entire animation team moved out into a large warehouse facility on Airway in Glendale California As the Disney story artists layout crew and animators moved in their new quarters they decided to name the building Sanctuary br Since Who Framed Roger Rabbit other animators hired by Disney Feature Animation were from Germany France Ireland and additional ones from Canada were involved in providing animation duties at the recently opened satellite studio Walt Disney Animation Paris Supervised by coproducer Roy Conli percent of the film was done there To coordinate with the Burbank studio the Brizzis traveled there with storyboards and conferred with the directors animators and layout team Back in Paris they discuss their animation dailies via video conferences provided by Compression Lab Industries CLI video system Meanwhile at the Feature Animation Florida studio which had been working on Mulan their first in house production at least seven animators penned about four minutes of screen time which mostly involved Frollo and Quasimodo The studio had also provided additional layout cleanup and special effects animation br During early development Trousdale and Wise realized they needed crowds of people but for this time they wanted them to move as opposed to being traditionally drawn as painted backdrops Recalling the wildebeest stampede in The Lion King they landed on the idea of using computer animation to generate them For that reason the CGI department headed by Kiran Joshi created the software Crowd to achieve large scale crowd scenes particularly for the Feast of Fools sequence and the film s climax The software was used to create six types of characters males and females either average in weight fat or thin which were programmed and assigned specific movements ranging from jumping and clapping Digital technology also provided a visual sweep that freed Quasimodo to scamper around the cathedral and soar around the plaza to rescue Esmeralda br br br Editing br Although the film did deviate from the source material s darker elements to receive a G rating from the Motion Picture Association of America MPAA it initially received a PG rating after being submitted to the rating board The reasons were a scene in which Frollo sniffs Esmeralda s hair and Frollo saying the word sin in the song Hellfire Hahn suggested toning down the sniffing sound effect and making the word less obvious by turning up the background sound effects In turn this resulted in the film receiving a G rating after its resubmission br br br Music br br Having worked on Pocahontas for a year Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz were offered multiple film projects to collaborate on when they chose to work on The Hunchback of Notre Dame According to Schwartz they had both been attracted to underlying themes of social outcast and Quasimodo s struggle to break free of the psychological abuse of Frollo br The film has many musical motifs that carry throughout the film weaving their way in and out of various pieces of music and having varying timbres depending on the action in the story at that point The film s soundtrack includes a musical score composed by Menken and songs written by him and Stephen Schwartz The film s songs include The Bells of Notre Dame for Clopin Frollo and the Archdeacon Out There for Quasimodo and Frollo Topsy Turvy for Clopin God Help the Outcasts for Esmeralda Heaven s Light for Quasimodo Hellfire for the Archdeacon and Frollo A Guy Like You for the gargoyles and The Court of Miracles for Clopin and the other Roma br Three songs written for the film were discarded for the storyboarding process Trousdale and Wise were not certain what musical number could be placed for the third act though Menken and Schwartz conceived two love songs In a Place of Miracles and As Long as There s a Moon between Esmeralda and Phoebus in the film However Trousdale and Wise felt the song took too much focus off of Quasimodo and ultimately decided to have Clopin sing about sentencing Phoebus and Quasimodo to death for finding their Roma sanctuary Menken and Schwartz had also written Someday originally for the film but the directors suggested that a religious song be sung in the cathedral The song was instead featured in the end credits R B group All One recorded the song for the end credits of the North American English release and by the British R B girl group Eternal in the British English version Luis Miguel recorded the version for the Latin American Spanish version which became a major hit br br br Themes and interpretations br The Hunchback of Notre Dame s thematic concerns include infanticide lust damnation and sin as well as the belief in a loving forgiving God According to Mark Pinsky it is also a condemnation of abortion euthanasia and racism and a moral resistance to genocide br The Hunchback of Notre Dame was the first and currently only Disney animated feature to have a major focus on traditional religious faith in this case pre Reformation Catholicism In fact the words God Lord and Hell are uttered more times in this film than in any other produced by Disney The book The Gospel According to Disney explains that it is the church that interposes or attempts to interpose itself between the villain and his evil intentions During production the studio executives expressed concerns about various aspects of the film especially those relating to the religious content in the story for their failure to defend the poor and the powerless and concerns that the story was too controversial Another book Deconstructing Disney notes that the studio approached the name of God with an almost Hebraic zeal that it should never be stated yet here it is invoked in a manner both pious and puritan Many of the songs were adapted from genuine Latin prayers and chants such as Hellfire which uses the Tridentine form of the Confiteor as a counterpoint melody The Gospel According to Disney includes a quote that says religion appears as an impotent irrelevant caricature and Disney refuses to admit a serious role for religion At one point the archdeacon says to Esmeralda You can t right all the wrongs of this world by yourself perhaps there is someone in here who can referring either to God or Mary This questions the power religious people actually have in making the world a moral and happy place according to Pinsky br The Gospel According to Disney explains that while Frollo s stated goal is to purge the world of vice and sin according to the opening song he saw corruption everywhere except within Because killing the woman on the steps has put Frollo s soul in mortal danger he has to take the child and look after him as penance Even then he absolves himself of agency in the murder by claiming God works in mysterious ways and ponders whether the child may be of use to him one day During the song God Help the Outcasts Esmeralda wonders if Were you once an outcast too while looking at a statue of Mary with the infant Jesus referencing the Flight into Egypt br According to the film s production notes Quasimodo is symbolically viewed as being an angel in a devil s body He is trapped between heaven above and the gritty streets of urban Paris viewed as Hell The version of the alphabet Quasimodo recites in a daily ritual reflects Frollo s view of the world full of abominations and blasphemy He is also constantly called deformed ugly a monster and an outcast who would be hated if he ever left the confines of the church br br br Release br In the film was scheduled for a Christmas release though the film was reportedly delayed following the departure of Katzenberg from The Walt Disney Company By January it was later pushed back to a summer release The film premiered on June at the Louisiana

touching message that emerges from the comedy and song In his review for the Chicago Tribune Gene Siskel awarded the film out of a possible stars describing the film as a surprisingly emotional simplified version of the Victor Hugo novel with effective songs and yes tasteful bits of humor Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film an A labeling it as the best of Disney s serious animated features in the multiplex era an emotionally rounded fairy tale that balances darkness and sentimentality pathos and triumph with uncanny grace br Richard Corliss of Time magazine praised the film stating that the result is a grand cartoon cathedral teeming with gargoyles and treachery hopeless love and tortured lust and also said Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz have written the largest most imposing score yet for an animated film Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph gave it a positive review saying it is thrillingly dramatic and for long stretches you forget you are watching a cartoon at all A dazzling treat Variety also gave the film a positive review stating that there is much to admire in Hunchback not least the risk of doing such a downer of a story at all and also saying the new film should further secure Disney s dominance in animation and connoisseurs of the genre old and young will have plenty to savor Janet Maslin wrote in her The New York Times review In a film that bears conspicuous eager resemblances to other recent Disney hits the filmmakers Herculean work is overshadowed by a Sisyphean problem There s just no way to delight children with a feel good version of this story br Upon opening in France in March reception from French critics towards Hunchback was largely positive French critics and audiences found resonance in the film which recounted a real life incident from August when French police raided a Parisian church and seized over immigrants seeking refuge from deportation under France s strict expulsion laws It is difficult not to think of the undocumented immigrants of St Bernard when Frollo tries to sweep out the rabble wrote one reviewer br br br Audience response br Arnaud Later a leading scholar on Hugo accused Disney of simplifying editing and censoring the novel in numerous aspects including the personalities of the characters In his review he later wrote that the animators don t have enough confidence in their own emotional feeling and that the film falls back on clich s Descendants of Hugo bashed Disney in an open letter to the Lib ration newspaper for their ancestor receiving no mention on the advertisement posters and describing the film as a vulgar commercialization by unscrupulous salesmen br Some audiences expressed concerns about whether the film was appropriate for children Jason Alexander said that while Disney would have us believe this movie s like the Ringling Bros for children of all ages he would not take his then four year old child to view the film However some newspaper publications reported child audiences being unaffected by the mature content and praising the film Some audiences criticized the film for having homosexual undertones noticeably with the song Out There being the name of a gay pressure group and as a call to come out of the closet br In June the Southern Baptist Convention voted overwhelmingly to urge its sixteen million members to boycott Disney films theme parks and merchandise saying the company disparages Christian values The cause of the protests unrelated to the film stemmed from the company s domestic partnership policy and gay and lesbian theme days at Walt Disney World Trousdale also claimed that Southern Baptists were outraged over the casting of Demi Moore as Esmeralda as she had just come off of the film Striptease in which she played an exotic dancer Disney officials would not comment on the motivation for the religious content displayed in the film beyond comments on the subject included in the film s press kit with Disney vice president John Dreyer commenting The film speaks for itself Nevertheless there was praise from religious organizations for its portrayal of religion in the film Louis P Sheldon a Presbyterian pastor and chairman of the Anaheim based Traditional Values Coalition said two months before its premiere I am thrilled at what I hear about Hunchback that Disney is seeking to honour Christianity and its role in Western civilization I only pray that it will accomplish much good in the minds and hearts of its viewers br Following protests in the United States thousands of British parents banned their kids from seeing The Hunchback of Notre Dame In reaction to the controversy Walt Disney Feature Animation president Peter Schneider said The only controversy I ve heard about the movie is certain people s opinion that Well it s OK for me but it might disturb somebody else Schneider also stated in his defense that the film was test screened all over the country and I ve heard nobody parents or children complain about any of the issues I think for example the issue of disabilities is treated with great respect and Quasimodo is really the underdog who becomes the hero I don t think there s anything better for anybody s psychological feelings than to become the hero of a movie The only thing we ve been asked to be careful about is the word hunchback which we have to use in the title br
