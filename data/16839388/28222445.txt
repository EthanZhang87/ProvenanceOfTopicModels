Sweden to the south by Latvia and to the east by Lake Peipus and Russia The territory of Estonia consists of the mainland the larger islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa and over other islands and islets on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea covering a total area of square kilometres sq mi Tallinn the capital city and Tartu are the two largest urban areas of the country The Estonian language is the indigenous and official language of Estonia It is the first language of the majority of the country s population of million as well as the world s second most spoken Finnic language br The land of present day Estonia has been inhabited by humans since at least BCE The medieval indigenous population of Estonia was one of the last pagan civilisations in Europe to adopt Christianity following the Papal sanctioned Northern Crusades in the th century After centuries of successive rule by the Teutonic Order Denmark Sweden and the Russian Empire a distinct Estonian national identity began to emerge in the mid th century This culminated in the February Estonian Declaration of Independence from the then warring Russian and German empires Democratic throughout most of the interwar period Estonia declared neutrality at the outbreak of World War II however the country was repeatedly contested invaded and occupied first by the Soviet Union in then by Nazi Germany in and was ultimately reoccupied in by and annexed into the USSR as an administrative subunit Estonian SSR Throughout the Soviet occupation Estonia s de jure state continuity was preserved by diplomatic representatives and the government in exile Following the bloodless Estonian Singing Revolution against the Soviet rule the nation s full independence was restored on August br Estonia is a developed country with a high income advanced economy ranking st out of in the Human Development Index The sovereign state of Estonia is a democratic unitary parliamentary republic administratively subdivided into maakond counties With a population of just around million it is one of the least populous members of the European Union the Eurozone the OECD the Schengen Area and NATO Estonia has consistently ranked highly in international rankings for quality of life education press freedom digitalisation of public services and the prevalence of technology companies br br br Name br br The name Estonia Estonian Eesti e s ti has been connected to Aesti a people first mentioned by Ancient Roman historian Tacitus around CE Some modern historians believe he was referring to Balts while others have proposed that the name then applied to the whole eastern Baltic Sea region Scandinavian sagas and Viking runestones referring to Eistland are the earliest known sources that definitely use the name in its modern geographic meaning From Old Norse the toponym spread to other Germanic vernaculars and reached literary Latin by the end of th century br br br History br br br Prehistory and Viking Age br br Human settlement in Estonia became possible years ago when the ice from the last glacial era melted The oldest known settlement in Estonia is the Pulli settlement on the banks of P rnu river in southwest Estonia According to radiocarbon dating it was settled around years ago br The earliest human habitation during the Mesolithic period is connected to the Kunda culture At that time the country was covered with forests and people lived in semi nomadic communities near bodies of water Subsistence activities consisted of hunting gathering and fishing Around BCE ceramics appear of the neolithic period known as Narva culture Starting from around BC the Corded Ware culture appeared this included new activities like primitive agriculture and animal husbandry br The Bronze Age started around BCE and saw the establishment of the first hill fort settlements A transition from hunter fisher subsistence to single farm based settlement started around BC and was complete by the beginning of the Iron Age around BC The large amount of bronze objects indicate the existence of active communication with Scandinavian and Germanic tribes br The middle Iron Age produced threats appearing from different directions Several Scandinavian sagas referred to major confrontations with Estonians notably when in the early th century Estonian Vikings defeated and killed Ingvar Harra the King of Swedes Similar threats appeared to the east where East Slavic principalities were expanding westward Around the troops of Kievan Rus led by Yaroslav the Wise defeated Estonians and established a fort in modern day Tartu This foothold may have lasted until ca when an Estonian tribe the Sosols destroyed it Around the th century the Scandinavian Viking era around the Baltic Sea was succeeded by the Baltic Viking era with seaborne raids by Curonians and by Estonians from the island of Saaremaa known as Oeselians In Estonians Oeselians Curonians or and Karelians sacked Sigtuna which was a major city of Sweden at the time br Estonia could be divided into two main cultural areas The coastal areas of north and west Estonia had close overseas contacts with Scandinavia and Finland while inland south Estonia had more contacts with Balts and Pskov The landscape of Ancient Estonia featured numerous hillforts Prehistoric or medieval harbour sites have been found on the coast of Saaremaa Estonia also has a number of graves from the Viking Age both individual and collective with weapons and jewellery including types found commonly throughout Northern Europe and Scandinavia br In the early centuries AD political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia Two larger subdivisions appeared the parish Estonian kihelkond and the county Estonian maakond which consisted of multiple parishes A parish was led by elders and centered on a hill fort in some rare cases a parish had multiple forts By the th century Estonia comprised eight major counties Harjumaa J rvamaa L nemaa Revala Saaremaa Sakala Ugandi and Virumaa and six minor single parish counties Alempois Jogentagana M hu Nurmekund Soopoolitse and Vaiga Counties were independent entities and engaged only in a loose cooperation against foreign threats br Little is known of medieval Estonians spiritual and religious practices before Christianization The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia mentions Tharapita as the superior deity of the then inhabitants of Saaremaa Oeselians There is some historical evidence about sacred groves especially groves of oak trees having served as places of pagan worship br br br Crusades and the Catholic Era br br In Pope Innocent III declared a crusade to defend the Christians of Livonia Fighting reached Estonia in when Danish King Valdemar II unsuccessfully invaded Saaremaa The German Livonian Brothers of the Sword who had previously subjugated Livonians Latgalians and Selonians started campaigning against the Estonians in and over next few years both sides made numerous raids and counter raids A major leader of the Estonian resistance was Lembitu an elder of Sakala County but in the Estonians suffered a significant defeat in the Battle of St Matthew s Day where Lembitu was killed In Valdemar II landed at Lindanise defeated the Estonians in the Battle of Lyndanisse and started conquering Northern Estonia The next year Sweden invaded Western Estonia but were repelled by the Oeselians In a major revolt ejected the Germans and Danes from the whole of Estonia except Reval but the crusaders soon resumed their offensive and in Saaremaa was the last maakond county to surrender br After the crusade the territory of present day south Estonia and Latvia was named Terra Mariana later on it became known simply as Livonia Northern Estonia became the Danish Duchy of Estonia while the rest was divided between the Sword Brothers and prince bishoprics of Dorpat and sel Wiek In after suffering a major defeat the Sword Brothers merged into the Teutonic Order becoming the Livonian Order In the next decades there were several uprisings against the Teutonic rulers in Saaremaa In a major uprising encompassed over north Estonia and Saaremaa The Teutonic Order suppressed the rebellion by and in the Danish king sold his possessions in Estonia to the Order The unsuccessful rebellion led to a consolidation of power for the upper class German minority For the subsequent centuries Low German remained the language of the ruling elite in both Estonian cities and the countryside br br Reval Tallinn the capital of Danish Estonia founded on the site of Lindanise adopted the L beck law and received full town rights in The Hanseatic League controlled trade on the Baltic Sea and overall the four largest towns in Estonia became members Reval Dorpat Tartu Pernau P rnu and Fellin Viljandi Reval acted as a trade intermediary between Novgorod and western Hanseatic cities while Dorpat filled the same role with Pskov Many artisans and merchants guilds were formed during the period Protected by their stone walls and membership in the Hansa prosperous cities like Reval and Dorpat often defied other rulers of the medieval Livonian Confederation br br br Post Reformation Era br br The Reformation began in central Europe in and soon spread northward to Livonia despite some opposition by the Livonian Order Towns were the first to embrace Protestantism in the s and by the s the majority of the landowners and rural population had adopted Lutheranism Church services were now conducted in vernacular language which initially meant Low German but already from the s onward the regular religious services were held in Estonian br During the th century the expansionist monarchies of Muscovy Sweden and Poland Lithuania consolidated power posing a growing threat to decentralised Livonia weakened by disputes between cities nobility bishops and the Order br In Tsar Ivan the Terrible of Russia Muscovy invaded Livonia starting the Livonian War The Livonian Order was decisively defeated in The majority of Livonia accepted Polish rule while Reval and the nobles of northern Estonia swore loyalty to the Swedish king and the Bishop of sel Wiek sold his lands to the Danish king Tsar Ivan s forces were at first able to conquer the larger part of Livonia however in the s the Polish Lithuanian and Swedish armies went on the offensive and the war ended in with Russian defeat As a result of the war northern Estonia became Swedish Duchy of Estonia southern Estonia became Polish Duchy of Livonia and Saaremaa remained under Danish control br In the Polish Swedish War broke out causing further devastation The protracted war ended in with Sweden gaining Livonia including the regions of Southern Estonia and Northern Latvia Danish Saaremaa was transferred to Sweden in The wars had halved the population of Estonia from about people in the mid th century to in the s br br While large parts of the rural population remained in serfdom during the Swedish rule legal reforms strengthened both serfs and free tenant farmers land usage and inheritance rights hence this period got the reputation of The Good Old Swedish Time in historical memory Swedish King Gustaf II Adolf established gymnasiums in Reval and Dorpat the latter was upgraded to Tartu University in Printing presses were also established in both towns The beginnings of the Estonian public education system appeared in the s largely due to efforts of Bengt Forselius who also introduced orthographical reforms to written Estonian The population of Estonia grew rapidly until the Great Famine of in which people died about of the population br During the Great Northern War the Tsardom of Russia Muscovy conquered the whole of Estonia by The war again devastated the population of Estonia with the population estimated at only In Estonia was divided into two governorates the Governorate of Estonia which included Tallinn and the northern part of Estonia and the southern Governorate of Livonia which extended to the northern part of Latvia The tsarist administration restored all the political and landholding rights of the local aristocracy The rights of local farmers reached their lowest point as serfdom completely dominated agricultural relations during the th century Serfdom was formally abolished in but this initially had very little practical effect major improvements in farmers rights started with reforms in the mid th century br br br National Awakening br br The Estonian national awakening began in the s as several leading figures started promoting an Estonian national identity among the general populace Widespread farm buyouts by Estonians and the resulting rapidly growing class of land owning farmers provided the economic basis for the formation of this new Estonian identity In Johann Voldemar Jannsen started publishing one of the first successful circulating Estonian language weekly newspapers Perno Postimees and began popularising the denomination of oneself as eestlane Estonian Schoolmaster Carl Robert Jakobson and clergyman Jakob Hurt became leading figures in a nationalist movement encouraging Estonian farmers to take pride in their language and ethnic Estonian identity The first nationwide movements formed such as a campaign to establish the Estonian language Alexander School the founding of the Society of Estonian Literati and the Estonian Students Society and the first national song festival held in in Tartu Linguistic reforms helped to develop the Estonian language The national epic Kalevipoeg was published in and saw the first performances of Estonian theatre In a major split happened in the national movement The moderate wing led by Hurt focused on development of culture and Estonian education while the radical wing led by Jakobson started demanding increased political and economical rights br At the end of the th century Russification began as the central government initiated various administrative and cultural measures to tie Baltic governorates more closely to the empire The Russian language replaced German and Estonian in most secondary schools and universities and many social and cultural activities in local languages were suppressed In the late s there was a new surge of nationalism with the rise of prominent figures like Jaan T nisson and Konstantin P ts In the early th century Estonians started taking over control of local governments in towns from Germans br During the Revolution the first legal Estonian political parties were founded An Estonian national congress was convened and demanded the unification of Estonian areas into a single autonomous territory and an end to Russification The unrest was accompanied by both peaceful political demonstrations and violent riots with looting in the commercial district of Tallinn and in a number of wealthy landowners manors in the Estonian countryside The Tsarist government responded with a brutal crackdown some people were executed and hundreds more jailed or deported to Siberia br br br Independence br br In after the February Revolution the governorate of Estonia was expanded by the Russian Provisional Government to include Estonian speaking areas of Livonia and was granted autonomy enabling the election of the Estonian Provincial Assembly The Bolsheviks seized power in Estonia in November and the Provincial Assembly was disbanded However the Provincial Assembly established the Salvation Committee and during the short interlude between Bolshevik retreat and German arrival the committee declared independence and formed the Estonian Provisional Government on February in the capital Tallinn German occupation immediately followed but after their defeat in World War I the Germans were forced to hand over power back to the Provisional Government of independent Estonia on November br On November Soviet Russia invaded starting the Estonian War of Independence The Red Army came within km of Tallinn but in January the Estonian Army led by Johan Laidoner went on a counter offensive ejecting Bolshevik forces from Estonia within a few weeks Renewed Soviet attacks failed and in the spring of the Estonian army in co operation with White Russian forces advanced into Russia and Latvia In June Estonia defeated the German Landeswehr which had attempted to dominate Latvia restoring power to the government of K rlis Ulmanis there After the collapse of the White Russian forces the Red Army launched a major offensive against Narva in late but failed to achieve a breakthrough On February the Tartu Peace Treaty was signed by Estonia and Soviet Russia with the latter pledging to permanently give up all sovereign claims to Estonia br In April the Estonian Constituent Assembly was elected The Constituent Assembly passed a sweeping land reform expropriating large estates and adopted a new highly liberal constitution establishing Estonia as a parliamentary democracy In the Soviet Union organised a communist coup attempt which quickly failed Estonia s cultural autonomy law for ethnic minorities adopted in is widely recognised as one of the most liberal in the world at that time The Great Depression put heavy pressure on Estonia s political system and in the right wing Vaps movement spearheaded a constitutional reform establishing a strong presidency On March the acting head of state Konstantin P ts extended a state of emergency over the entire country under the pretext that the Vaps movement had been planning a coup P ts went on to rule by decree for several years while the parliament did not reconvene era of silence A new constitution was adopted in a referendum and in a new bicameral parliament was elected in a popular vote where both pro government and opposition candidates participated The P ts r gime was relatively benign compared to other authoritarian r gimes in interwar Europe and the r gime never used violence against political opponents br Estonia joined the League of Nations in Attempts to establish a larger alliance together with Finland Poland and Latvia failed with only a mutual defence pact being signed with Latvia in and later was followed up with the Baltic Entente of In the s Estonia also engaged in secret military co operation with Finland Non aggression pacts were signed with the Soviet Union in and with Germany in In Estonia declared neutrality but this proved futile in World War II br br br World War II br br A week before the outbreak of World War II on August Nazi Germany and the Stalinist Soviet Union signed the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact In the pact s secret protocol Poland Romania Lithuania Latvia Estonia and Finland were divided between USSR and Germany into spheres of influence with Estonia assigned to the Soviet sphere On September the Soviet dictator Stalin presented the Estonian government an ultimatum demanding that Estonia immediately sign a treaty that would allow the USSR to establish military bases in Estonia or else face war The Estonian government decided to avoid military conflict and a mutual assistance treaty was signed in Moscow on September On June the Soviet Union instituted a full naval and air blockade on Estonia On the same day the airliner Kaleva was shot down by the Soviet Air Force On June the USSR presented an ultimatum demanding completely free passage of the Red Army into Estonia and the establishment of a pro Soviet government Feeling that resistance was hopeless the Estonian government complied and on the next day the whole country was occupied On August Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union as the Estonian SSR br br The USSR established a repressive wartime regime in occupied Estonia Many of the country s high ranking civil and military officials intelligentsia and industrialists were arrested Soviet repressions culminated on June with mass deportation of around people to Russia When Operation Barbarossa accompanied by Estonian guerrilla soldiers called Forest Brothers began against the Soviet Union on June in the form of the Summer War Estonian Suves da around young Estonian men were forcibly drafted into the Red Army fewer than of whom survived the war Soviet destruction battalions initiated a scorched earth policy Political prisoners who could not be evacuated were executed by the NKVD Many Estonians went into the forest starting an anti Soviet guerrilla campaign In July German Wehrmacht reached south Estonia The USSR evacuated Tallinn in late August with massive losses and capture of the Estonian islands was completed by German forces in October br Initially many Estonians were hopeful that Germany would help to restore Estonia s independence but this soon proved to be in vain Only a puppet collaborationist administration was established and occupied Estonia was merged into Reichskommissariat Ostland with its economy being fully subjugated to German military needs About a thousand Estonian Jews who had not managed to leave were almost all quickly killed in Numerous forced labour camps were established where thousands of Estonians foreign Jews Romani and Soviet prisoners of war perished German occupation authorities started recruiting men into small volunteer units but as these efforts provided meagre results and the military situation worsened forced conscription was instituted in eventually leading to formation of the Estonian Waffen SS division Thousands of Estonians who did not want to fight in the German military secretly escaped to Finland where many volunteered to fight together with Finns against Soviets br br The Red Army reached the Estonian borders again in early but its advance into Estonia was stopped in heavy fighting near Narva for six months by German forces including numerous Estonian units In March the Soviet Air Force carried out heavy bombing raids against Tallinn and other Estonian towns In July the Soviets started a major offensive from the south forcing the Germans to abandon mainland Estonia in September and the Estonian islands in November As German forces were retreating from Tallinn the last pre war prime minister J ri Uluots appointed a government headed by Otto Tief in an unsuccessful attempt to restore Estonia s independence Tens of thousands of people including most of the Estonian Swedes fled westwards to avoid the new Soviet occupation br Overall Estonia lost about of its population through deaths deportations and evacuations in World War II Estonia also suffered some irrevocable territorial losses as the Soviet Union transferred border areas comprising about of Estonian pre war territory from the Estonian SSR to the Russian SFSR br br br Second Soviet occupation br br Thousands of Estonians opposing the second Soviet occupation joined a guerrilla movement known as the Forest Brothers The armed resistance was heaviest in the first few years after the war but Soviet authorities gradually wore it down through attrition and resistance effectively ceased to exist in the mid s The Soviets initiated a policy of collectivisation but as farmers remained opposed to it a campaign of terror was unleashed In March about Estonians were deported to Siberia Collectivization was fully completed soon afterwards br The Russian dominated occupation authorities under the Soviet Union began Russification with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians and other Soviet people being induced to settle in occupied Estonia in a process which eventually threatened to turn indigenous Estonians into a minority in their own native land In Estonians formed of the population but by their share of the population had fallen to Occupying authorities carried out campaigns of ethnic cleansing mass deportation of indigenous populations and mass colonization by Russian settlers which led to Estonia losing of its native population By March people were deported from Estonia and from Latvia to the gulag system in Siberia where death rates were The occupying regime established an Estonian Communist Party where Russians were the majority in party membership Economically heavy industry was strongly prioritised but this did not improve the well being of the local population and caused massive environmental damage through pollution Living standards under the Soviet occupation kept falling further behind nearby independent Finland The country was heavily militarised with closed military areas covering of territory Islands and most of the coastal areas were turned into a restricted border zone which required a special permit for entry Estonia was quite closed until the second half of the s when gradually Estonians began to covertly watch Finnish television in the northern parts of the country thus getting a better picture of the way of life behind the Iron Curtain br The majority of Western countries considered the annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union illegal Legal continuity of the Estonian state was preserved through the government in exile and the Estonian diplomatic representatives which Western governments continued to recognise br br br Independence restored br br The introduction of perestroika by the Soviet central government in made open political activity possible again in Estonia which triggered an independence restoration process later known as laulev revolutsioon the Singing revolution The environmental Fosforiidis da Phosphorite war campaign became the first major protest movement against the central government In new political movements appeared such as the Popular Front of Estonia which came to represent the moderate wing in the independence movement and the more radical Estonian National Independence Party which was the first non communist party in the Soviet Union and demanded full restoration of independence On November after the first non rigged multi candidate elections in half a century the parliament of Soviet controlled Estonia issued the Sovereignty Declaration asserting the primacy of Estonian laws Over the next two years many other administrative parts or republics of the USSR followed the Estonian example issuing similar declarations On August about million Estonians Latvians and Lithuanians participated in a mass demonstration forming the Baltic Way human chain across the three countries In February elections were held to form the Congress of Estonia In March a referendum was held where of voters supported full independence During the coup attempt in Moscow Estonia declared restoration of independence on August br Soviet authorities recognised Estonian independence on
