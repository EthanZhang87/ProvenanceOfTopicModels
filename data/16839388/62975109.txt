again and everyone loses control of their gifts The tablet is reassembled and presented to Alma Pepa who can control the weather accidentally creates a large storm cloud forcing everyone to evacuate Isabela furiously admonishes Mirabel as she leaves while Alma assures the townspeople that the house and family are unharmed br Amidst the chaos Mirabel follows rats carrying the pieces of the tablet

the key to the fate of Casita s magic Not wanting Mirabel to be hurt he destroyed the vision s tablet and isolated himself At Mirabel s insistence Bruno reluctantly conjures another vision that depicts Mirabel and Isabela who have a strained relationship embracing and strengthening the candle br Mirabel reluctantly apologizes to Isabela who confesses she does not want to marry Mariano and is burdened by her image of perfection After accidentally creating a cactus and finding it beautiful despite its asymmetry Isabela realizes that she does not need to be perfect Mirabel helps Isabela use

again br br br Production br br br Development br br During a November publicity tour for Moana Miranda revealed that early stage work had begun on an animated project that John Lasseter then the chief creative officer of Disney Animation had presented to him and Howard Howard and Bush subsequently revealed that after finishing Zootopia they knew they wanted their next project to be a musical which turned into a Latin American musical after Miranda came on board Howard and Bush had already worked on buddy films where two characters go out into the world and learn about each other and wanted to try something completely different The three men discussed their common experience of having large extended families and decided to make a musical film about a large extended family with a dozen main characters br During the five years it took to develop the film Howard and Bush s true north was the theme of perspective about how you see the other people in your family and how you re seen They began by brainstorming ideas on a whiteboard Early on they made three important discoveries about families which became the basis of the film s story most of us don t feel truly seen by our families most of us carry burdens we never let our families see and most of us are oblivious that nearly all of us especially within our own families feel the exact same way In turn it was Miranda who suggested that the vibrant broad spectrum of Latin American music could best capture the complexity of family relationships br Early in development the production team spoke with many therapists and psychologists All were asked who would be treated best by the parents in a four person family every answer differed Bush concluded It s about how you perceive yourself in the family The crew also consulted family members and Disney Animation people br Howard and Bush started to discuss Latin American culture at length with Juan Rendon and Natalie Osma who had previously worked with them on the making of documentary Imagining Zootopia Rendon and Osma both happened to be from Colombia and repeatedly drew upon their personal experiences with Colombian culture in their discussions which caused Howard Bush and Miranda to focus their research on that country Rendon and Osma became the first two of several cultural experts hired by Disney Animation as consultants on the film who collectively formed what Disney called the Colombian Cultural Trust br In Rendon and Osma accompanied Howard Bush and Miranda on a research trip to Colombia During their two weeks in the country they met with architects chefs and artisans to immerse themselves in the country s culture They also visited the Gabriel Garc a M rquez foundation They visited big cities like Bogot and Cartagena but they found inspiration in small towns such as Salento terrain and Barichara architecture Bush noticed that every town we went to had a very specific personality because of how the country s mountainous terrain divides and isolates them br According to Disney fan club publication Disney twenty three this isolation became the key to placing the Madrigals residence in a remote encanto that is a place that s charmed or spiritually blessed a domain where magic and reality merge As Colombian tourist guide Alejandra Espinosa Uribe explained Colombians are surrounded by sacred lands that feel magical and we coexist with them not questioning their existence br In Barichara they befriended Espinosa Uribe who showed them around the town and later hired her to consult on the film s historical and cultural authenticity Espinosa Uribe was an inspiration for several aspects of the film s protagonist Mirabel including her curly black hair large eyeglasses and gestures The design of Mirabel s skirt was inspired by traditional skirts woven in the V lez area br The final version of the film is deliberately vague as to the timeframe in which it is set but drew inspiration from early th century Colombia After exploring the s the directors decided to shift the look of the film to the early s and to use a folkloric Colombian aesthetic At the beginning of the th century the country endured the Thousand Days War which resulted in the populations of entire villages fleeing to save themselves as depicted in the film br br br Writing br As the film steadily became more complex with an entire family to develop multiple songs and a rich cultural setting with a deep tradition of magical realism Howard and Bush realized they needed a second screenwriter to help write the screenplay They selected Charise Castro Smith for her strong background in magical realism and experience with handling real world family dynamics Bush described her as a godsend as she provided a foundation of heart vulnerability and authenticity Castro Smith sought to create a distinct imperfect and completely human character in Mirabel one that spoke to the lives of many Latinas while also being relatable to viewers globally br From working on Moana Miranda knew that film s protagonist Moana originally had eight brothers before they were removed to streamline the film s plot As Miranda had expected from that experience Disney Animation initially resisted moving forward with a dozen main characters for Encanto Miranda deliberately wrote the film s opening number The Family Madrigal to prove to Disney Animation that it was possible to efficiently introduce such a large family and its internal dynamics to the audience Because of the film s minute runtime the filmmakers struggled to make the center family feel genuine fleshed out and human and to give them arcs br The crew worked hard to develop Encanto upon instantly identifiable family archetypes The team focused on pushing past the archetypes and showing that family members are more complicated than the masks imposed on them Each member of the Madrigal family is inspired by a common family archetype if it were exaggerated and made magical for example Isabela and Luisa are based on that of the golden child and rock respectively Bush explained that this method prevented each gift from feeling arbitrary instead being prescribed by emotions and personality br Like most Disney Animation films Encanto went through many different versions in its development as various story ideas were explored and discarded The ideas discarded along the way include a young modern day woman is transported by a magical doorknob to another world Agust n was the family patriarch who discovered Encanto and personally built Casita there the film would have been expressly set in the s and featured cosmopolitan and modern fashions as well as motor vehicles and a trip to the big city where Alma had originally come from Casita was an extension of only Alma s personality rather than the entire family the film would have followed the story of multiple generations and Casita over a year timespan Mirabel was desperately trying to find her magical gift rather than merely expressing frustration with not being granted one the colors of Mirabel s world as seen from her perspective would have reflected her emotional state as she narrated the first two acts and then changed over to more realistic colors when the film shifted to Alma s point of view in the third act Luisa s room would have been made out of stone and appeared boring to reflect her sense of responsibility but would have concealed a secret exit to a hidden room similar to a theme park where she could have fun and Isabela at one point had a dorky suitor named Bubo who came from the big city br After the film s release Bush revealed via Twitter several more ideas which had been discussed and set aside Alma gave birth to the triplets at the river at the moment of Pedro s death Isabela and Mirabel s mutual hostility culminated in a fistfight and Mirabel celebrated her quincea era According to Howard as the plot evolved over several years the core of the whole film was always the relationship between Mirabel and Alma br br br Casting br Disney cast several actors with Colombian heritage including Stephanie Beatriz whose father is Colombian John Leguizamo who was born in Bogot and Wilmer Valderrama who spent his childhood in Colombia where his mother is from br Though no obvious roles which he could voice existed due to the Madrigals Colombian nationality and Mirabel s lack of an animal sidekick Alan Tudyk considered Disney s good luck charm makes a cameo as Pico a toucan When he first came into the recording studio Tudyk informed the crew that their scratch vocals for Pico were not actually those of toucans but instead were parrots He spent many hours doing imitations of various toucans The team would speak to him in English and Tudyk would respond using toucan noises br br br Design br Encanto was the hardest film to date for heads of animation Renato dos Anjos and Kira Lehtomaki because they were asked to fully develop a dozen characters as opposed to other animated films which primarily feature two or three characters out of a large cast Accordingly the characters required a degree of complexity that Disney Animation had previously never achieved Journalist Edna Liliana Valencia Murillo was the Afro Caribbean consultant and contributed greatly towards F lix Dolores and Antonio s designs According to Howard certain characters Afro Latin hairstyles were essential Disney veterans Ian Gooding and Lorelay Bov were hired as production designers for the film Lorelay and her sister costume design lead Neysa Bov hoped to represent the film s various communities well Neysa requested Colombian consultants which included an anthropologist and botanist br Instead of fabrics similar to neoprene that are often depicted in films the characters costumes are generally loose The clothes are meant to appear as though they are from Colombia The designers emphasized embroidery texture and movement each costume except Isabela s is asymmetric with a handmade feeling In Encanto personalities and family ties are represented through color For example Pepa and F lix s side of the family wear warm tones of orange yellow and red an homage to his Caribbean ancestry br By contrast Julieta and Agust n s side wear cool tones of blues purples and greens Alma sits in the middle with darker hues such as purple black and brown Each Madrigal has a symbol on their clothing that denotes their gift such as barbells on Luisa s skirt and Pepa s sun earrings Due to her lack of a gift Mirabel has symbols of the other family members gifts embroidered across her skirt in addition to her face and name br The residents of the Encanto dress in neutral tones thus the main family are distinguished by their vivid colors They needed to be distinctive while not standing out which visual development artist Jin Kim said occasionally made them harder to design than the main cast Disney used simple silhouettes for the villagers clothes to make them seem and feel similar to typical residents from the Colombian coffee region They incorporated depictions of the Sombrero vueltiao from the Zen Indigenous Community and the Sombrero Aguade o from the Aguadas Community br br br Animation br br The animators were challenged by the directors to make Mirabel distinctively different from all prior Disney heroines she had to be both capable and imperfect but not merely just clumsy The Casita was inspired not only by traditional Colombian homes but films in which houses come alive especially Beetlejuice br The production team learned in their research that music dance and rhythm are core elements of everyday life in Colombia As a result Encanto was the first Disney Animation film to have choreographers involved in the development process from start to finish meaning they worked closely with the production team to develop songs characters and story br This is in contrast to older films where the story was already in place by the time a choreographer was hired to consult on specific scenes For Encanto Disney Animation initially hired African American choreographer Jamal Sims who insisted on immediately hiring Colombian American dancer Kai Martinez as the film s animation reference consultant They worked together with a team of dancers to prepare choreography reference footage for each scene and then gave feedback to the animators on scenes as they were animated They developed different dance styles for different characters Luisa s style is reggaeton while Mirabel s style is Cali salsa br For selection and animation of the plants and flowers that Isabela could make grow the production team consulted with Colombian botanist Felipe Zapata His advice allowed appropriate plants to be selected and then shown in accurate detail The river of jacarandas and strangler figs and the cascade of sundew that Isabela produces are all based on this input Plants in the background scenery are also realistic These included the iconic but now vulnerable wax palm and dramatic Cecropia trees Economically important plants like coffee also appear br Over people of them animators were involved in the production of Encanto Disney Animation was planning to send many of its animators to Colombia starting on March in preparation for the film s transition from development to production This second research trip had to be cancelled after the onset of the COVID pandemic The studio s animators ended up having to work remotely with the Colombian Cultural Trust for example Espinosa Uribe gave the animators a virtual tour of Colombia with the help of her cell phone Diane Guerrero sent the studio s designers photographs of Colombian food taken by her relatives in Colombia br On June Miranda confirmed on Good Morning America that he and Bush were working on an animated Disney film set in Colombia with Bush and Byron Howard directing and Charise Castro Smith co directing br On June the tentative title was revealed to be Encanto The project was also confirmed to be the film Miranda was involved in and it was reported to be about a girl in a magical family On December the project was officially confirmed at a Disney Investor Day meeting where a clip was shown a fall release was announced and magical realism was referenced According to Bush development of the film s script wrapped in August and production on the film wrapped a month later Due to the COVID pandemic many crew members worked together remotely for over a year and did not meet each other in person until Disney put on a socially distanced outdoor screening of the final version of the film br br br Cinematography br Encanto is the first Disney Animation film since Tangled to employ a tall frame a decision made to get closer to the characters This layout was supplemented by romantic lighting According to Howard romantic meaning heightened in spirit is the film s key word in terms of the approach towards cinematography and lighting The latter was also inspired by magical realism due to the genre s heavy influence on the writing and characters br The directors aimed to use the film s optics to portray strong emotions Alessandro Jacomini and Daniel Rice directors of cinematography and lighting respectively stated this use would amplify exaggerate and distort perception which is very in line with Mirabel s point of view as a narrator Her feelings of being left out were also shown using emotive lighting The directors frequently reminded the crew of the emotional subtext of every scene as well as the intricacies of the individual parts That subtext was applied by Warner Jacomini and Rice in elaborate sequences such as the song Surface Pressure br br br Soundtrack br br In June Miranda publicly revealed that he had begun to write the film s music which would have eight original songs in both Spanish and English After the film s premiere he disclosed that he had been writing songs for the film from the very beginning On September Germaine Franco co composer of the songs for Coco began to score the film br Encanto was released on November A huge commercial success alike the film the soundtrack reached number one on the US Billboard becoming the first Disney soundtrack since that of Frozen II to top the chart The track We Don t Talk About Bruno broke various records and became one of Disney s most successful songs of all time It topped the US Billboard Hot and the UK Singles Chart and marked Disney s first number one song on the former in the st century and its first ever on the latter making Encanto the first Disney film to produce a number one song and a number one album br br br Release br br br Marketing br The first look of the film was shown on December during Disney s Investor Day The teaser trailer was released on July which garnered acclaim from internet users due to Luisa s physical appearance especially her muscles she was dubbed the Buff Lady The official trailer was released on September For its opening weekend at the box office Disney spent million on television advertisements to promote the film generating billion impressions Deadline Hollywood said the marketing failed to distinguish the film from other Disney properties causing audience members to believe that it would be similar to Coco Film was critical of Disney s merchandising most of which featured Mirabel and Isabela Many members of the Madrigal family could only be bought in more costly merchandise of the entire family Since Isabela is considered the perfect and beautiful sister the website stated the merchandise reinforces the idea that beauty is the most effective marketing tactic for young girls br br br Theatrical br Disney held the film s world premiere at the El Capitan

with a vivacious naturalistic glow swirling flower petals eye candy pastels that at moments is nearly psychedelic David Rooney from The Hollywood Reporter highlighted the film s colors and the designs of the costumes natural settings and Casita for particular praise For IndieWire Kristen Lopez lauded the visuals as stunning and life like IGN s Andrea Towers called the animation beautiful The Daily Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin was particularly amazed Encanto s animation is dazzling in all sorts of ways with technical effects and flights of creative fancy that would have been unimaginable

emotionally distilled and verbally nimble The Detroit News writer Adam Graham agreed commenting that the songs lift Encanto to the sky Similarly The Arizona Republic s Bill Goodykoontz regarded them as the film s peak CNN writer Brian Lowry shared a similar view Nevertheless many journalists found fault with the music such as National Review s Kyle Smith who called it thuddingly mediocre Though he found the songs breezy and fun Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly deemed them unmemorable Writing for Bleeding Cool Kaitlyn Booth believed the music was no thing particularly special and that a lack of songs would have benefited the film br Reviewers singled out Encanto s representation and diversity for particular praise Writing for The Guardian Simran Hans found the awareness of culturally unique generational trauma and displacement intriguing and surprising Despite being critical of a perceived disguise of cultural representation Rafael Matomayor of The New York Observer stated that when the film dives into the specificity of its portrayal of Colombia it becomes an exciting nuanced complex magical realist adventure that propels Disney into a new era The Independent s Clarissa Loughgrey highlighted that the cultural specificity was more than simple aesthetic or linguistic references commending the incorporation of magical realism and various skin tones Whelan Barzel of Time Out summarized the film as a genuine love letter to the diversity of Latin America br Reviews with regards to the film s portrayal of family dynamics deemed the aspect one of its strengths According to Slant Magazine s Derek Smith Encanto thrives in expressing not only the typical message of the value of family but also the concept that even the best families require much

for Collider commended the message of being enough because family is enough Polygon s Petrana Radulovic found the familial interactions stunningly realistic and strengthened by magical metaphors Many

which character they identified with most MovieWeb singled out Mirabel s search for acceptance and a purpose stating b uckets of tears are going to be shed br Regarding Disney s regular formula Encanto divided reviewers some thought that it departed from the formula well Forbes s Scott Mendelson called the film terrifically unconventional while World critic Collin Garbarino highlighted several aspects that he recognized as deviating from the formula such as a lack of princesses and villains as well as the focus on community Vulture s Bilge Ebiri attributed the film s enchanting qualities to the smaller scale narrative He explained that when the Madrigals inner journey is combined with the typical Disney spectacle it becomes an unexpected downright Sirkian power Others found it too similar to other Disney films For Pittsburgh Magazine Sean Collier felt the film was just another by the numbers Disney flick while Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian thought that the story wants to have its metaphorical cake and eat it deeming it contrived Film s Josh Spiegel thought Encanto included a mixture of formulaic aspects from many of the previous Disney and Pixar films and failed to make them unnoticeable br Some critics found the story unfocused The Irish Independent s Paul Whittington considered the plot too aimless to satisfy anyone for long Alice Forman of Mashable concurred and felt several parts of Mirabel s journey were arbitrary she had a particularly negative opinion of the film s middle section which she called tedious The Globe and Mail writer Aparita Bhandari asserted the internal rather than external source of conflict and several unanswered questions confused her preventing her from immersing herself in the film From USA Today Brian Truitt expressed his disappointment in the third act which he said misses Encanto s focal point David Lynch writing for KENS agreed and stated the act was weak due to an underdeveloped relationship between Mirabel and Alma as well as clumsy writing Multiple critics also cited the film s lack of villains as a detractor br Metacritic reported that Encanto appeared in five critic top ten lists including CNN and New York Daily News s non ranked lists and Pittsburgh Post Gazette s ranking ninth The film has also appeared on several lists of the best animated films of including those by Paste tenth Rotten Tomatoes

embroidered dresses the food the many colors of our skin even the animals including the ubiquitous toucan and the yellow butterflies that are synonymous with Garc a M rquez br Johanna Ferreira of PopSugar wrote that the success of both Encanto and its soundtrack speaks to not just the importance and significance of this type of representation in animated films but also how movies like this are
