approximately seven minutes In January Rubio described the program as different films from the kinds of films developed at Pixar while executive producer Lindsey Collins said that the shorts are referred to as SparkShorts because Pixar wants to discover that creative spark in its employees Rubio viewed the program as a wonderful opportunity to tell his story He stated that Float is inspired by his son who is autistic and that he identified with the father from the short Rubio said that the boy from the short is different from other children since he can float He commented that while the father loves his son wholeheartedly without restriction at first this begins to be altered by what the other people say as a result he has to choose between deciding they are right and ignoring their thoughts br Since his son was growing up Rubio decided he had to tell this story and started storyboarding it The initial storyboards contained Caucasian characters but one of Rubio s co workers told him that he should depict Filipino American characters instead While he was initially unsure of this idea he decided to make this change to empower his son and empower children of color Rubio wanted to incorporate some of his own features as a Filipino American into the characters designs in order to make them look authentic He commented that he was very proud that Float was released during Filipino American History Month Rubio said that seeing the viewers react to some scenes in the way he had expected them to was amazing stating that he totally loved it According to Rubio viewers had several different interpretations of the film br Krissy Cababa described Float as a powerful story about being a parent and the struggles you go through as a parent with your kids She also

want them to be She stated that people are talking about representation due to Float sharing what this means to them and its importance She mentioned that the short is a huge deal Cababa said the

characterized as extremely cute and as adorable Alex Abad Santos of Vox described the short as one of the best new things on Disney He commented that facial expressions and body language carry the story despite the general lack of dialogue adding that a small shift in posture or the way a frown sharpens an entire face wields so much emotion Abad Santos stated that the short s core story could be a story about assimilation and growing up as a minority or it could be about what it is like to feel different from those around you He said that Float taps into the human instinct to fiercely protect someone you love the worry that the world out there will not see them the way you do and the hope that that big scary world will love this person as much as you do he stated that while this sounds like a lot of ground to cover in seven minutes the short manages to do that very well Fortune s Ellen McGirt said that Rubio s own fear that his son would be judged by others is palpable through this short Float was described as a film about acceptance with a heartwarming story br br br br br br External links br Float at IMDb br Float on Disney
