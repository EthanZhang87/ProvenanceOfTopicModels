id: 7290308
Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the Great Clock of Westminster and by extension for the clock tower itself which stands at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London England Originally known simply as the Clock Tower it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II The clock is a striking clock with five bells br The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a Perpendicular Gothic Revival style and was completed in It is elaborately decorated with stone carvings and features symbols related to the four nations of the United Kingdom and the Anglo Welsh Tudor dynasty A Latin inscription celebrates Queen Victoria in whose reign the palace was built The tower stands feet m tall and the climb from ground level to the belfry is steps Its base is square measuring feet m on each side The dials of the clock are feet m in diameter br The clock uses its original mechanism and was the largest and most accurate four faced striking and chiming clock in the world upon its completion It was designed by Edmund Beckett Denison and George Airy the Astronomer Royal and constructed by Edward John Dent and Frederick Dent It is known for its reliability and can be adjusted by adding or removing pre decimal pennies from the pendulum The Great Bell was cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and weighs long tons tonnes short tons Its nickname may be derived from Sir Benjamin Hall who oversaw its installation or heavyweight boxing champion Benjamin Caunt There are four quarter bells which chime on the quarter hours br Big Ben is a British cultural icon It is one of the most prominent symbols of the United Kingdom and parliamentary democracy and it is often used in the establishing shot of films set in London The clock tower has been part of a Grade I listed building since and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since The fabric was repaired and renovated between and during which the bells remained silent with few exceptions br br br Tower br br br History br br Elizabeth Tower originally named the Clock Tower and popularly known as Big Ben was built as a part of Charles Barry s design for a new Palace of Westminster after the old palace was largely destroyed by fire on October Although Barry was the chief architect of the neo gothic palace he turned to Augustus Pugin for the design of the Clock Tower which resembles earlier Pugin designs including one for Scarisbrick Hall in Lancashire Construction of the tower began on September The building contractors were Thomas Grissell and Morton Peto An inscribed trowel in the Parliamentary Archives records that Emily sister of Peto s daughter in law was given the honour of laying the first stone It was Pugin s last design before his descent into mental illness and death in and Pugin himself wrote at the time of Barry s last visit to him to collect the drawings I never worked so hard in my life for Mr Barry for tomorrow I render all my designs for finishing his bell tower and it is beautiful br br br Design br Completed in the tower is designed in Pugin s Gothic Revival style and is feet m high making it the third tallest clock tower in the UK Its dials at the centre are feet m above ground level The tower s base is square measuring feet m on each side resting on concrete foundations feet m thick It was constructed using bricks clad on the exterior with sand coloured Anston limestone from South Yorkshire topped by a spire covered in hundreds of cast iron rooftiles There is a spiral staircase with stone steps up to the clock room followed by to reach the belfry and an additional to the top of the spire br Above the belfry and the Ayrton Light are shields decorated with national emblems of the four countries of the UK the red and white rose of England s Tudor dynasty the thistle of Scotland shamrock of Northern Ireland and leek of Wales They also feature the pomegranate of Catherine of Aragon first wife of the Tudor king Henry VIII the portcullis symbolising both Houses of Parliament and fleurs de lis a legacy from when English monarchs claimed to rule France br A ventilation shaft running from ground level up to the belfry which measures feet m by feet m was designed by David Boswell Reid known as the grandfather of air conditioning It was intended to draw cool fresh air into the Palace of Westminster in practice this did not work and the shaft was repurposed as a chimney until around The conservation works included the addition of a lift or elevator that was installed in the shaft br Its foundations rest on a layer of gravel below which is London Clay Owing to this soft ground the tower leans slightly to the north west by roughly mm in over m height giving an inclination of approximately This includes a planned maximum of mm increased tilt due to tunnelling for the Jubilee line extension In the s thousands of tons of concrete were pumped into the ground underneath the tower to stabilise it during construction of the Westminster section of the Jubilee line It leans by about mm in at the finial Experts believe the tower s lean will not be a problem for another to years br br br Ayrton Light br br A new feature was added in by Acton Smee Ayrton then First Commissioner of Works and Public Buildings The Ayrton Light is a lantern sited above the belfry and is lit whenever the House of Commons sits after dark It can be seen from across London Originally it shone towards Buckingham Palace so Queen Victoria could look out of a window and see when the Commons were at work br br br Prison Room br Inside the tower is an oak panelled Prison Room which can only be accessed from the House of Commons not via the tower entrance It was last used in when atheist Charles Bradlaugh newly elected Member of Parliament for Northampton was imprisoned by the Serjeant at Arms after he protested against swearing a religious oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria Officially the Serjeant at Arms can still make arrests as they have had the authority to do since The room however is currently occupied by the Petitions Committee which oversees petitions submitted to Parliament br br br Name br Journalists during Queen Victoria s reign called it St Stephen s Tower As members of Parliament originally sat at St Stephen s Hall these journalists referred to anything related to the House of Commons as news from St Stephens the Palace does contain a feature called St Stephen s Tower located above the public entrance On June the House of Commons voted in support of a proposal to change the name from the Clock Tower to Elizabeth Tower in commemoration of Elizabeth II in her Diamond Jubilee year since the large west tower known as Victoria Tower had been renamed in tribute to Queen Victoria on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee On June the House of Commons confirmed that the name change could go ahead David Cameron then prime minister officially announced the change of name on September The change was marked by a naming ceremony in which John Bercow then Speaker of the House of Commons unveiled a plaque attached to the tower on the adjoining Speaker s Green br br br Clock br br br Dials br br Augustus Pugin drew inspiration from the clockmaker Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy when he designed the dials Each is made of cast iron sections bolted together The whole frame is feet m in diameter making them the third largest in the UK They each contain pieces of opalescent glass Originally the dials were backlit using gas lamps at first only when Parliament was sitting but they have routinely been illuminated from dusk until dawn since Electric bulbs were installed at the beginning of the th century The ornate surrounds of the dials are gilded At the base of each dial is the Latin inscription DOMINE SALVAM FAC REGINAM NOSTRAM VICTORIAM PRIMAM which means O Lord keep safe our Queen Victoria the First Unlike Roman numeral clock dials that show the position as IIII the Great Clock faces depict as IV The clock s gun metal hour hands and copper minute hands are feet m and feet m long respectively br When completed the dials and clock hands were Prussian blue but were painted black in the s to disguise the effects of air pollution The original colour scheme was reinstated during the conservation work Analysis of the paint layers found that no fewer than six different colour schemes had been used over the past years The Victorian glass was also removed and replaced with faithful reproductions made in Germany by glassmakers Glasfabrik Lamberts br br br Movement br br The clock s movement is known for its reliability The designers were the lawyer and amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Denison and George Airy the Astronomer Royal Construction was entrusted to clockmaker Edward John Dent after his death in his stepson Frederick Dent completed the work in As the tower was not completed until Denison had time to experiment before its installation in April that year instead of using a deadbeat escapement and remontoire as originally designed he invented a double three legged gravity escapement which provides the best separation between pendulum and clock mechanism thus mitigating the effects of rain wind and snow on the dials Denison never patented his design and it quickly became the standard on all new high quality tower clocks br br On top of the pendulum is a small stack of pre decimal penny coins these are to adjust the time of the clock Adding a coin has the effect of minutely lifting the position of the pendulum s centre of mass reducing the effective length of the pendulum rod and hence increasing the rate at which the pendulum swings Adding or removing a penny will change the clock s speed by seconds per day It keeps time to within a few seconds per week It is hand wound taking about hours three times a week The Keeper of the Clock is responsible for looking after the movement in addition to overseeing every aspect of maintenance around the Palace A team of horologists are on call hours a day to attend to the clock in the event of an emergency br On May a German bombing raid damaged two of the clock s dials and sections of the tower s stepped roof and destroyed the House of Commons chamber Architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott designed a new five floor block Two floors are occupied by the current chamber which was used for the first time on October The clock ran accurately and chimed throughout the Blitz br br br Breakdowns and other incidents br br br th century br Before The clock stopped for the first time in its history through a heavy fall of snow on the hands of a clock face br August January The clock was stopped for three weeks to allow the tower and mechanism to be cleaned and repaired The old escape wheel was replaced br br br th century br February The heavy build up of snow on a clock face impeded the progress of the hour hand causing the clock to stop for about eight hours br For two years during World War I the bells were silenced and the clock faces were not illuminated at night to avoid guiding attacking German Zeppelins The bells were restored at a m on November to mark the end of the war br December Snow build up on a clock face stopped the clock br Winter Heavy snow stopped the clock for several hours br April The clock stopped from a m to p m when it was repaired br September A painter painting the inside of the clock room placed a ladder against a shaft driving the hands stopping the clock from a m to a m br September Although the bells continued to ring the clock faces were not illuminated at night throughout World War II to avoid guiding bomber pilots during the Blitz br May the clock was damaged during a German bombing raid either by a small bomb or by a British anti aircraft shell Stonework and ornamental ironwork were damaged and the glass on the south dial was shattered The damage was repaired at the time but in major refurbishment from it was found that the tower had sustained greater damage than originally thought and asbestos lead paint and broken glass were discovered increasing the refurbishment cost from an estimated m to nearly m br June The clock stopped from p m until the following morning after a workman repairing air raid damage to the clock face left a hammer too close to the mechanism br December The clock hands stopped due to mechanical failure The broken part a pendulum suspension spring was replaced within a few hours br January Extremely cold temperatures froze the rubber bushings on the quarter bell hammers preventing the chimes sounding from p m on the th to p m the following evening the BBC broadcast the pips in the interval br January The rubber bushings on the quarter bell hammers again froze before the clock sounded midnight muting the chimes though the problem was resolved by the morning br August The clock slowed by four and a half minutes after a flock of starlings perched on the minute hand br January The clock stopped at a m due to drifts of snow forming on the north and east dials Small electric heaters were placed just inside these two dials and this measure has helped to reduce instances of freezing in recent years br July The rope operating the striking hammer broke silencing the clock from a m to p m br New Year s Eve The clock slowed due to heavy snow and ice on the hands causing the pendulum to detach from the clockwork as it is designed to do in such circumstances to avoid serious damage elsewhere in the mechanism the pendulum continuing to swing freely Thus it chimed in the new year nine minutes late br January The bells were silenced during the funeral of statesman and former prime minister Winston Churchill br January Snow buildup on the clock faces blocked the hands from moving stopping the clock from a m to a m br August The air brake speed regulator of the chiming mechanism broke from torsional fatigue after more than years of use causing the fully wound ton weight to spin the winding drum out of the movement causing much damage The Great Clock was shut down for a total of days over nine months it was reactivated on May This was the longest break in operation since its construction During this time BBC Radio broadcast the pips instead Although there were minor stoppages from to when maintenance of the clock was carried out by the old firm of clockmakers Thwaites Reed these were often repaired within the permitted two hour downtime and not recorded as stoppages Before maintenance was carried out by the original firm of Dents since by parliamentary staff br March and January The problem of the rubber bushings on the quarter bell chimes freezing recurred muffling the chimes br April The clock stopped hours before the general election and stopped again three weeks later br br br st century br br May The clock stopped at pm possibly because of hot weather temperatures in London had reached an unseasonable C F It resumed but stopped again at pm and remained still for about minutes before resuming br October The mechanism was stopped for about hours to allow maintenance work on the clock and its chimes It was the lengthiest maintenance shutdown in years br a m on June The clock tower s Quarter Bells were taken out of commission for four weeks as a bearing holding one of the quarter bells was worn and needed to be removed for repairs During this period BBC Radio broadcast recordings of British bird song followed by the pips in place of the usual chimes br August Start of six week stoppage for maintenance Bearings in the clock s chime train and the great bell striker were replaced for the first time since installation During the maintenance the clock was driven by an electric motor Once again BBC Radio broadcast the pips during this time The intention was that the clock should run accurately for a further years before major maintenance is again required in fact the repairs sufficed for ten years br April The bells were silenced as a mark of profound dignity and deep respect during the funeral of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher br August Maintenance crews discovered the clock to be running seven seconds fast They removed coins from its pendulum to correct the error which caused it to run slow for a period br August Start of a four year silencing of the chimes during maintenance and repair work to the clock mechanism and repairs and improvements to the clock tower building During this time dials hands and lights were removed for restoration with at least one dial with its hands driven by an electric motor left intact functioning and visible at any given time A lift was also installed during this renovation br May The clock dials all stopped at and Big Ben did not chime at The hands restarted but the clock was five minutes slow until rectified at br br br Bells br br br Great Bell br br The main bell officially known as the Great Bell but better known as Big Ben is the largest bell in the tower and part of the Great Clock of Westminster It sounds an E natural br The original bell was a ton tonne hour bell cast on August in Stockton on Tees by John Warner Sons It is thought that the bell was originally to be called Victoria or Royal Victoria in honour of Queen Victoria but that an MP suggested the bell s current nickname of Big Ben during a Parliamentary debate the comment is not recorded in Hansard br Since the tower was not yet finished the bell was mounted in New Palace Yard but during testing it cracked beyond repair and a replacement had to be made The bell was recast on April at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry as a ton tonne bell The second bell was transported from the foundry to the tower on a trolley drawn by sixteen horses with crowds cheering its progress it was then pulled ft m up to the Clock Tower s belfry a feat that took hours It is feet inches m tall and feet m diameter This new bell first chimed on July in September it too cracked under the hammer According to the foundry s manager George Mears the horologist Denison had used a hammer more than twice the maximum weight specified For three years Big Ben was taken out of commission and the hours were struck on the lowest of the quarter bells until it was repaired To make the repair a square piece of metal was chipped out from the rim around the crack and the bell given an eighth of a turn so the new hammer struck in a different place Big Ben has chimed with a slightly different tone ever since and is still in use today with the crack unrepaired Big Ben was the largest bell in the British Isles until Great Paul a ton tonne bell currently hung in St Paul s Cathedral was cast in br In August the bell s striker was replaced for the first time since installation br br br Nickname br The origin of the nickname Big Ben is the subject of some debate The nickname was applied first to the Great Bell it may have been named after Sir Benjamin Hall who oversaw the installation of the Great Bell or after English heavyweight boxing champion Ben Caunt Now Big Ben is often used by extension to refer to the clock the tower and the bell collectively although the nickname is not universally accepted as referring to the clock and tower Some authors of works about the tower clock and bell sidestep the issue by using the words Big Ben first in the title then going on to clarify that the subject of the book is the clock and tower as well as the bell br br br Chimes br Along with the Great Bell the belfry houses four quarter bells which play the Westminster Quarters on the quarter hours The four quarter bells sound G F E and B They were cast by John Warner Sons at their Crescent Foundry in G F and B and E The Foundry was in Jewin Crescent in what is now known as The Barbican in the City of London The bells are sounded by hammers pulled by cables coming from the link room a low ceiling space between the clock room and the belfry where they are triggered by cables coming from the chime train br The quarter bells play a once repeating note sequence of rounds and four changes in the key of E major at quarter past at half past and at quarter to and on the hour which sounds seconds before the main bell tolls the hour Because the low bell B is struck twice in quick succession there is not enough time to pull a hammer back and it is supplied with two wrench hammers on opposite sides of the bell The tune is that of the Cambridge Chimes first used for the chimes of Great St Mary s church Cambridge and supposedly a variation attributed to William Crotch based on violin phrases from the air I know that my Redeemer liveth in Handel s Messiah The notional words of the chime again derived from Great St Mary s and in turn an allusion to Psalm are All through this hour Lord be my guide And by Thy power No foot shall slide They are written on a plaque on the wall of the clock room br One of the requirements for the clock was that the first stroke of the hour bell should be correct to within one second per day The tolerance is with reference to Greenwich Mean Time BST in summer So at twelve o clock for example it is the first of the twelve hour bell strikes that signifies the hour the New Year on New Year s Eve at midnight The time signalled by the last of the six pips UTC may be fractionally different br On November Remembrance Sunday the chimes of Big Ben returned to regular service for the first time since August preceding the hour bell being sounded at a m local time the first hour strike marking the beginning of two minutes of silence br br br Cultural significance br br The clock has become a cultural symbol of the United Kingdom particularly in the visual media When a television or film maker wishes to indicate a generic location in the country a popular way to do so is to show an image of the tower often with a red double decker bus or black cab in the foreground br In a survey of people found that the tower was the most popular landmark in the United Kingdom It has also been named as the most iconic film location in London br The sound of the clock chiming has also been used this way in audio media the Westminster Quarters are imitated by other clocks and other devices but the sound of Big Ben is preferred as the original and best Big Ben is a focal point of New Year celebrations in the United Kingdom with radio and television stations airing its chimes to welcome the start of the New Year To welcome in the clock tower was lit with fireworks that exploded at every toll of Big Ben Similarly on Remembrance Day the chimes of Big Ben are broadcast to mark the th hour of the th day of the th month and the start of the two minutes silence br In prior to the millennium New Year a recording of the clock was released by London Records under the title Millennium Chimes with the artist labelled as Big Ben It reached number for the week ending January which included purchases prior to December br The chimes of Big Ben have also been used at the state funerals of monarchs on four occasions chiming one stroke for each year of the monarch s life firstly at the funeral of King Edward VII in when Big Ben chimed times secondly at the funeral of King George V in strokes thirdly at the funeral of King George VI in strokes and lastly at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in strokes br Londoners who live an appropriate distance from the tower and Big Ben can by means of listening to the chimes both live and on analogue radio hear the bell strike thirteen times This is possible because the electronically transmitted chimes arrive virtually instantaneously while the live sound is delayed travelling through the air since the speed of sound is relatively slow br ITN s News at Ten opening sequence formerly featured an image of the tower with the sound of Big Ben s chimes punctuating the announcement of the news headlines of the day The Big Ben chimes known within ITN as The Bongs continue to be used during the headlines and all ITV News bulletins use a graphic based on the Westminster clock dial Big Ben can also be heard striking the hour before some news bulletins on BBC Radio p m and midnight plus p m on Sundays and the BBC World Service a practice that began on December The sound of the chimes is sent live from a microphone permanently installed in the tower and connected by line to Broadcasting House br At the close of the polls for the general election the results of the national exit poll were projected onto the south side of the tower On July starting at a m Big Ben chimed times to welcome the Games of the th Olympiad which officially began that day to London br br br restoration br On August Big Ben s chimes fell silent for four years to allow essential restoration work to be carried out on the tower The decision to silence the bells was made to protect the hearing of the workers on the tower and drew much criticism from senior MPs and Prime Minister Theresa May The striking and tolling of the bells for important occasions such as New Year s Eve and Remembrance Sunday was handled via an electric motor and at least one of the four clock faces always remained visible during the restoration Scaffolding was put up around the tower immediately after the bells were silenced The cost of the project to the taxpayers and creditors was originally estimated to be roughly million but it more than doubled to million br In February the renovations revealed that the Elizabeth Tower had sustained greater damage than previously thought from the May bombing raid that destroyed the adjacent House of Commons Other costly discoveries included asbestos in the belfry the extensive use of lead paint broken glass on the clock dials and serious deterioration to the tower s intricate stone carvings due to air pollution The cost of addressing these problems was estimated at million bringing the total budget for restoring the Elizabeth Tower to nearly million br The cast iron roof tiles were removed and refurbished and a lift was installed to make access easier along with a basic toilet facility with running water for the first time in the tower itself The Ayrton Light at the top of the tower which is lit when Parliament is sitting was also fully dismantled and restored along with the other lights in the Belfry being replaced with low energy LEDs One of the most visible changes to the tower has been the restoration of the clock face framework to its original colour of Prussian blue used when the tower was first built in with the black paint that was used to cover up the soot stained dial frames having been stripped away The clock faces were regilded and the shields of St George repainted in their original red and white colours The pieces of glass that make up the clock faces have also been removed and replaced br In December after four years of renovations and restoration the tower emerged from behind its scaffolding in time for the ringing in of the new year In April the gantry supporting the scaffolding was removed br br br See also br London portal br Big Ben Aden a metre replica
