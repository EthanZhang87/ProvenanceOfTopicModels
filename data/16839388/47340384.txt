Joy is a fictional character who appears in Disney Pixar s Inside Out franchise She is one of the five later ten emotions inside the mind of Riley Andersen being the literal embodiment of joy and the lead emotion in Riley s head She wears a green dress and has yellow skin and blue hair In the film she is one of the two protagonists alongside Sadness and is primarily voiced by Amy Poehler br Joy s popularity in Inside Out has led to multiple other appearances in related media The character returns in Inside Out once again as one of the protagonists and is set to return in an unnamed upcoming Disney spin off show of the films br br br Concept and creation br In early stages of development for Inside Out Joy was going to be the main source of narrative tension as she wouldn t let Riley grow up Kevin Nolting said they changed the character arc as the essence of the problem was Joy wasn t likable she was putting Riley in embarrassing situations Riley was in middle school but Joy was making her act like a child As an audience member you weren t rooting for Joy Joy was going to be paired with Fear and not Sadness for the film s story but this was changed as the writers found Joy and Sadness as more dynamic viewing From the early stages of production director Pete Docter was set on Joy being the film s protagonist as reason for why she is the only emotion with a common name Like the other emotions her primary color was chosen based on color theory where yellow is associated with happiness Docter has said Joy was the hardest character to write in the film due to her positive attitude potentially grating on people so her contrast with Sadness and development from it was given a major role in the story to avoid this Joy s voice actress Amy Poehler added saying Joy and Sadness were written to play off each other Poehler s casting was also incorporated to ensure the character would not annoy the audiences br According to designers Joy was given bare feet and a pixie cut to reinforce her rambunctious nature as well as a blue hair color to avoid comparisons to the Peter Pan character Tinker Bell The character was designed so that she could incorporate larger than life movements notably in her running The character s body shape was also based on that of a star done to emphasize her energetic personality br br br Personality br As her name would suggest Joy is vivacious and has a cheerful peppy and optimistic attitude mainly wanting the best for Riley However this causes her to act somewhat selfishly towards the other emotions particularly Sadness as Joy likes to be in control of how Riley feels While she thinks of herself as a people person Joy grows easily frustrated with anyone who doesn t share her worldview She s happiest when she s in charge and she s confident that her way is always the right way br As the movie goes on Joy learns to accept Sadness as an integral part of Riley s mind Amy Poehler stated Joy goes through her own journey in the film She realizes that she has to also be sad And so when we were working on the character together it was like What level are we at in the beginning Can we modulate that And how does she change br br

their way back br At one point Joy and Bing Bong fall into the Memory Dump where old memories made by Riley go to be forgotten Bing Bong sacrifices himself so Joy can get out and get to headquarters After getting out of the Memory Dump Joy attempts to find Sadness She then sees her flying on a cloud and chases after her She finds that Sadness is close to headquarters and flings herself to Sadness
