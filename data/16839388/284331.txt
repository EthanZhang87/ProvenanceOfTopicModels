including song lyrics by Beyonc and Justin Bieber He was named the longest serving astronaut in space by NASA after a Buzz Lightyear action figure spent months onboard the International Space Station from May to September br br br Development br br br Conception and writing br Toy Story originated in the short Tin Toy an animated Pixar film about a tin toy and a baby The film was so successful that Disney approached Pixar to develop more animated films from computer generated animation A feature film was conceived involving a windup toy named Tinny who rivals a former favorite toy a ventriloquist s dummy Tinny was eventually converted into a spaceman and evolved through various design changes eventually transforming into Buzz Lightyear Disney entered into the joint project with Pixar then a young production studio chaired by Steve Jobs for three computer animated feature films in a million deal The Pixar team working on the project included John Lasseter as director screenwriters Andrew Stanton and Pete Docter and Ed Catmull In the early s Lasseter and his colleagues created short films at Pixar using computer software that was still being designed but they had not produced a feature film When Disney came onboard with Lasseter s idea they pushed for edgier characters Lasseter recalled that this made them unlikeable The characters were yelling they were cynical they were always making fun of everybody and I hated it Worried about losing the deal with Disney the Pixar team reworked the story concept within two weeks with the belief that toys could appeal to adults and teenagers The new story centred around a boy named Andy a cowboy leading a group of toys and a space toy and the film was greenlit by Disney Lasseter named various influences on the story concept including Star Wars the space race and buddy comedies br br The film s script went through various changes during development The first draft was produced in March and followed Tinny a one man band toy who is given to a boy as a birthday gift The boy s family take Tinny on holiday but accidentally leave him at a gas station where he meets the ventriloquist s dummy From there the two characters have to work out how to find their way back to Tinny s owners After a series of adventures they find their way to a kindergarten playground where they are reunited with the children By summer Jeff Katzenberg at Disney decided that it should be a buddy film in which two conflicting characters must learn to work together In September the Pixar team drew up a new version in which the ventriloquist s dummy is already the favorite toy in the house and Tinny is introduced as its rival which causes friction between the two characters br br br Design br Further changes to the character followed during the development Lasseter considered a one man band toy to be an outdated idea and decided to change Tinny to an action figure similar to G I Joe He said we started to analyze what a little boy would get these days that would make him so excited that he stopped playing with anything else G I Joe was Lasseter s favorite character in childhood but later Tinny evolved into a space hero similar to Major Matt Mason This character then went through various design iterations initially named Lunar Larry which was then changed to Tempus and then Morph who wore a red space suit Finally the dummy character was redesigned into a stuffed cowboy doll named Woody and Morph became Buzz Lightyear br Buzz Lightyear was named in honor of Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin the second person to walk on the Moon The film producers thought that Aldrin had the coolest astronaut name Aldrin acknowledged the tribute when he pulled a Buzz Lightyear toy out during a speech at NASA Aldrin did not receive any endorsement fees for the use of his nickname In he admitted to being exasperated by Disney using his name for the character You don t want to tangle with Disney the friend of children You don t want to challenge their lawyers for sure you re going to lose br The lime green and purple color scheme in Buzz s design was created by Lasseter while sketching the character and was chosen as an apology to his wife for working late lime green was the favorite color of Lasseter and purple was his wife s favorite The appearance of television actor Ed Kemmer was also an inspiration for Lightyear Kemmer played Commander Buzz Corry in Space Patrol one of the first science fiction series on American television br br br Voices br br Originally when a screen test was being made Lasseter wanted Buzz to be voiced by Billy Crystal and used audio from the film When Harry Met Sally Crystal turned the role down being of the opinion that he was the wrong voice for the character but later said that the decision was the biggest regret of his career Several other actors were considered for the role including Bill Murray who turned it down and Jim Carrey Chevy Chase also passed on the role leaving it open for Tim Allen who cited Chase as his idol and the reason he chose to accept the role Allen was cast due to Lasseter enjoying his standup comedy as he wanted the character to be funny The honesty in Allen s first reading for Buzz influenced Pixar to change him to a character who is unaware that he is a toy For both Allen and Tom Hanks the voice of Woody it was their first time working on an animated film Allen admitted that he was initially sceptical that the film would be successful as he thought it too high tech and too similar to a video game br Allen continued to voice Buzz in all of the Toy Story feature films and also voiced the character for Buzz Lightyear of Star Command The Adventure Begins a spin off released for direct to video in In addition Allen also voiced the character in the animated short film series Toy Story Toons and in Ralph Breaks the Internet Other actors have also voiced Buzz including Pat Fraley who took on the role in the mid s for various productions including Toy Story Treats Toy Story The Video Game Toy Story Animated Storybook and Toy Story Activity Patrick Warburton also voiced the character in for Buzz Lightyear of Star Command a D animated TV series based on the direct to video film From to a show titled Toy Story The Musical on board Disney Cruise Line featured Buzz portrayed by Noel Orput In Toy Story the Spanish version of Buzz was voiced by Javier Fernandez Pe a who returned for Toy Story Toons Hawaiian Vacation From Mike MacRae voiced Buzz in various video games including Toy Story The Video Game three instances of Toy Story for Disney Infinity and Kingdom Hearts III Corey Burton portrayed Buzz in performances of Disney on Ice in Teddy Newton voiced a small Buzz character in the short film Toy Story Toons Small Fry Additionally James Brolin voices an older version of Buzz in Lightyear br Chris Evans was cast as the voice of Buzz for the animated spin off film Lightyear After being initially intimidated by the role Evans said that he used Allen as his inspiration but did not want to do a shameless impression Instead he tried to create his own interpretation of the character by lowering his voice tone while also making it a homage to Allen Director Angus MacLane explained that his casting was intended to separate the more serious action hero version of the character from Allen s comedic toy version in the Toy Story films which he described as a little goofier and a little dumber Lightyear was Evans first voice acting role He admitted that speaking Buzz s catchphrase To infinity and beyond was like wearing someone else s clothes and felt that the line belonged to Allen The casting announcement caused confusion in the media and prompted Hanks who had remained friends with Allen since the first Toy Story film to question why he had not been recast in the role Allen responded to the casting in June stating that he had not commented earlier as he felt that Lightyear had no connection to the original Buzz He criticised the film for not having a closer connection to toy Buzz and commented There s really no Toy Story Buzz without Woody In February Allen was confirmed to be returning to the role for Toy Story br br br Characteristics br Buzz Lightyear is a toy given as a birthday present to a boy named Andy He is a space ranger toy with electronic features including flashing lights and catchphrases and is based on a character in Andy s favorite film Like the other toys in Toy Story Buzz comes to life but is unaware that he is a toy instead believing himself to be a real space ranger His delusion is expressed immediately upon entering Andy s room which he mistakes for a strange planet He declares that he is stationed in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four and is tasked with protecting the galaxy from the Evil Emperor Zurg the enemy of the Galactic Alliance He explains to Woody that he must rendezvous with Star Command to deliver information on Zurg s secret weapon which can destroy entire planets and that Woody is causing him to be delayed As an action figure Buzz has various features including a space suit that glows in the dark He also takes his heroic role very seriously and is prepared to face dangerous enemies by setting his laser from stun to kill His earnestness is often used as a form of comic relief Being the newest toy in Andy s room the other toys except for Woody are impressed and treat him with reverence like a real space ranger He is particularly convinced that he can fly and attempts to demonstrate this to the other toys in Andy s room He often uses one of his catchphrases To infinity and beyond as a rallying cry when attempting a heroic feat Despite initially being a figure of fun for Woody he is often proven to be courageous and the calmer and more sensible of the two making safer decisions that demonstrate his leadership qualities Over time Buzz develops a deep friendship with Woody and their bond continues throughout the Toy Story films He eventually discovers that he is just a toy which leads to a personal crisis and moments of self reflection upon discovering other Buzz Lightyear action figures in a toy store Buzz accepts that he is not a space ranger while helping Woody to reach Andy in a moving van where he activates his wings to glide through the air and proclaims that he is not flying but falling with style br br br Characterization br br br In Toy Story br br During the development of Toy Story Buzz Lightyear was conceived to be the opposite to Andy s favorite toy Woody Writer Andrew Stanton explained that while Woody is an old cowboy doll Buzz is a flashy new space ranger toy with all the gizmos Their rivalry over their status as Andy s favorite toy is a fundamental aspect of the story which Stanton said evolved into a classic buddy picture Commenting on Buzz s personality Allen said he would like to have Buzz s innocence I wish I could look at things that simply He said that in contrast to Woody Buzz has a limited sense of what is real and this lack of consciousness is used for comedic effect He noted that the dynamic between the two characters is what gives Buzz a personality stating that his sense of being is created in the moment when he sees Woody for the first time He described Buzz as being linear and duty oriented but commented that when he eventually finds his inner voice it is plastic but it works for Buzz Allen admitted that the character Duke Caboom presented a problem for him due to the similarities in his personality to Buzz s bravado Consequently he discussed the character with Keanu Reeves the character s voice actor who then made some changes to the character In Toy Story director Lee Unkrich said that the production team knew they wanted Buzz to switch from his usual state so after some brainstorming they decided that he would switch to a Spanish mode As a result his personality was changed into the form of a Latin lover According to Toy Story director Josh Cooley Buzz plays a pivotal role in Woody s story arc in the moment when he decides to move on in the final scenes of the film He commented Buzz had to be the one who kind of gave him permission and said You need to do this This is for you Producer Jonas Rivera described their relationship in this moment as sophisticated due to them having the ability to communicate without speaking br br br In Lightyear br br In the spin off film Lightyear Buzz is characterized as the fictional character in the favorite film of the Toy Story character Andy which the Buzz Lightyear action figures were based on For Buzz s character in Lightyear the Pixar team wanted to create a distinction between the heroic fictional human Buzz and the toy Buzz of Toy Story Consequently they needed to ensure he was both a dramatic and comedic character rather than a character used for comic relief He also needed to appear heroic without coming across as arrogant Director Angus MacLane was influenced by his love of sci fi action adventure films to imagine Buzz as he would appear to Andy in a blockbuster movie Describing Buzz as a cool toy he considered Buzz s absolute confidence in himself to be the ideal comedic partner for Woody and questioned whether his backstory involving Emperor Zurg could be produced in film Having worked as an animator on the first two Toy Story sequels he decided that for Lightyear Buzz s character trait was a disagreement over the nature of reality referring to Toy Story in which Buzz believes himself to be a space ranger and Toy Story where he believes that he is the Buzz Lightyear Using his own personal experience of time passing at Pixar as his inspiration he imagined Buzz rapidly travelling through time and consequently losing his connection to the important people in his life This felt like a natural fit for Buzz as a hero out of time a well worn story in the science fiction drama He cited various influences on his depiction of Buzz s story including Stars Wars Star Trek and Alien MacLane framed Buzz in the heroic form of Captain America reinforced by casting Evans in the role but their personalities differed due to the Captain being a team player and Buzz being an isolated character The writers gave Buzz a character to respect and admire in the form of Alicia Hawthorne and used this relationship to eventually show Buzz what he is missing from his life MacLane explained that Buzz s catchphrase To infinity and beyond was used to emphasise the character s story arc His personal and moral failure is the realization that he isn t perfect and the need to embrace his imperfections He recalled that in Toy Story the catchphrase is a joke you can t go beyond infinity but in Lightyear it was used as a secret handshake shared with his friend Alicia Producer Galyn Susman said that it had two meanings in the film initially being about Buzz s next adventure and finally being much more about being together and being here in the present In the film Buzz is transported to Zurg s spaceship where he contemplates whether Zurg is his father a reference to a comedic moment in Toy Story that mimics a Star Wars scene where Zurg tells a Buzz Lightyear figure that he is his father Lightyear s story flips this by revealing that Zurg is really an older version of Buzz from an alternate timeline MacLane realised that employing the same plot point as in Toy Story would not have worked with audiences because it would be expected What we were really going for was the idea that Buzz s greatest enemy is himself literally and figuratively br br br Appearances br br br Toy Story films br br br Toy Story br br Buzz Lightyear an action figure is given to a boy named Andy Davis from his mother as a birthday present He quickly impresses the other toys with his skills flashy accessories and wings and soon becomes Andy s favorite toy Sheriff Woody the former favorite toy quickly becomes

By April only five months before the film s release Thinkway Toys a small Canadian manufacturer took on the licensing deal within the tight timeframe Albert Chan president and CEO of Thinkway Toys said he saw the deal as an opportunity while many manufacturers considered it a risk to produce toys for the first CGI film Lasseter explained that in the film Buzz Lightyear was designed as a inch action figure and therefore he wanted the same size for the real Buzz Lightyear toy This differed from the standard and a half inch action figures produced in North America Chan had reservations about the size and price but was convinced to trust Lasseter s judgement Anne Osberg the president of Disney Consumer Products admitted that she had underestimated the merchandising potential of the Toy Story characters when compared to Mickey Mouse I saw Buzz as not competitive with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Due to the enormous success of Toy Story upon its release Thinkway Toys was unable to meet the demand for Buzz Lightyear figures in the holiday season of With the assumption that Woody would be the most popular character only Buzz Lightyear toys were manufactured compared to Woody toys

most sought after Christmas present Although character sales from the film resulted in million in revenue Marketing Week described it as a toy fiasco for Disney due to the estimated loss of million in
