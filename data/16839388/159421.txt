title: Urination
id: 159421
Urination is the release of urine from the bladder to the outside of the body Urine is released from the urethra through the penis or vulva in placental mammals and through the cloaca in other vertebrates It is the urinary system s form of excretion It is also known medically as micturition voiding uresis or rarely emiction and known colloquially by various names including peeing weeing pissing and euphemistically going for a number one The process of urination is under voluntary control in healthy humans and other animals but may occur as a reflex in infants some elderly individuals and those with neurological injury It is normal for adult humans to urinate up to seven times during the day br In some animals in addition to expelling waste material urination can mark territory or express submissiveness Physiologically urination involves coordination between the central autonomic and somatic nervous systems Brain centres that regulate urination include the pontine micturition center periaqueductal gray and the cerebral cortex br br br Anatomy and physiology br br br Anatomy of the bladder and outlet br br The main organs involved in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra The smooth muscle of the bladder known as the detrusor is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacral spinal cord Fibers in the pelvic nerves constitute the main afferent limb of the voiding reflex the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitute the excitatory efferent limb also travel in these nerves Part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord in an area termed Onuf s nucleus br Smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra and these fibers are sometimes called the internal urethral sphincter although they do not encircle the urethra Further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle the sphincter of the membranous urethra external urethral sphincter The bladder s epithelium is termed transitional epithelium which contains a superficial layer of dome like cells and multiple layers of stratified cuboidal cells underneath when evacuated When the bladder is fully distended the superficial cells become squamous flat and the stratification of the cuboidal cells is reduced in order to provide lateral stretching br br br Physiology br The physiology of micturition and the physiologic basis of its disorders are subjects about which there is much confusion especially at the supraspinal level Micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and like defecation subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition br In healthy individuals the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity the storage or guarding phase when urine is stored in the bladder and the voiding phase when urine is released through the urethra The state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra At low bladder volumes afferent firing is low resulting in excitation of the outlet the sphincter and urethra and relaxation of the bladder At high bladder volumes afferent firing increases causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge Individual ready to urinate consciously initiates voiding causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax Voiding continues until the bladder empties completely at which point the bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re initiate storage The muscles controlling micturition are controlled by the autonomic and somatic nervous systems During the storage phase the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation During micturition parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax The external urethral sphincter sphincter urethrae is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition br In infants voiding occurs involuntarily as a reflex The ability to voluntarily inhibit micturition develops by the age of two three years as control at higher levels of the central nervous system develops In the adult the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about millilitres imp fl oz US fl oz br br br Storage phase br During storage bladder pressure stays low because of the bladder s highly compliant nature A plot of bladder intravesical pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder called a cystometrogram will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled This phenomenon is a manifestation of the law of Laplace which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius In the case of the bladder the tension increases as the organ fills but so does the radius Therefore the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full The bladder s smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity however when its nerve supply is intact stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle br Action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves Since bladder wall stretch is low during the storage phase these afferent neurons fire at low frequencies Low frequency afferent signals cause relaxation of the bladder by inhibiting sacral parasympathetic preganglionic neurons and exciting lumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons Conversely afferent input causes contraction of the sphincter through excitation of Onuf s nucleus and contraction of the bladder neck and urethra through excitation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons br Diuresis production of urine by the kidney occurs constantly and as the bladder becomes full afferent firing increases yet the micturition reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until it is appropriate to begin voiding br br br Voiding phase br Voiding begins when a voluntary signal is sent from the brain to begin urination and continues until the bladder is empty br Bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the periaqueductal gray where they project both to the pontine micturition center and to the cerebrum At a certain level of afferent activity the conscious urge to void or urination urgency becomes difficult to ignore Once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued neurons in the pontine micturition center fire maximally causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons The firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract as a result a sudden sharp rise in intravesical pressure occurs The pontine micturition center also causes inhibition of Onuf s nucleus resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter When the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra The micturition reflex normally produces a series of contractions of the urinary bladder br The flow of urine through the urethra has an overall excitatory role in micturition which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty br Many men and some women may sometimes briefly shiver after or during urination br After urination the female urethra empties partially by gravity with assistance from muscles Urine remaining in the male urethra is expelled by several contractions of the bulbospongiosus muscle and by some men manual squeezing along the length of the penis to expel the rest of the urine br For land mammals over kilogram the duration of urination does not vary with body mass being dispersed around an average of seconds standard deviation seconds despite a order of magnitude difference in bladder volume This is due to increased urethra length of large animals which amplifies gravitational force hence flow rate and increased urethra width which increases flow rate For smaller mammals a different phenomenon occurs where urine is discharged as droplets and urination in smaller mammals such as mice and rats can occur in less than a second The posited benefits of faster voiding are decreased risk of predation while voiding and decreased risk of urinary tract infection br br br Voluntary control br The mechanism by which voluntary urination is initiated remains unsettled One possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of the muscles of the pelvic floor causes a sufficient downward tug on the detrusor muscle to initiate its contraction Another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter br There is an inhibitory area for micturition in the midbrain After transection of the brain stem just above the pons the threshold is lowered and less bladder filling is required to trigger it whereas after transection at the top of the midbrain the threshold for the reflex is essentially normal There is another facilitatory area in the posterior hypothalamus In humans with lesions in the superior frontal gyrus the desire to urinate is reduced and there is also difficulty in stopping micturition once it has commenced However stimulation experiments in animals indicate that other cortical areas also affect the process br The bladder can be made to contract by voluntary facilitation of the spinal voiding reflex when it contains only a few milliliters of urine Voluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles aids the expulsion of urine by increasing the pressure applied to the urinary bladder wall but voiding can be initiated without straining even when the bladder is nearly empty br Voiding can also be consciously interrupted once it has begun through a contraction of the perineal muscles The external sphincter can be contracted voluntarily which will prevent urine from passing down the urethra br br br Experience of urination br The need to urinate is experienced as an uncomfortable full feeling It is highly correlated with the fullness of the bladder In many males the feeling of the need to urinate can be sensed at the base of the penis as well as the bladder even though the neural activity associated with a full bladder comes from the bladder itself and can be felt there as well In females the need to urinate is felt in the lower abdomen region when the bladder is full When the bladder becomes too full the sphincter muscles will involuntarily relax allowing urine to pass from the bladder Release of urine is experienced as a lessening of the discomfort br br br Disorders br br br Clinical conditions br Many clinical conditions can cause disturbances to normal urination including br br Urinary incontinence the inability to hold urine br Stress incontinence incontinence as a result of external mechanical disturbances br Urge incontinence incontinence that occurs as a result of the uncontrollable urge to urinate br Mixed incontinence a combination of the two types of incontinence br Urinary retention the inability to initiate urination br Overactive bladder a strong urge to urinate usually accompanied by detrusor overactivity br Interstitial cystitis a condition characterized by urinary frequency urgency and pain br Prostatitis an inflammation of the prostate gland that can cause urinary frequency urgency and pain br Benign prostatic hyperplasia an enlargement of the prostate that can cause urinary frequency urgency retention and the dribbling of urine br Urinary tract infection which can cause urinary frequency and dysuria br Polyuria abnormally large production of urine associated with in particular diabetes mellitus types and and diabetes insipidus br Oliguria low urine output usually due to a problem with the upper urinary tract br Anuria refers to absent or almost absent urine output br Micturition syncope a vasovagal response which may cause fainting br Paruresis the inability to urinate in the presence of others such as in a public toilet br Bladder sphincter dyssynergia a discoordination between the bladder and external urethral sphincter as a result of brain or spinal cord injury br A drug that increases urination is called a diuretic whereas antidiuretics decrease the production of urine by the kidneys br br br Experimentally induced disorders br br There are three major types of bladder dysfunction due to neural lesions the type due to interruption of the afferent nerves from the bladder the type due to interruption of both afferent and efferent nerves and the type due to interruption of facilitatory and inhibitory pathways descending from the brain In all three types the bladder contracts but the contractions are generally not sufficient to empty the viscus completely and residual urine is left in the bladder Paruresis also known as shy bladder syndrome is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area These people males may have difficulty urinating in the presence of others and will consequently avoid using urinals without dividers or those directly adjacent to another person Alternatively they may opt for the privacy of a stall or simply avoid public toilets altogether br br br Deafferentation br When the sacral dorsal roots are cut in experimental animals or interrupted by diseases of the dorsal roots such as tabes dorsalis in humans all reflex contractions of the bladder are abolished The bladder becomes distended thin walled and hypotonic but there are some contractions because of the intrinsic response of the smooth muscle to stretch br br br Denervation br When the afferent and efferent nerves are both destroyed as they may be by tumors of the cauda equina or filum terminale the bladder is flaccid and distended for a while Gradually however the muscle of the decentralized bladder becomes active with many contraction waves that expel dribbles of urine out of the urethra The bladder becomes shrunken and the bladder wall hypertrophied The reason for the difference between the small hypertrophic bladder seen in this condition and the distended hypotonic bladder seen when only the afferent nerves are interrupted is not known The hyperactive state in the former condition suggests the development of denervation hypersensitization even though the neurons interrupted are preganglionic rather than postganglionic br br br Spinal cord injury br During spinal shock the bladder is flaccid and unresponsive It becomes overfilled and urine dribbles through the sphincters overflow incontinence After spinal shock has passed a spinally mediated voiding reflex ensues although there is no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers Some paraplegic patients train themselves to initiate voiding by pinching or stroking their thighs provoking a mild mass reflex In some instances the voiding reflex becomes hyperactive Bladder capacity is reduced and the wall becomes hypertrophied This type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder The reflex hyperactivity is made worse and may be caused by infection in the bladder wall br br br Techniques br br br Young children br br A common technique used in many developing nations involves holding the child by the backs of the thighs above the ground facing outward in order to urinate br br br Fetal urination br br The fetus urinates hourly and produces most of the amniotic fluid in the second and third trimester of pregnancy The amniotic fluid is then recycled by fetal swallowing br br br Urination after injury br Occasionally if a male s penis is damaged or removed or a female s genitals urinary tract is damaged other urination techniques must be used Most often in such cases doctors will reposition the urethra to a location where urination can still be accomplished usually in a position that would promote urination only while seated squatting though a permanent urinary catheter may be used in rare cases br br br Alternative urination tools br br Sometimes urination is done in a container such as a bottle urinal bedpan or chamber pot also known as a gazunder A container or wearable urine collection device may be used so that the urine can be examined for medical reasons or for a drug test for a bedridden patient when no toilet is available or there is no other possibility to dispose of the urine immediately br An alternative solution for traveling stakeouts etc is a special disposable bag containing absorbent material that solidifies the urine within seconds making it convenient and safe to store and dispose of later br It is possible for both sexes to urinate into bottles in case of emergencies The technique can help children to urinate discreetly inside cars and in other places without being seen by others A female urination device can assist women and girls in urinating while standing or into a bottle br In microgravity excrement tends to float freely so astronauts use a specially designed space toilet which uses suction to collect and recycle urine the space toilet also has a receptacle for defecation br br br Social and cultural aspects br br br Art br A puer mingens is a figure in a work of art depicted as a prepubescent boy in the act of urinating either actual or simulated The puer mingens could represent anything from whimsy and boyish innocence to erotic symbols of virility and masculine bravado br br br Toilet training br br Babies have little socialized control over urination within traditions or families that do not practice elimination communication and instead use diapers Toilet training is the process of learning to restrict urination to socially approved times and situations Consequently young children sometimes develop nocturnal enuresis br br br Facilities br It is socially more accepted and more environmentally hygienic for those who are able especially when indoors and in outdoor urban or suburban areas to urinate in a toilet Public toilets may have urinals usually for males although female urinals exist designed to be used in various ways br br br Urination without facilities br br Acceptability of outdoor urination in a public place other than at a public urinal varies with the situation and with customs Potential disadvantages include a dislike of the smell of urine and exposure of genitals It can be avoided or mitigated by going to a quiet place and or facing a tree or wall if urinating standing up or while squatting hiding the back behind walls bushes or a tree br Portable toilets port a potties are frequently placed in outdoor situations where no immediate facility is available These need to be serviced cleaned out on a regular basis Urination in a heavily wooded area is generally harmless actually saves water and may be condoned for males and less commonly females in certain situations as long as common sense is used Examples depending on circumstances include activities such as camping hiking delivery driving cross country running rural fishing amateur baseball golf etc br The more developed and crowded a place is the more public urination tends to be objectionable In the countryside it is more acceptable than in a street in a town where it may be a common transgression Often this is done after the consumption of alcoholic beverages which causes production of additional urine as well as a reduction of inhibitions One proposed way to inhibit public urination due to drunkenness is the Urilift which is disguised as a normal manhole by day but raises out of the ground at night to provide a public restroom for bar goers br In many places public urination is punishable by fines though attitudes vary widely by country In general females are less likely to urinate in public than males Women and girls unlike men and boys are restricted in where they can urinate conveniently and discreetly br The th century BC historian Herodotus writing on the culture of the ancient Persians and highlighting the differences with those of the Greeks noted that to urinate in the presence of others was prohibited among Persians br There was a popular belief in the UK that it was legal for a man to urinate in public so long as it occurred on the rear wheel of his vehicle and he had his right hand on the vehicle but this is not true Public urination still remains more accepted by males in the UK although British cultural tradition itself seems to find such practices objectionable br In Islamic toilet etiquette it is haram to urinate while facing the Qibla or to turn one s back to it when urinating or relieving bowels but modesty requirements for females make it impossible for girls to relieve themselves without facilities When toilets are unavailable females can relieve themselves in Laos Russia and Mongolia in emergency but it remains less accepted for females in India even when circumstances make this a highly desirable option br Women generally need to urinate more frequently than men but as opposed to the common misconception it is not due to having smaller bladders Resisting the urge to urinate because of lack of facilities can promote urinary tract infections which can lead to more serious infections and in rare situations can cause renal damage in women Female urination devices are available to help women to urinate discreetly as well to help them urinate while standing br br br Sitting standing or squatting br Techniques and body postures while urinating vary across cultures Different anatomical conditions in men and women may presume different postures yet these are largely shaped by cultural norms types of clothing and the sanitary facilities available While sitting toilets are the most common form in Western countries squat toilets are common in Asia Africa and the Arab world Urinals for men are widespread worldwide although women s urinals are available in some countries recently becoming more common in Western countries With the spread of pants among women a standing posture became impractical but in some regions where women wear traditional skirts or robes an upright posture is common br br br Males br br Cultures around the world differ regarding socially accepted voiding positions and preferences in the Middle East and Asia the squatting position was more prevalent while in the Western world the standing and sitting positions were more common For practising Muslim men the genital modesty of squatting is also associated with proper cleanliness requirements or awrah In Western culture the standing position is regarded as the more efficient option among healthy males In restrooms without urinals and sometimes at home men may be urged to use the sitting position as to diminish spattering of urine br Elderly males with prostate gland enlargement may benefit from sitting down to urinate with the seated voiding position found superior as compared with standing in elderly males with benign prostate hyperplasia br br br Females br br In Western culture females usually sit or squat for urination depending on what type of toilet they use a squat toilet is used for urination in a squatting position Women averting contact with a toilet seat may employ a partial squatting position or hovering similar to using a female urinal However this may not completely void the bladder br Females may also urinate while standing and while clothed It is common for women in various regions of Africa to use this position when they urinate as do women in Laos Herodotus described a similar custom in ancient Egypt An alternative method for women voiding while standing is to use a female urination device to assist br br br Talking about urination br In many societies and in many social classes even mentioning the need to urinate is seen as a social transgression despite it being a universal need Many adults avoid stating that they need to urinate br Many expressions exist some euphemistic and some vulgar For example centuries ago the standard English word both noun and verb for the product and the activity was piss but subsequently pee formerly associated with children has become more common in general public speech Since elimination of bodily wastes is of necessity a subject talked about with toddlers during toilet training other expressions considered suitable for use by and with children exist and some continue to be used by adults e g weeing doing having a wee wee to tinkle go potty br Other expressions include squirting and taking a leak and predominantly by younger persons for outdoor female urination popping a squat referring to the position many women adopt in such circumstances National varieties of English show creativity American English uses to whiz Australian English has coined I am off to take a Chinese singing lesson derived from the tinkling sound of urination against the China porcelain of a toilet bowl British English uses going to see my aunt going to see a man about a dog to piddle to splash one s boots as well as to have a slash which originates from the Scottish term for a large splash of liquid One of the most common albeit old fashioned euphemisms in British English is to spend a penny a reference to coin operated pay toilets which used pre decimalisation to charge that sum br br br Use in language br br References to urination are commonly used in slang Usage in English includes br br Piss someone off to anger someone alternatively to leave somewhere in a hurry br Piss off to express contempt see above br Pissing down to refer to heavy rain br Pissing contest an unproductive ego driven battle br Pisshead vulgar way to refer to someone who drinks too much alcohol br Piss ant a worthless person in non slang usage the term refers to several species of ant whose colonies have a urine like odor br Pissing up a flagpole to partake in a futile activity br Pissing into the wind to act in ways that cause self harm br Piss away to squander or use wastefully br Taking the piss to take liberties be unreasonable or to mock another person br Full of piss and vinegar energetic or ambitious late adolescent or young adult male br Piss up British expression for drinking to get drunk br Pissed drunk in British English or angry in American English br br br Urination and sexual activity br br Urolagnia a paraphilia is an inclination to obtain sexual enjoyment by looking at or thinking of urine or urination Urine may be consumed or the person may bathe in it this is known colloquially as a golden shower Drinking urine is known as urophagia though uraphagia refers to the consumption of urine regardless of whether the context is sexual Involuntary urination during sexual intercourse is common but rarely acknowledged In one survey of women reported involuntary urination during sexual intercourse in of patients urination occurred on penetration while in urine leakage was restricted to orgasm br Female kob may exhibit urolagnia during sex one female will urinate while the other sticks her nose in the stream br Some mammals urinate on themselves in order to attract mates during the rut or urinate on other individuals before mating with them A male Patagonian mara a type of rodent will stand on his hind legs and urinate on a female s rump to which the female may respond by spraying a jet of urine backwards into the face of the male The male s urination is meant to repel other males from his partner while the female s urination is a rejection of any approaching male when she is not receptive Both anal digging and urination are more frequent during the breeding season and are more commonly done by males br A male porcupine urinates on a female porcupine prior to mating spraying the urine at high velocity br br br Electric shock injuries and deaths br In in London a person died when they were urinating alongside a railway track at a train station and they received an electric shock The person received the electric shock when their stream of urine connected with the electric current from the live third rail br In in Washington state a person who had died had received burns injuries on their body that were related to receiving an electric shock It is thought that an electric current had traveled through their stream of urine and into their body It is thought that the person had urinated into a roadside ditch and a live wire that was lying in the ditch gave the person an electric shock br In in Spain a person died when they were urinating on a lamp post and they received an electric shock It was reported that an electric current may have traveled through the stream of urine and into the person s body br br br Other species br br While the primary purpose of urination is the same across the animal kingdom urination often serves a social purpose beyond the expulsion of waste material In dogs and other animals urination can mark territory or express submissiveness In small rodents such as rats and mice it marks familiar paths br The urine of animals of differing physiology or sex sometimes has different characteristics For example the urine of birds and reptiles is whitish consisting of a pastelike suspension of uric acid crystals and discharged with the feces of the animal via the cloaca whereas mammals urine is a yellowish colour with mostly urea instead of uric acid and is discharged via the urethra separately from the feces Some animals example carnivores urine possesses a strong odour especially when it is used to mark territory or communicate in other ways br br Felids and canids scent mark their territories using urine Wolves mark their territories by urinating in a raised leg posture and release preputial gland secretions in their urine Male dogs mark their territories with urine more frequently than females br Young cattle can be toilet trained to urinate in a latrine where their urine can be collected for wastewater treatment which could be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the animals urine
