the Dogcatcher br The Mellomen Thurl Ravenscroft Bill Lee Max Smith Bob Hamlin and Bob Stevens as Dog Chorus br Ravenscroft also plays Al the alligator br br br Production br br br Story development br In Walt Disney Productions story artist Joe Grant came up with an idea inspired by the antics of his English Springer Spaniel Lady and how she got shoved aside by Joe s new baby He approached Walt Disney with sketches of Lady Disney enjoyed the sketches and commissioned Grant to start story development on a new animated feature titled Lady Through the late s and early s Joe Grant and other artists worked on the story taking a variety of approaches but Disney was not pleased with any of them primarily because he thought Lady was too sweet and there was not enough action br Walt Disney read the short story written by Ward Greene titled Happy Dan the Cynical Dog in the Cosmopolitan magazine published in He thought that Grant s story would be improved if Lady fell in love with a cynical dog character like the one in Greene s story and bought the rights to it The cynical dog had various names during development including Homer Rags and Bozo before Tramp was chosen br The finished film is slightly different from what was originally planned Lady was to have only one next door neighbor a Ralph Bellamy type canine named Hubert Hubert was later replaced with Jock and Trusty Aunt Sarah was the traditional overbearing mother in law In the final film she is softened to a busybody who though antagonistic towards Lady and Tramp is well meaning she sends a packet of dog biscuits to the dogs at Christmas to apologize for mistreating them Aunt Sarah s Nip and Tuck were later renamed Si and Am Originally Lady s owners were called Jim Brown and Elizabeth These were changed to highlight Lady s point of view They were briefly referred to as Mister and Missis before settling on the names Jim Dear and Darling To maintain a dog s perspective Darling and Jim s faces are rarely shown similar to Tom s various owners in the Tom and Jerry cartoons The rat was a somewhat comic character in early sketches but became a great deal more frightening due to the need to raise dramatic tension A scene created but then deleted was one in which after Trusty says Everybody knows a dog s best friend is his human Tramp describes a world in which the roles of both dogs and humans are switched the dogs are the masters and vice versa There was a love triangle among Lady Tramp and a Russian wolfhound named Boris who appears in the dog pound in the final version br The film s opening sequence in which Darling unwraps a hat box on Christmas morning and finds Lady inside is inspired by an incident when Walt Disney presented his wife Lily with a Chow puppy as a gift in a hat box to make up for having previously forgotten a dinner date with her br In Grant left the studio yet Disney story men were continually pulling Grant s original drawings and story off the shelf to retool A solid story began taking shape in based on Grant s storyboards and Greene s short story Greene later wrote a novelization of the film that was released two years before the film itself at Walt Disney s insistence so that audiences would be familiar with the story Due to Greene s novelization Grant did not receive film credit for his story work an issue that animation director Eric Goldberg hoped to rectify in the Lady and the Tramp Platinum Edition s behind the scenes vignette that explained Grant s role br Singer Peggy Lee not only voiced four characters but co wrote six songs for the film br br br Animation br As they had done with the deer on Bambi the animators studied many dogs of different breeds to capture the movement and personality of dogs Although the spaghetti eating sequence is probably now the best known scene from the film Walt Disney was prepared to cut it thinking that it would not be romantic and that dogs eating spaghetti would look silly Animator Frank Thomas was against Walt s decision and animated the entire scene himself without any lay outs Walt was impressed by Thomas s work and how he romanticized the scene and kept it in On viewing the first take of the scene the animators felt that the action should be slowed down so an apprentice trainee was assigned to create half numbers in between many of the original frames br Originally the background artist was supposed to be Mary Blair and she did some inspirational sketches for the film However she left the studio to become a children s book illustrator in Claude Coats was then appointed as the key background artist Coats made models of the interiors of Jim Dear and Darling s house and shot photos and film at a low perspective as reference to maintain a dog s view Eyvind Earle who later became the art director of Disney s Sleeping Beauty did almost miniature concept sketches for the Bella Notte sequence and was a key contributor to the film br br br CinemaScope br br Originally Lady and the Tramp was planned to be filmed in a regular full frame aspect ratio However due to the growing interest of widescreen film among movie goers Disney decided to animate the film in CinemaScope making Lady and the Tramp the first animated feature filmed in the process This new innovation presented additional problems for the animators the expansion of space created more realism but gave fewer closeups It also made it difficult for a single character to dominate the screen so that groups had to be spread out to keep the screen from appearing sparse Longer takes become necessary since constant jump cutting would seem too busy or annoying Layout artists essentially had to reinvent their technique Animators had to remember that they had to move their characters across a background instead of the background passing behind them Yet the animators overcame these obstacles during the action scenes such as Tramp killing the rat br More problems arose as the premiere date got closer since not all theaters had the capability to show CinemaScope at the time Upon learning this Walt issued two versions of the film one in widescreen and another in the Academy ratio This involved gathering the layout artists to restructure key scenes when characters were on the edges of the screen br br br Release br Lady and the Tramp was originally released to theaters on June An episode of Disneyland called A Story of Dogs aired before the film s release The film was also reissued to theaters in and Lady and the Tramp also played a limited engagement in select Cinemark

part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection line br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br During its initial release the film initially received mixed reviews from critics Bosley Crowther of The New York Times claimed the film was not the best Disney has done in this line The sentimentality is mighty and the CinemaScope size does not make for any less aware of the thickness of the goo It also magnifies the animation so that the flaws and poor foreshortening are more plain Unfortunately and surprisingly the artists work is below par in this film Time wrote Walt Disney has for so long parlayed gooey sentiment and stark horror into profitable cartoons that most moviegoers are apt to be more surprised than disappointed to discover that the combination somehow does not work this time However Variety deemed the film a delight for the juveniles and a joy for adults Harrison s Reports felt the scintillating musical score and several songs the dialogue and the voices the behaviors and expressions of the different characters the mellow turn of the century backgrounds the beautiful color and sweep of the CinemaScope process all these add up to the one of the most enjoyable cartoon features Disney has ever made Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times described the film as a delightful haunting charmed fantasy that is remarkably enriched with music and incidentally with rare conversations among the canine characters br br However the film has since gone on to become regarded as a classic Both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review on their show At the Movies when re released in with Ebert in particular praising the opening scene of Lady as a puppy calling it one of the greatest animated sequences Disney ever did Dave Kehr writing for The Chicago Tribune gave the film four stars Animation historian Charles Solomon praised the film The sequence of Lady and Tramp sharing a plate of spaghetti climaxed by an accidental kiss as they swallow opposite ends of the same strand of spaghetti is considered an iconic scene in American film history The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received a approval rating with an average rating of based on reviews The website s consensus states A nostalgic charmer Lady and the Tramp s token sweetness is mighty but the songs and richly colored animation are technically
