sing for Tetti Tatti He finds them and upon hearing Willie sing Tetti Tatti comes to believe that Willie has swallowed not one but three singers due to his having three uvulas each with a different voice range tenor baritone and bass and chases him with a harpoon on a boat with three crewmen Upon hearing the whale sing the crewmen try to stop the stubborn and deluded Tetti Tatti from killing the whale as they want to continue listening to him sing even to the point of pinning Tetti Tatti down by sitting on him A montage then follows of what would be Willie s future career in performing opera on the stage of the Met with Tetti Tatti shown to have finally been convinced In the end reality strikes when Tetti Tatti succeeds in harpooning and killing Willie which causes the three sailors to beat him up afterwards but the narrator then explains that Willie s voice now in a thousand each more golden than before will sing on in heaven ironically still achieving his dream after all the final

feature two years in the making may command widest attention yet The blend of cartoon with human action has been evidenced before here Disney has retained all his characters in their basic art form but endowed them with human qualities voices and treatments which is another step forward in the field where cartoons graduate into the field of the classics Harrison s Reports felt that some of the shorts were more entertaining than others but all are good and each has something to please movie goers of all tastes and ages It is a delightful blend of comedy music pathos animation and color given a most imaginative treatment br Bosley Crowther reviewing for The New York Times praised the film as a brilliant abstraction wherein fanciful musical instruments dance gayly on sliding color disks sets of romping fingers race blithely down tapes of piano keys and musical notes fly wildly through the multi hued atmosphere all to the tingling accompaniment of Benny Goodman s quartet playing the ancient and melodious torch song After You re Gone Color form and music blend dynamically in this bit and a rich stimulant of sensuous rhythm is excitingly achieved Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Make Mine Music was a picture of much inventiveness and imagination The lighter the picture is the more is its excellence demonstrated it might be noted And while music is the keynote of the production it ranges well into comedy and plentifully into swing br The film holds rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of The site s critical consensus reads This collection of musical themed shorts doesn t reach the artistic heights of Fantasia but it s well animated and mostly good fun br br br See also br in film br List of American films of br List of Walt Disney
