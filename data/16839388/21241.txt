NATO the European Free Trade Association the Council of Europe the Antarctic Treaty and the Nordic Council a member of the European Economic Area the WTO and the OECD and a part of the Schengen Area The Norwegian dialects share mutual intelligibility with Danish and Swedish br Norway maintains the Nordic welfare model with universal health care and a comprehensive social security system and its values are rooted in egalitarian ideals The Norwegian state has large ownership positions in key industrial sectors having extensive reserves of petroleum natural gas minerals lumber seafood and fresh water The petroleum industry accounts for around a quarter of the country s gross domestic product GDP On a per capita basis Norway is the world s largest producer of oil and natural gas outside of the Middle East The country has the fourth and eighth highest per capita income in the world on the World Bank s and IMF s list respectively It has the world s largest sovereign wealth fund with a value of US trillion br br br Etymology br br Norway has two official names Norge in Bokm l and Noreg in Nynorsk The English name Norway comes from the Old English word Nor weg mentioned in meaning northern way or way leading to the north which is how the Anglo Saxons referred to the coastline of Atlantic Norway The Anglo Saxons of Britain also referred to the kingdom of Norway in as Nor manna land br There is some disagreement about whether the native name of Norway originally had the same etymology as the English form According to the traditional dominant view the first component was originally nor r a cognate of English north so the full name was Nor r vegr the way northwards referring to the sailing route along the Norwegian coast and contrasting with su rvegar southern way from Old Norse su r for Germany and austrvegr eastern way from austr for the Baltic br br br History br br br Prehistory br br The earliest traces of human occupation in Norway are found along the coast where the huge ice shelf of the last ice age first melted between and BC The oldest finds are stone tools dating from to BC discovered in Finnmark Komsa culture in the north and Rogaland Fosna culture in the southwest Theories about the two cultures being separate were deemed obsolete in the s br Between and BC new settlers Corded Ware culture arrived in eastern Norway They were Indo European farmers who grew grain and kept livestock and gradually replaced the hunting fishing population of the west coast br br br Metal Ages br br From about BC bronze was gradually introduced Burial cairns built close to the sea as far north as Harstad and also inland in the south are characteristic of this period with rock carving motifs that differ from those of the Stone Age depicting ships resembling the Hjortspring boat while large stone burial monuments known as stone ships were also erected br There is little archaeological evidence dating to the early Iron Age the last years BC The dead were cremated and their graves contained few goods During the first four centuries AD the people of Norway were in contact with Roman occupied Gaul about Roman bronze cauldrons often used as burial urns have been found Contact with countries farther south brought a knowledge of runes the oldest known Norwegian runic inscription dates from the third century br br br Viking Age br br By the time of the first historical records of Scandinavia about the th century several small political entities existed in Norway It has been estimated that there were nine petty realms in Western Norway during the early Viking Age Archaeologist Bergljot Solberg on this basis estimates that there would have been at least in the whole country br In the Viking period Norwegian Viking explorers discovered Iceland by accident in the ninth century when heading for the Faroe Islands and eventually came across Vinland known today as Newfoundland in Canada The Vikings from Norway were most active in the northern and western British Isles and eastern North America isles br br According to tradition Harald Fairhair unified them into one in after the Battle of Hafrsfjord in Stavanger thus becoming the first king of a united Norway Harald s realm was mainly a South Norwegian coastal state Fairhair ruled with a strong hand and according to the sagas many Norwegians left the country to live in Iceland the Faroe Islands Greenland and parts of Britain and Ireland br Haakon I the Good was Norway s first Christian king in the mid th century though his attempt to introduce the religion was rejected Norse traditions were replaced slowly by Christian ones in the late th and early th centuries This is largely attributed to the missionary kings Olaf I Tryggvasson and Olaf II Haraldsson St Olaf Olaf Tryggvasson conducted raids in England including attacking London Arriving back in Norway in Olaf landed in Moster where he built a church which became the first Christian church in Norway From Moster Olaf sailed north to Trondheim where he was proclaimed King of Norway by the Eyrathing in One of the most important sources for the history of the th century Vikings is the treaty between the Icelanders and Olaf II Haraldsson king of Norway circa to br Feudalism never really developed in Norway or Sweden as it did in the rest of Europe However the administration of government took on a very conservative feudal character The Hanseatic League forced royalty to cede to them greater and greater concessions over foreign trade and the economy because of the loans the Hansa had made to the royals and the large debt the kings were carrying The League s monopolistic control over the economy of Norway put pressure on all classes especially the peasantry to the degree that no real burgher class existed in Norway br br br High Middle Ages br br From the s to the country was at peace In the civil war era broke out on the basis of unclear succession laws which allowed the king s sons to rule jointly The Archdiocese of Nidaros was created in and attempted to control the appointment of kings The church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts The wars ended in with the appointment of H kon IV H konsson who introduced clear laws of succession br From to the population increased from to resulting both in more land being cleared and the subdivision of farms While in the Viking Age farmers owned their own land by seventy per cent of the land was owned by the king the church or the aristocracy and about twenty per cent of yields went to these landowners br The th century is described as Norway s golden age with peace and increase in trade especially with the British Islands although Germany became increasingly important towards the end of the century Throughout the High Middle Ages the king established Norway as a sovereign state with a central administration and local representatives br In the Black Death spread to Norway and within a year killed a third of the population Later plagues reduced the population to half the starting point by Many communities were entirely wiped out resulting in an abundance of land allowing farmers to switch to more animal husbandry The reduction in taxes weakened the king s position and many aristocrats lost the basis for their surplus High tithes to church made it increasingly powerful and the archbishop became a member of the Council of State br br The Hanseatic League took control over Norwegian trade during the th century and established a trading centre in Bergen In Olaf Haakonsson inherited both the Norwegian as Olaf IV and Danish thrones as Olaf II creating a union between the two countries In under Margaret I the Kalmar Union was created between the three Scandinavian countries She waged war against the Germans resulting in a trade blockade and higher taxation on Norwegian goods which led to a rebellion However the Norwegian Council of State was too weak to pull out of the union br Margaret pursued a centralising policy which inevitably favoured Denmark because of its greater population Margaret also granted trade privileges to the Hanseatic merchants of L beck in Bergen in return for recognition of her rule and these hurt the Norwegian economy The Hanseatic merchants formed a state within a state in Bergen for generations The Victual Brothers launched three devastating pirate raids on the port the last in br Norway slipped ever more to the background under the Oldenburg dynasty established There was one revolt under Knut Alvsson in Norway took no part in the events which led to Swedish independence from Denmark in the s br br br Kalmar Union br br Upon the death of King Haakon V in Magnus Erikson at just three years old inherited the throne as King Magnus VII A simultaneous movement to make Magnus King of Sweden proved successful he was a grandson of King Magnus III of Sweden and both the kings of Sweden and of Denmark were elected to the throne by their respective nobles Thus Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus VII br In the Black Death killed between and of Norway s population and led to a period of social and economic decline Although the death rate was comparable with the rest of Europe economic recovery took much longer because of the small scattered population Even before the plague the population was only about After the plague many farms lay idle while the population slowly increased However the few surviving farms tenants found their bargaining positions with their landlords greatly strengthened br br King Magnus VII ruled Norway until when his son Haakon was placed on the throne as Haakon VI In Haakon married Margaret daughter of King Valdemar IV of Denmark Upon the death of Haakon in his year old son Olaf IV acceded to the throne As Olaf had already been elected to the throne of Denmark in Denmark and Norway entered a personal union Olaf s mother and Haakon s widow Queen Margaret managed the foreign affairs of Denmark and Norway during Olaf s minority br Margaret was on the verge of achieving a union of Sweden with Denmark and Norway when Olaf IV suddenly died Denmark made Margaret temporary ruler on the death of Olaf On February Norway followed suit and crowned Margaret Queen Margaret knew that her power would be more secure if she were able to find a king to rule in her place She settled on Eric of Pomerania grandson of her sister Thus at an all Scandinavian meeting held at Kalmar Erik of Pomerania was crowned king of all three Scandinavian countries bringing the thrones of Norway Denmark and Sweden under the control of Queen Margaret when the country entered into the Kalmar Union br br br Early modern period br br After Sweden broke out of the Kalmar Union in Norway tried to follow suit but the subsequent rebellion was defeated and Norway remained in a union with Denmark until This period was by some referred to as the Year Night since all of the kingdom s intellectual and administrative power was centred in Copenhagen br br With the introduction of Protestantism in the archbishopric in Trondheim was dissolved Norway lost its independence and effectually became a colony of Denmark The Church s incomes and possessions were instead redirected to the court in Copenhagen Norway lost the steady stream of pilgrims to the relics of St Olav at the Nidaros shrine and with them much of the contact with cultural and economic life in the rest of Europe br Eventually restored as a kingdom albeit in legislative union with Denmark in Norway saw its land area decrease in the th century with the loss of the provinces B huslen Jemtland and Herjedalen to Sweden as the result of a number of disastrous wars with Sweden In the north its territory was increased by the acquisition of the northern provinces of Troms and Finnmark at the expense of Sweden and Russia br The famine of killed roughly of Norway s population The harvest failed in Scandinavia at least nine times between and with great loss of life br br br Later modern period br br After Denmark Norway was attacked by the United Kingdom at the Battle of Copenhagen it entered into an alliance with Napoleon with the war leading to dire conditions and mass starvation in As the Danish kingdom was on the losing side in it was forced by the Treaty of Kiel to cede Norway to Sweden while the old Norwegian provinces of Iceland Greenland and the Faroe Islands remained with the Danish crown Norway took this opportunity to declare independence adopted a constitution based on American and French models and elected the Crown Prince of Denmark and Norway Christian Frederick as king on May celebrated as the Syttende mai Seventeenth of May holiday br Norwegian opposition to the decision to link Norway with Sweden caused the Norwegian Swedish War to break out as Sweden tried to subdue Norway by military means As Sweden s military was not strong enough to defeat the Norwegian forces outright and Norway s treasury was not large enough to support a protracted war and as British and Russian navies blockaded the Norwegian coast the belligerents were forced to negotiate the Convention of Moss Christian Frederik abdicated the Norwegian throne and authorised the Parliament of Norway to make the necessary constitutional amendments to allow for the personal union that Norway was forced to accept On November the Parliament Storting elected Charles XIII of Sweden as king of Norway thereby establishing the union with Sweden Under this arrangement Norway kept its liberal constitution and its own independent institutions though it shared a monarch and foreign policy with Sweden Following the recession caused by the Napoleonic Wars economic development of Norway remained slow until br br This period also saw the rise of Norwegian romantic nationalism as Norwegians sought to define and express a distinct national character The movement covered all branches of culture including literature Henrik Wergeland Bj rnstjerne Bj rnson Peter Christen Asbj rnsen J rgen Moe painting Hans Gude Adolph Tidemand music Edvard Grieg and even language policy where attempts to define a native written language for Norway led to today s two official written forms for Norwegian Bokm l and Nynorsk br King Charles III John came to the throne of Norway and Sweden in and reigned to He protected the constitution and liberties of Norway and Sweden during the age of Metternich As such he was regarded as a liberal monarch However he was ruthless in his use of paid informers secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press to put down public movements for reform especially the Norwegian national independence movement br The Romantic Era that followed the reign of Charles III John brought some significant social and political reforms In women won the right to inherit property In the last trace of keeping unmarried women in the status of minors was removed Furthermore women were eligible for different occupations particularly the common school teacher By mid century Norway s democracy was limited voting was limited to officials property owners leaseholders and burghers of incorporated towns br br Norway remained a conservative society Life in Norway especially economic life was dominated by the aristocracy of professional men who filled most of the important posts in the central government There was no strong bourgeois class to demand a breakdown of this aristocratic control Thus even while revolution swept over most of the countries of Europe in Norway was largely unaffected br Marcus Thrane was a Utopian socialist who in organised a labour society in Drammen In just a few months this society had a membership of and was publishing its own newspaper Within two years societies had been organised all over Norway with a total membership of drawn from the lower classes of both urban and rural areas In the end the revolt was easily crushed Thrane was captured and jailed br In all men were granted universal suffrage followed by all women in br br br Dissolution of the union and the First World War br br Christian Michelsen Prime Minister of Norway from to played a central role in the peaceful separation of Norway from Sweden on June A national referendum confirmed the people s preference for a monarchy over a republic However no Norwegian could legitimately claim the throne since none of Norway s noble families could claim royal descent br The government then offered the throne of Norway to Prince Carl of Denmark a prince of the Dano German royal house of Schleswig Holstein Sonderburg Gl cksburg and a distant relative of Norway s medieval kings Following the plebiscite he was unanimously elected king by the Norwegian Parliament he took the name Haakon VII br Throughout the First World War Norway remained neutral however diplomatic pressure from the British government meant that it heavily favoured the Allies During the war Norway exported fish to both Germany and Britain until an ultimatum from the British government and anti German sentiments as a result of German submarines targeting Norwegian merchantmen led to a termination of trade with Germany Norwegian merchantmen were sunk by the Kaiserliche Marine with Norwegian sailors killed br br br Second World War br br Norway once more proclaimed its neutrality during the Second World War but was invaded by German forces on April Although Norway was unprepared for the German surprise attack see Battle of Dr bak Sound Norwegian Campaign and Invasion of Norway military and naval resistance lasted for two months Norwegian armed forces in the north launched an offensive against the German forces in the Battles of Narvik but were forced to surrender on June after losing British support which had been diverted to France during the German invasion of France br br King Haakon and the Norwegian government escaped to Rotherhithe in London Throughout the war they sent radio speeches and supported clandestine military actions against the Germans On the day of the invasion the leader of the small National Socialist party Nasjonal Samling Vidkun Quisling tried to seize power but was forced by the German occupiers to step aside Real power was wielded by the leader of the German occupation authority Josef Terboven Quisling as minister president later formed a collaborationist government under German control Up to Norwegians volunteered to fight in German units including the Waffen SS br Many Norwegians and persons of Norwegian descent joined the Allied forces as well as the Free Norwegian Forces In June a small group had left Norway following their king to Britain This group included ships five aircraft and men from the Royal Norwegian Navy By the end of the war the force had grown to ships and men in service in the Royal Norwegian Navy squadrons of aircraft in the newly formed Norwegian Air Force and land forces including the Norwegian Independent Company and Troop as well as No Commandos br During German occupation Norwegians built a resistance movement which incorporated civil disobedience and armed resistance including the destruction of Norsk Hydro s heavy water plant and stockpile of heavy water at Vemork which crippled the German nuclear programme More important to the Allied war effort however was the role of the Norwegian Merchant Marine the fourth largest merchant marine fleet in the world It was led by the Norwegian shipping company Nortraship under the Allies throughout the war and took part in every war operation from the evacuation of Dunkirk to the Normandy landings Every December Norway gives a Christmas tree to the United Kingdom as thanks for the British assistance during the war br Svalbard was not occupied by German troops but Germany secretly established a meteorological station there in br br br Post World War II history br From to the Labour Party held an absolute majority in the parliament The government led by prime minister Einar Gerhardsen embarked on a programme inspired by Keynesian economics emphasising state financed industrialisation and co operation between trade unions and employers organisations Many measures of state control of the economy imposed during the war were continued although the rationing of dairy products was lifted in while price controls and rationing of housing and cars continued until br br The wartime alliance with the United Kingdom and the United States continued in the post war years Although pursuing the goal of a socialist economy the Labour Party distanced itself from the Communists especially after the Communists seizure of power in Czechoslovakia in and strengthened its foreign policy and defence policy ties with the US Norway received Marshall Plan aid from the United States starting in joined the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD one year later and became a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO in br Oil was discovered at the small Balder field in but production only began in In the Phillips Petroleum Company discovered petroleum resources at the Ekofisk field west of Norway In the Norwegian government founded the State oil company Statoil now Equinor Oil production did not provide net income until the early s because of the large capital investment required Around both the proportion and absolute number of workers in industry peaked Since then labour intensive industries and services like factory mass production and shipping have largely been outsourced br Norway was a founding member of the European Free Trade Association EFTA Norway was twice invited to join the European Union but ultimately declined after referendums that failed by narrow margins in and br br In a Conservative Party government led by K re Willoch replaced the Labour Party with a policy of stimulating the stagflated economy with tax cuts economic liberalisation deregulation of markets and measures to curb record high inflation in br Norway s first female prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of the Labour Party continued many of the reforms while backing traditional Labour concerns such as social security high taxes the industrialisation of nature and feminism By the late s Norway had paid off its foreign debt and had started accumulating a sovereign wealth fund Since the s a divisive question in politics has been how much of the income from petroleum production the government should spend and how much it should save br In Norway suffered two terrorist attacks by Anders Behring Breivik which struck the government quarter in Oslo and a summer camp of the Labour party s youth movement at Ut ya island resulting in deaths and wounded br Jens Stoltenberg led Norway as prime minister for eight years from to The Norwegian parliamentary election brought a more conservative government to power with the Conservative Party and the Progress Party winning of the electorate s votes In the Norwegian parliamentary election the centre right government of Prime Minister Erna Solberg won re election The Norwegian parliamentary election saw a big win for the left wing opposition in an election fought on climate change inequality and oil Labour leader Jonas Gahr St re was sworn in as prime minister br br br Geography br br Norway s core territory comprises the western and northernmost portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula the remote island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard are also included The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom Norway also claims a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land Norwegian possessions in the North Atlantic Faroe Islands Greenland and Iceland remained Danish when Norway was passed to Sweden at the Treaty of Kiel Norway also comprised Bohusl n until J mtland and H rjedalen until Shetland and Orkney until and the Hebrides and Isle of Man until the Treaty of Perth in br Norway comprises the western and northernmost part of Scandinavia in Northern Europe between latitudes and N and longitudes and E Norway is the northernmost of the Nordic countries and if Svalbard is included also the easternmost Norway includes the northernmost point on the European mainland The rugged coastline is broken by huge fjords and thousands of islands The coastal baseline is kilometres mi The coastline of the mainland including fjords stretches kilometres mi when islands are included the coastline has been estimated to kilometres mi Norway shares a kilometre mi land border with Sweden kilometres mi with Finland and kilometres mi with Russia to the east To the north west and south Norway is bordered by the Barents Sea the Norwegian Sea the North Sea and Skagerrak The Scandinavian Mountains form much of the border with Sweden br At square kilometres sq mi including Svalbard and Jan Mayen square kilometres sq mi without much of the country is dominated by mountainous or high terrain with a great variety of natural features caused by prehistoric glaciers and varied topography The most noticeable of these are the fjords Sognefjorden is the world s second deepest fjord and the world s longest at kilometres mi Hornindalsvatnet is the deepest lake in Europe Norway has about lakes and registered islands Permafrost can be found all year in the higher mountain areas and in the interior of Finnmark county Numerous glaciers are found in Norway The land is mostly made of hard granite and gneiss rock but slate sandstone and limestone are also common and the lowest elevations contain marine deposits br br br Climate br br Because of the Gulf Stream and prevailing westerlies Norway experiences higher temperatures and more precipitation than expected at such northern latitudes especially along the coast The mainland experiences four distinct seasons with colder winters and less precipitation inland The northernmost part has a mostly maritime Subarctic climate while Svalbard has an Arctic tundra climate The southern and western parts of Norway fully exposed to Atlantic storm fronts experience more precipitation and have milder winters than the eastern and far northern parts Areas to the east of the coastal mountains are in a rain shadow and have lower rain and snow totals than the west The lowlands around Oslo have the warmest summers but also cold weather and snow in wintertime The sunniest weather is along the south coast but sometimes even the coast far north can be very sunny the sunniest month with sun hours was recorded in Troms br Because of Norway s high latitude there are large seasonal variations in daylight From late May to late July the sun never completely descends beneath the horizon in areas north of the Arctic Circle and the rest of the country experiences up to hours of daylight per day Conversely from late November to late January the sun never rises above the horizon in the north and daylight hours are very short in the rest of the country br Temperature anomalies found in coastal locations are exceptional with southern Lofoten and B having all monthly means above freezing in spite of being north of the Arctic Circle The very northernmost coast of Norway would be ice covered in winter if not for the Gulf Stream The east of the country has a more continental climate and the mountain ranges have subarctic and tundra climates There is also higher rainfall in areas exposed to the Atlantic especially the western slopes of the mountain ranges and areas close such as Bergen The valleys east of the mountain ranges are the driest some of the valleys are sheltered by mountains in most directions Saltdal m in Nordland is the driest place with millimetres inches precipitation annually In southern Norway Skj k in Innlandet get millimetres inches precipitation Finnmarksvidda and some interior valleys of Troms receive around millimetres inches annually and the high Arctic Longyearbyen millimetres inches br Parts of southeastern Norway including parts of Mj sa have a humid continental climate K ppen Dfb the southern and western coasts and also the coast north to Bod have an oceanic climate Cfb and the outer coast further north almost to North Cape has a subpolar oceanic climate Cfc Further inland in the south and at higher altitudes and also in much of Northern Norway the subarctic climate Dfc dominates A small strip of land along the coast east of North Cape including Vard earlier had tundra alpine polar climate ET but this is mostly gone with the updated climate normals making this also subarctic Large parts of Norway are covered by mountains and high altitude plateaus and about one third of the land is above the treeline and thus exhibit tundra alpine polar climate ET br br br Biodiversity br br Norway has a larger number of different habitats than almost any other European country There are approximately species in Norway and adjacent waters excluding bacteria and viruses The Norwegian Shelf large marine ecosystem is considered highly productive The total number of species include species of insects probably more species yet to be described species of algae species of lichen species of mosses species of vascular plants up to species of fungi species of birds species nesting in Norway species of mammals fresh water species of fish salt water species of fish species of fresh water invertebrates and species of salt water invertebrates About of these species have been described by science The red list of encompasses species Norway contains five terrestrial ecoregions Sarmatic mixed forests Scandinavian coastal conifer forests Scandinavian and Russian taiga Kola Peninsula tundra and Scandinavian montane birch forest and grasslands br Seventeen species are listed mainly because they are endangered on a global scale such as the European beaver even if the population in Norway is not seen as endangered The number of threatened and near threatened species equals to it includes fungi species many of which are closely associated with the small remaining old growth forests bird species and species of mammals In species were listed as endangered or vulnerable of these were listed as vulnerable VU as endangered EN and species as critically endangered CR among which were the grey wolf the Arctic fox and the pool frog br The largest predator in Norwegian waters is the sperm whale and the largest fish is the basking shark The largest predator on land is the polar bear while the brown bear is the largest predator on the Norwegian mainland The largest land animal on the mainland is the elk American English moose br br br Environment br Attractive and dramatic scenery and landscape are found throughout Norway The west coast of southern Norway and the coast of northern Norway present some of the most visually impressive coastal sceneries in the world National Geographic has listed the Norwegian fjords as the world s top tourist attraction The country is also home to the natural phenomena of the Midnight sun during summer as well as the Aurora borealis known also as the Northern lights br The Environmental Performance Index from Yale University Columbia University and the World Economic Forum put Norway in seventeenth place immediately below Croatia and Switzerland The index is based on environmental risks to human health habitat loss and changes in CO emissions The index notes over exploitation of fisheries but not Norway s whaling or oil exports Norway had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of ranking it th globally out of countries br br br Politics and government br br Norway is considered to be one of the most developed democracies and states of justice in the world Since Norway has been classified as the world s most democratic country by the Democracy Index br According to the Constitution of Norway which was adopted on May and was inspired by the United States Declaration of Independence and French Revolution Norway is a unitary constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government wherein the King of Norway is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government Power is separated among the legislative executive and judicial branches of government as defined by the Constitution which serves as the country s supreme legal document br The monarch officially retains executive power But following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government the duties of the monarch became strictly representative and ceremonial The Monarch is commander in chief of the Norwegian Armed Forces and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad and as a symbol of unity Harald V of the House of Schleswig Holstein Sonderburg Gl cksburg ascended to the Norwegian throne in the first since the th century who has been born in the country Haakon Crown Prince of Norway is the heir to the throne br In practice the Prime Minister exercises the executive powers Constitutionally legislative power is vested with both the government and the Parliament of Norway but the latter is the supreme legislature and a unicameral body Norway is fundamentally structured as a representative democracy The Parliament can pass a law by simple majority of the representatives of which are elected directly from constituencies and an additional seats levelling seats are allocated on a nationwide basis to make the representation in parliament correspond better with the popular vote for the political parties A election threshold is required for a party to gain levelling seats in Parliament br The Parliament of Norway called the Storting ratifies national treaties developed by the executive branch It can impeach members of the government if their acts are declared unconstitutional If an indicted suspect is impeached Parliament has the power to remove the person from office br The position of prime minister is allocated to the member of Parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in Parliament usually the current leader of the largest political party or more effectively through a coalition of parties Norway has often been ruled by minority governments The prime minister nominates the cabinet traditionally drawn from members of the same political party or parties in the Storting making up the government The PM organises the executive government and exercises its power as vested by the Constitution br Norway has a state church the Lutheran Church of Norway which has gradually been granted more internal autonomy in day to day affairs but which still has a special constitutional status Formerly the PM had to have more than half the members of cabinet be members of the Church of Norway this rule was removed in The issue of separation of church and state in Norway has been increasingly controversial A part of this is the evolution of the public school subject Christianity a required subject since Even the state s loss in a battle at the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg in did not settle the matter As of January the Church of Norway is a separate legal entity and no longer a branch of the civil service br Through the Council of State a privy council presided over by the monarch the prime minister and the cabinet meet at the Royal Palace and formally consult the Monarch All government bills need formal approval by the monarch before and after introduction to Parliament The Council approves all of the monarch s actions as head of state br Members of the Storting are directly elected from party list proportional representation in nineteen plural member constituencies in a national multi party system Historically both the Norwegian Labour Party and Conservative Party have played leading political roles In the early st century the Labour Party has been in power since the election in a Red Green Coalition with the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party Since both the Conservative Party and the Progress Party have won numerous seats in the Parliament br In national elections in September two political parties H yre and Fremskrittspartiet were elected on promises of tax cuts more spending on infrastructure and education better services and stricter rules on immigration formed a government Erna Solberg became prime minister the second female prime minister after Gro Harlem Brundtland and the first conservative prime minister since Jan P Syse Solberg said her win was a historic election victory for the right wing parties Her centre right government won re election in the Norwegian parliamentary election Norway s new centre left cabinet under Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St re the leader the Labour Party took office on October br br br Administrative divisions br br Norway a unitary state is divided into fifteen first level administrative counties fylke The counties are administered through directly elected county assemblies who elect the County Governor Additionally the King and government are represented in every county by a fylkesmann who effectively acts as a Governor The counties are then sub divided into second level municipalities kommuner which in turn are administered by directly elected municipal council headed by a mayor and a small executive cabinet The capital of Oslo is considered both a county and a municipality Norway has two integral overseas territories out of mainland Jan Mayen and Svalbard the only developed island in the archipelago of the same name located far to the north of the Norwegian mainland br settlements have city status in Norway In most cases the city borders are coterminous with the borders of their respective municipalities Often Norwegian city municipalities include large areas that are not developed br br br Dependencies of Norway br br There are three Antarctic and Subantarctic dependencies Bouvet Island Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land On most maps there was an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land and the South Pole until June when Norway formally annexed that area br br br Largest populated areas br br br Judicial system and law enforcement br br Norway uses a civil law system where laws are created and amended in Parliament and the system regulated through the Courts of justice of Norway It consists of the Supreme Court of permanent judges and a Chief Justice appellate courts city and district courts and conciliation councils The judiciary is independent of executive and legislative branches While the Prime Minister nominates Supreme Court Justices for office their nomination must be approved by Parliament and formally confirmed by the Monarch Usually judges attached to regular courts are formally appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister br The Courts formal mission is to regulate the Norwegian judicial system interpret the Constitution and implement the legislation adopted by Parliament In its judicial reviews it monitors the legislative and executive branches to ensure that they comply with provisions of enacted legislation br The law is enforced in Norway by the Norwegian Police Service It is a Unified National Police Service made up of Police Districts and several specialist agencies such as Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime known as kokrim and the National Criminal Investigation Service known as Kripos each headed by a chief of police The Police Service is headed by the National Police Directorate which reports to the Ministry of Justice and the Police The Police Directorate is headed by a National Police Commissioner The only exception is the Norwegian Police Security Agency whose head answers directly to the Ministry of Justice and the Police br Norway abolished the death penalty for regular criminal acts in and for high treason in war and war crimes in Norwegian prisons are humane rather than tough with emphasis on rehabilitation At Norway s re conviction rate is among the lowest in the world br Reporters Without Borders in its World Press Freedom Index ranked Norway in first place out of countries In general the legal and institutional framework in Norway is characterised by a high degree of transparency accountability and integrity and the perception and the occurrence of corruption are very low br br br Human rights br br Norway has been considered a progressive country which has adopted legislation and policies to support women s rights minority rights and LGBT rights As early as of the leading figures among them five Prime Ministers co founded the Norwegian Association for Women s Rights They successfully campaigned for women s right to education women s suffrage the right to work and other gender equality policies From the s gender equality also came high on the state agenda with the establishment of a public body to promote gender equality which evolved into the Gender Equality and Anti Discrimination Ombud Civil society organisations also continue to play an important role women s rights organisations are today organised in the Norwegian Women s Lobby umbrella organisation br In the Norwegian constitution was amended to grant absolute primogeniture to the Norwegian throne meaning that the eldest child regardless of gender takes precedence in the line of succession As it was not retroactive the current successor to the throne is the eldest son of the King rather than his eldest child br br The S mi people have for centuries been the subject of discrimination and abuse by the dominant cultures in Scandinavia and Russia those countries claiming possession of S mi lands Norway has been greatly criticised by the international community for the politics of Norwegianization of and discrimination against the indigenous population of the country Nevertheless Norway was in the first country to recognise ILO convention on indigenous people recommended by the UN br Norway was the first country in the world to enact an anti discrimination law protecting the rights of gay men and lesbians In Norway became the second country to legalise civil union partnerships for same sex couples and on January Norway became the sixth country to legalise
