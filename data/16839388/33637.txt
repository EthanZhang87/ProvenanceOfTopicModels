Wasabi Japanese or pronounced wa sabi or Japanese horseradish Eutrema japonicum syn Wasabia japonica is a plant of the family Brassicaceae which also includes horseradish and mustard in other genera The plant is native to Japan and the Russian Far East including Sakhalin as well as the Korean Peninsula It grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan br It is grown for its rhizomes which are ground into a paste as a pungent condiment for sushi and other foods It is similar in taste to hot mustard or horseradish rather than chilli peppers in that it stimulates the nose more than the tongue but freshly grated wasabi has a subtly distinct flavour The two main cultivars in the marketplace are E japonicum Daruma and Mazuma but there are many others br The oldest record of wasabi as a food dates to the th century AD The popularity of wasabi in English speaking countries has coincided with that of sushi growing steadily starting in about Due to constraints that limit the Japanese wasabi plant s mass cultivation and thus increase its price and decrease availability outside Japan the western horseradish plant is widely used in place of the Japanese wasabi This version is commonly referred to as western wasabi in Japan br br br Taxonomy br br Siebold named Cochlearia wasabi in noting its use pro condimento or as a condiment however this is a nomen nudum and the synonym Eutrema wasabi published by Maximovich in is thus an illegitimate name The wasabi plant was first described by Miquel in as Lunaria japonica from the type collected by Siebold in Japan though the precise type locality was not recorded br In Matsumura erected the genus Wasabia recognising within it the species Wasabia pungens and Wasabia hederaefolia these are now regarded as synonyms of Eutrema japonicum In Matsumura recognised the species Wasabia japonica treating his earlier Wasabia pungens as a synonym In Koidzumi transferred the wasabi plant to the genus Eutrema the correct name and author citation being Eutrema japonicum Miq Koidz br br br Description br It has large leaves produced from long thin stalks They are simple and large inches cm long and inches cm wide with palmate veins br Wasabi flowers appear in clusters from long stems that bloom from late winter to early spring br br br Culinary uses br br br As condiment br Wasabi is mainly used to make wasabi paste which is a pungent spicy condiment eaten with foods like sushi The part used for wasabi paste has been characterized as the rhizome or the stem or the rhizome plus the base part of the stem Stores generally sell only this part of the plant br The fresh rhizome is grated into a paste and eaten in small amounts at a time Traditionally coarse sharkskin is used to grate the root but metal graters called oroshigane are used in modern times Fresh wasabi paste loses its flavor quickly if left uncovered and so the paste is grated on the spot in some high end restaurants Sushi chefs usually put the wasabi between the fish and the rice to cover the wasabi and preserve its flavour br Store bought wasabi paste is usually made from dried wasabi powder and sold in bottles or squeezable toothpaste like tubes br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br As flavoring br br Wasabi is used to flavor many foods especially dry snacks Wasabi mame wasabi bean are legumes peanuts soybeans or peas that are roasted or fried and then coated with wasabi powder and eaten as a snack br br br Others br br Fresh wasabi leaves can be eaten raw having a spicy flavor but a common side effect is diarrhea Wasabizuke is made of wasabi leaves pickled in sake lees and is considered a specialty of Shizuoka Prefecture br br br Surrogates br Wasabi favors growing conditions that restrict its wide cultivation among other things it is quite intolerant of direct sunlight requires an air temperature between and C and F and prefers high humidity in summer This makes fully satisfying commercial demand impossible for growers which makes wasabi quite expensive Therefore outside Japan finding real wasabi plants is rare br A common substitute is a mixture of horseradish mustard starch and green food colouring or spinach powder Often packages are labelled as wasabi while the ingredients do not include any part of the wasabi plant The primary difference is colour with wasabi being naturally green Fresh horseradish root is described as having a similar albeit simpler flavor and texture to that of fresh wasabi br In Japan horseradish is referred to as seiy wasabi western wasabi Outside of Japan where fresh wasabi is hard to obtain a powdered mixture of horseradish and mustard oil known as kona wasabi is used at a majority of sushi restaurants including reputable ones In the United States true wasabi is generally found only at specialty grocers and high end restaurants br br br Chemistry br br The chemical in wasabi that provides its initial pungency is the volatile compound allyl isothiocyanate which is produced by hydrolysis of allyl glucosinolate a natural thioglucoside conjugates of the sugar glucose and sulfur containing organic compounds the hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by myrosinase and occurs when the enzyme is released on cell rupture caused by maceration e g grating of the plant The same compound is responsible for the pungency of horseradish and mustard Allyl isothiocyanate can also be released when the wasabi plants have been damaged because it is being used as a defense mechanism The sensory neural target of mustard oil is the chemosensory receptor TRPA also known as the wasabi receptor br The unique flavour of wasabi is a result of complex chemical mixtures from the broken cells of the plant including those resulting from the hydrolysis of thioglucosides including sinigrin and other glucosinolates into glucose and methylthioalkyl isothiocyanates br br Methylsulfinyl hexyl isothiocyanate MITC br Methylthioheptyl isothiocyanate br Methylthiooctyl isothiocyanate br Such isothiocyanates inhibit microbial growth perhaps with implications for preserving food against spoilage and suppressing oral bacterial growth br Because the burning sensations of wasabi are not oil based they are short lived compared to the effects of capsaicin in chilli peppers and are washed away with more food or liquid The sensation is felt primarily in the nasal passage and can be painful depending on the amount consumed Inhaling or sniffing wasabi vapor has an effect like smelling salts a property exploited by researchers attempting to create a smoke alarm for the deaf One deaf subject participating in a test of the prototype awoke within seconds of wasabi vapour sprayed into his sleeping chamber The Ig Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the researchers for determining the ideal density of airborne wasabi to wake people in the event of an emergency br br br Nutritional information br Wasabi is normally consumed in such small quantities that its nutritional value is negligible The major constituents of raw wasabi root are carbohydrates water fat and protein br br br Cultivation br br Few places are suitable for large scale wasabi cultivation which is difficult even in ideal conditions In Japan wasabi is cultivated mainly in these regions br br Izu Peninsula in Shizuoka Prefecture Traditional Wasabi Cultivation in Shizuoka Japan is a Globally and Japanese Nationally Important Agricultural Heritage System br Nagano Prefecture including the Daio Wasabi Farm in Azumino a popular tourist attraction and the world s largest commercial wasabi farm br Iwate Prefecture br Shimane Prefecture known as its Hikimi wasabi br br Numerous artificial cultivation facilities also exist as far north as Hokkaido and as far south as Kyushu As the demand for real wasabi is higher than that which can be produced within Japan Japan imports copious amounts of wasabi from the United States Canada Taiwan South Korea Israel Thailand and New Zealand In North America wasabi is cultivated by a handful of small farmers and companies in the rain forests on the coast of Western Canada the Oregon Coast and in areas of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee In Europe wasabi is grown commercially in Iceland the Netherlands Hungary and the UK br Modern cultivars of wasabi mostly derive from three traditional cultivars Fujidaruma Shimane No and Mazuma Sequencing of the chloroplastic genome which is inherited maternally in wasabi supports
