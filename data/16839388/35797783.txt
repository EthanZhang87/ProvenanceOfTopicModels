not look promising as it was a high concept show He compared it to the NBC science fiction comedy series rd Rock from the Sun claiming that the series creator made it so different from rd Rock from the Sun that it is weird He stated that if The Neighbors garnered low ratings it could possibly be replaced with Family Tools an ABC comedy that is scheduled to air in mid season He compared it to other comedies set to air on the same channel writing that those are better According to Wiegand The Neighbors seems like Outsourced which aired for one season on NBC br Other reviews were somewhat more positive Dave Walker from The Times Picayune thought that The Neighbors was a fish out of water he called it a potentially comedic show Rob Owen a Pittsburgh Post Gazette critic claimed that he has interest in high concept shows he also laughed a good bit at the pilot episode His concern was how long they can keep up the jokes Seeing the unusual way aliens do the dishes in the pilot is
