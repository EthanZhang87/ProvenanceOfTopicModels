homemade animated shorts with a family movie camera He later described his interest in animation as a way to play God making up nearly living characters Cartoon director Chuck Jones producer Walt Disney and cartoonist Jack Davis were major inspirations br He spent about a year at the University of Minnesota studying both philosophy and making art before transferring to the California Institute of the Arts where he won a Student Academy Award for his production Next Door and graduated in with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Although Docter had planned to work for Walt Disney Animation Studios his best offers came from Pixar and from the producers of The Simpsons He did not think much of Pixar at that time and later considered his choice to work there a strange and unusual one br br br Career br br Before joining Pixar Docter had created three non computer animations Next Door Palm Springs and Winter All three shorts were later preserved by the Academy Film Archive He was a fan of the company s early short films but he knew nothing about them otherwise He commented in an October interview Looking back I kind of go what was I thinking br He started at Pixar in at the age of after John Lasseter asked his former classmate the late Joe Ranft who was one of Docter s teachers at CalArts to recommend any students who would be a good fit for the company Deciding to follow his instincts and what felt right at the time he accepted the job offer from then obscure Pixar and began work there the day after his college graduation as the tenth employee at the company s animation group and its third animator Docter instantly felt at home in the tight knit atmosphere of the company He has said Growing up a lot of us felt we were the only person in the world who had this weird obsession with animation Coming to Pixar you feel like Oh There are others br Docter had been brought in with limited responsibilities but Lasseter quickly assigned him larger and larger roles in writing animation sound recording and orchestra scoring He was one of the three key screenwriters behind the concept of Toy Story and partially based the character of Buzz Lightyear on himself He had a mirror on his desk and made faces with it as he conceptualized the character br Docter s fascination with character development was further influenced by a viewing of Paper Moon he told journalist Robert K Elder in an interview for The Film That Changed My Life br br I like the more character driven stuff and Paper Moon brought that home to me in a way that I had not seen in live action really focusing on the whole story just about characters It was almost theatrical in the same way you might see a stage show because you re locked in a room It s got to be about characters and yet it was so cinematic a film that couldn t be done in any other medium It just kind of blew my socks off br Docter has been an integral part of some of Pixar s most seminal works including Toy Story Toy Story A Bug s Life and Monsters Inc all of which received critical acclaim and honors He contributed to these animated films as a co author to the scripts and worked with CGI stalwarts such as Lasseter Ronnie

Braintrust which came together during the making of Toy Story the other four being Lasseter Stanton Ranft and Unkrich br Docter made his directorial debut with Monsters Inc the first Pixar film not directed by Lasseter which occurred right after the birth of his first child Nick Docter has said that the abrupt move from a complete single minded devotion to his career to parenting drove him upside down and formed the inspiration for the storyline In he was asked by Lasseter to direct the English translation of Howl s Moving Castle Docter then directed the film Up released on May He based the protagonist of Up partially on himself based on his frequent feelings of social awkwardness and his desire to get away from crowds to contemplate Following the success of Up Docter and fellow
