forest a doe gives birth to a male fawn named Bambi who will one day take over the position of Great Prince of the Forest who guards the woodland creatures Bambi grows up very attached to his mother with whom he spends most of his time The fawn is befriended by an eager energetic male rabbit named Thumper who helps to teach him to walk and speak a young male skunk he mistakenly calls Flower who is so flattered he keeps the name and a female fawn named Faline Curious and inquisitive Bambi frequently asks about the world around him and is cautioned about the dangers of life as a forest creature by his loving mother One day out in a meadow Bambi briefly sees the Great Prince but does not realize that he is his father As the Great Prince wanders uphill he discovers the human hunter named Man by all the animals is coming and rushes down to the meadow to get everyone to safety Bambi is briefly separated from his mother during that time but is escorted to her by the Great Prince as the three of them make it back in the forest just as Man fires his gun br During Bambi s first winter he and Thumper play in the snow while Flower hibernates One day his mother takes him to find food when Man shows up again As they run off his mother is shot and killed by the hunter leaving the little fawn mournful and alone Taking pity on his abandoned son the Great Prince leads Bambi home as he reveals to him that he is his father Next year Bambi has matured into a young stag and his childhood friends have also entered young adulthood They are warned about becoming twitterpated by Friend Owl and that they will eventually fall in love but the trio views the concept of romance with scorn Thumper and Flower soon encounter their beautiful romantic counterparts and abandon their former thoughts on love Bambi himself encounters Faline as a beautiful doe Their courtship is quickly interrupted by a belligerent older stag named Ronno who attempts to force Faline away from Bambi Bambi successfully manages to defeat Ronno in battle and earn the rights to the doe s affections br Bambi is awakened afterward by the smell of smoke he follows it and discovers it leads to a hunter camp His father warns Bambi that Man has returned with more hunters Bambi is separated from Faline in the turmoil but finds her cornered by Man s vicious hunting dogs which he manages to ward off Bambi escapes them and is shot by Man but survives Meanwhile at the Man s camp their campfire suddenly spreads into the forest resulting in a wildfire from which the forest residents flee in fear Bambi his

Development br In Sidney Franklin purchased the rights to Felix Salten s novel Bambi a Life in the Woods to produce a live action film for Metro Goldwyn Mayer but soon realized that it would be too difficult to achieve Joseph M Schenck of United Artists suggested him to make an animated version in alliance with Walt Disney who was contemplating the idea of his first full length feature at the time with Bambi as one of the possible choices Later that year Franklin approached him with the idea but Disney eventually refused feeling that his animation studio was unprepared for the technical difficulties that Bambi would have presented Franklin sold the film rights to Walt Disney in April Disney began work on crafting an animated adaptation immediately intending it to be the company s second feature length animated film and their first to be based on a specific recent work However the original novel was written for an adult audience and was considered too grim and somber for a regular light hearted Disney film The artists also discovered that it would be challenging to animate deer realistically These difficulties resulted in Disney putting production on hold while the studio worked on several other projects In Disney assigned Perce Pearce and Carl Fallberg to work on the film s storyboards but attention was soon drawn away as the studio began working on Fantasia Finally on August production on Bambi began in earnest but progressed slowly owing to changes in the studio personnel location and methodology of handling animation at the time br br br Writing br There were many interpretations of the story As writer and animator Mel Shaw recalled The story of Bambi had a so many possibilities you could go off on a million tangents I remember one situation when Walt became involved with himself He said Suppose we have Bambi step on an ant hill and we cut inside and see all the damage he s done to the ant civilization We spent weeks and weeks developing the ants and then all of a sudden we decided you know we re way off the story this has got nothing to do with the story of Bambi We also had a family of grasshoppers and they get into a family squabble of this or that and Bambi is watching all of this and here s the big head of Bambi in the grasshoppers And what s that got to do with the story and this would go on many times br Originally the film was intended to have six individual bunny characters similar to the dwarfs in Snow White However Perce Pearce suggested that they could instead have five generic rabbits and one rabbit with a different color than the rest with one tooth would have a very distinct personality This character later became known as Thumper br There originally was a brief shot in the scene where Bambi s mother dies after jumping over a log and getting shot by a man Larry Morey however felt the scene was too dramatic and that it was emotional enough to justify having her death occur off screen Walt Disney was also eager to show the man burned to death by his fire that he inadvertently started but this was discarded when it was decided not to show the man at all There was also a scene involving two autumn leaves conversing like an old married couple before parting ways and falling to the ground but Disney found that talking flora did not work in the context of the film and instead a visual metaphor of two realistic leaves falling to the ground was used instead Disney and his story team also developed the characters consisting of a squirrel and a chipmunk that were to be a comic duo reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy However after years of experimentation Walt felt that the story should focus on the three principal characters Bambi Thumper and Flower The squirrel and chipmunk make only brief appearances in the final film br The writing was completed in July by which time the film s budget had increased to br br br Animation br Although the animators had animated deer in Snow White they were animated in the words of Eric Larson like big flour sacks Disney wanted the animals in Bambi to be more realistic and expressive than those in Snow White He had Rico LeBrun a painter of animals come and lecture to the animators on the structure and movement of animals The animators visited the Los Angeles Zoo and Disney set up a small zoo at the studio with animals such as rabbits ducks owls and skunks and a pair of fawns named Bambi and Faline so that the artists could see first hand the movement of these animals LeBrun s sketches depicted realistic animals but as characters they lacked personality Marc Davis created the final design of Bambi by incorporating LeBrun s realistic study of deer anatomy but exaggerating the character s face by making his proportions baby like short snout big eyes etc Although there were no humans in Bambi live action footage of humans was used for one scene actress Jane Randolph and Ice Capades star Donna Atwood acted as live action references for the scene where Bambi and Thumper are on the icy pond The animators learned a lot about animals during the film s production giving them a broader spectrum of animation styles to use in future projects br The backgrounds for the film were inspired by the Eastern American woodlands One of the earliest and best known artists for the Disney studio Maurice Jake Day spent several weeks in the Vermont and Maine forests sketching and photographing deer fawns and the surrounding wilderness areas However his first sketches were too busy as the eye did not know where to focus Tyrus Wong a Chinese animator showed Day some of his impressionistic paintings of a forest Day liked the paintings and appointed him art director of the film Wong s backgrounds were revolutionary since they had more detail around the center and less around the edges thus leading a viewer s eye to the characters br Due to World War II which began in Europe in Pinocchio and Fantasia failed at the box office Facing financial difficulty Disney was forced to cut minutes from the film before final animation to save production costs br br br Songs br br br Release br br br Original theatrical run br br Bambi premiered in London on August as the first Disney film to premiere abroad It was released in theaters in United States five days later on August The film was released during World War II and did not

streaming platform Disney in October Bambi was the first of three Disney movies to receive a dubbing in a Native American language The next such instance had to wait until when Pixar s Finding Nemo received a dubbing in Navajo and then Disney s Moana in Hawaiian two years later While the first was also made available on Disney the latter was only distributed for free in schools in Hawaii and never received any home media release form br br br Reception br br br Critical response br At the time of the film s release Bambi received mixed reviews from the critics mainly because of the lack of fantasy elements in the film and objection towards a dramatic story of animals and their struggle to survive in the woods and avoid the threat of humans The New York Times claimed that In the search for perfection Mr Disney has come perilously close to tossing away his whole world of cartoon fantasy Manny Farber of The New Republic wrote that Bambi is interesting because it s the first one that s been entirely unpleasant Mickey wouldn t be caught dead in this br Farber added that In an attempt to ape the trumped up realism of flesh and blood movies he has given up fantasy which was pretty much the magic element Even Disney s daughter Diane complained saying that Bambi s mother did not need to die When Walt claimed that he was only following the book Diane protested saying that he had taken other liberties before and that Walt Disney could do whatever he wanted br Today however Bambi is viewed much more favorably On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has
