modern times and Variety calling it a cataclysmic disaster br br br Critical response br On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes of critics reviews are positive with an average rating of The website s consensus reads Wish earns some tugs at the heartstrings with the way it warmly references many of the studio s classics but nostalgia s no substitute for genuine storytelling magic no matter how beautifully animated it might be It was the first Walt Disney Animation Studios film to be classified as Rotten on the site since Chicken Little Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews becoming the lowest rated Walt Disney Animation Studios film on the site Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale while those polled by PostTrak gave it a overall positive score br Kate Erbland of IndieWire praised the film saying As Disney celebrates its th year Wish serves as a throwback to the past a celebration of the present and a gentle push into the future Brian Truitt of USA Today gave it three stars out of four and wrote that the film entertains and unabashedly owns being a safe paean to old school Disney shamelessly aiming for all your nostalgic feels And it makes no difference who you are John Nugent of Empire called it An appropriate tribute to Disney by itself It hardly breaks any ground it s simply there to celebrate the ground the studio was built on but felt that the jokes largely land a little flatly to be appreciated by only the youngest audiences although props must be given to the cadre of breakdancing chickens a genuine highlight Sarah El Mahmoud of CinemaBlend awarded the film out of stars writing From gorgeous watercolor like settings to adorable talking animals to earworm pop songs Wish goes to the Disney mainstays Kristen Lopez of TheWrap called it a darling film with fantastic music and amazing voice performances but the story does feel a bit like a house of cards waiting to be poked Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic wrote that What saves the film from being nothing but a rehash are DeBose whose singing voice unsurprisingly shines and Pine who sang in Into the Woods who makes an excellent villain as well as some of the songs most of which they re involved in br Michael O Sullivan of The Washington Post gave stars out of in a review what Wish feels like at times not a movie made by filmmakers with an original vision but one assembled by focus group with an eye more on fan service than on fresh ideas It all feels familiar which is another word for comforting And Wish however recycled it may be is at least that warm funny ish and with its heart in the right place Damon Wise of Deadline Hollywood s review was mixed saying that Disney used to make this kind of film all the time but now the studio seems a bit bamboozled as to how to do it in the modern age which might explain why it lifts quite a lot from DreamWorks Shrek starting with a tongue in cheek fairytale book opening and takes its musical direction from The Greatest Showman which means lots of tub thumping numbers that sound like variations on a theme from a YA adaptation of Les Mis rables Like that film s bombastic This Is Me every song here feels like an overreaction and the verbosity of the lyrics hesitations rhymes with reservations jars with the simplicity of the animation and its Snow White palette He concluded that Thankfully it doesn t outstay its welcome but to cap years with a few throwaway quips about Bambi Mary Poppins and Peter Pan plus a whole roll call of more recent characters during the end credits seems to be a hell of a disappointing way to capitalize on such a formidable back catalog Lovia Gyarkye of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Even during its more successful moments Wish s magic falls flat The film is weighed down by its purpose to revel in Disney nostalgia while soaring into the future Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote The strategy behind Wish seems to be If we do an homage to enchantment the audience will be enchanted True magic however can t be recycled Tim Grierson of Screen International wrote that the film is a strained animated musical which overtly references the company s most beloved films a strategy that mostly exposes how singular the studio s productions used to be Amy Nicholson of The New York Times wrote that Oddly and rather fascinatingly this is a film about a spiritual revolution Can Asha a humanist convince the islanders to reject the man in the embroidered robe who preaches that he alone is a conduit for miracles br br br Accolades br br br Notes br br br br br br Further reading br Rebello Stephen Baughman Kimmer The Art of
