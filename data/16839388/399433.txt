Gabriel conceived the film during a Thanksgiving weekend Goldberg who had just finished up work as the supervising animator of the Genie in Aladdin joined Gabriel as co director The project went into development concurrently with The Lion King and attracted most of Disney s top animators Meanwhile Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg decided that the film should be an emotional romantic epic in the vein of Beauty and the Beast in hope that like Beauty it would also be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture Screenwriters Binder Grant and LaZebnik took creative liberties with history in an attempt to make the film palatable to audiences br Pocahontas premiered at Central Park on June and was released in the United States on June to mixed reactions from critics and audiences who praised its animation voice performances and music but criticized its story with its lack of focus on tone The film s historical inaccuracies and artistic license received polarized responses Pocahontas earned over million at the box office The film received two Academy Awards for Best Musical or Comedy Score for Menken and Best Original Song for Colors of the Wind According to critics the depiction of Pocahontas as an empowered heroine influenced subsequent Disney films like Mulan and Frozen The film was followed by a direct to video sequel Pocahontas II Journey to a New World in br br br Plot br In the Susan Constant travels from London to the New World carrying English settlers from the Virginia Company The settlers including Captain John Smith talk of adventure finding gold fighting Injuns and potentially settling in the new land br In the Powhatan tribe in Werowocomoco Tsenacommacah Virginia Pocahontas the daughter of Chief Powhatan fears being possibly wed

capture John before retrieving Kocoum s body Enraged at Kocoum s death Powhatan angrily berates Pocahontas of leaving the village and declares war on the English beginning with John s execution at dawn br After reaching Jamestown Thomas warns the settlers of John s capture Ratcliffe then rallies his men to battle using this as an excuse to annihilate the tribe and find their nonexistent gold That same night Powhatan also orders his men to prepare for battle A desperate Pocahontas visits Grandmother Willow and realizes the arrow from John s compass is the same spinning arrow from her dream which leads to her destiny Morning comes and Powhatan and his tribe drag John to a cliff for his execution Meanwhile Ratcliffe leads the armed colonists to fight Powhatan s warriors Just as Powhatan

Rolfe and Pocahontas mother respectively in Terrence Malick s The New World br br br Production br br br Development br Following the release of The Rescuers Down Under director Mike Gabriel was eager to collaborate with veteran Disney story artist Joe Grant on a follow up project that was vastly different from the animated adventure film In April and May they first partnered on an adaptation of Swan Lake with both of them writing story outlines and creating conceptual artwork Gabriel and Grant then submitted their outline for approval but it was negatively received by the studio s live action script readers Earlier during Thanksgiving weekend Gabriel had wanted to direct an animated musical set in the American West At a relative s Thanksgiving dinner while glancing through numerous titles in their bookcase Gabriel struck on the idea of adapting the life of Pocahontas after finding a book about her Following the cancellation of Swan Lake Gabriel returned to the idea br Shortly after Gabriel pitched his idea at the Gong Show meeting held by Michael Eisner Jeffrey Katzenberg Peter Schneider and Roy E Disney He had written the title Walt Disney s Pocahontas on an image of Tiger Lily from Peter Pan to the back of which he taped a brief pitch that read an Indian princess who is torn between her father s wishes to destroy the English settlers and her wishes to help them a girl caught between her father and her people and her love for the enemy Coincidentally Feature Animation president Peter Schneider had been developing an animated version of William Shakespeare s play Romeo and Juliet and observed several similarities between his idea and Gabriel s Pocahontas pitch Schneider recalled We were particularly interested in exploring the theme of If we don t learn to live with one another we will destroy ourselves Gabriel s pitch was quickly accepted becoming the quickest story turnaround in Disney studio history br br After Beauty and the Beast was unprecedentedly nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture at the th Academy Awards then studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg opted to produce another animated romance film in the hopes of achieving a similar feat While Aladdin and The Lion King were considered to be too far into development Katzenberg deemed Pocahontas a promising candidate and thus pushed for the heroine to be older the romance between her and Smith to be more mature and the animals to be mute Head of story Tom Sito went on the record stating he wanted to include broader jokes but the higher ups wanted it more winsome more gentle Some of the folks were so concerned about political correctness they didn t want to be cuckoo wacky about it br Eric Goldberg following his contributions to Aladdin as the supervising animator of the Genie and with all animation units for The Lion King already occupied was asked to co direct Pocahontas alongside Gabriel to which he agreed Likewise he had originally expected the film to be more comedic and cartoonish like Aladdin but Schneider informed him that the film would be produced in a vein more similar to that of Beauty and the Beast the then ongoing Los Angeles riots further convinced Goldberg to commit to the film due to its racial themes However executive interference would grow so much that Goldberg himself decided to work for Chuck Jones Productions under the pseudonym Claude Raynes during production It eventually reached a peak when Joe Grant drew Percy wearing a Native American feather by which the animators took the concept one step further by placing a Spanish ruff on Meeko One executive exclaimed Animals don t have the intelligence to switch their clothes They don t even have opposing thumbs The animators would retain their concept for the film br Under Katzenberg Frank Wells and Michael Eisner the Disney studios had begun a correlation of hiring Broadway personnel to manage the Disney animation staff on their feature films that brought such producers as Amy Pell to Aladdin and Sarah McArthur and Thomas Schumacher to The Lion King Before making his producing debut on Pocahontas James Pentecost had earlier worked as a production stage manager on several Broadway productions including La Cage aux Folles and Crimes of the Heart br In June the filmmakers embarked on a research trip to the Jamestown Settlement where Pentecost first met Shirley Little Dove Custalow McGowan and Debbie White Dove Custalow both descendants of the Powhatan Native Americans The trip also included a visit to the Pamunkey Indian Reservation and conducted interviews with historians at Old Dominion University Following the research trip Custalow McGowan served as a consultant traveling to the Disney studios three times and while Custalow McGowan offered her services for free Disney paid her a daily consulting fee plus expenses Ultimately when it came to light that historical accuracy was not being pursued to the extent she had hoped McGowan has voiced her feelings of shame she felt in conjunction with her work on the film saying she wish ed her name wasn t on it Additional Native American consultants were brought in to authenticate the clothing and war dance choreography That same month Katzenberg held a meeting with the Feature Animation staff in which he predicted that Pocahontas would be a commercial hit while deeming The Lion King experimental and less likely to succeed As a result most of the animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on Pocahontas instead believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two br br br Writing br In January Carl Binder joined the project having previous expertise as a television writer on shows such as Punky Brewster War of the Worlds Friday the th The Series and Top Cops Four months later Susannah Grant and Philip LaZebnik joined the writing team Susannah Grant was selected by Disney as a screenwriter on Pocahontas after winning the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting awarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences the year before while still attending film school On board as a screenwriter she was only one of the many who was contributing the specific vision the upper management at Disney had in mind and collaborated with Native American consultants While working on the film Susannah Grant wrote to a specific story outline and no scene was rewritten less than thirty five times until she felt it was perfect br Story supervisor Tom Sito who became the project s unofficial historical consultant did extensive research into the early colonial era and the story of John Smith and Pocahontas but was confronted over the historical inaccuracies by historians Already knowing that in reality Pocahontas married John Rolfe Gabriel explained it was felt that the story of Pocahontas and Rolfe was too complicated and violent for a youthful audience so instead they would focus on Pocahontas s meeting with John Smith The filmmakers discovered that Pocahontas was around twelve years old and Smith was not a very likeable character in which producer James Pentecost confessed that dramatic license was needed to be taken Likewise when searching for an appropriate age for Pocahontas to begin her relationship with Smith Glen Keane explained We had the choice of being historically accurate or socially responsible so we chose the socially responsible side by increasing Pocahontas s age from a girl into a young woman br br One of Gabriel s early ideas was for Pocahontas s mother to be embodied in a certain star in the sky that would help Pocahontas find her path to Smith The Lion King however had concurrently carried a similar idea of the ancestors giving wisdom and guidance to the protagonist so the idea was discarded Michael Eisner pushed for Pocahontas to have a mother lamenting that We re always getting fried for having no mothers The writers countered that Powhatan was polygamous and formed dynastic alliances among other neighboring tribes by impregnating a local woman and giving away the child so it was believed that Pocahontas herself probably did not see her mother that much Well Eisner conceded I guess that means we re toasted Ultimately her mother s spirit would become the swirling wind that occurs throughout the film br For the villain they chose John Ratcliffe whose portrayal was based on actual English captains including John Martin Christopher Newport and Edward Maria Wingfield In reality it was Wingfield who despised John Smith but the filmmakers preferred the sinister sound of Ratcliffe The writers tried to adapt actual events from Pocahontas s life into the film such as her warning Smith that the Native Americans were after him so he could escape in the middle of the night Powhatan ordering the captured Smith to make bead necklaces to humiliate him and Pocahontas being captured by Ratcliffe instead of Samuel Argall though none of them worked with the story br Sito mentioned that Joe Grant contributed heavily towards the film as he was the creator of Redfeather Meeko and Flit Redfeather was a wise cracking turkey who was intended to be voiced by John Candy and Percy who was to be voiced by Richard E Grant was revised to become mute Following the death of John Candy in March co screenwriter Susannah Grant decided the turkey was inappropriate for the script she co wrote for Pocahontas and a more realistic approach would have the animals pantomime instead of talking Joe Grant stated Redfeather had comic potential he thought he was handsome a lady s man When we decided he couldn t talk and having no hands he couldn t mime br Joe Grant would later draw a concept sketch of a hair braiding raccoon which Glen Keane animated and claimed the directors loved the idea and got rid of the turkey character Similarly according to Sito Meeko was created because they were naturally enigmatic because they have little hands and a little mask over their face like a thief Gabriel described the inspiration for Flit the hummingbird from having hummingbirds all over my backyard and I thought That s a great animal to animate According to the directors Governor Ratcliffe s pampered pet Percy was based on history as the royalty of the time often carried small pugs wherever they went br For the spiritual ancestor a male character named Old Man River was originally envisioned and Gregory Peck was cast in the role Peck later realized that the character ought to be a maternal figure and reluctantly turned down the role Conceived as a tree of life whose seasonal changes would frame the story Grandmother Willow grew out of a concept sketch of a sawed off tree with a branch pointing to its rings drawn by Joe Grant which would serve as a narrator that would remember back to Pocahontas years earlier Joe Grant would continue to protest to have the tree be more a character within the story and her character flowered into the idea of a grandmotherly spiritual adviser to Pocahontas Because of Katzenberg s opposition to having Grandmother Willow in the story Joe Grant assisted fellow veteran story artist Burny Mattinson with coming up tree puns such as My bark is worse than my bite The roots of all problems and They re barking up the wrong tree Mattinson reluctantly added them to his pitch for the next morning and during the story meeting he exclaimed Everybody loved it All of a sudden Oh I want her in Let s build her part bigger br br br Casting br br In September Disney began casting actors for Pocahontas telling talent agents that they were particularly interested in Native American actors for the project For the role of Pocahontas Broadway actress singer Judy Kuhn was hired to provide the singing voice for the eponymous character before Irene Bedard was cast Kuhn explained They said You are going to do the dialogue unless we find a Native American actress whose singing voice matched yours I was cast before Irene so it actually went backwards Bedard herself was filming Lakota Woman Siege at Wounded Knee where she was informed by the casting director that they were looking for someone to voice the title role According to Bedard she took a train to Buffalo New York where she walked in wearing a sundress and a straw hat and read for the part Back on the set of Lakota Woman she learned that she was cast in the role Michelle St John had also auditioned for the role of Pocahontas and was given the role of Nakoma after Bedard was cast br Mel Gibson was cast as English settler John Smith following a desire to make something for my kids In a notable contrast to previous voice actors for Disney animated features Gibson provided the singing voice for his character which the actor has described as the most difficult part of his role br Christian Bale auditioned for the role of Thomas As he explained in an interview with Disney Adventures the directors played with Thomas being Irish and Scottish and younger than I am so I had to raise my voice and do different accents But the more we did it the more he became like me older and English Richard White the voice of Gaston in Beauty and the Beast was supposed to voice Ratcliffe but the crew was worried he might sound too much like Gaston so he was replaced by his co star David Ogden Stiers who also voices Ratcliffe s dimwitted assistant Wiggins Robbie Coltrane and Chris Barrie were brought in to read for Ratcliffe while Goldberg wanted Hugh Laurie to play Wiggins br Russell Means was cast as Chief Powhatan though he initially expressed displeasure with the script in that Native Americans addressed each other using proper names rather than the traditional my father or my friend Indigenous Canadian actor Gordon Tootoosis was also cast as the tribal medicine man Kekata Throughout most of the production the cast members performed their dialogue in separate recording sessions br br br Design and animation br br Renowned for his animation of Ariel in The Little Mermaid supervising animator Glen Keane was immediately tapped to draw the titular Native American princess Following the demands of Jeffrey Katzenberg to make the title character the most idealized and finest woman ever made Keane first sought his inspirations for his depictions of Pocahontas from Shirley Little Dove Custalow McGowan and Devi White Dove women he had met during the research trip to Virginia Keane recalled meeting the women So I turned around and there s this beautiful Indian woman walking up a Native American She said Are you Glen Keane The animator that s going to do Pocahontas I said Well yeah And then from behind another tree another woman came up and she said Well my name is Shirley Little Dove and this is my sister Devi White Dove and we are descended from Pocahontas And as they stood there I mean I took a picture of both of them and between their faces was Pocahontas face in my mind I could see her br Other inspirations were Natalie Belcon Naomi Campbell Jamie Pillow supermodel Kate Moss Charmaine Craig Christy Turlington Dyna Taylor and her own voice actress Irene Bedard For almost three years Taylor herself sat for four three hour modeling sessions in which she was videotaped so the animators could draw poses of her from different angles Keane also looked to a depiction of Pocahontas from a history book though he would state the depiction was not exactly a candidate for People s Most Beautiful issue so I made a few adjustments to add an Asian feeling to her face Due to the complexity of the color schemes shapes and expressions in the animation a total of animators worked on the animation of Pocahontas character alone including Mark Henn and Pres Romanillos br After working at Sullivan Bluth Studios for over fourteen years John Pomeroy who notoriously resigned alongside Don Bluth during work on The Fox and the Hound in returned to Disney and worked on the film Pomeroy noted that initially John Smith was portrayed as well groomed before the animators tried designs where the character was sloppier bearded and carried daggers and knives Pomeroy grew more satisfied with the character s design the more simple it became Additionally Pomeroy cited inspiration for John Smith from Errol Flynn and the facial features of Gibson br Initially assigned as a supervising animator on The Lion King Nik Ranieri did character designs and test animation for Timon but moved over to Pocahontas growing frustrated with an indecisive vision from the directors There he was assigned to animate Redfeather until Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered for the animals to be mute Finding feathers difficult for Redfeather to gesture with he was again assigned to animate Meeko using a Little Golden Books animal book illustrated by Alice and Martin Provensen as reference Duncan Marjoribanks utilized geometric shapes to create Ratcliffe In early drafts of the character he had a body similar to a pear but to make him appear more arrogant the animator increased the force of gravity on his chest so that he seemed more pompous and physically threatening Chris Buck served as the supervising animator for Percy Wiggins and Grandmother Willow For Grandmother Willow the face was traditionally animated by Buck while the cowl and the trunk of the tree were digitally animated under the supervision of Steve Goldberg Assisted by the effect animators a D software program was employed for the bark to be individually manipulated and for the face to match with the computer generated texture The following supervising animators also included Anthony DeRosa for Nakoma Michael Cedeno for Kocoum Ken Duncan for Thomas T Daniel Hofstedt for the settlers Lon and Ben and Dave Pruiksma for Flit While Mulan was within its pre production stages minutes were animated by animators and artists at the Disney MGM Studios br Initially Gabriel asked Michael Giaimo to create conceptual paintings for the film as they both shared in a style of shape based and secondary art details Giaimo himself a former assistant animator and then a CalArts teacher accepted working several months on a freelance basis After Goldberg became the film s co director the two directors asked Giaimo to officially join the staff in which he was promoted to being the film s art director For Giaimo he relied on a color saturated elegant designs in a less than realistic format inspired by prehistory Caribbean themes and creatures derived from Mexican and African folk art Giaimo also sought out inspiration for the visual design from the works produced by earlier Disney art designers such as Richard Kelsey who had done story sketches for his unproduced film Hiawatha Eyvind Earle who worked on Sleeping Beauty and Mary Blair br br br Music br br Howard Ashman and Alan Menken were planning to write songs for Pocahontas once they were finished working on Aladdin but Ashman died in Following the death of his longtime collaborator Menken wrote the remaining songs for Aladdin with Tim Rice at his home in London which the New York based composer found to be difficult When Aladdin was finished Menken was expected to write songs for Pocahontas with Rice Kevin Bannerman the studio s director of development stated Rice was always gallivanting around the world and it was difficult to get him and Alan together And so here was Stephen Schwartz who had written scores that we all loved and we were huge fans of and he lived in the New York area Disney immediately contacted Stephen Schwartz who after working on Working Rags and Children of Eden had quit theater and was taking psychology courses at New York University he was hired to write the lyrics This would mark the first time Menken had collaborated without Ashman for a Disney animated film Menken commented that their work included moments of tension because Schwartz was also capable of writing music and Menken had experience with lyrics br Due to corporate interest in the film surrounding its theme of promoting understanding between different groups and its inclusion of violence and threats of greater conflict Schwartz became heavily involved in the storytelling Bannerman estimated that he spent a week with one of the screenwriters and helped work out the overall themes of tolerance and cooperation In June Schwartz researched Jamestown Virginia where he absorbed the atmosphere and bought tapes of Native American music and English sea shanties as well as other music from the early th century that helped inspire numbers in the film Schwartz modeled his lyrical writing for people of other ethnicities on that of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick Colors of the Wind was the first song to be written for the film Gabriel Goldberg and Pentecost stated the song had defined the film s heart and soul Schwartz began Colors with a few draft ideas for lyrics taking inspiration from Chief Seattle s letter to the United States Congress Then Menken wrote the melody with Schwartz listening at the piano and making suggestions Schwartz would add lyrics before a session together where they were refined br Just Around the Riverbend also composed by Menken and Schwartz was devised by Schwartz s wife Carole with the idea that Pocahontas would have a recurring dream that suggested something coming her way paving the way for her I Want song The song almost did not make it into the completed film when Disney executives doubted whether her song would have the kind of impact they wanted at that point Schwartz however stated he and Menken believed in it very strongly Indeed at one point we wrote a different song for that spot but Alan and I were never as happy with the second song and ultimately everybody at Disney came to feel that way too br The filmmakers had planned for a song for when Pocahontas and Smith met in the glade just before Kocoum attacks Smith There were an estimated three to four songs at this point including Different Drummer In the Middle of the River First to Dance which was deemed too silly as it took place before Kocoum s death and Powerful Magic which was another attempt at a cheerful song A love song titled If I Never Knew You had been finished by the animators but following a test screening where child and teen audiences were not interested in the song as it played Menken suggested that the song be removed It was although its melody remained in the orchestral underscoring The soundtrack was successful reaching number one on the Billboard charts during the week of July It received a triple platinum certification br br br Release br br br Marketing br br To replicate the promotional buzz of The Lion King the four minute musical number Colors of the Wind was released in November accompanying a theatrical re release of The Lion King On February Disney began its promotional marketing campaign starting in San Diego California launching a nationwide week tour of fashion malls located within twenty five cities where a mall exhibit named Pocahontas Animation Discovery Adventure was created to help promote the release There a Disney

time it was seen as a commercial box office disappointment in comparison to The Lion King in January then Disney CEO Michael Eisner contested in an annual shareholders meeting that Pocahontas is well on its way to being one of our most successful films of all time It has equalled Beauty and the Beast s box office numbers domestically and now it has taken Europe by storm and is playing well in every country in which it is being shown Sales of Pocahontas merchandise have been phenomenal br br br Critical response br br Pocahontas received mixed reviews from film critics The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that of critics gave the film a positive review based on reviews with an average score of The site s consensus states Pocahontas means well and has moments of startling beauty but it s largely a bland uninspired effort with uneven plotting and an unfortunate lack of fun It was the only film from the Disney Renaissance to be classified as rotten on the site Metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of from top reviews from mainstream critics calculated a score of based on reviews indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film out of stars writing that Pocahontas was the best looking of the modern Disney animated features and one of the more thoughtful though he was more critical of the story and portrayal of the villain ultimately summarizing that on a list including Mermaid Beauty Aladdin and Lion King I d rank it fifth It has a lot of good intentions but a severe scoundrel shortage On the television program Siskel Ebert Ebert repeated the same sentiment while his partner Gene Siskel was more praising of the film Both critics gave the film a Thumbs Up In his print review for the Chicago Tribune Siskel awarded the film stars out of stating it is a surprisingly serious thoughtful and beautifully drawn Disney animated feature about the American birthright of exploitation and racism He praised it for sending powerful images to children about threats to the natural order restoring a certain majesty to the Indian culture and for having the courage that leads to the life goes on ending br The film s writing and lack of humor received mixed reviews Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly stated With dismay I realize that virtually everything in the movie every character every story twist every song is as generic as the two hygienic lovers As a fairy tale confection a kind of West Side Story in Jamestown Pocahontas is pleasant to look at and it will probably satisfy very small kiddies but it s the first of the new era Disney cartoons that feels less than animated Peter Travers of Rolling Stone bemoaned that there were no funny fast talking animals Meeko the raccoon and Flit the hummingbird remain silent pals to Pocahontas and make you miss the verbal fun that Nathan Lane s wisecracking meerkat brought to The Lion King Desson Howe reviewing for The Washington Post likewise criticized the writing as recycling elements from Snow White to The Lion King with a father child clash a heroine s saintly pureness that transforms an entire people a forbidden love consultations with an oracle shaman in this case a tree spirit voiced by Linda Hunt and the usual sideshow of funny fuzzy animals While calling the screenplay the film s weakest element Janet Maslin of The New York Times summarized in her review Gloriously colorful cleverly conceived and set in motion with the usual Disney vigor Pocahontas is one more landmark feat of animation It does everything a children s movie should do except send little viewers home humming its theme song br According to Chief Roy Crazy Horse Johnson of the Powhatan Renape Nation an unrecognized tribe in New Jersey the film distorts history beyond recognition and perpetuates a dishonest and self serving myth at the expense of the Powhatan Nation Roy claimed that Disney had refused the tribe s offers to help create a more culturally and historically accurate film In the Los Angeles Times Angela Aleiss said that Pocahontas and other portrayals of the Native princess rarely show her having anything more important in her life than her relationships with men Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies Cornel Pewewardy argues that the film presents damaging stereotypes of the Native American population Pewewardy feels that the representation of Native characters like Grandmother Willow Meeko and Flit as animals has a marginalizing effect Anthropologist Kiyomi Kutsuzawa also observed that in the film Kocoum and John Smith fight for Pocahontas s affection Kutsuzawa viewed Smith s victory over Kocoum in this arena as symbolic of Western Europe s domination of the Americas and white men s domination over men of color br Conversely Native American activist Russell Means who portrays Chief Powhatan in the film praised the film s racial overtones stating that Pocahontas is the first time Eurocentric male society has admitted its historical deceit and that it makes the stunning admission that the purpose of the European colonization of the Americas was to kill Indians and rape and pillage the land Means also said that the film marked the first time other than on Northern Exposure that a human face has been put on an Indian female dubbing Pocahontas the finest feature film on American Indians Hollywood has turned out Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic concurred stating that the film s narrative had a progressive attitude when it came to interpreting history portraying the settlers as plunderers searching for non existent gold who were intent upon murdering the heathen savages they encountered in the process although she criticized the depiction of Pocahontas as stereotypical br br br Accolades br br br Historical accuracy br Pocahontas real name was Matoaka to her kin The public called her Amonute Pocahontas was only a nickname and it can variously be translated to little wanton playful one little brat or the naughty one Pocahontas was around or at the time John Smith arrived with the Virginia Company in in contrast to her portrayal as a young adult in the film br Smith is portrayed as an amiable man in reality he was described as having a harsh exterior and a very
