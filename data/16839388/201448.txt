Announcer br Dub Taylor as Digger a mole br John Fiedler as Deacon Owl br br br Production br In the book The Rescuers by Margery Sharp had been published to considerable success In Sharp followed up with a sequel titled Miss Bianca That same year the books were optioned by Walt Disney who began developing an animated film adaptation In January story artist Otto Englander wrote a story treatment based on the first book centering on a Norwegian poet unfairly imprisoned in a Siberia like stronghold known as the Black Castle The story was revised with the location changed to Cuba in which the mice would help the poet escape into the United States However as the story became overtly involved in international intrigue Disney shelved the project as he was unhappy with the political overtones In August Englander wrote another treatment featuring Bernard and Bianca rescuing Richard the Lionheart during the Middle Ages br A total of four years were spent working on The Rescuers which was made on a budget of million During the early s The Rescuers reentered development as a project for the young animators led by Don Bluth with the studio planning to alternate between full scale A pictures and smaller scaled back B pictures with simpler animation The animators had selected the most recent book Miss Bianca in the Antarctic to adapt from The new story involved a King penguin deceiving a captured polar bear into performing in shows aboard a schooner causing the unsatisfied bear to place a bottle that would reach the mice Fred Lucky a newly hired storyboard artist was assigned to develop the story adaptation alongside Ken Anderson This version of the story was dropped to which Lucky explained the Arctic setting was too stark a background for the animators Vance Gerry also a storyboard artist also explained director Wolfgang Reitherman decided not to go with Fred Lucky s version He said It s too complicated I want a simple story A little girl gets kidnapped and the mice try to get her back period According to Burny Mattinson he stated Our problem was that the penguin wasn t formidable or evil enough for the audience to believe he would dominate the big bear We struggled with that for a year or so We changed the locale to somewhere in America and it was now a regular zoo and we tried to come up with something with the bear in the zoo and needing to be rescued but that didn t work either br In that version the bear character was still retained but was renamed Louie the Bear Jazz singer Louis Prima was cast in the role and had recorded most of the dialogue and multiple songs that were composed by Floyd Huddleston The writers also expanded the role of his best friend Gus the Lion Huddleston had stated It s about two animals One is Louis Prima he s the polar bear and Redd Foxx is the lion Louis gets cornered into leaving and going to the South Pole where he can make himself a bigger star But he gets homesick he feels fooled They send out little mice as rescuers By November the role of Louie the Bear had been heavily scaled back and then eliminated In one version the bear was meant to be Bernard and Bianca s connection to Penny Gerry explained We developed the sequence where while the two mice are searching for clues as to where Penny has been taken they come across this bear who she had been friends with because the orphanage where Penny was living was near the zoo In the final film the idea was reduced to a simple scene where Bernard enters a zoo and hears a lion s roar that scares him away br br While promoting the release of Robin Hood in Europe Reitherman stated I took Margery Sharp s books along and there was in there a mean woman in a crystal palace When I got back I called some of the guys together and I said We ve got to get a villain in this thing The villainess and her motive to steal a diamond was adapted from the Diamond Duchess in Miss Bianca The setting was then changed to the bayous found in the Southern United States By August the villainess was named the Grand Duchess with Phyllis Diller cast in the role A month later Ken Anderson began depicting Cruella de Vil the villainess from One Hundred and One Dalmatians as the main antagonist of the film Anderson had drawn several sketches of Cruella de Vil sporting alligator leathered chic attire and sunglasses one sketch depicted her wearing bell bottom pants and platform shoes However several staff members such as animator Ollie Johnston stated it felt wrong to attempt a sequel for the character Furthermore Mattinson explained that Milt Kahl did not want to animate Cruella de Vil Milt of course was very strong against that Oh no no We re gonna have a new character I m not gonna do Cruella Mattinson recalled Because he felt that Marc Davis had animated Cruella beautifully He was not gonna go and take his character br The new villain was named Madame Medusa and her appearance was based on Kahl s then wife Phyllis Bounds who was the niece of Lillian Disney whom he divorced in This was Kahl s last film for the studio and he wanted his final character to be his best He was so insistent on perfecting Madame Medusa that he ended up doing almost all the animation for the character himself The kidnapped child Penny was inspired by Patience the orphan in the novel The alligator characters Brutus and Nero was based on the two bloodhounds Tyrant and Torment in the novels For the henchman the filmmakers adapted the character Mandrake into Mr Snoops His appearance was caricatured from John Culhane a journalist who had been interviewing animators at the Disney studios Culhane claimed he was practically tricked into posing for various reactions and his movements were imitated on Mr Snoops s model sheet However he stated Becoming a Disney character was beyond my wildest dreams of glory br The writers had considered depicting Bernard and Bianca as married professional detectives but decided that depicting them as novices in a new relationship was more compelling and romantic For the supporting characters a pint sized swamp mobile for the mice a leaf powered by a dragonfly was created As they developed the comedic potential of displaying his exhaustion through buzzing the dragonfly grew from an incidental into a major character Veteran sound effects artist and voice actor Jimmy MacDonald came out of retirement to provide the effects Additionally the local swamp creatures were originally written as a dedicated home guard that drilled and marched incessantly However the writers rewrote them into a volunteer group of helpful little bayou creatures Their leader a singing bullfrog voiced by Phil Harris was cut from the film as were lines characterizing muskrat Ellie Mae as their outspoken boss For Bernard and Bianca s transportation a pigeon was proposed specifically one that would be catapulted repurposing an unused gag from Robin Hood until Johnston remembered a True Life Adventures film featuring albatrosses and their clumsy take offs and landings leading him suggest that ungainly bird instead A scene of the mice preparing for their adventure with Bianca choosing outfits and Bernard testing James Bond like gadgets was cut for pacing On February co director John Lounsbery died of a heart attack during production Art Stevens an animator was then selected as the new co director br br br Animation br After the commercial success of The Aristocats then vice president Ron Miller pledged that new animators should be hired to ensure a continuity of quality Disney animated films for another generation Eric Larson one of the Nine Old Men animators scouted for potential artists who were studying at art schools and colleges throughout the United States More than artists were brought into the training program Then the selected trainees were to create a black and white animation test which were reviewed at the end of the month The process would continue for several months in which the few finalists were first employed as in betweeners working only on nights and weekends By more than artists were hired during the training program Among those selected were Glen Keane Ron Clements and Andy Gaskill all of whom would play crucial roles in the Disney Renaissance Because of this The Rescuers was the first collaboration between the newly recruited trainees and the senior animators It would also mark the last joint effort by Milt Kahl Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas and the first Disney film Don Bluth had worked on as a directing animator instead of as an assistant animator br Ever since One Hundred and One Dalmatians animation for theatrical Disney animated films had been done by xerography which had only been able to produce black outlines By the time The Rescuers was in production the technology had been improved for the cel artists to use a medium grey toner in order to create a softer looking line br br br Music br br Sammy Fain was first hired as a lyricist and wrote two original songs Swamp Volunteers March and The Rescuers Aid Society Meanwhile the filmmakers had listened to an unproduced musical composed by the songwriting team of Carol Connors and Ayn Robbins Both women had first met each other in on a double date Before then Connors had co composed and sang successful songs such as To Know Him Is to Love Him and Hey Little Cobra with the Teddy Bears Meanwhile Robbins worked as a personal secretary to actors George Kennedy and Eva Gabor and wrote unpublished poetry br Desiring more contemporary songs for the film Reitherman called Connors and Robbins into his office and shown them storyboards of Bernard and Bianca flying on Orville Connors and Robbins then composed Tomorrow Is Another Day to accompany the scene They later composed the symphonic piece The Journey to play during the opening titles Near the end of the film s production Reitherman asked artist Mel Shaw to illustrate pastel sketches to accompany the music Shaw agreed and was assisted by Burny Mattinson br Connors and Robbins wrote another song The Need To Be Loved but Reitherman preferred Fain s song Someone s Waiting for You He nevertheless asked both women to compose new lyrics for the songs They also recomposed a new version of the Rescuers Aid Society song Most of the songs they had written for the film were performed by Shelby Flint Also for the first time since Bambi all the most prominent songs were sung as part of a narrative as opposed to by the film s characters as in most Disney animated films br Describing their collaborative process Robbins noted Carol plays the piano and I play the pencil During production both women were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Gonna Fly Now from Rocky with Bill Conti br br br Songs br Original songs performed in the film include br br Songs heard in the film but not released on the soundtrack include br br Faith is a Bluebird Although not an actual song it is a poem recited by Rufus and partially by Penny in a flashback the old cat has to when he last saw the small orphan girl and comforted her through the poem about having faith The titular bluebird that appears in this sequence originally appeared in Alice in Wonderland br The U S Air Force Serves as the leitmotif for Orville br For Penny s a Jolly Good Fellow Sung by the orphan children at the end of the film as a variation of the song For He s a Jolly Good Fellow br br br Release br br br Original theatrical run br On June The Rescuers premiered at the AFI Silver Theatre in Washington D C and was accompanied

vibrations of real life and real feelings Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote the film is one of the most rousing and appealing animated features ever made by the Disney studio The last production for several members of the original feature animation unit assembled by Walt Disney in the late s the film is both a triumphant swan song and gladdening act of regeneration Dave Kehr of The Chicago Reader praised the film as a beautifully crafted and wonderfully expressive cartoon feature calling it genuinely funny and touching Variety magazine wrote the film was the best work by Disney animators in many years restoring the craft to its former glories In addition it has a more adventurous approach to color and background stylization than previous Disney efforts have displayed with a delicate pastel palette used to wide ranging effect br Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the film doesn t belong in the same category as the great Disney cartoon features Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs Bambi Fantasia but it s a reminder of a kind of slickly cheerful animated entertainment that has become all but extinct Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two and a half stars out of four writing To see any Disney animated film these days is to compare it with Disney classics released or years ago Judged against Pinocchio for example The Rescuers is lightweight indeed
