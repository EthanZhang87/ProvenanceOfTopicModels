The V Smile stylized as V SMILE TV LEARNING SYSTEM is a sixth generation educational home video game console manufactured and released by VTech The system was first released on August Its titles are available on ROM cartridges called Smartridges a pun on the system s educational nature Several variants of the V Smile console are sold including handheld versions and models with added functionality such as touch tablet integrated controllers or microphones The V Motion is a variant that includes motion sensitive controllers and has titles designed to take advantage of motion related active learning br Several versions of V Smile and V Motion consoles continued to be sold after newer models were introduced frequently offered in alternative color schemes placing the systems in various niches of the educational toy market Some key differentiators between systems and the ability to fully utilize all game functions include the options of a microphone touch tablet additional joystick port for player gameplay stylus enhanced controller or motion sensitive game pad with V Motion br br br Hardware br A V Smile generally has on and off buttons two joystick ports and a compartment for keeping the cartridges in addition to the cartridge slot The system can run using either an AC adapter or with batteries The V Smile can hold up to six titles in this compartment br The V Smile is a standard cartridge based system that will play the title inserted When there is no cartridge inserted the startup logo plays continuously The graphics of games are primarily sprite based br The console is often bundled with a particular game the original and most popular being a game called Alphabet Park Adventure Other pack in games included a Winnie the Pooh game bundled with a Orange Purple console variant a pink purple colored console was shipped later targeting girls and bundled with a Cinderella game and a later Red Blue and Red Silver model which was bundled with a Scooby Doo game br The V Smile was released in several countries with different names br br The buttons on the game system and controllers are large to accommodate small children s less developed manual dexterity The default controllers consist of an joystick four colored buttons a large Enter button a Learning Zone button that immediately takes the player to a minigame section of the software an Exit button that either brings up an option to end the game or to keep playing or to exit out of any menu that the player is in and a Help button which repeats the spoken instructions or hints provided by the game to the player A small latch on the bottom of the controller allows the analog stick to be moved to the other side of the buttons in order to accommodate left handed players This makes it the first console to be bundled with an ambidextrous controller br br br Variants br A second generation of the V Smile console was launched in This model Model is bundled with a microphone and a redesigned controller was shipped which now comes with a graphics tablet built in However the design of the console is the same as the first apart from the presence of a microphone holder The internals of the system also appear to be based upon the design of the first generation console as software meant for the first generation console is playable on the second generation console and vice versa although software that takes advantage of the microphone feature will disable the sections of the software that requires the use of the microphone if played on the first generation console br br In a translucent faced V Smile TV Learning System Limited Edition console was released including two joysticks and the Alphabet Park Adventure game cartridge The console colors were reversed translucent orange face with purple body from the normal console colors solid purple face with orange body br The last revision of the console Model was the smallest of the main line becoming shorter and square in shape it retains controller ports but it adds V Link functionality and the cartridge storage on the back removed the cover and became smaller with space for only games The console also drops stereo sound having a video and mono audio jack br br br V Smile Pocket and V Smile Cyber Pocket br The V Smile Pocket is a handheld version of the V Smile console released on September It features a built in Passive matrix based color LCD display and a monaural speaker but is otherwise similar to the desktop console counterpart However there is no connector for an additional joystick and thus many games that support two player mode will disallow access selection of the said mode The device is not compatible with games that uses any of the other accessories due to the lack of an additional joystick port It was originally introduced in Orange Purple but a Pink Purple model was introduced later in line with the color schemes available for the desktop console br A second V Smile Pocket model was introduced in in which a microphone is added to the device Apart from the new feature added support for games that use the microphone and a repositioning of the speaker from the lower right to the upper left it retained the appearance of the first V Smile Pocket model Still if compared side by side a slight difference in the bulkiness of the lower half of the unit can be seen with the New V Smile Pocket being a bit slimmer and narrower towards the bottom The game system is larger than devices such as the Game Boy Advance or Nintendo DS although the V Smile Pocket uses full size Smartridges from the console and is generally offered at lower prices in most of the markets br A third generation called V Smile Cyber Pocket was introduced in The console was redesigned with a smaller flip open screen still Passive matrix based and an integrated graphics tablet while retaining the microphone introduced in the second generation V Smile Pocket A proprietary port was added to the console which a flash drive like device called the V Link with a matching proprietary connector on one end and a USB connector on another could plug into the Cyber Pocket This device is used to transfer the data of games that support such function to a PC which would in turn upload the data to a website The data could then be used to chart the player s progress as well as be used to unlock bonus games on the said website br During s Black Friday sales limited supplies of New V Smile Pocket units were sold at U S Walmart stores for the reduced price of USD This was roughly half of the cost of a single Xbox Game Disc at that time and nearly one tenth the cost of a PlayStation Portable game system bundle br br br PC Pal br The PC Pal released on June is a variant of the basic V Smile console with an integrated accessory a more colorful and functional version of the Smart Keyboard accessory with built in joystick and tablet controls Unlike a regular V Smile system the V Smile PC Pal has a port for the V Link accessory It comes bundled with a Smartridge of games for the keyboard that teach typing and other basic keyboard skills The main unit looks like a standard V Smile system with the name PC Pal printed on it It can play all Smartridges but since the joystick controls are built into the keyboard the setup is more easily used on a desktop surface with a small TV serving as a monitor similar to a personal computer For someone who already owns a V Smile the Smart Keyboard accessory and a touch tablet enhanced joystick will provide a similar experience Since the keyboard can be disconnected and a standard joystick or other V Smile accessory used the PC Pal can function as a normal V Smile system br br br V Motion and V Smile Motion br br A newer variant of the V Smile is the V Motion Active Learning System Model or V Smile Motion released in September It uses built in wireless controller with accelerometers that detect three axes of movement The controller can be tilted in a direction to achieve a result on the screen The V Motion controller is adaptable by handedness br Titles released after the V Motion system are designed to use its motion controls However the traditional joystick directional control can be used and all Smartridge titles can be played across the V Smile line of systems The system s storage compartment can hold up to nine Smartridges br The V Motion won the National Parenting Center s Seal of Approval for and the Creative Child Seal of Excellence br br br Accessories br The V Smile TV Learning System Plus Joystick includes a built in writing pad and stylus The joystick with writing pad works on both the original V Smile and the New V Smile TV Learning System and can be used to take advantage of newer Smartridges that use the writing pad functionality in games br The V Smile Smart Keyboard is a PC like keyboard that can be connected to a V Smile System console It includes several activities and lessons that teach typing letters spelling and logic br The V Smile Smartbook includes the Smartbook an interface with a stylus that holds activity books and works together with Smartridges an idea pioneered by Sega with their Sega Pico and Japan only Advanced Pico Beena educational gaming systems The activity book plays along with the smartridge and the Smartbook knows which page is being used while the touch sensitive stylus directs the play The Smartbook may come bundled with a Scooby Doo Activity Book Smartridge Additional Activity Book and Smartridge combos such as Dora s Got A Puppy or Toy Story are also available to use with the SmartBook device br The V Smile Art Studio is a large touch pad and stylus device that allows for paintings to appear on screen Interactive stamps color palette picture drawing color mixing animation maker coloring in pictures are some of the features of the Art Studio It comes with an Art Studio specific Smartridge br The V Smile V Link is an accessory that works only with the Cyber Pocket PC Pal V Motion systems and a few of the newer V Smiles It allows the user to track their progress by keeping the accessory plugged into the Game Console where it automatically tracks a child s progress and scores When plugging the V Link into a PC s USB port it auto connects to a secure website where the child can see how they rank against all V Smile players also using V Link As children play more of their Smartridges and master more skills they are rewarded with online bonus games that are unlocked by their progress br The V Smile Jammin Gym Class is similar to dance pads made popular by Dance Dance Revolution It is called a soft exercise mat for interactive play dance and exercise by VTech It includes different active learning activities and connects directly to either the V Smile TV Learning System or the V Smile V Motion with the Jammin Gym Class cartridge It helps teach letters numbers colors spelling and health concepts br Note Aside from the V Link these accessories are intended for the TV connected consoles not handheld versions of the V Smile br br br Competition and comparisons br The V Motion was introduced as a low cost educational alternative to the popular Wii console to which it has been compared due to its use of motion controllers br The V Smile Pocket s direct competition is the handheld Leapster by LeapFrog The Leapster TV Learning System is the less high profile but available counterpart to the multiple V Smile and V Motion consoles that are direct connect to the TV The Leapster L Max is comparable to the V Smile Cyber Pocket and is stylus enhanced VTech has the advantage in number and diversity of available accessories such as SmartBooks and Art Studio whereas LeapFrog s Leapster accessories are generally focused on portability options such as batteries and cases The Leapster is also more technically powerful then the V Smile albeit with a lower screen resolution and audio quality br The V Smile family in general is more focused on TV connectability while the Leapster family is more focused on the handheld portable systems but both VTech and LeapFrog have moved to compete with one another on both fronts Leapster systems and games tend to be slightly more expensive than V Smile games The Leapster does have an age range for some games that reaches up to age which is territory more for the V Flash than the V Smile Noteworthy is that both LeapFrog and VTech continue to sell previous generation handhelds at a reduced price compared to the Leapster and the New Improved V Smile Pocket br The V Smile PC Pal variant console and Smart Keyboard accessory faces direct competition with LeapFrog s ClickStart educational computer offering and indirect competition with various toy educational laptops and low cost desktop PCs with children software and child friendly accessories installed While the V Smile SmartBook console may have faced competition from the Sega Pico due to the similarity of the concepts the Sega Pico was not available outside Japan for a long time br Rough comparisons in technological capability with the V Smile consoles in terms of graphics and sound can be made to Nintendo s SNES console thus generally the V Smile is technologically comparable to most fourth generation consoles despite being released in the seventh generation era The V Smile systems in general are offered for a fraction of the price of those consoles when they were new and the V Smile systems were designed specifically for children with a focus on education br Durability and quality of plastics and other components of the V Smile systems is in line with expectations given the low cost of the devices Replacement game system hardware can often be bought for less than the cost of a single game on dedicated current generation console game systems from Sony Microsoft or Nintendo on the market br br br Games br The majority of educational game Smartridges for the V Smile involve licensed characters popular with children Some properties used are Scooby Doo Bob the Builder The Little Mermaid Go Diego Go and The Wiggles CGI animated characters from movies also found their way to the V Smile including Kung Fu Panda Ratatouille Finding Nemo and Cars VTech also offers less commercial or traditional characters in games such as Soccer Little Red Riding Hood and Whiz Kid Wheels br Smartridges are labeled for the intended age of players Two major categories are Junior Thinkers Ages and Master Minds Ages There are also Beginner s games with age ranges of and Advanced games for ages such as SpongeBob SquarePants A Day in The Life of a Sponge The educational content and difficulty of gameplay is age appropriate For example in Dora s Fix it Adventure Ages Dora will not fall from the edge of a platform if the child makes a mistake when moving her Instead she will get up on her tiptoes and appear unbalanced For children in the older age range Cinderella and Batman games offer more challenging educational and action based gameplay br Some titles may include the text New and Improved Version on the covers These are updated versions of existing game titles that now include microphone and or touch tablet enhanced gameplay such as Sing Along through use of the microphone feature that was added to second generation V Smile consoles and the New V Smile Pocket br br br List of V Smile games br br Several games were released in different countries and as a result of the console being aimed at younger children who might not know English they were translated into their respective languages The games also have a suggested age range on the box that sometimes changes depending on which country it was released in The Console and its games were sometimes distributed by different companies such as Concentra in Portugal and Giochi Preziosi in Italy br Some V Smile games were rereleased with V Motion functionality All Smartridge titles are compatible with the V Smile family of systems including the original V Smile system V Motion V Smile Pocket and Cyber Pocket br The cartridges are light purple in color but there are others ones that work with accessories are bright yellow V Smile SmartBook games are red and transparent dark purple cartridges which came with several bundles of the special edition console in different games Cartridges designed for V Motion are a rounded top with a hole in the shape of a V and are orange in color br There are known unreleased titles Adventures in Oz which was listed on Amazon by VTech in before the console was released but it is unknown if it was ever developed or if when why it was cancelled and also the German VTech plans to make an untitled Bumba game it was cancelled in the Netherlands and in Germany br There were titles known to have been released br br br V Smile Baby Infant Development System br br An unrelated and separate spin off system called the V Smile Baby Infant Development System was released shortly after the original V Smile TLS was introduced to the market The games and cartridges of a V Smile Baby IDS are not compatible with a V Smile TLS and vice versa This is an important distinction since so many of the other consoles named V Smile are inter compatible The control system for the V Smile Baby Infant Development System is significantly different from those used in the V Smile TLS that is targeted at older children it does not have the features of a typical game controller instead the design is more like that of a playboard The controls consist of a mode slider two switches one for power and the other toggles the board between standalone play mode and console control mode buttons shape buttons a fun button a small Exit button and a roller ball hooked up to a sensor The controller itself has a speaker which comes into play during standalone mode in which it functions as a playboard that play music speech and sound when interacted with The controller communicates with the console by means of infrared signaling and runs off six AA Lithium batteries It also lacks a pink variant for girls V Smile Baby only ships with an orange color scheme br The console itself is rather unusual in design having only an on off switch and permanently attached cables carrying composite video signal and mono audio through two RCA connectors It runs off four AA Lithium batteries or a V DC power supply sold separately although European systems are missing the DC in port only being able to use batteries The console has a cartridge slot as well as indents to hold four additional cartridges for storage Also powering off the controller will also power off the console if the console is switched on at the time It was designed for kids ages months Years old br It was released in several countries with different names br br br List of V Smile Baby games br br This is an possibly incomplete list of games for the system br Most games were released in both NTSC and PAL with PAL region titles sometimes having a different English name to its US counterparts Most games were also translated for other European market languages br The game Bailey Goes to Town came included with the Bailey Teddy bear that functioned as a controller br There were only titles known to have been released br br br Region protection and inter compatibility br br Even though the V Smile range of games are compatible with most of its consoles the V Smile Baby games aren t The cartridges are shorter but are also thicker and wider than normal V Smile ones meaning they can t fit on other systems However both cartridges have the same connector and pins meaning V Smile Smartridges which are slimmer and narrower can be physically inserted into the V Smile Baby and connected although it s harder to do so and the game won t work with the console br The V Smile range of consoles are apparently not region locked While the console itself come in NTSC and PAL versions and the BIOS on the consoles appear to be region specific distinguishable from the speech sample played in the screen after the VTech logo when the console is started with no cartridge inserted games purchased from an NTSC region can play on PAL systems and vice versa Observations suggest that both the V Smile and V Smile Infant Development System used different methods of booting The V Smile and V Smile Pocket variants will apparently boot into their own BIOS then obligingly run the software on the cartridge br The V Smile Baby appears to boot from the default BIOS when a cartridge of the same region is inserted or when there s no cartridge in the system but appears to boot from a different BIOS when a cartridge of a different region is inserted Currently it is unknown if the extra BIOS resides on the cartridge or on the console itself br br br Reception br Research by the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP and the National Institutes of Health NIH show that Vtech s V Smile Baby product marketed for ages nine months to three years may not meet the claims that it helps with early childhood development or education in any way stating that children ages to years are basically too young to understand anything and many cannot watch TV br On October AAP s Council on Communications and media released a report titled Media Use by Children Younger than Years concluded that the educational merit of media for children younger than two years remains unproven despite the fact that three quarters of the top selling infant videos make explicit or implicit educational claims and further found that media viewing by children under years of age can have a negative effect on language development br Video game and technology critics are also quick to discount Vtech s line of products including V Smile ages V Smile Baby ages m V Flash ages V Smile Pocket ages and V Reader citing the lack of professionally developed games as VTech consoles had no major third party video game publishers by aside from Disney Interactive br Critics also state that the V Smile proves the notion that the need for special electronics for children is artificial as products like mainstream consoles Xbox PlayStation Wii tablets iPad Android and computers PC Mac have a variety of educational and children s software Furthermore such devices offer flexibility that allows children to grow with them not outgrow them br br br See also br V Flash br VTech Socrates br VTech br br br br br br External links br Official website archived
