earliest history is still visible in its streetmap and centuries of rulers adding their respective architectural marks on the capital has resulted in an accumulated wealth of history rich monuments and buildings whose beauty played a large part in giving the city the reputation it has today At its origin before the Middle Ages the city was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine of those two remain today le Saint Louis and the le de la Cit A third one is the artificially created le aux Cygnes br Modern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to Napoleon III and his Prefect of the Seine Baron Haussmann Between and they rebuilt the city centre created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected imposed standard facades along the boulevards and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream grey Paris stone They also built the major parks around the city centre The high residential population of

Suburbs br br Aside from the th century addition of the Bois de Boulogne the Bois de Vincennes and the Paris heliport Paris s administrative limits have remained unchanged since A greater administrative Seine department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity To address this problem the parent District de la r gion parisienne district of the Paris region was reorganised into several new departments from Paris became a department in itself and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it The district of the Paris region was renamed le de France in but this abbreviated Paris region name is still commonly used today to describe the le de France and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration Long intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began on January when the M tropole du Grand Paris came into existence br Paris s disconnect with its suburbs its lack of suburban transportation in particular became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration s growth Paul Delouvrier promised to resolve the Paris suburbs m sentente when he became head of the Paris region in two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban villes nouvelles new cities and the RER commuter train network Many other suburban residential districts grands ensembles were built between the s and s to provide a low cost solution for a rapidly expanding population These districts were socially mixed at first but few residents actually owned their homes the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the s Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities br These areas quartiers sensibles sensitive quarters are in northern and eastern Paris namely around its Goutte d Or and Belleville neighbourhoods To the north of the city they are grouped mainly in the Seine Saint Denis department and to a lesser extreme to the east in the Val d Oise department Other difficult areas are located in the Seine valley in vry et Corbeil Essonnes Essonne in Mureaux Mantes la Jolie Yvelines and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier s ville nouvelle political initiative br The Paris agglomeration s urban sociology is basically that of th century Paris the wealthy live in the west and southwest and the middle to working classes are in the north and east The remaining areas are mostly middle class dotted with wealthy islands located there due to reasons of historical importance namely Saint Maur des Foss s to the east and Enghien les Bains to the north of Paris br br br Demographics br br The official estimated population of the City of Paris on January was down from on January according to the INSEE the official French statistical agency According to INSEE the population has dropped by or about five percent over the past decade The Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo declared that this illustrated the de densification of the city creating more green space and less crowding Despite the drop Paris remains the most densely populated city in Europe with residents per hectare not counting parks This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate the departure of middle class residents and the possible loss of housing in the city due to short term rentals for tourism br Paris is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union following Berlin Madrid and Rome Eurostat places Paris million people behind London million and ahead of Berlin million based on the populations of what Eurostat calls urban audit core cities br The population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of million in The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between and Factors in the migration included de industrialisation high rent the gentrification of many inner
