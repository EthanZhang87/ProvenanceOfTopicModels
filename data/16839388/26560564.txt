reception of the character was mixed Following his debut in Cars Mater was described as the series breakout character and made prominent appearances in Cars animated series and short films Several critics disliked his lead role in Cars particularly for taking the spotlight away from Lightning McQueen with some comparing him to the Star Wars character Jar Jar Binks br br br Development br br br Concept and creation br Mater takes his name from construction superintendent and die hard NASCAR fan Douglas Mater Keever who was later invited by Pixar to provide the voice of one of the motorhome characters watching Lightning McQueen race at the beginning of the film Cars director John Lasseter met him in while conducting research for the film at Lowe s Motor Speedway near Charlotte Upon meeting Lasseter Keever introduced himself by the nickname he had been given in childhood My name s Mater Yeah like tuh mater but without the tuh This line was eventually used by the character in the film Keever explained that the nickname originated in him throwing tomatoes around his family s farm Lasseter was immediately interested in him as he felt that he was a definitive NASCAR fan Although the cheerful truck character was originally intended to be a flatbed Lasseter realised that the concept was not working and came up with the idea of a tow truck instead using Keever s nickname as a pun to create Tow Mater br br Mater s driving skills include a claim to be the world s best backwards driver an ability inspired by Dean Walker a Kansas Historic Route Association president known in Riverton as Crazy Legs Walker the Ambassador of Crazy Feet on Route for his ability to twist his feet backward and walk in reverse The Pixar production team met Walker during a nine day tour of Route guided by historian Michael Wallis in and decided to include his ability in the film Wallis was keen for the production team to incorporate aspects of the people that they met on the trip into the car characters to make them more human He also said that Mater s character was inspired partly by a troubadour in Erick Okla who wears a redneck tuxedo named Harley Russell According to Wallis Mater s appearance was inspired by a rusty old tow truck that they came across in Galena which he knew would end up in the film Wallis recalled the moment that inspired Mater s design There was an old wrecker in an empty lot by Route in Galena Kan Joe Ranft the studio s head of story and a key member of the Pixar team stopped and noticed it and Mater was born The inspiration for the character was a International Harvester tow truck that was used to pull equipment from the lead mines of Galena and following the release of the film was parked outside the former Kan O Tex Service Station as a tourist attraction Due to copyright reasons Disney requested that the truck be renamed so the owners decided to call it Tow Tater br br br Voice br br Tow Mater is voiced by American stand up comedian Larry the Cable Guy He said that he loved voicing the character because it was completely different to anything he had done previously He is the voice of Mater in Cars Cars and Cars and also voices the character in Mater and the Ghostlight Cars Toons and the Cars video games Lasseter entered into talks with Larry the Cable Guy after watching the Blue Collar Comedy Tour with co director Joe Ranft and found his performance hilarious Lasseter said His accent was so thick but you could understand everything he was saying He described him as the funniest comedian you will ever see Sweet and irreverent br Recalling his first voice recording session for Mater Larry the Cable Guy said that he was encouraged by Lasseter to voice the character in his own way after stating that he would not say the lines in the way they were written According to his voice actor Mater was originally going to be named Zeb Larry the Cable Guy said that he was relieved that the Pixar team decided upon the name Mater because he thought it sounded cuter He joked My name s Zeb like web only without the wa You know it wouldn t have had the same ring to it Rick Dempsey senior vice president of Disney character voices said that finding regional voice actors for international dubbings of the Cars films proved to be a challenge due to Mater being kind of a redneck which the Pixar team knew would have little meaning in other countries He said that for each country the team had to work out which areas were more of an uneducated population without being offensive br br br Characterization br br Tow Mater is a rusty tow truck and the owner of Tow Mater Towing and Salvage in the small town of Radiator Springs He is the loyal best friend of Lightning McQueen and deeply values their friendship Mater is characterized by his cheerful and honest personality but he also enjoys telling stories to his friends Lasseter described Mater as loveable and a sweetheart He considered Larry the Cable Guy to be the embodiment of the character For Cars Lasseter wanted to give Mater more growth and focused the film on the character s friendship with Lightning McQueen He explained that Mater s innocence is a core aspect of the story illustrating this in the moment when Mater realises that the other car characters are not laughing with him but laughing at him br br br Appearances br br br Cars filmography

br br br Reception br Steve Daly of Entertainment Weekly described Mater as the breakout star of Cars commenting that he steals every scene he s part of Michael Agger of Slate commented that although Mater comes across as a Southern stereotype he is presented in a positive light He praised Mater s drawl as a lovely instrument overflowing with character and the sweetness of his friendship with Lightning McQueen Empire s Olly Richards singled him out as the only character that the audience was likely to remember at the film s credits describing the other characters as not particularly funny Phil Patton of The New York Times described Mater as the most lovable character in the film According to Matt Soergel of The Florida Times Union Mater was the best character in Cars He praised both his sweet dim exuberant personality and rusted dented buck toothed appearance as the character s standout features while finding the other characters to be bland Kristen Page Kirby writing for The Washington Post likened Mater to the gravedigger in Hamlet saying that he is well written entertaining and serves the purpose of showing Lightning McQueen the real meaning of happiness but added that like the gravedigger Mater was not written to be a main character br Mater s prominent role in the plot of Cars received an unfavourable review from A O Scott of The New York Times who described him as Pixar s redneck Jar Jar Binks and considered it a calamitous move He disliked his exaggerated drawl and thought that Mater is dumb excitable and puppy dog loyal his idiot savant automotive expertise grounded in humble blue collar simplicity Aly Semigran writing for Entertainment Weekly reflected on this and also questioned why he had been given top billing in the film despite being the second banana to Lightning McQueen but felt that he would not ultimately be detrimental to the franchise In a Time review of the second film Mary Pols expressed surprise to discover that Lightning McQueen had not yet rid himself of needy dopey Mater and described the film as a Materthon commenting that the character left her longing for WALL E s robot to crush him into a silent cube Todd Mccarthy of The Hollywood Reporter found Mater acceptable as a side character but quickly became tired of his Hee Haw routine and saddlesore witticisms In his review of the film for The Guardian Peter Bradshaw thought it was strange that Mater had been chosen to take the lead and commented that although he is cast as the star he doesn t have really anything funny or interesting to say or do A A Dowd of The A V Club wrote that placing Mater in the film s leading role was the biggest sin of Cars He likened Mater s espionage storyline to The Man Who Knew Too Little with Bill Murray as Mater and described him as a fairly one note character built mostly for comic relief By contrast Matt Fowler writing for IGN thought it was the right decision to give Mater the lead role as he considered Lightning to be a dry character br Polygon writer Julia Alexander opined that with the release of Cars Pixar attempted to ignore the events of Cars making no reference to Mater s heroism and honorary knighthood in the second film due to its poor reception and instead focused the third film squarely on Lightning McQueen Matt Singer of ScreenCrush also noticed that Mater did not play a prominent role in the third film and was for the most part sidelined by Cruz Ramirez in the role of sidekick br br br br br br External links
