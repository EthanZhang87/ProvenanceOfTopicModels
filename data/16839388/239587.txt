Marlin frantically pursues the boat in vain Marlin meets Dory a blue tang with acute short term memory loss who offers to help him The two encounter Bruce Anchor and Chum three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating fish Marlin finds a diver s mask that fell from the boat and accidentally injures Dory with it The scent of her blood sends Bruce into a frenzy and he accidentally sets off old naval mines the sharks Marlin and Dory are able to swim to safety before the mines blow up br Nemo is placed in a fish tank in the office of dentist Philip Sherman in Sydney He meets the Tank Gang led by Gill a scarred Moorish idol Sherman plans to give Nemo to his niece Darla who killed her previous pet fish Gill who also wishes to return to the ocean devises an escape plan Nemo the smallest fish in the tank will block the aquarium s filter tube with a pebble obliging Sherman to put the fish into bags while he cleans the tank This will allow them to roll out the window and into the harbor Nemo attempts to block the filter but fails and is almost killed by the filter s machinery causing Gill to feel deeply regretful br The diver s mask falls into a deep trench As Marlin and Dory search for it they are attacked by an anglerfish but manage to trap it using the mask Dory memorizes the address written on the mask A school of moonfish give the pair directions to the East Australian Current On their way Marlin and Dory become trapped in a forest of jellyfish After being stung and knocked unconscious they awaken in the East Australian Current with a large group of sea turtles including Crush and his son Squirt The story of Marlin s quest is relayed by the turtles all across the ocean to Sydney where it reaches Nigel a pelican who regularly converses with the Tank Gang Nigel tells the Tank Gang of Marlin s journey motivating Nemo to try blocking the filter again Nemo is successful and the aquarium quickly becomes covered in green algae br After exiting the current Marlin and Dory get lost and are consumed by a blue whale The whale expels them through its blowhole into Sydney Harbour Nigel takes Marlin and Dory to Sherman s office where Nemo is playing dead to avoid being given to Darla this causes Marlin to believe Nemo is really dead Sherman forces Nigel out of his office and Gill helps Nemo escape through the sink drain that leads to the ocean br Deeply shaken

Dory joins Marlin and together they wave goodbye to Nemo as he leaves with his class br Meanwhile after the dentist s new filter breaks the Tank Gang escapes into Sydney Harbour in their plastic bags Now successfully in the ocean but still stuck in the bags they ponder what to do next br br br Voice cast br br br Production br br br Development br br The inspiration for Finding Nemo sprang from multiple experiences going back to director Andrew Stanton s childhood when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home In shortly after his son was born he and his family took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom which was called Marine World at the time There after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation Later in he took his son for a walk in the park but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father son experience that day br In an interview with National Geographic magazine Stanton said that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an anemone br br It was so arresting I had no idea what kind of fish they were but I couldn t take my eyes off them And as an entertainer the fact that they were called clownfish it was perfect There s almost nothing more appealing than these little fish that want to play peekaboo with you br br In addition clownfish are colorful but do not tend to come out of an anemone often For a character who has to go on a dangerous journey Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect type of fish for the character Pre production of the film began in early Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post production of A Bug s Life As a result Finding Nemo began production with a complete screenplay something that co director Lee Unkrich called very unusual for an animated film The artists took scuba diving lessons to study the coral reef br Stanton originally planned to use flashbacks to reveal how Coral died but realized that by the end of the film there would be nothing to reveal deciding to show how she died at the beginning of the movie The character of Gill also was different from the character seen in the final film In a scene that was eventually deleted Gill tells Nemo that he s from a place called Bad Luck Bay and that he has brothers and sisters in order to impress the young clownfish only for the latter to find out that he was lying by listening to a patient reading a children s storybook that shares exactly the same details br br br Casting br William H Macy was the first actor cast as Marlin Although Macy had recorded most of the dialogue Stanton felt that the character needed a lighter touch Stanton then cast Albert Brooks in the role and in his opinion it saved the film Brooks liked the idea of Marlin being this clownfish who isn t funny and recorded outtakes of telling very bad jokes br The idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Stanton and Bob Peterson while they were driving to record the actors Although he originally envisioned the character of Dory as male Stanton was inspired to cast Ellen DeGeneres when he watched an episode of Ellen in which he saw her change the subject five times before finishing one sentence The pelican character named Gerald who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory was originally a friend of Nigel They were going to play against each other with Nigel being neat and fastidious and Gerald being scruffy and sloppy The filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow the pace of the picture so Gerald s character was minimized br Stanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle He originally did the voice for the film s story reel and assumed they would find an actor later When Stanton s performance became popular in test screenings he decided to keep his performance in the film He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in Unkrich s office Crush s son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird the young son of fellow Pixar director Brad Bird According to Stanton the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day Stanton felt the voice was this generation s Thumper and immediately cast Nicholas br Megan Mullally was originally going to provide a voice in the film According to Mullally the producers were stunned to learn that the voice of her character Karen Walker on the television show Will Grace was not her natural speaking voice The producers hired her anyway and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role When Mullally refused she was dismissed br br br Animation br To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography They visited aquariums went diving in Hawaii and received in house lectures from an ichthyologist As a result Pixar s animator for Dory Gini Cruz Santos integrated the fish movement human movement and facial expressions to make them look and feel like real characters Production designer Ralph Eggleston created pastel drawings to give the lighting crew led by Sharon Calahan ideas of how every scene in the film should be lit br The Great white shark Bruce is in reference to the animatronic shark used in the Universal film Jaws The shark they had used on set was nicknamed Bruce after Bruce Raiman who was Steven Spielberg s divorce lawyer The line Here s Brucey is a reference to the Jack Nicholson line from the horror film The Shining Additionally the music that plays for the dentist s niece Darla is the theme music from the Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho br The film was dedicated to Glenn McQueen a Pixar animator who died of melanoma in October Finding Nemo shares many plot elements with Pierrot the Clownfish a children s book published in but allegedly conceived in The author Franck Le Calvez sued Disney for infringement of his intellectual rights and to bar Finding Nemo merchandise in France The judge ruled against him citing the color differences between Pierrot and Nemo br br br Localization br br In Disney Character Voices International s senior vice president Rick Dempsey in collaboration with the Navajo Nation Museum created a Navajo dubbing of the movie titled Nemo H d st which was released in theaters March of the same year The project was thought as a means to preserve Navajo language teaching the language to kids through a Disney movie The studio held auditions on the reservation but finding an age appropriate native speaker to voice Nemo was hard Dempsey said as the majority of native Navajo speakers are over years old The end credits version of the song Beyond the Sea covered in the English version by Robbie Williams was also adapted into Navajo with Fall Out Boy s lead singer Patrick Stump performing it In Finding Nemo was the second movie to receive a dub in Navajo after Star Wars br br br Soundtrack br br Finding Nemo
