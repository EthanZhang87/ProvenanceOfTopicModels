Lithuanians belong to the ethnolinguistic group of the Balts and speak Lithuanian one of only a few living members of the Baltic branch of the Indo European language family which is also the most widely spoken language of the branch br For millennia the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various Baltic tribes In the s Lithuanian lands were united for the first time by Mindaugas who formed the Kingdom of Lithuania on July Subsequent expansion and consolidation resulted in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania which by the th century was the largest country in Europe In the Grand Duchy entered into a de facto personal union with the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland The two realms were united into the bi confederal Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth in forming one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries until neighbouring countries gradually dismantled it between and with the Russian Empire annexing most of

story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva Litua pronounced litua Due to lack of reliable evidence the true meaning of the name is unknown and scholars still debate it There are a few plausible versions br Since Lietuva has a suffix uva there should be a corresponding original word with no suffix A likely candidate is Liet Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms Usually such names evolved through the following process hydronym toponym ethnonym Lietava a small river not far from Kernav the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania is usually credited as the source of the name However the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation On the other hand such naming is not unprecedented in world history br Art ras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis that Lietuva relates to the word lei iai plural of leitis From the middle of the th century lei iai were a distinct warrior social group of the Lithuanian society subordinate to the Lithuanian ruler or the state itself The word lei iai is used in th century historical sources as an ethnonym for Lithuanians but not Samogitians and is still used usually poetically or in historical contexts in the Latvian language which is closely related to Lithuanian br br br History br br The history of Lithuania dates back to settlements founded about years ago but the first written record of the name for the country dates back to AD Lithuanians one of the Baltic peoples later conquered neighboring lands and established the Grand Duchy of Lithuania

adopt Christianity beginning in the th century A formidable power it became the largest state in Europe in the th century spread from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea through the conquest of large groups of East Slavs who resided in Ruthenia br In the Grand Duchy formed a dynastic union with Poland through the Union of Krewo Later the Union of Lublin created the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth During the Second Northern War the Grand Duchy sought protection under the Swedish Empire through the Union of K dainiai in However it soon returned to being a part of the Polish Lithuanian state
