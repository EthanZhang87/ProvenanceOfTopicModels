scenes rather than actual frame by frame animation br Actual footage of live actors mouths moving instead of animated lips on the characters a technique known as Synchro Vox The most well known example of this form of animation was the Clutch Cargo series br A Cold War era plot pitting true freedom loving American superheroes against a stereotypical Communist supervillain br The sidekick which Frozone is portrayed as being ensnared by the supervillain so that complete emphasis can be placed on the main hero who nevertheless thanks the sidekick for his involvement in stopping the villain br Frozone speaking in forced beatnik slang showing the out of touch depiction of minority characters in animated works at the time br A cute animal sidekick only added for children s appeal

addition to the many in jokes and animation references included in this film Craig T Nelson and Samuel L Jackson provided a DVD commentary for the fictional show acting in character as Mr Incredible and Frozone as if sitting down and watching this for the first time br The in universe background behind Mr Incredible and Pals stated that many years before the Supers were banned Mr Incredible and Frozone licensed their names and images to a television animation company and this was the pilot episode for an animated television series that never aired due to the Super ban The two supers are watching this pilot for the first time several years after it was produced br The commentary of the two characters provides additional entertainment for the DVD s viewers as they react with shock and disbelief to the poor quality of the film br While Mr Incredible appears to display only apathy for the show Frozone is aghast and disgusted at its campiness and supposed racism the show s version of himself appears to be white or tan as Mr Incredible assumed some of the color faded while in storage He is also annoyed by Mr Skipperdoo and Lady Lightbug the former due to it being a thinly veiled marketing ploy toward kids and the latter because it was a made up villain By the end of the short Frozone is so annoyed that he walks out of the commentary at the end demanding the episode never be aired br br br Cast br Roger Jackson as The Narrator and Evil Cornhead br Pete Docter as Mr Incredible br Michael Asberry as Frozone br Celia Schuman as Lady Lightbug br Commentary br br Craig T

portrays him and the fact that the film makes them fight alongside a bunny Mr Incredible then speaks to Rick Dicker who agrees to shelve the film br On a level of Lego The Incredibles during a burning building Frozone creates an ice bridge to make the tenants come across one of them then told him and Mr Incredible that she once saw him on TV where he made the exact same bridge but due to their vigilante disguises she couldn t recognize him and said he looked nothing like Frozone referencing his tan appearance br In a Pixar Animation Internship Reel a couple of animators created clips to
