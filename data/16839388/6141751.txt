dream she shared with her late father She works two waitress jobs to earn the money she needs leaving no time for a social life In early Naveen the arrogant prince of Maldonia arrives in New Orleans His parents have cut him off from the family fortune so he intends to marry Charlotte La Bouff Tiana s best friend Charlotte s father wealthy Eli Big Daddy La Bouff hosts a masquerade ball in Naveen s honor for which Charlotte hires Tiana to make beignets paying her enough to buy a dilapidated mill to convert into her dream restaurant Naveen and his valet Lawrence encounter Dr Facilier an evil voodoo witch doctor who plans to rule New Orleans Facilier transforms Naveen into a frog and Lawrence into a doppelganger of Naveen using a voodoo talisman containing Naveen s blood Facilier intends for the disguised Lawrence to marry Charlotte then to kill her father with a voodoo doll so he can gain the La Bouff fortune br At the ball Tiana learns she has been outbid for the mill Upset she accidentally spills beignets and sauce on her outfit so Charlotte lends her a princess costume Feeling disheartened she begins wishing on a star when Naveen appears in frog form Thinking Tiana is a real princess he asks her to kiss him to break the spell Tiana reluctantly agrees since Naveen can give her enough money for the mill However she is transformed into a frog much to Tiana s horror The two are chased into a nearby bayou where they meet a jazz loving alligator named Louis When they explain their predicament he tells them of Mama Odie another voodoo practitioner who lives in the bayou Naveen convinces Louis to take him and Tiana to see Mama Odie so he can ask her to turn him into a human as well to accomplish his dream of being a professional jazz musician br However Louis does not know the way to Mama Odie a Cajun firefly named Ray who knows Mama Odie helps the trio During the journey Tiana and Naveen begin developing feelings for each other especially after Naveen learns to be more responsible Meanwhile the talisman disguising Lawrence as Naveen begins faltering it needs a steady supply of Naveen s blood to function Facilier asks his friends on the other side a legion of voodoo spirits to help retrieve Naveen and they grant him an army of shadow demons to do his bidding The demons discover Tiana and her group in the bayou Mama Odie rescues the group br Mama Odie tells Naveen the spell can only be broken with a princess s kiss Tiana realizes that since Big Daddy has been crowned Mardi Gras king Charlotte will be a princess until midnight The group hitches a ride on a paddle steamer back to New Orleans during which Naveen tells Ray about his love for Tiana and plans to propose marriage to her After talking to Tiana Naveen selflessly decides against proposing

his blood to replenish the talisman After Ray tells Tiana of Naveen s love for her Tiana heads to the Mardi Gras parade to find Naveen only to see the disguised Lawrence marrying Charlotte Heartbroken Tiana flees the scene br Ray rescues the real Naveen and steals the talisman which he gives to Tiana before Facilier mortally wounds him Facilier offers to make Tiana s dream come true in exchange for the talisman Realizing that she would be dishonoring her father by accepting Tiana destroys the talisman With Facilier s plan foiled the voodoo spirits drag him into their world for failing to pay back his debt After Lawrence is arrested Tiana reveals her love to Naveen Charlotte is moved by this and agrees to kiss Naveen so he and Tiana can be human together but as the clock strikes midnight Charlotte is no longer a princess so Tiana and Naveen remain frogs Ray dies shortly thereafter and is reincarnated as a star Tiana and Naveen are married by Mama Odie and since doing so makes Tiana a

while they are transformed into frogs br The film s composer Randy Newman makes a brief cameo as Ray s Cousin Randy the character is also designed to resemble Newman physically br br br Production br br br Early development br Disney had once announced that s Home on the Range would be their last traditionally animated film After the company s acquisition of Pixar in Ed Catmull and John Lasseter the new president and chief creative officer of Disney Animation Studios reversed this decision and reinstated hand drawn animation at the studio Many animators who had either been laid off or had left the studio when the traditional animation units were dissolved in were located and re hired for the project Lasseter also brought back directors Ron Clements and John Musker whose earlier works include The Great Mouse Detective The Little Mermaid Aladdin Hercules and Treasure Planet The duo had left the company in but Lasseter requested their return to Disney to direct and write the film and had let them choose the style of animation traditional or CGI they wanted to use br The film s story began development by merging two projects in development at Disney and Pixar at the time both based around The Frog Prince fairy tale One of the projects was based on E D Baker s The Frog Princess in which the story s heroine Princess Emma kisses a prince turned frog Prince Eadric only to become a frog herself The other was based on Ralph Eggleston s pitch of The Frog Prince set in gangster era Chicago Jorgen Klubien separately claimed that a story he was developing at Pixar tentatively titled The Spirit of New Orleans served as inspiration for the film The Princess and the Frog returns to the musical film format used in many of the previously successful Disney animated films with a style Musker and Clements declared like with Aladdin and The Little Mermaid had inspiration from Golden Age Disney features such as Cinderella br Musker and Clements thought that given so many fairy tales were set in Europe they could do an American fairy tale They stated that they chose New Orleans as a tribute to the history of the city for its magical qualities and because it was Lasseter s favorite city The directors spent ten days in Louisiana before starting to write the film br The Princess and the Frog was originally announced as The Frog Princess in July and early concepts and songs were presented to the public at Anchor Bay Entertainment s annual shareholders meeting in March These announcements drew criticism from African American media outlets due to elements of the Frog Princess story characters and settings considered distasteful African American critics disapproved of the original name for the heroine Maddy due to its similarity to the derogatory word term mammy Also protested were Maddy s original career as a chambermaid the choice to have the Black heroine s love interest be a non Black prince and the use of a Black male voodoo witchdoctor as the film s villain The Frog Princess title was also thought by critics to be a slur on French people Also questioned was the film s setting of New Orleans which had been heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina in resulting in the expulsion of a large number of mostly Black residents Critics claimed the choice of New Orleans as the setting for a Disney film with a Black heroine was an affront to the Katrina victims plight br In response to these early criticisms the film s title was changed in May from The Frog Princess to The Princess and the Frog The name Maddy was changed to Tiana and the character s occupation was altered from chambermaid to waitress Talk show host Oprah Winfrey was hired as a technical consultant for the film leading to her taking a voice acting role in the film as Tiana s mother Eudora br br br Writing and themes br The head of story Don Hall described the plot as a fairy tale twisted enough that it seems new and fresh with a kingdom that is a modern city a handsome prince that is a knuckleheaded playboy and a variation on the fairy godmother with Mama Odie Co writer Rob Edwards also said The Princess and the Frog was a princess movie for people who don t like princess movies As the writers thought Tiana s character motivation of simply dreaming of having her own restaurant was not appealing enough they expanded so it was her father s as well with the extra philosophy of food bringing people together from all walks of life Musker and Clements stated that while Tiana already starts as a sympathetic character the events of the plot make her understand things in a deeper level and change people around her Both protagonists would learn from each other Naveen to take responsibilities Tiana to enjoy life as well as figuring from Ray s passion for Evangeline that the perfect balance is brought by having someone you love to share the experience Tiana became the first African American Disney Princess br Tiana was inspired in part by famed restaurateur Leah Chase whom Clements and Musker met on their research trip to New Orleans Clements elaborated There s a woman in New Orleans named Lee sic Chase who was a waitress and ultimately opened a restaurant with her husband we met with her and we talked with her and she went to kind of into her story her philosophy about food which is a big element of the movie br br br Voice cast br br On December a detailed casting call was announced for the film at the Manhattan Theatre Source forum The casting call states the film as being an American fairy tale musical set in New Orleans during the Jazz Age and provides a detailed list of the film s major characters br In February it was reported that Dreamgirls actresses Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose were top contenders for the voice of Tiana and that Alicia Keys directly contacted then Walt Disney Studios chairman Dick Cook about voicing the role It was later reported that Tyra Banks was being considered for the role By April it was confirmed that Rose would be voicing Tiana Three months later it was reported that Keith David was cast as Doctor Facilier the villain of the film br br br Animation and design br Clements and Musker had agreed early on that the style they were aiming for was primarily that of Lady and the Tramp a film which they and John Lasseter feel represents the pinnacle of Disney s style After that everything started becoming more stylized like Sleeping Beauty Dalmatians which are fantastic films as well but there s a particular style to Lady and the Tramp that s so classically Disney Lady and the Tramp also heavily informed the style of the New Orleans scenes while Disney s Bambi served as the template for the bayou scenes Bambi was described as a stylistic reference for the painted backgrounds as according to art director Ian Gooding Bambi painted what it feels like to be in the forest instead of the forest so The Princess and the Frog would in turn try capturing the essence of roaming through New Orleans br The former trend in Disney s hand drawn features where the characters and cinematography were influenced by a CGI look had been abandoned Andreas Deja a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie says I always thought that maybe we should distinguish ourselves to go back to what D is good at which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume which is a CG kind of thing So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments You have to create a world but we re doing it more simply What we re trying to do with Princess and the Frog is hook up with things that the old guys did earlier It s not going to be graphic Deja also mentioned that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the s All those things that were non graphic which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other an organic feel to the drawing Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability For example with Louis the alligator created by Eric Goldberg Lasseter said It s the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes particularly for most characters being human For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen while the animators started with realistic designs they eventually went for stylized designs removing all that is unappealing in frogs similar to Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio br Toon Boom Animation s Toon Boom Harmony computer software was used as the main software package for the production of the film as the Computer Animation Production System CAPS system that Disney developed with Pixar in the s for use on their previous traditionally animated films had become now outdated by The Harmony software was augmented with a number of plug ins to provide CAPS like effects such as shading on cheeks and smoke effects The reinstated traditional unit s first production a Goofy cartoon short entitled How to Hook Up Your Home Theater was partly animated without paper by using Harmony and Wacom Cintiq pressure sensitive tablets The character animators found some difficulty with this approach and decided to use traditional paper and pencil drawings which were then scanned into the computer systems for The Princess and the Frog br The one exception to the new Toon Boom Harmony pipeline was the Almost There dream sequence which utilized an Art Deco graphic style based on the art of Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas Supervised by Eric Goldberg and designed by Sue Nichols the Almost There sequence s character animation was done on paper without going through the clean up animation department and scanned directly into Photoshop The artwork was then enhanced to affect the appearance of painted strokes and fills and combined with backgrounds using Adobe After Effects br The visual effects and backgrounds for the film were created digitally using Cintiq tablet displays Marlon West one of Disney s veteran animation visual effects supervisors says about the production Those guys had this bright idea to bring back hand drawn animation but everything had to be started again from the ground up One of the first things we did was focus on producing shorts to help us re introduce the D pipeline I worked as vfx supervisor on the Goofy short How to Hook Up Your Home Theater It was a real plus for the effects department so we went paperless for The Princess and the Frog The backgrounds were painted digitally using Adobe Photoshop and many of the architectural elements were based upon D models built in Autodesk Maya Much of the clean up animation digital ink and paint and compositing were outsourced to third party companies in Orlando Florida Premise Entertainment Toronto Ontario Canada Yowza Animation and Brooklin S o Paulo Brazil HGN Produ es br br br Music br br In February Alan Menken was initially reported to be composing the soundtrack However Lasseter thought that since Menken was scoring the Disney film Enchanted at the time the music might be too repetitive Lasseter felt that Randy Newman whom he had previously worked with was the perfect choice for the film and replaced Menken with him due to the fact that Newman was a jazz composer and grew up in New Orleans making him compatible with the project s musical setting not to mention that he had previous experience in adding Broadway musical style to another D animated film which was Cats Don t Dance In February Newman was announced as the film s new composer br During Disney s shareholder meeting Newman and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band performed the film s opening number Down in New Orleans with famous New Orleans singer Dr John singing while slides of pre production art from the film played on a screen Other songs in the film include Almost There a solo for Tiana Dig a Little Deeper a song for Mama Odie When We re Human a song for Louis Tiana and Naveen as frogs Friends on the Other Side a solo for Doctor Facilier and Gonna Take You There and Ma Belle Evangeline two solos for Ray Newman composed arranged and conducted the music for the film a mixture of jazz zydeco blues and gospel styles performed by the voice cast members for the respective characters while R B singer songwriter Ne Yo wrote and performed the end title song Never Knew I Needed an R B love song referring to the romance between the film s two main characters Tiana and Naveen Supported by a music video by Melina Never Knew I Needed was issued to radio outlets as a commercial single from the Princess and the Frog soundtrack br The film s soundtrack album The Princess and the Frog Original Songs and Score contains the ten original songs from the film and seven instrumental pieces The soundtrack was released on November the day before the limited release of the film in New York and Los Angeles br br br Release br The film premiered in theaters with a limited run in New York and Los Angeles beginning on November followed by wide release on December The film was originally set for release on Christmas

AMC Theatres lasting for one week from October to October as part of the Dream Big Princess campaign As part of Disney s th anniversary the film was re released in cinemas across the UK on October for one week br br br Marketing br The Princess and the Frog was supported by a wide array of merchandise leading up to and following the film s release Although Disney s main marketing push was not set to begin until November positive word of mouth promotion created demand for merchandise well in advance of the film Princess Tiana costumes were selling out prior to Halloween and a gift set of Tiana themed hair care products from Carol s Daughter sold out in seven hours on the company s website Other planned merchandise includes a cookbook for children and even a wedding gown Princess Tiana was also featured a few months before the release in the Disney on Ice Let s Celebrate show The film itself was promoted through advertisements including one from GEICO where Naveen as a frog converses with the company s gecko mascot br A live parade and show called Tiana s Showboat Jubilee premiered on October at the Magic Kingdom theme park at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and on November at Disneyland in California In Disneyland actors in New Orleans Square paraded to the Rivers of America and boarded the park s steamboat From there the cast starring Princess Tiana Prince Naveen Louis the alligator and Doctor Facilier would sing songs from the movie following a short story line taking place after the events of the film The Disneyland version s actors actually partook in singing while the Walt Disney World rendition incorporated lip syncing br Tiana s Showboat Jubilee ran at both parks until January At Disneyland Park the show was replaced by a land based event called Princess Tiana s Mardi Gras Celebration which features Princess Tiana along with five of the original presentation s Mardi Gras dancers and the park s Jambalaya Jazz Band as they perform songs from

went on to gross million in the United States and Canada and million worldwide It was the fifth highest grossing animated film of which was deemed an underachievement by Disney s standards Overall the film was considered a qualified commercial success against greater production and pre release hopes br While the film outgrossed Disney s contemporaneous hand drawn films of the s including The Emperor s New Groove Atlantis The Lost Empire Treasure Planet Brother Bear and Home on the Range it had a considerably less auspicious time than the animated films from Disney s second heyday of the latter s and s Disney animator Tom Sito compared the film s performance to that of The Great Mouse Detective which had been a step up from the theatrical run of the box office failure The Black Cauldron both films presaged upcoming commercial returns to form for Disney with The Great Mouse Detective in particular cited as a self successful inflection point towards the Renaissance including by Disney internally It has been opined that part of the film s modest return could be ascribed to being overshadowed by the release of James Cameron s Avatar a week after its release The film s fiscal shortcoming was a major reason for the changing of title of the next year s Tangled from Rapunzel in order to dissociate from The Princess and the Frog and the entire vacillating Disney Princess concept Tangled would almost double its predecessor s box office take br br br Critical reception br Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported the film has an approval rating based on

average grade of A on an A to F scale br Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A grade and applauded the film s creative team for uphold ing the great tradition of classic Disney animation Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised Walt Disney Animation for rediscovering its traditional hand drawn animation and for a thing called story David Germain of the Associated Press wrote that The Princess and the Frog is not the second coming of Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King It s just plain pleasant an old fashioned little charmer that s not straining to be the next glib animated compendium of pop culture flotsam br Justin Chang of Variety was less receptive stating this long anticipated throwback to a venerable house style never comes within kissing distance of the studio s former glory Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film three stars out of five stars while saying The Princess and the Frog breaks the color barrier for Disney princesses but is a throwback to traditional animation and her story is a retread Village Voice s Scott Foundas found that the movie as a whole never approaches the wit cleverness and storytelling brio of the studio s early s animation renaissance Beauty and the Beast The Lion King or pretty much anything by Pixar Betsy Sharkey formerly of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review claiming With The Princess and the Frog they ve gotten just about everything right The dialogue is fresh prince clever the themes are ageless the rhythms are riotous and the return to a primal animation style is beautifully executed br Chicago Sun Times film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and admired Disney s step back to traditional animation writing No D No glasses No extra ticket charge No frantic frenzies of meaningless action And good gravy A story Characters A plot This is what classic animation once was like but stated that the film inspires memories of Disney s Golden Age it doesn t quite live up to as I ve said but it s spritely and high spirited and will allow kids to enjoy it without visually assaulting them S Jhoanna Robledo of Common Sense Media gave the film three out of five stars writing First African American Disney princess is a good role model Saint Bryan of KING Seattle praised the film and called it The Best Disney Movie Since The Lion King br Upon its release the film created controversy among some Christians over its use of Louisiana Voodoo as a plot device Christianity Today s review of the film cited its sexual undertones and use of voodoo arguing that the scenes with Dr Facilier and his friends on the other side contain many horror elements and that young children might be frightened by the film The film s negative portrayal of Voodoo also drew criticism from non Christian factions The film also received criticism for historical negationism of the Jim Crow era in the Southern USA br br br Awards

Impact and debates br Following The Princess and the Frog Disney considered releasing at least one hand drawn animated film every two years starting with Winnie the Pooh and continuing with a film inspired by The Snow Queen The medium of the latter was later switched to CGI although it features a similar visual style to the film Tangled by blending elements of the two media due to complex visual elements in the story The film was ultimately titled Frozen and was released in br The blog website Film noted in July with the release of hand drawn concept art for Frozen which grossed over US billion worldwide that any future hand drawn animated films have been killed for the time being due to The Princess and the Frog failing to ignite the box office Two months later however many Disney artists announced they were working on a new independent hand drawn animated film Hullabaloo as part of an attempt to bring back hand drawn animation consisting in three short films while others got later involved on making the Netflix animated film Klaus released in br Looking back on the experience four years later Catmull stated that Disney had made a serious mistake in the process of marketing and releasing the film Walt Disney Studios marketing department had warned Disney Animation that the word princess in the title would lead moviegoers to think that the film was for girls only but the animation studio s management insisted on keeping the princess title because they believed that the film s quality and hand drawn animation would bring in all quadrants anyway In Catmull s words this belief was our own version of a stupid pill The marketing department turned out to be correct in their prediction that many moviegoers would and did avoid the film because they thought it was for little girls only This was further compounded by the fact that the film opened a week before Avatar br Looking back on the experience seven years later Lasseter told Variety I was determined to bring back hand drawn animation because I felt it was such a heritage of the Disney studio and I love the art form I was stunned that Princess didn t do better We dug into it and did a lot of research and focus groups It was viewed as old fashioned by the audience br Despite the absence of traditional animated feature films after the release of Winnie the Pooh Disney Animation has been using both media for the sake of experimenting with new techniques and styles In after Lasseter left Disney Jennifer Lee the succeeding CCO of Walt Disney Animation Studios producer Peter Del Vecho and director Chris Buck confirmed that making another D animated film is still possible and that the different styles are driven by the filmmakers who chose what method to use to tell their stories br
