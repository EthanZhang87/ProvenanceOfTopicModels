title: Motion Picture Association film rating system
id: 75890
The Motion Picture Association film rating system is used in the United States and its territories to rate a motion picture s suitability for certain audiences based on its content The system and the ratings applied to individual motion pictures are the responsibility of the Motion Picture Association MPA previously known as the Motion Picture Association of America MPAA from to The MPA rating system is a voluntary scheme that is not enforced by law films can be exhibited without a rating although most theaters refuse to exhibit non rated or NC rated films Non members of the MPA may also submit films for rating Other media such as television programs music and video games are rated by other entities such as the TV Parental Guidelines the RIAA and the ESRB respectively br In effect as of November following the Hays Code of the classical Hollywood cinema era the MPA rating system is one of various motion picture rating systems that are used to help parents decide what films are appropriate for their children It is administered by the Classification Ratings Administration CARA an independent division of the MPA br br br Ratings br br br MPA film ratings br The MPA film ratings are as follows br br In the MPA ratings were visually redesigned with the rating displayed on a left panel and the name of the rating shown above it A larger panel on the right provides a more detailed description of the film s content and an explanation of the rating level is placed on a horizontal bar at the bottom of the rating br br br Content descriptors br Film ratings often have accompanying brief descriptions of the specifics behind the film s content and why it received a certain rating They are displayed in trailers posters and on the backside of home video releases Film rating content descriptors are exclusively used for films rated from PG to NC they are not used for G rated films because the content in them is suitable for all audiences even if containing mild objectionable content br br br Other labels br If a film has not been submitted for a rating or is an uncut version of a film that was submitted the labels Not Rated NR or Unrated UR are often used Uncut extended versions of films that are labeled Unrated also contain warnings saying that the uncut version of the film contains content that differs from the theatrical release and might not be suitable for minors br If a film has not yet been assigned a final rating the label This Film Is Not Yet Rated is used in trailers and television commercials br br br Regulation of promotional materials and releases br br The MPA also rates film trailers print advertising posters and other media used to promote a film br br br Theatrical trailers br br Rating cards appear at the head of trailers in the United States which indicate how closely the trailer adheres to the MPA s standards br br Green band When the trailer accompanies another rated feature the wording on the green title card states as of May The following preview has been approved to accompany this feature For trailers hosted on the Internet the wording is tweaked to The following preview has been approved for appropriate audiences Until April these cards indicated that they had been approved for all audiences and often included the film s MPA rating This signified that the trailer adheres to the standards for motion picture advertising outlined by the MPA which include limitations on foul language and violent sexual or otherwise objectionable imagery In April the MPA began to permit the green band language to say that a trailer had been approved for appropriate audiences meaning that the material would be appropriate for audiences in theaters based on the content of the film they had come to see In May the MPA changed the trailer approval band from for appropriate audiences to to accompany this feature but only when accompanying a feature film for bands not accompanying a feature film the text of the band remained the same The font and style of the text on the graphic bands green and red was also changed at the time the green band was revised in br Yellow band A yellow title card introduced around exists solely to indicate trailers with restricted content that are hosted on the Internet with the wording stipulating The following preview has been approved only for age appropriate Internet users The MPAA defines age appropriate Internet users as visitors to sites either frequented mainly by adults or accessible only between p m and a m i e through local time The yellow card is reserved for trailers previewing films rated PG or stronger Although official this practice appears to have never been widespread However yellow band trailers are occasionally created a notable example being the trailer for Rob Zombie s Halloween br Red band A red title card is issued to trailers which do not adhere to the MPAA s guidelines It indicates that the trailer is approved for only restricted or mature audiences and when it accompanies another feature the wording states The following restricted preview has been approved to accompany this feature only For trailers hosted on the Internet the wording is tweaked to The following restricted preview has been approved for appropriate audiences The red title card is reserved for trailers previewing R and NC rated films these trailers may include nudity profanity or other material deemed inappropriate for children These trailers may only be shown theatrically before R rated NC rated or unrated movies Trailers hosted on the Internet carrying a red title card require viewers to pass an age verification test which entails users aged and older to match their names birthdays and ZIP Codes to public records on file However many YouTube channels which exist to syndicate film and television trailers often do not have this check and release these trailers without any type of restriction to some criticism from groups such as Common Sense Media br br br Releases br br The MPA also creates blue feature tags for theatrical and home media use Theatrical releases show the blue tag after the film with home media releases showing it prior to the film They feature the rating block and any content descriptors as assigned by the Classification and Rating Administration the MPA logo and links to MPA websites along the bottom br br br History br br br Replacement of the Hays Code br Jack Valenti who had become president of the Motion Picture Association of America in May deemed the Motion Picture Production Code which had been in place since and rigorously enforced since July out of date and bearing the odious smell of censorship Filmmakers were pushing at the boundaries of the code with some even going as far as filing lawsuits against the Hays Code by invoking the First Amendment Valenti cited examples such as Who s Afraid of Virginia Woolf which used prohibited language including hump the hostess and Blowup which was denied Code approval due to nudity resulting in Metro Goldwyn Mayer then a member studio of the MPAA releasing it through a subsidiary Valenti revised the Code to include the SMA Suggested for Mature Audiences advisory as a stopgap measure To accommodate the irresistible force of creators determined to make their films and to avoid the possible intrusion of government into the movie arena he developed a set of advisory ratings which could be applied after a film was completed br On November the voluntary MPAA film rating system took effect with three organizations serving as its monitoring and guiding groups the MPAA the National Association of Theatre Owners NATO and the International Film Importers Distributors of America IFIDA Only films that premiered in the United States after that date were affected by this Walter Reade was the only one of top U S exhibitors who refused to use the ratings Warner Bros Seven Arts The Girl on a Motorcycle was the first film to receive the X rating and was distributed by their Claridge Pictures subsidiary Two other films were rated X by the time the MPAA published their first weekly bulletin listing ratings Paramount s Sin With a Stranger and Universal s Birds in Peru Both films were subsequently released by subsidiaries br The ratings used from to were br br Rated G Suggested for general audiences br Rated M Suggested for mature audiences Parental discretion advised br Rated R Restricted Persons under not admitted unless accompanied by parent or adult guardian br Rated X Persons under not admitted br This content classification system originally was to have three ratings with the intention of allowing parents to take their children to any film they chose However the National Association of Theatre Owners urged the creation of an adults only category fearful of possible legal problems in local jurisdictions The X rating was not an MPAA trademark and would not receive the MPAA seal any producer not submitting a film for MPAA rating could self apply the X rating or any other symbol or description that was not an MPAA trademark br br br From M to GP to PG br In the ages for R and X were raised from to Also due to confusion over whether M rated films were suitable for children M was renamed to GP for General audiences Parental guidance suggested and in the MPAA added the content advisory Some material not generally suitable for pre teenagers On February GP was revised to PG br The ratings used from to were br br Rated G All ages admitted General audiences br Rated GP All ages admitted Parental guidance suggested Sometimes a disclaimer would say This film contains material which may not be suitable for pre teenagers br Rated R Restricted Under requires accompanying parent or adult guardian br Rated X No one under admitted br The ratings used from to were br br Rated G General audiences All ages admitted br Rated PG Parental guidance suggested Some material may not be suitable for pre teenagers children br Rated R Restricted Under requires accompanying parent or adult guardian br Rated X No one under admitted br br br Addition of the PG rating br In the s complaints about violence and gore in films such as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Gremlins both of which received PG ratings refocused attention on films seen by younger children According to author Filipa Antunes this revealed the conundrum of a film that could not be recommended for all children but could also not be repudiated for all children uniformly leading to speculation that the rating system s PG classification no longer matched a notion of childhood most parents in America could agree on Steven Spielberg director of Temple of Doom and executive producer of Gremlins suggested a new intermediate rating between PG and R The PG rating was introduced on July with the advisory Parents Are Strongly Cautioned to Give Special Guidance for Attendance of Children Under Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Young Children The first film to be released with this rating was the John Milius war film Red Dawn In the wording was simplified to Parents Strongly Cautioned Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Children Under Around the same time the MPAA won a trademark infringement lawsuit against the producers and distributors of I Spit on Your Grave over a fraudulent application of its R rating to the uncut version of the film and forced its member studios and several other home video distributors to put MPAA ratings on the packaging of MPAA rated films via a settlement that would come into effect by fall that year br The ratings used from to were br br Rated G General audiences All ages admitted br Rated PG Parental guidance suggested Some material may not be suitable for children br Rated PG Parents strongly cautioned Some material may be inappropriate for children under br Rated R Restricted Under requires accompanying parent or adult guardian br Rated X No one under admitted br br br Tennessee law br In Tennessee state law set the minimum age to view a theatrically exhibited R rated film without adult accompaniment at instead of and categorized the admission of minors to X rated films as a misdemeanor The statute remained in force until when it was ruled to be in violation of the First Amendment The law was amended in as to prohibit persons under the age of only if the film was considered harmful to minors br br br X replaced by NC br br In the rating system s early years X rated films such as Midnight Cowboy and A Clockwork Orange were understood to be unsuitable for children but non pornographic and intended for the general public However pornographic films often self applied the non trademarked X rating and it soon became synonymous with pornography in American culture In late and early respectively Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer and The Cook the Thief His Wife Her Lover two critically acclaimed art films featuring strong adult content were released Neither film was approved for an MPAA rating limiting their commercial distribution and prompting criticism of the rating system s lack of a designation for such films br In September the MPAA introduced the rating NC No Children Under Admitted Henry June previously to be assigned an X rating was the first film to receive the NC rating instead Although films with an NC rating had more mainstream distribution opportunities than X rated films many theaters refused to screen them most entertainment media did not accept advertising for them and many large video outlets refused to stock them br The ratings used from to were br br Rated G General audiences All ages admitted br Rated PG Parental guidance suggested Some material may not be suitable for children br Rated PG Parents strongly cautioned Some material may be inappropriate for children under br Rated R Restricted Under requires accompanying parent or adult guardian br Rated NC No children under admitted br In the minimum age for NC rated films was raised to by rewording it to No One and Under Admitted The ratings used since are br br Rated G General audiences All ages admitted br Rated PG Parental guidance suggested Some material may not be suitable for children br Rated PG Parents strongly cautioned Some material may be inappropriate for children under br Rated R Restricted Under requires accompanying parent or adult guardian br Rated NC Adults only No one and under admitted br Since September the MPAA has included explanations or descriptors of why each film received an R rating allowing parents to know what type of content the film contained For example some films descriptors may read Rated R for strong graphic violent content disturbing material sexual content graphic nudity drug use and pervasive language br By the early s the MPAA began applying rating explanations for PG PG and NC rated films as well br br br Rating components br br br Violence br Depictions of violence are permitted under all ratings but must be moderated for the lower ones Violence must be kept to a minimum in G rated films and must not be intense in PG rated films Depictions of intense violence are permitted under the PG rating but violence that is both realistic and extreme or persistent will generally require at least an R rating br br br Language br Snippets of language that go beyond polite conversation are permitted in G rated films but no stronger words are present Profanity may be present in PG rated films and use of one of the harsher sexually derived words as an expletive will initially incur at least a PG rating More than one occurrence will usually incur an R rating as will the usage of such an expletive in a sexual context Known as the automatic language rule the rule has been applied differently depending on the subject matter of the film For example All the President s Men received a PG rating after appealing it from an R despite multiple instances of strong language likely because of its historic subject matter The automatic language rule is arguably the rule that can most often be successfully appealed The ratings board may award a PG rating passed by a two thirds majority if they believe the language is justified by the context or by the manner in which the words are used br It is sometimes claimed that films rated PG are only able to use the expletive fuck once to avoid an R rating for language There are several exceptional cases in which PG rated films contain multiple occurrences of the word fuck Adventures in Babysitting where the word is used twice in the same scene Antwone Fisher which has three uses Taylor Swift The Eras Tour which has four uses six in the Taylor s Version cut The Hip Hop Project which has seventeen uses and Gunner Palace a documentary of soldiers in the Iraq War which has uses of the word with two used sexually Both Bully a documentary about bullying and Philomena which has two instances of the word released in were originally given R ratings on grounds of the language but the ratings were dropped to PG after successful appeals albeit Bully needed some cuts The King s Speech however was given an R rating for one scene using the word fuck several times in a speech therapy context the MPAA refused to recertify the film on appeal despite the British Board of Film Classification reducing the British rating from a rating to a A on the grounds that the uses of the expletive were not directed at anyone br This was satirized in the film Be Cool in which the movie producer Chili Palmer John Travolta says Do you know that unless you re willing to use the R rating you can only say the F word once You know what I say Fuck that I m done Often film producers will use the word for a scene of gravitas or humor and then bleep out any further instances with sound effects br Some forms of media are cut post release so as to obtain a PG rating for home media release or to feature on an Internet streaming service that will not carry films rated higher than PG In a recording of Hamilton was released on Disney after cuts by Lin Manuel Miranda to remove two of the three instances of fuck in the musical to qualify it as PG under MPAA guidelines br A study of popular American teen oriented films rated PG and PG from to found that in those films teenaged characters use more and stronger profanity than adult ones in the same movies However the study found that the overall amount of such language had declined somewhat since the s br br br Substances br br Drug use content is restricted to PG and above An example of an otherwise PG film being assigned a PG rating for a drug reference momentary along with brief language is Whale Rider The film contained only mild profanity but was rated PG because of a scene where drug paraphernalia were briefly visible Critic Roger Ebert criticized the MPAA for the rating and called it a wild overreaction br In May the MPAA announced that depictions of cigarette smoking would be considered in a film s rating Anti smoking advocates stated that the child friendly PG rating was inappropriate for the Nickelodeon animated film Rango which included over depictions of characters smoking br br br Nudity br Nudity is restricted to PG and above and anything that constitutes more than brief nudity will require at least a PG rating Nudity that is sexually oriented will generally require an R rating Since films have been flagged by the MPAA for carrying nudity In the MPAA flagged three films specifically for male nudity precipitated by parental pressure in response to Br no In MPAA Ratings Chair Joan Graves clarified the MPA s position by stating that we don t usually define nudity as male or female usually we just mention partial nudity or graphic nudity br br br Sex br The MPAA does not have any explicit criteria for sexual content other than excluding sex scenes from G rated films br br br Effects of ratings br br br The Exorcist br br Prior to the release of The Exorcist at the end of CARA president Aaron Stern took the unusual step of calling director William Friedkin to tell him that since it was an important film it would be rated R and could be released without any cuts The film drew huge crowds upon its release many of whom vomited and or fainted a psychiatric journal would later document four cases of cinematic neurosis induced by the film br Among those patrons were many children not always accompanied by adults This left many commentators incredulous that the ratings board would have found that a film with disturbing scenes such as a possessed year old girl masturbating with a crucifix was acceptable for children to see Roy Meacham a Washington D C critic who had praised the film while admonishing parents not to take their children to it recalled those children he did see leaving showings drained and drawn afterward their eyes had a look I had never seen before Authorities in Washington invoked a municipal ordinance that would have prevented any minors from seeing the film threatening theater owners with arrest if they did br Meacham insinuated that the board had succumbed to pressure from Warner Brothers which had spent million more than twice its original budget making the film an X rating would have seriously limited The Exorcist s commercial prospects New Yorker critic Pauline Kael echoed his criticism If The Exorcist had cost under a million or been made abroad she wrote it would almost certainly be an X film But when a movie is as expensive as this one the board doesn t dare give it an X br In Richard Heffner took over as president of the board During his interview process he had asked to screen recent films that had sparked ratings controversies including The Exorcist How could anything be worse than this he recalled thinking later And it got an R After he took over as head he would spearhead efforts to be more aggressive with the X rating especially over violence in films In he got the board to give the Japanese martial arts film The Street Fighter an X rating for its graphic violence the first time a film had earned that rating purely for violence br br br Commercial viability of the NC rating br The NC rating has been described as a kiss of death for any film that receives it Like the X rating it replaced NC limits a film s prospects of being marketed screened in theaters and sold in major video outlets In MGM UA released the big budget film Showgirls it became the most widely distributed film with an NC rating showing in cinemas simultaneously but it was a box office failure that grossed only of its million budget Some modest successes can be found among NC theatrical releases however Fox Searchlight Pictures released the original NC rated American edition of the European film The Dreamers in theaters in the United States and later released both the original NC and the cut R rated version on DVD A Fox Searchlight spokesman said the NC rating did not give them much trouble in releasing this film they had no problem booking it and only the Salt Lake City newspaper Deseret News refused to take the film s ad and Fox Searchlight was satisfied with this film s United States box office result Another notable exception is Bad Education an NC foreign language film that grossed million in the United States theatrically a moderate success for a foreign language film br In the Directors Guild of America called the NC rating an abject failure for causing filmmakers to re edit films to receive an R rating rather than accept an NC rating They argued that this was not only compromising filmmakers visions but also greatly increasing the likelihood that adult oriented movies are seen by the very groups for which they are not intended As of March according to Variety MPAA chairman Dan Glickman had been made aware of the attempts to introduce a new rating or find ways to reduce the stigma of the NC rating Film studios have pressured the MPAA to retire the NC rating because of its likely impact on their film s box office revenue br During the controversy about the MPAA s decision to give the film Blue Valentine an NC rating The Weinstein Company challenged this decision and the MPAA ended up awarding the same cut an R rating on appeal Actor Ryan Gosling who stars in the film noted that NC films are not allowed wide advertisement and that given the refusal of major cinema chains like AMC and Regal to show NC rated movies many such films will never be accessible to people who live in markets that do not have art house theatres br Legal scholar Julie Hilden wrote that the MPAA has a masterpiece exception that it has made for films that would ordinarily earn an NC rating if not for the broader artistic masterpiece that requires the violence depicted as a part of its message She cites Saving Private Ryan with its bloody depiction of the D Day landings as an example This exception is troubling Hilden argues because it ignores context and perspective in evaluating other films and favors conventional films over edgier films that contribute newer and more interesting points to public discourse about violence br br br Issuance of R Cards br Starting in GKC Theatres since absorbed into AMC Theatres introduced R Cards which parents could obtain for their children under to see R rated films without adult accompaniment The cards generated much controversy MPAA president Jack Valenti said in a news article I think it distorts and ruptures the intent of this voluntary film ratings system All R rated films are not alike John Fithian the president of the National Association of Theatre Owners also said that the cards can be harmful He noted in a news article for the Christian Science Monitor that the R rating is broad enough to include relatively family friendly fare such as Billy Elliot and Erin Brockovich which were both rated R for language along with films that push the extremes of violence including Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill br br br Criticisms br br br Emphasis on sex and language versus violence br The film rating system has had a number of high profile critics Film critic Roger Ebert called for replacing the NC rating with separate ratings for pornographic and non pornographic adult film Ebert argued that the system places too much emphasis on sex while allowing the portrayal of massive amounts of gruesome violence The uneven emphasis on sex versus violence is echoed by other critics including David Ansen as well as many filmmakers Moreover Ebert argued that the rating system is geared toward looking at trivial aspects of the film such as the number of times a profane word is used rather than at the general theme of the film for example if the film realistically depicts the consequences of sex and violence He called for an A adults only rating to indicate films high in violence or mature content that should not be marketed to teenagers but do not have NC levels of sex He also called for the NC rating to be removed and to have the X rating revived He felt that everyone understood what X rated means while fewer people understood what NC meant br MPAA chairman Dan Glickman has disputed these claims stating that far more films are initially rated NC for violence than for sex but that these are later edited by studios to receive an R rating br Despite this an internal critic of the early workings of the ratings system is film critic and writer Stephen Farber who was a CARA intern for six months during and In The Movie Ratings Game he documents a prejudice against sex in relation to violence The documentary This Film Is Not Yet Rated also points out that four times as many films received an NC rating for sex as they did for violence according to the MPAA s own website further mentioning a bias against homosexual content compared to heterosexual content particularly with regards to sex scenes Filmmaker Darren Stein further insists that his tame teen comedy G B F which features multiple same sex kisses but no intercourse strong language violence or nudity was rated R for being gay br The documentary Bully received an R rating for the profanity contained within the film which prevented most of the intended audience middle and high schoolers from seeing the film The film s director Lee Hirsch has refused to recut the film stating I feel a responsibility as a filmmaker as the person entrusted to tell these kids stories to not water them down A petition collected more than signatures to change the film s rating and a version with less profanity was finally given a PG rating The same however could not be said about the teen drama Kids which director Larry Clark wanted rated R so parents could take their kids to it for educational purposes but the MPAA rated it NC due to its content of teen sex and turned down Clark s appeal The film was then released unrated by Miramax under Shining Excalibur Films because Miramax formerly owned by Disney hesitated to release it as an NC film br br br Inconsistent standards for independent studios br Many critics of the MPA rating system especially independent distributors have charged that major studios releases often receive more lenient treatment than independent films br The independent film Saints and Soldiers which contains no nudity almost no sex although there is a scene in which a German soldier is about to rape a French woman very little profanity and a minimum of violence was said to have been rated R for a single clip where a main character is shot and killed and required modification of just that one scene to receive a PG rating Eric Watson producer of the independently distributed NC rated Requiem for a Dream complained that the studios are paying the budget of the MPAA which gives the studios leverage over the MPAA s decisions br The comedy Scary Movie released by Dimension Films at the time a division of The Walt Disney Company contained strong crude sexual humor language drug use and violence including images of ejaculation fellatio and an erect penis but was rated R to the surprise of many reviewers and audiences by comparison the comparatively tame porn spoof Orgazmo an independent release by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker contained explicit sexual content and dialogue and received an NC the only on screen penis seen in the film is a dildo Parker and Stone did not have the time and money to edit the film so it retained its NC rating In contrast Parker and Stone s second feature film South Park Bigger Longer Uncut was distributed by a major studio Paramount Pictures and after multiple submissions and notes from the MPAA received an R rating br br br Inconsistent standards between G and PG br Disney s adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame has been criticized for its depiction of lust antiziganism and genocide despite being rated G Twenty five years after its release one of the screenwriters for the film Tab Murphy talked about its rating in an interview with The New York Times saying That s the most R rated G you will ever see in your life Pixar s film Cars has been criticized similarly for featuring on screen gun violence and a torture scene despite being rated G In contrast critics of the system accuse the ratings board of giving PG ratings to family friendly films such as Frozen and Finding Dory for no reason br br br Call for publicizing the standards br Many critics of the system both conservative and liberal would like to see the MPAA ratings unveiled and the standards made public The MPAA has consistently cited nationwide scientific polls conducted each year by the Opinion Research Corporation of Princeton New Jersey which show that parents find the ratings useful Critics such as Matt Stone in Kirby Dick s documentary This Film Is Not Yet Rated respond this proves only that parents find the ratings more useful than nothing at all In the film it is also discussed how the MPAA will not reveal any information about how or why certain decisions are made and that the association will not even reveal to the filmmaker the specific scenes that need to be cut in order to get an alternative rating br br br Accusation of ratings creep br Although there has always been concern about the content of films the MPAA has been accused of a ratings creep whereby the films that fell into specific ratings categories in contained more objectionable material than those that appeared in the same categories two decades earlier A study put forward by the Harvard School of Public Health in concluded that there had been a significant increase in the level of profanity sex and violence in films released between and Kimberly Thompson director of the study stated The findings demonstrate that ratings creep has occurred over the last decade and that today s movies contain significantly more violence sex and profanity on average than movies of the same rating a decade ago br br br Questions of relevance br Film managing editor David Chen wrote on the website It s time for more people to condemn the MPAA and their outrageous antics We re heading towards an age when we don t need a mommy like organization to dictate what our delicate sensibilities can and can t be exposed to I deeply hope that the MPAA s irrelevance is imminent br Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips wrote that the MPAA ratings board has become foolish and irrelevant and its members do not have my interests at heart or yours They re too easy on violence yet bizarrely reactionary when it comes to nudity and language br br br See also br br List of highest grossing R rated films br List of NC rated films br Common Sense
