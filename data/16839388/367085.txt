screenwriter Murphy decided to do an adventure film inspired by the works of Jules Verne Atlantis The Lost Empire was notable for adopting the distinctive visual style of comic book artist Mike

have been shot in anamorphic format Linguist Marc Okrand constructed an Atlantean language specifically for use in the film James Newton Howard provided the film s musical score The film was released at a time when audience interest in animated films was shifting away from hand drawn animation toward films with full CGI br Atlantis The Lost Empire premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood Los Angeles on June and went into its general release on June The film received mixed reviews from critics Budgeted at around million Atlantis grossed over million worldwide million of which was earned in North America its lackluster box office response was identified as a result of being released in competition with Shrek Lara Croft Tomb Raider The Fast and the Furious and Dr Dolittle As a

and would do so again in Lilo Stitch as Jumba br br br Production br br br Development br br The idea for Atlantis The Lost Empire was conceived in October when Don Hahn Gary Trousdale Kirk Wise and Tab Murphy lunched at a Mexican restaurant in Burbank California Having recently completed The Hunchback of Notre Dame the producer and directors wanted to keep the Hunchback crew together for another film with an Adventureland setting rather than a Fantasyland setting Drawing inspiration from Jules Verne s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas they set out to make a film which would fully explore Atlantis compared to the brief visit depicted in Verne s novel While primarily utilizing the Internet to research the mythology of Atlantis the filmmakers became interested in the clairvoyant readings of Edgar Cayce and decided to incorporate some of his ideas notably that of a mother crystal which provides power healing and longevity to the Atlanteans into the story They also visited museums and old army installations to study the technology of the early th century the film s time period and traveled underground in New Mexico s Carlsbad Caverns to view the subterranean trails which would serve as a model for the approach to Atlantis in the film br The filmmakers wanted to avoid the common depiction of Atlantis as crumbled Greek columns underwater said Wise From the get go we were committed to designing it top to bottom Let s get the architectural style clothing heritage customs how they would sleep and how they would speak So we brought people on board who would help us develop those ideas Art director David Goetz stated We looked at Mayan architecture styles of ancient unusual architecture from around the world and the directors really liked the look of Southeast Asian architecture The team later took ideas from other architectural forms including Cambodian Indian and Tibetan works Hahn added If you take and deconstruct architecture from around the world into one architectural vocabulary that s what our Atlantis looks like The overall design and circular layout of Atlantis were also based on the writings of Plato and his quote in a single day and night of misfortune the island of Atlantis disappeared into the depths of the sea was influential from the beginning of production The crew wore T shirts which read ATLANTIS Fewer songs more explosions due to the film s plan as an action adventure unlike previous Disney animated features which were musicals br br br Language br br Marc Okrand who developed the Klingon language for the Star Trek television and theatrical productions was hired to devise the Atlantean language for Atlantis The Lost Empire Guided by the directors initial concept for it to be a mother language Okrand employed an Indo European word stock with its own grammatical structure He would change the words if they began to sound too much like an actual spoken language John Emerson designed the written component making hundreds of random sketches of individual letters from among which the directors chose the best to represent the Atlantean alphabet The written language was boustrophedon designed to be read left to right on the first line then right to left on the second continuing in a zigzag pattern to simulate the flow of water br br The Atlantean A is a shape developed by John Emerson It is a miniature map of the city of Atlantis i e the outside of the swirl is the cave the inside shape is the silhouette of the city and the dot is the location of the crystal It s a treasure map br br br Writing br Joss Whedon was the first writer to be involved with the film but soon left to work on other Disney projects According to him he had not a shred in the movie Tab Murphy completed the screenplay stating that the time from initially discussing the story to producing a script that satisfied the film crew was about three to four months The initial draft was pages much longer than a typical Disney film script which usually runs pages When the first two acts were timed at minutes the directors cut characters and sequences and focused more on Milo Murphy said that he created the centuries old Shepherd s Journal because he needed a map for the characters to follow throughout their journey A revised version of the script eliminated the trials encountered by the explorers as they navigated the caves to Atlantis This gave the film a faster pace because Atlantis is discovered earlier in the story br br The character of Milo J Thatch was originally supposed to be a descendant of Edward Teach otherwise known as Blackbeard the pirate The directors later related him to an explorer so he would discover his inner talent for exploration The character of Moli re was originally intended to be professorial but Chris Ure a story artist changed the concept to that of a horrible little burrowing creature with a wacky coat and strange headgear with extending eyeballs said Wise Don Hahn pointed out that the absence of songs presented a challenge for a team accustomed to animating musicals as action scenes alone would have to carry the film Kirk Wise said it gave the team an opportunity for more on screen character development We had more screen time available to do a scene like where Milo and the explorers are camping out and learning about one another s histories An entire sequence is devoted to having dinner and going to bed That is not typically something we would have the luxury of doing br Hahn stated that the first animated sequence completed during production was the film s prologue The original version featured a Viking war party using The Shepherd s Journal to find Atlantis and being swiftly dispatched by the Leviathan Near the end of production story supervisor John Sanford told the directors that he felt this prologue did not give viewers enough emotional involvement with the Atlanteans Despite knowing that the Viking prologue was finished and it would cost additional time and money to alter the scene the directors agreed with Sanford Trousdale went home and completed the storyboards later that evening after visiting a strip club where he boarded the new sequence on a napkin The opening was replaced by a sequence depicting the destruction of Atlantis which introduced the film from the perspective of the Atlanteans and Princess Kida The Viking prologue is included as an extra feature on the DVD release br br br Casting br Kirk Wise one of the directors said that they chose Michael J Fox for the role of Milo because they felt he gave his characters his own personality and made them more believable on screen Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his past experience with live action because he did not have to worry about what he looked like in front of a camera while delivering his lines The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A E he allowed his son to choose which film he would work on and he chose Atlantis Viewers have noted similarities between Milo and the film s language consultant Marc Okrand who developed the Atlantean language used in the film Okrand stated that Milo s supervising animator John Pomeroy sketched him claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted Kida s supervising animator Randy Haycock stated that her actress Cree Summer was very intimidating when he first met her this influenced how he wanted Kida to look and act on screen when she meets Milo Wise chose James Garner for the role of Commander Lyle Tiberius Rourke because of his previous experience with action films especially war and Western films and said the role fits him like a glove When asked if he would be interested in the role Garner replied I d do it in a heartbeat Producer Don Hahn was saddened that Jim Varney the voice of Jebidiah Allardyce Cookie Farnsworth never saw the finished film before he died of lung cancer in February but mentioned that he was shown clips of his character s performance during his site sessions and said He loved it Shawn Keller supervising animator for Cookie stated It was kind of a sad fact that Varney knew that he was not going to be able to see this film before he passed away He did a bang up job doing the voice work knowing the fact that he was never gonna see his last performance Steven Barr recorded supplemental dialogue for Cookie br John Mahoney who voiced Preston Whitmore stated that doing voice work was freeing and allowed him to be big and outrageous with his character Dr Joshua Sweet s supervising animator Ron Husband indicated that one of the challenges was animating Sweet in sync with Phil Morris rapid line delivery while keeping him believable Morris stated that this character was extreme with no middle ground he mentioned When he was happy he was really happy and when he s solemn he s real solemn Claudia Christian described her character Lieutenant Helga Katrina Sinclair as sensual and striking and was relieved when she finally saw what her character looked like joking I d hate to you know go through all this and find out my character is a toad Jacqueline Obradors said her character Audrey Rocio Ramirez made her feel like a little kid again and she always hoped her sessions would last longer Florence Stanley felt that her character Wilhelmina Bertha Packard was very cynical and secure She does her job and when she is not busy she does anything she wants Corey Burton mentioned that finding his performance as Gaetan Mole Moli re was by allowing the character to leap out of him while making funny voices To get into character during his recording sessions he stated that he would throw myself into the scene and feel like I m in this make believe world Kirk Wise and Russ Edmonds supervising animator for Vincenzo Vinny Santorini noted Vinny s actor Don Novello s unique ability to improvise dialogue while voicing the role Edmonds recalled Novello would look at the sheet and he would read the line that was written once and he would never read it again And we never used a written line it was improvs the whole movie Michael Cedeno supervising animator for King Kashekim Nedakh was astounded at Leonard Nimoy s voice talent in the role stating that he had so much rich character in his performance As he spoke his lines Cedeno said the crew would sit there and watch Nimoy in astonishment br br br Animation br br At the peak of its production animators artists and technicians were working on Atlantis at all three Disney animation studios Walt Disney Feature Animation Burbank California Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida Orlando and Disney Animation France Paris The film was one of the few Disney animated features produced and shot in mm anamorphic format The directors felt that a widescreen image was crucial as a nostalgic reference to old action adventure films presented in the CinemaScope format noting Raiders of the Lost Ark as an inspiration Because switching to the format would require animation desks and equipment designed for widescreen to be purchased Disney executives were at first reluctant about the idea The production team found a simple solution by drawing within a smaller frame on the same paper and equipment used for standard aspect ratio Disney animated films Layout supervisor Ed Ghertner wrote a guide to the widescreen format for use by the layout artists and mentioned that one advantage of widescreen was that he could keep characters in scenes longer because of additional space to walk within the frame Wise drew further inspiration for the format from filmmakers David Lean and Akira Kurosawa br The film s visual style was strongly based upon that of Mike Mignola the comic book artist behind Hellboy Mignola was one of four production designers along with Matt Codd Jim Martin and Ricardo Delgado hired by the Disney studio for the film Accordingly he provided style guides preliminary character and background designs and story ideas Mignola s graphic the angular style was a key influence on the look of the characters stated Wise Mignola was surprised when first contacted by the studio to work on Atlantis His artistic influence on the film would later contribute to a cult following br br I remember watching a rough cut of the film and these characters have these big square weird hands I said to the guy next to me Those are cool hands And he says to me Yeah they re your hands We had a whole meeting about how to do your hands It was so weird I couldn t wrap my brain around it br The final pull out scene of the movie immediately before the end title card was described by the directors as the most difficult scene in the history of Disney animation They said that the pullout attempt on their prior film The Hunchback of Notre Dame struggled and lacked depth however after making advances in the process of multiplaning they tried the technique again in Atlantis The scene begins with one inch cm piece of paper showing a close up of Milo and Kida As the camera pulls away from them to reveal the newly restored Atlantis it reaches the equivalent of an inch cm piece of paper composed of many individual pieces of paper inches cm or smaller Each piece was carefully drawn and combined with animated vehicles simultaneously flying across the scene to make the viewer see a complete integrated image br br At the time of its release Atlantis The Lost Empire was notable for using more computer generated imagery CGI than any other Disney traditionally animated feature To increase productivity the directors had the digital artists work with the traditional animators throughout the production Several important scenes required heavy use of digital animation the Leviathan the Ulysses submarine and sub pods the Heart of Atlantis and the Stone Giants During production after Matt Codd and Jim Martin designed the Ulysses on paper Greg Aronowitz was hired to build a scale model of the submarine to be used as a reference for drawing the D Ulysses The final film included digital effects shots and computer programs were used to seamlessly join the D and D artwork One scene that took advantage of this was the sub drop scene where the D Ulysses was dropped from its docking bay into the water As the camera floated toward it a D Milo was drawn to appear inside tracking the camera The crew noted that it was challenging to keep the audience from noticing the difference between the D and D drawings when they were merged The digital production also gave the directors a unique virtual camera for complicated shots within the film With the ability to operate in the z plane this camera moved through a digital wire frame set the background and details were later hand drawn over the wireframes This was used in the opening flight scene through Atlantis and the submarine chase through the undersea cavern with the Leviathan in pursuit br br br Music and sound br Since the film would not feature any songs the directors hired James Newton Howard to compose the score after the directors heard his music on Dinosaur Approaching it as a live action film Howard decided to have different musical themes for the cultures of the surface world and Atlantis In the case of Atlantis Howard chose an Indonesian orchestral sound incorporating chimes bells and gongs The directors told Howard that the film would have a number of key scenes without dialogue the score would need to convey emotionally what the viewer was seeing on screen br Gary Rydstrom and his team at Skywalker Sound were hired for the film s sound production Like Howard Rydstrom employed different sounds for the two cultures Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers he felt that the Atlanteans should have a more organic sound utilizing ceramics and pottery The sound made by the Atlantean flying fish vehicles posed a particular challenge Rydstrom revealed that he was sitting at the side of a highway recording one day when a semi truck drove by at high speed When the recording was sped up on his computer he felt it sounded very organic and decided to use it in the film Rydstrom created the harmonic chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by rubbing his finger along the edge of a champagne flute and the sound of sub pods moving through the water with a water pick br br br Release br Atlantis The Lost Empire had its world premiere at Disney s El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood Los Angeles on June and a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on June a wider release followed on June At the premiere Destination Atlantis was on display featuring behind the scenes props from the film and information on the legend of Atlantis with video games displays laser tag and other attractions The Aquarium of the Pacific also loaned a variety of fish for display within the attraction br br br Promotion br Atlantis was among Disney s first major attempts to utilize internet marketing The film was promoted through Kellogg s which created a website with mini games and a movie based video game give away for UPC labels from specially marked packages of Atlantis breakfast cereal The film was one of Disney s first marketing attempts through mobile network operators and allowed users to download games based on the film McDonald s which had an exclusive

its sequel Atlantis Milo s Return br br br Reception br br br Box office br Before the film s release reporters speculated that it would have a difficult run due to competition from Shrek and Lara Croft Tomb Raider Regarding the market s shift from traditional animation and competition with CG animated films Kirk Wise said Any traditional animator including myself can t help but feel a twinge I think it always comes down to story and character and one form won t replace the other Just like photography didn t replace painting But maybe I m blind to it Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly noted that CGI films such as Shrek were more likely to attract the teenage demographic typically not interested in animation and called Atlantis a marketing and creative gamble br With a budget of million the film opened at on its debut weekend behind Lara Croft Tomb Raider earning million in theaters During its second weekend it would drop into fourth place behind the latter film Dr Dolittle and The Fast and the Furious making million The film s international release began September in Australia and other markets followed suit During its week theatrical run Atlantis The Lost Empire grossed over million worldwide million from the United States and Canada Responding to its disappointing box office performance Thomas Schumacher then president of Walt Disney Feature Animation said It seemed like a good idea at the time to not do a sweet fairy tale but we missed br br br Critical response br Atlantis The Lost Empire received mixed reviews from critics The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that of professional critics have given Atlantis The Lost Empire a positive review the average rating is The site s consensus is Atlantis provides a fast paced spectacle but stints on such things as character development and a coherent plot Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of out of based on reviews from mainstream critics this was considered mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br While critics had mixed reactions to the film in general some praised it for its visuals action adventure elements and attempt to appeal to an older audience Roger Ebert gave Atlantis three and a half stars out of four He praised the animation s clean bright visual look and the classic energy of the comic book style crediting this to the work of Mike Mignola Ebert gave particular praise to the story and the final battle scene and wrote The story of Atlantis is rousing in an old pulp science fiction sort of way but the climactic scene transcends the rest and stands by itself as one of the great animated action sequences In The New York Times Elvis Mitchell gave high praise to the film calling it a monumental treat and stated Atlantis is also one of the most eye catching Disney cartoons since Uncle Walt institutionalized the four fingered glove Internet film critic James Berardinelli wrote a positive review of the film giving it three out of four stars He wrote On the whole Atlantis offers minutes of solid entertainment once again proving that while Disney may be clueless when it comes to producing good live action movies they are exactly the opposite when it comes to their animated division Wesley Morris of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote positively of the film s approach for an older audience But just beneath the surface Atlantis brims with adult possibility br Other critics felt that the film was mediocre in regards to its story and characters and that it failed to deliver as a non musical to Disney s traditional audience Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C rating writing that the film had gee whiz formulaic character and was the essence of craft without dream Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said the storyline and characterizations were old fashioned and the film had the retrograde look of a Saturday morning cartoon but these deficiencies were offset by its brisk action and frantic pace Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote Disney pushes into all talking no singing no dancing and in the end no fun animated territory Stephanie Zacharek of Salon wrote of Disney s attempt to make the film for an adult audience The big problem with Disney s latest animated feature Atlantis The Lost Empire is that it doesn t seem geared to kids at all It s so adult that it s massively boring Rita Kempley of The Washington Post panned the film calling it a new fashioned but old fangled hash and wrote Ironically Disney had hoped to update its image with this mildly diverting adventure yet the picture hasn t really broken away from the tried and true format spoofed in the far superior Shrek br In Katharine Trendacosta at io reviewed the film and called it a Beautiful Gem of a Movie That Deserved Better Than It Got and said that the film deserves more love than it ended up getting Lindsay Teal considers Atlantis to be a lost Disney classic Describing the film as highly entertaining she praises the writing and characterisation in particular Sweet Helga and Kida In particular much praise has been given to the character of Kida Summer has regarded the character of Kida as one of her favourite roles and even considers the character among the official Disney Princess line up br br br Themes and interpretations br Several critics and scholars have noted that Atlantis plays strongly on themes of anti capitalism and anti imperialism M Keith Booker academic and author of studies about the implicit messages conveyed by media views the character of Rourke as being motivated by capitalist greed when he pursues his own financial gain in spite of the knowledge that his theft of the crystal will lead to the destruction of Atlantis Religion journalist Mark Pinsky in his exploration of moral and spiritual themes in popular Disney films says that it is impossible to read the movie any other way than as a devastating unrelenting attack on capitalism and American imperialism Max Messier of FilmCritic com observes Disney even manages to lambast the capitalist lifestyle of the adventurers intent on uncovering the lost city Damn the imperialists According to Booker the film also delivers a rather segregationist moral by concluding with the discovery of the Atlanteans kept secret from other surface dwellers in order to maintain a separation between the two highly divergent cultures Others saw Atlantis as an interesting look at utopian philosophy of the sort found in classic works of science fiction by H G Wells and Jules Verne br br br Nadia The Secret of Blue Water controversy br When the film was released some viewers noticed that Atlantis The Lost Empire was similar to the anime Nadia The Secret of Blue Water particularly in its character design setting and story The similarities as noted by viewers in both Japan and America were strong enough for its production company Gainax to be called to sue for plagiarism According to Gainax member Yasuhiro Takeda they only refrained from doing so because the decision belonged to parent companies NHK and Toho Another Gainax worker Hiroyuki Yamaga was quoted in an interview in as saying We actually tried to get NHK to pick a fight with Disney but even the National Television Network of Japan didn t dare to mess with Disney and their lawyers We actually did say that but we wouldn t actually take them to court We would be so terrified about what they would do to them in return that we wouldn t dare br Although Disney never responded formally to those claims co director Kirk Wise posted on a Disney animation newsgroup in May Never heard of Nadia till it was mentioned in this newsgroup Long after we d finished production I might add He claimed both Atlantis and Nadia were inspired in part by the Jules Verne novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea However speaking about the clarification Lee Zion from Anime News Network wrote There are too many similarities not connected with Leagues for the whole thing to be coincidence As such the whole affair ultimately entered popular culture as a convincing case of plagiarism In Reuben Baron from Comic Book Resources added to Zion s comment stating Verne didn t specifically imagine magic crystal based technology something featured in both the Disney movie and the too similar anime The Verne inspiration also doesn t explain the designs being suspiciously similar to Nadia s br Critics also saw parallels with the film Laputa Castle in the Sky from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli which also featured magic crystals and Atlantis directors Trousdale and Wise both acknowledged Miyazaki s works as a major influence on their own work and with the film Stargate as Milo s characteristics were said to resemble those of Daniel Jackson the protagonist of Stargate and its spinoff television series Stargate SG which coincidentally launched its own spinoff titled Stargate Atlantis the plot of the film is also paralleled involving a group visiting an unknown world a fictional language made for the other world s people the main protagonist having apparent knowledge of the people s culture falling in love with one of the female locals and electing to stay behind when the others return home br br br Accolades br br br Related works br br Atlantis The Lost Empire was meant to inspire an animated television series entitled Team Atlantis which would have presented the further adventures of its characters The series would have been akin to an animated steampunk version of The X Files and feature a crossover with Gargoyles However because of the film s underperformance at the box office the series was not produced On May Disney released a direct to video sequel titled Atlantis Milo s Return consisting of three episodes planned for the aborted series br Disneyland planned to revive its Submarine Voyage ride with an Atlantis The Lost Empire theme with elements from the movie These plans were canceled and the attraction was re opened in as the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage its theme based on the Pixar film Finding Nemo which was far more successful commercially and critically In addition after the Submarine Voyage s Magic Kingdom counterpart Leagues Under the Sea Submarine Voyage closed down in four years before Disneyland s there were proposals of a new attraction that would take its place with one of them a volcano attraction inspired by that film s Vulcania location being approved for the Magic Kingdom s Adventureland area Around during development of Atlantis The Lost Empire it was decided that it would be themed to the movie with it taking place in two years after the film s events The ride would have focused on Preston Whitmore a character from the film seeking to make Atlantis existence public and offer expeditions to visitors in newly developed vehicles However due to mishaps the vehicles would be forced to make a detour through the lava filled caverns of the volcano The attraction would have used a unique hybrid ride system in which it would start as a standard coaster before the trains hook up to a suspended track midway through to fly through the caverns The attraction would have been accessed by a new canyon path in between Pirates of the Caribbean and a re routed Jungle Cruise that would have led to a Whitmore Enterprises base camp at the edge of the Walt Disney World Railroad path with the mountain itself being built outside the berm However like the previous Submarine Voyage retheme the ride was cancelled due to the film s disappointment in the box office br br br Soundtrack br br The soundtrack to Atlantis The Lost Empire was released on May It consists
