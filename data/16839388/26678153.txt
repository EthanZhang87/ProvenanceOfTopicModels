causing the entire factory and the city to go dark br Entering the locker room the flashlights turn on allowing guests to point them at various objects activating different characters and objects to move Several tiny monsters pop out of the lockers while other objects simply pop out from underneath floor tiles and benches Turning into the bathroom Sulley can be seen searching for Boo with his flashlight Boo s giggling is heard from an unseen location br Randall can be found here hiding from Sulley whom he stands right behind Pulling into the laugh floor guests find several of M I s top

Harryhausen s sushi restaurant guests find the octopus like chef searching for Boo who can be found popping in and out of several different take out boxes Several odd fish can be found throughout the

tank She falls in the water and the vehicles head back into the streets br After tagging several more monsters Mike can be found being electrocuted by a large power source continuously the veins in

Boo playing with some garbage outside of a garbage compactor unaware that Randall is directly behind her raising his butterfly net br Randall mutters to himself about his success and when the power is suddenly returned to the factory Mike emerges from a grate in the floor knocking Randall backwards and sending him screaming into the garbage compactor which as guests watch on sends him on a conveyor belt only to be run over by a spike lined wheel repeatedly getting his body pummeled by large iron poles flattened and spun across another large wheel while changing skin colors then chopped up by a large wall like contraption and emerge from the compactor in the shape of a cube much like several other compacted cubes of garbage around him Randall s eyes spin in circles as he groans in pain br Turning away from the garbage compactor Mike Sulley and Boo can be found outside of Boo s door saying goodbye Leaving them behind the vehicles pass a small monster that waves goodbye Boo beneath him
