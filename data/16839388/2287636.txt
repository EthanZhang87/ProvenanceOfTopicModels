Fauna give her beauty and song the evil fairy Maleficent appears angry at not being invited She places a curse on Aurora before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday she will prick her finger on the

the kingdom s spinning wheels burned Flora Fauna and Merryweather devise a plan to hide Aurora in a secluded location and raise her themselves until her sixteenth birthday to which Stefan and Leah

so they can prepare a surprise party In the forest Aurora sings to the animals drawing the attention of Phillip now a handsome young man They fall in love without revealing their names and Aurora invites Phillip to the cottage that evening Meanwhile Flora and Merryweather s argument about the color of Aurora s birthday gown attracts the attention of Maleficent s pet raven Diablo Aurora returns

girl he met and wants to marry unaware she is the princess to whom he is betrothed King Hubert unsuccessfully tries to dissuade him br Shortly before sunset the fairies bring Aurora to the castle for her birthday celebration Maleficent appears and lures her to a tower room where she pricks her finger on a spinning wheel that Maleficent conjures The fairies place the sleeping Aurora in the highest tower and put the entire kingdom to sleep until their princess awakens Flora overhears a conversation between Hubert and Stefan and realizes that Phillip is the man that Aurora met The fairies rush to the cottage and discover that Phillip has been abducted by Maleficent br At her domain the Forbidden Mountain Maleficent reveals Aurora s identity to Phillip She plans to lock him away until he is an old man on the verge of death before releasing him to meet Aurora who will not have aged a single day The fairies rescue Phillip and arm him with the magical Sword of Truth and the Shield of Virtue

with Purv Pullen providing the sounds of other forest animals Marvin Miller was the film s narrator br br br Production br br br Story development br Walt Disney first considered making an animated version of Charles Perrault s fairy tale Sleeping Beauty in Preliminary artwork was submitted by Joe Grant but the project did not move forward Disney registered Sleeping Beauty as a planned production title with the Motion Picture Association of America on January after a preview audience s positive response to Cinderella By November of that year the Los Angeles Times officially confirmed the film s development Disney envisioned Sleeping Beauty as the pinnacle of his studio s achievements in animation and was willing to pool all resources needed to achieve that Recognizing the difficulty of producing another fairy tale feature which would not be too reminiscent of his previous films notably Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella he repeatedly told his staff during production that it had to be different br Key story work was done by Ted Sears Winston Hibler Bill Peet and Ralph Wright who were joined by other story artists as production continued They decided to discard the second half of the original Perrault story which describes a sleeping beauty married to a strange prince and focus on its first half to develop a more convincing relationship between the characters The earliest known story outline was written by April featuring a climactic wake up kiss and the encounter between prince and princess before she succumbs to the curse It also included the names of the fairies who had been reduced from eight to four and their corresponding magical abilities Tranquility the Fairy of Dreams Fernadell the Fairy of the Forest Merryweather the Fairy of the Elements and Maleficent the Fairy of Darkness The story artists expanded the fairies roles turning the good fairies into comical guardians of the princess and the evil fairy into a more powerful villain In this version of the story Maleficent would conjure an indestructible spinning wheel which the king and queen would unsuccessfully try to get rid of they would be forced to hide their daughter in the castle walls and never let her out The princess was envisioned as a poor little rich girl burdened with her royal lineage and dreaming of exploring the world outside the castle Shortly before her sixteenth birthday the princess was to switch clothes with her maidservant and secretly escape to a nearby forest or country fair where she would meet and fall in love with the prince He would travel to a faraway land and return a few years later to fight Maleficent with the help of the good fairies find the sleeping princess and wake her up with the kiss Story ideas of that period also included the good fairies attempting to surround the castle with a protective circle and Maleficent having a comically incompetent vulture sidekick although the earlier outline depicted him as a sinister falcon br br By June the full storyboard of Sleeping Beauty was completed but Disney rejected it stating that its approach was too similar to his studio s earlier films The story artists discarded the original version and started from scratch deciding to retain several ideas from earlier suggestions such as the prince s acquaintance with the princess before the curse is fulfilled and a shorter sleep The story team initially developed a sequence in which the characters meet during a treasure hunt but later abandoned it feeling it drifted too far from the central storyline Instead it was written that the prince and princess would meet in the forest by chance which had been introduced in the outline Striving for more serious storytelling Disney decided to cut several gags involving the Three Good Fairies which he felt were more appropriate for Donald Duck shorts In one the fairies who had been renamed Flora Fauna and Merryweather try to bake a birthday cake for the princess and accidentally blow up the oven The good fairies were originally intended to rule the domains indicated by their names Flora would be in charge of flowers and plants Fauna would oversee the animals and birds and Merryweather would control the climate Disney discarded this idea as well feeling that it did not advance the central storyline br Part of the difficulty in production was in differentiating the studio s third princess who had been named Aurora from Snow White and Cinderella The story artists came up with an idea of the fairies raising her in a forest cottage with Aurora unaware of her background or the danger she faced She was also given a different personality a freshness and a modern sensibility to make her more appealing to audiences In earlier versions of the story Aurora would encounter Maleficent who would trick her into pricking her finger on the spindle but Disney felt that the eerie haunting presentation of a victim powerless in the hands of evil would be a stronger choice so the scene was rewritten to have Maleficent lure Aurora with hypnosis The improvement of his animators skill in drafting a realistic male figure prompted Disney to expand the role of the prince who had been named Phillip To establish him as Aurora s true love the story artists developed a plot in which Maleficent kidnaps Phillip and plans to keep him prisoner in her castle for a century which was also a reference to the year slumber in Perrault s story Several story elements originated from discarded ideas for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella including the prince and princess dancing on a cloud Disney s favorite concept and Phillip s escape from Maleficent s domain br br br Casting br Walt Disney spent three years searching for a voice for Princess Aurora and considered shelving the project entirely before Mary Costa was cast by June She was invited to audition by Walter Schumann the film s composer at the time who heard her singing at a dinner party for the entertainment industry Born in Knoxville Tennessee Costa had a strong Southern accent which nearly prevented her from being cast until she proved that she could sustain a British accent Disney personally contacted Costa within hours of her audition to confirm that she had the role Before Costa was cast LP records by forty female singers were heard by the story artists and fifteen of them auditioned Costa recorded her lines for three years from to Twenty singers auditioned for the role of Prince Phillip and Bill Shirley who had a high baritone voice and experience in light opera was the final choice Before he and Costa were selected they made audition records together to determine if their voices complemented each other Disney was convinced that they did and approved the casting br Disney personally suggested Eleanor Audley for the role of Maleficent Audley initially refused since she had tuberculosis and was unsure if she would be strong enough for recording sessions but reconsidered when she began feeling better Regarding her voice work for the character Audley later said that she tried to do a lot of contrasting to be both sweet and nasty at the same time Disney chose Barbara Jo Allen for Fauna who had been frequently compared by the story artists to Vera Vague Jo Allen s character in The Bob Hope Show and Barbara Luddy for Merryweather Many actors auditioned for the role of King Stefan including Hans Conried before Taylor Holmes was cast because of his bemused but dignified voice This was Holmes final film role before his death in September eight months after the film s release Several of the studio s voice regulars were cast in the film including Verna Felton as Flora and Bill Thompson as King Hubert Felton is also believed to have been the voice of Queen Leah but the studio has no saved records of who voiced the character br br br Production delays br br By mid Walt Disney had planned to release Sleeping Beauty in Production began in July when supervising director Wilfred Jackson recorded the dialogue assembled a story reel and was to begin preliminary animation for a pilot scene in which Aurora and Phillip meet in the forest Disney was dissatisfied with the original version of the scene and Jackson along with Ted Sears and two other story artists had to extensively rewrite it over the next few months before Disney approved the revised version In December Jackson had a heart attack and was replaced by Eric Larson whose unit would animate the forest scene The film was scheduled for a February release by April and was later postponed to Christmas By July Disney began building his own theme park and developing a number of television series such as The Mickey Mouse Club and most of the studio personnel working on Sleeping Beauty at the time were assigned to develop those projects The film s production was suspended although the castle at Disneyland was named Sleeping Beauty Castle to promote it br During its dormancy Sleeping Beauty was given to Erdman Penner and Joe Rinaldi for further development and the full storyboard was completed and to be discussed with Walt Disney by early The film s production resumed in December with its release rescheduled for Christmas Although Disney insisted on overseeing every aspect of the film he remained focused on Disneyland and animators such as Milt Kahl blamed him for the delays feet of animation had been completed by January with feet to be done According to studio executive Harry Tytle after the screening of the finished footage on August of that year Disney expressed disinterest in Sleeping Beauty and didn t give this the treatment he would have in years past where he d go in for a couple of days and fine tooth comb the whole picture Production delays led to an increase in the film s budget such as the forest scene which took several years to complete exceeded its budget and displeased Disney Relatively late in production he replaced supervising director Eric Larson with Clyde Geronimi A quota system was introduced to keep costs down requiring animators to create a specified number of drawings per day br br br Animation br br br Art direction br br To distinguish Sleeping Beauty from his previous features Walt Disney decided to take a different approach to the film s visual design After one of the story meetings he told Larson that he needed a moving illustration and did not care how long it would take By December Kay Nielsen was the first to create styling sketches for the film suggesting an ethereal depiction of the Middle Ages Although he was impressed with his artwork the film s production designer Ken Anderson felt that Nielsen s pastel paintings would be difficult to translate into animation Disney tasked John Hench to help interpret Nielsen s artwork with opaque cel paint but Nielsen left the studio by April The film s tapestry like style developed after Hench s visit to the Cloisters where he saw the Unicorn Tapestries series Hench brought reproductions of the tapestries back to the studio and made sketches inspired by the museum visit suggesting them as a visual template for the film s design Disney approved the idea and background artist Eyvind Earle made trial paintings based on Hench s sketches Wanting Sleeping Beauty to have a unified look from beginning to end Disney made Earle both the film s color stylist and its artistic director giving him unprecedented control of the film s visual appearance Sleeping Beauty was the first film of the studio in which background paintings defined its art direction br br Earle s main inspiration for Sleeping Beauty was the illuminated book of hours by Herman and Jean Limbourg Tr s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry from which he took key colors such as the yellow green for Maleficent s flames and the pink and blue for Aurora s royal dress He was also influenced by the pre Renaissance Northern European art including the works of Pieter Bruegel Albrecht D rer Huybrecht van Eyck Giotto di Bondone and Sandro Botticelli as well as by Gothic and Persian art medieval tapestries and Japanese prints In his five years of working on the film Earle created about three hundred visual development paintings hundreds of thumbnail scene sketches and dozens of key background paintings some fifteen feet long Over eight hundred other backgrounds in the film were created by Frank Armitage Thelma Witmer Al Dempster Walt Peregoy Bill Layne Ralph Hulett Dick Anthony Fil Mottola Richard H Thomas and Anthony Rizzo who worked under Earle s supervision and followed his style to maintain consistency in the film s design br Although the layout artists and animators were impressed with Earle s paintings they became discouraged by working in a style which many considered too cold flat and modernist for a fairy tale feature Animators struggled to make the characters which had to be stylized to match Earle s design stand out against his detailed background paintings with their design and color styling hindering character animation At one point Frank Thomas and Milt Kahl rebelled and went to Disney s office to complain but Disney insisted on the visual design saying that past inspirational artwork he had commissioned such as Mary Blair s had always been homogenized by the animators Earle s design prompted Walt Disney to film Sleeping Beauty in Super Technirama as the first animated film in this format This decision presented additional difficulties for animators and layout artists who had to work with very large sheets of paper and create twice as much art to fill the frame Sleeping Beauty was the last hand inked Disney animated feature film before the studio switched to the Xerox process with One Hundred and One Dalmatians Xerox was partially used in Sleeping Beauty to animate the forest of thorns in the final battle scene br When Clyde Geronimi became the supervising director he had creative differences with Earle feeling that Earle s paintings didn t have the mood All that beautiful detail in the trees the bark and all that that s all well and good but who the hell s going to look at that The backgrounds became more important than the animation He d made them more like Christmas cards By that time Disney felt that too much focus was on the film s design at the expense of its story In March before Sleeping Beauty was completed Earle left the Disney studio for John Sutherland Productions Geronimi then had the background paintings softened with an airbrush so they did not compete with the animation br br br Live action reference br Before animation began a live action reference version with actors in costumes as models was filmed for the animators to study Walt Disney insisted on this because he wanted the characters to be as real as possible near flesh and blood Several animators however such as Milt Kahl objected to this method stating that anyone worth his salt in this business ought to know how people move By March Helene Stanley was hired to provide live action references for Princess Aurora and several scenes of the Three Good Fairies She was chosen from over three hundred candidates interviewed for the role Stanley s costume for Aurora s woodland disguise Briar Rose was created by Alice Estes at the behest of Marc Davis as her first job assignment for the Disney studio br Prince Phillip was modeled by Ed Kemmer For a few scenes in the final battle scene Kemmer had to ride a wooden wagon imitating a horse which was controlled by the animators Cubby O Brien was a model for young Phillip The live action reference for Maleficent was provided by her voice actress Eleanor Audley and dancer Jane Fowler Among the actresses who appeared in reference footage for the Three Good Fairies were Spring Byington Madge Blake and Frances Bavier Hans Conried and Don Barclay were live action references for King Stefan and King Hubert The lackey who serves wine to the kings in the Skumps scene was modeled by Franklin Pangborn br br br Character animation br Tom Oreb whose designs employed a straight against curve motif similar to Earle s backgrounds was the film s character stylist Oreb was the first Disney artist to receive a credit in that capacity He worked closely with Earle who also had decision making capability in character designs and color schemes and created preliminary sketches for most of the characters incorporating strong horizontal and vertical planes of the background paintings into the designs The studio s ink and paint department made finished cels of Oreb s sketches which were placed over Earle s backgrounds to ensure that they would match the film s style The animators complained that Oreb s designs like Earle s styling were too rigid to animate According to Ken Anderson the characters became really unfortunately quite stiff In order to fit this mannered background they too took on a sort of cylindrical geometrical shape that didn t lend itself as well to the Well you might say the Bambi type of animation It wasn t really possible just to make the characters fit the style and still be quite as attractive br Marc Davis who embraced Earle s style was the supervising animator of Princess Aurora Collaborating with Oreb he created a leading lady of elegance whose earlier designs were influenced by Audrey Hepburn Stylizing the character to match the backgrounds Oreb incorporated vertical lines into the folds of her costumes and two dimensional swirls into her hair while Davis sharpened her features and clothes adding Art Nouveau and Art Deco style to her curls Aurora s final design was more refined than those of previous Disney heroines and therefore required more attention to detail than any animated character before Iwao Takamoto who was quality control animator of Aurora called working with her animation drawings a laborious job which limited in betweeners such as himself to completing only six or seven drawings per day where twenty four were required for each second of film br br Davis was also tasked with supervising Maleficent s animation and design which was influenced by a painting in a Czechoslovakian art book that he found in his home library Although Davis original designs had red trim on Maleficent s costume to highlight its flame like shape Earle asked to change it to lavender because red would appear too strong Davis also added horns and a collar resembling bat wings to give the character a more diabolic look and endowed her costume with a reptilian quality to foreshadow her dragon form Animating Maleficent was challenging for Davis because of the character s tendency to soliloquize and her lack of physical contact with other characters This was resolved with the introduction of Diablo Maleficent s raven whom Davis also designed and animated Maleficent s dragon form was animated by Eric Cleworth who based its head movements on those of a rattlesnake br Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston who struggled the most to adapt to Earle s style were the supervising animators of Flora Fauna and Merryweather Walt Disney initially urged that the characters be homogeneous but Thomas and Johnston objected feeling that it would be more interesting for each fairy to have a distinct personality Oreb s earlier designs portrayed the characters in a stricter geometric style reflecting the three primary shapes square triangle and circle but this was too difficult to animate and was discarded The final design was set after Don DaGradi created preliminary drawings suggesting a lighter and more delicate look for the fairies although they retained angularity in their capes and headdresses to match the background styling Thomas and Johnston studied the movements of old women they saw at wedding receptions and grocery stores for help in animation and the fairies costume design was influenced by wardrobe books for medieval Scandinavian and German style attire br Milt Kahl animated Prince Phillip but was displeased with the character s limited emotional range He also animated Phillip s horse Samson whose design was influenced by the works of Ronald Searle King Stefan and King Hubert Kahl s characters were co animated by John Lounsbery who also worked on Aurora s forest animal friends and the pig like leader of Maleficent s goons Among other animators working on the film were Wolfgang Reitherman who directed the climactic dragon battle sequence Les Clark who directed the opening scene in which the townspeople march to the castle for Aurora s christening and John Sibley who animated the lackey br br br Music br The use of music from Pyotr Tchaikovsky s ballet The Sleeping Beauty was discussed early in the film s development but the idea was initially discarded due to the potential difficulty of adapting Tchaikovsky s ballet as a film score Jack Lawrence and Sammy Fain were signed to write the film s original songs in April and Walter Schumann was the composer A song score was produced by late summer of that year which included the main title song and its reprise by Fain and Victor Young the opening number Holiday sung by the royal subjects celebrating Princess Aurora s birth followed by It Happens I Have a Picture in which King Stefan and King Hubert discuss the virtues of their respective children Sunbeams Bestowal of Gifts sung by the Three Good Fairies and Maleficent as they bestow gifts on Aurora Where in the World Aurora s solo followed by the love song Once Upon a Dream in which she meets Prince Phillip and Mirage Follow Your Heart in which Aurora is lured to the spinning wheel br After Eyvind Earle became the film s artistic director the following year Walt Disney returned to the idea of using Tchaikovsky s ballet score feeling that Lawrence and Fain s Broadway type songs would clash with Earle s stylized design Schumann unsuccessfully tried to create new arrangements for the songs which would give them a Tchaikovsky sound but the original song score was unusable except for Once Upon a Dream which was based on the ballet s Garland Waltz theme Schumann later left the project due to creative differences with Disney and Ward Kimball recommended that George Bruns replace him Sleeping Beauty was Bruns first collaboration with the Disney studio and his first experience as a film composer br Working closely with animators directors and story artists Bruns studied and experimented with Tchaikovsky s music for three years to make it work as a film score The opening number Hail to the Princess Aurora sung by the royal subjects going to the castle for Aurora s christening was based on a march in the ballet s prologue The third strain of the Garland Waltz became I Wonder sung by Aurora as she walks through the forest with her animal friends For the scene in which Maleficent lures Aurora to the spinning wheel Bruns used the Puss in Boots theme from the ballet s third act due to its ominous quality that fitted perfectly into the needs of the suspense sequence He made several attempts to create a song from the Silver Fairy theme resulting in Riddle Diddle One Two Three sung by Flora Fauna and Merryweather as they prepare birthday presents for Aurora The song was eventually cut but its melody remained in the scene Among other deleted songs were Evil Evil which would have been sung by Maleficent and her goons and Go to Sleep in which the Three Good Fairies put a sleeping spell on the castle br Four of Bruns songs based on the ballet score were used in the film Hail to the Princess Aurora The Gifts of Beauty and Song I Wonder and Sleeping Beauty For Skumps sung by King Stefan and King Hubert as they toast their children s upcoming wedding Bruns composed his own tune in Tchaikovsky s style because he could not find anything suitable in the ballet The song lyrics were written by Tom Adair Erdman Penner Winston Hibler and Ted Sears most have the same placement and purpose in the plot as Fain and Lawrence s original songs Recording of the music began in the United States but due to a musicians strike Bruns was sent to a state of the art studio in Berlin which permitted a new stereo sound system for the film Sleeping Beauty s score was the first true stereo soundtrack It was recorded with the Graunke Symphony Orchestra from September to

the distributor s share of the box office gross in the United States and Canada It was considered a box office bomb and Buena Vista Distribution Disney s distribution division lost Eric Larson blamed the studio s publicity department for the film s underperformance feeling that The Shaggy Dog released later that year had a far more extensive and successful advertising campaign The production costs and box office failure of Sleeping Beauty coupled with the underperformance of much of the studio s release slate caused Walt Disney to lose interest in animation His company posted an annual loss of

br br br Reception br br br Critical response br Sleeping Beauty initially received mixed reviews from critics with many praising its art direction voice acting and musical score but criticizing its plot and characters Ren Grevatt of Billboard called the film a Disney best and complimented its score colors and the final battle scene which he described as a hair raiser for the youngsters and grown up alike Variety praised the vocal work of Mary Costa and Bill Shirley and called the scenes involving the Three Good Fairies some of the best parts of the picture For The New York Daily News Kate Cameron wrote that the film will charm the young and tickle adults and praised its story voice acting and character animation George Bourke of the Miami Herald described the film as a magnificent achievement offering suspense action and happy humor in a truly giant size package Lorna Carroll writing for the St Petersburg Times called the film a masterpiece and the last word in the art of animation however although Sleeping Beauty is far more magnificent far more advanced it does not touch the heart as did Snow White Henry Ward of The Pittsburgh Press praised the film s art direction and said that children undoubtedly will find the film completely enchanting adding that a more mature audience may find this new effort somewhat of a carbon copy of previous Disney animated features br Bosley Crowther wrote for The New York Times that the colors are rich the sounds are luscious and magic sparkles spurt charmingly from wands but felt that the film s plot and characters were too similar to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Philip K Scheuer of Los Angeles Times praised the film s visual design animation quality and the Three Good Fairies and Maleficent but criticized its stereotyped human characters and found himself more impressed by the accompanying short film Grand Canyon In the Pittsburgh Post Gazette Harold V Cohen praised the film s sharp and unmistakable art style and animation but found the characters underdeveloped and not exactly memorable Harrison s Reports also noted the film s similarity to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs saying that although Sleeping Beauty is unquestionably superior from the viewpoint of the art of animation it lacked the unforgettable characters songs and the overall entertainment appeal of Snow White Time harshly criticized the film particularly its design Even the drawing in Sleeping Beauty is crude a compromise between sentimental crayon book childishness and the sort of cute commercial cubism that tries to seem daring but is really just square br Among contemporary reviews Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader described Sleeping Beauty as the masterpiece of the Disney Studios postwar style Kehr praised its use of the Super Technirama process particularly in the final battle scene Charles Solomon wrote for the Los Angeles Times that the film represents the culmination of Walt Disney s effort to elevate animation to an art form Solomon praised its visual design the character of Maleficent and the finale battle scene but felt that it lacks the strong story line of the other Disney features particularly the not very interesting romance between Aurora and Phillip Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine praised the film s limber giddy art style calling it one of Disney s studio s most under cherished works A Time Out reviewer wrote that although Sleeping Beauty rarely achieves the heights of classics like Snow White and Dumbo it still has its moments highlighting its polished if sometimes stodgy animation soundtrack and the final confrontation between Maleficent and Phillip br In his book The Disney Films Leonard Maltin praised the film s design The fantastic effort and phenomenal expense do show up on the screen it is unquestionably Disney s most elaborate cartoon film Its animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston said on their website that Sleeping Beauty was dazzling in color and design but lacked warmth The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film had an approval rating based on reviews with an average rating of According to its
