the defining evolution of their tailfins The cars are inclined at the same angle as the pyramids of Giza br br br History br Chip Lord and Doug Michels were architects Marquez was an art student at Tulane University in New Orleans Louisiana According to Lord Ant Farm was founded as an alternative architectural practice kind of an experiment in an attempt to subvert normal corporate ways of doing architecture br According to Marquez Chip and I were living in the mountains north of San Francisco and there was a book meant for kids left in a bar near where we lived It was called The Look of Cars and there was something on the rise and fall of the tail fin I didn t have a lot to do so I just sorta drew it up I ve always loved the Cadillacs br The group claims to have been given a list of eccentric millionaires in in San Francisco identifying Stanley Marsh of Amarillo amongst those who might be able to fund one of their projects and submitted it to him Marsh s response began It s going to take me awhile sic to get used to the idea of the Cadillac Ranch I ll answer you by April Fool s Day It s such an irrelevant and silly proposition that I want to give it all my time and attention so I can make a casual judgment of it br br br Relocation br Cadillac Ranch was originally located in a wheat field but in the installation was quietly moved by a local contractor to a location two miles three kilometers to the west to a cow pasture along Interstate in order to place it farther from the limits of the growing city Both sites belonged to Stanley Marsh Marsh was well known in the city for his longtime patronage of artistic endeavors including the Cadillac Ranch Floating Mesa Amarillo Ramp a work by land artist Robert Smithson and a series of fake traffic signs throughout the city known collectively as the Dynamite Museum As of Stanley Marsh did not own the Cadillac Ranch ownership appears to have been transferred to a family trust some time before his June death br Cadillac Ranch is visible from the highway and though located on private land visiting it by driving along a frontage road and entering the pasture by walking through an unlocked gate is tacitly encouraged In addition writing graffiti on or otherwise spray painting the vehicles is now encouraged and the vehicles which have long since lost their original colors are wildly decorated Ant Farm artists have encouraged this kind of public interaction with the cars br The cars are periodically repainted various colors once white for the filming of a television commercial another time pink in honor of Stanley s wife Wendy s birthday and again all cars were painted flat black to mark the passing of Ant Farm artist Doug Michels or simply to provide a fresh canvas for future visitors In they were painted rainbow colors to commemorate gay pride day The cars were briefly restored to their original colors by the motel chain Hampton Inn in a public relations sponsored series of Route landmark restoration projects The new paint jobs and even the plaque commemorating the project lasted less than hours without fresh graffiti The cars were painted solid black with the words Black Lives Matter in June to protest police brutality and the murder of George Floyd br br br fire br On September the oldest of the Cadillacs was reportedly damaged by an arson fire br br br In popular culture br br
