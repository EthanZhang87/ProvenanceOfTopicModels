allowing Hamilton to retain his own image rights which is considered unusual in the sport and keep his championship winning cars and trophies br br Despite recording more pole positions and race wins than any other driver in Hamilton lost the drivers title by five points to his teammate Rosberg The team s policy of letting the pair fight freely led to several acrimonious exchanges both on and off the track culminating in Hamilton defying team orders at the final Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and deliberately slowing to back Rosberg into the chasing pack at the end of the race in an unsuccessful bid to encourage other drivers to overtake his teammate which would have allowed him to win the title Ultimately a succession of poor starts from Hamilton early in the season and a crucial engine blowout at

and race wins respectively br The season finale was marred by controversy over race director Michael Masi s decision to instruct only the lapped cars separating Verstappen and Hamilton to un lap themselves under the safety car which eliminated any gap between the pair and allowed the Dutchman running newly fitted soft tyres to enter the final lap immediately behind Hamilton on his worn hard tyres Four days after the race the FIA announced that it would conduct an internal investigation into the incident Masi was subsequently removed from his role as race director with the FIA World Motor Sport Council report finding that human error resulted in the failure to follow Formula One Sporting Regulations concerning the withdrawal of the safety car but also that the final standings are valid

Hamilton and Verstappen having been head and shoulders and a lot more clear of every other driver on the grid br br br Mercedes struggles and departure br br Hamilton was partnered by George Russell for the season in place of the departing Bottas The season saw significant changes in technical regulations which sought to utilise ground effect to generate downforce During pre season testing in Bahrain Mercedes introduced their zero sidepod car design which was radically different to that of its competitors Although the Mercedes W s innovative design elements provided promising results in the simulator it suffered with extreme porpoising early in the season To prevent this the team was forced run their cars with higher ride heights compared to others leading to significant loss of downforce which limited the car s potential At the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix Hamilton deemed the car was undrivable after barely managing to finish in the points During the first half of the season Hamilton was marginally low on points compared to Russell despite his integral involvement in W s development He diligently experimented with various car setups during race weekends until the major car upgrades at the British Grand Prix Once his focus and contribution shifted from development to the usual performance he was able achieve better results Surpassing Russell s tally in the latter half of the season with more podium finishes and championship points br Despite a difficult season Hamilton was able to set several driver records including most consecutive seasons with at least one podium finish most consecutive seasons with at least one lap led most races with a single constructor most Q appearances most top finishes and chequered flags reached at the Monaco Grand Prix most podium finishes at a single circuit most points scored at the Monza Circuit and most podium finishes at the United States Grand Prix By the end of the season Hamilton had scored nine podium finishes but failed to win a race nor a pole position in a season for the first time in his Formula One career He finished sixth in the Drivers Championship points behind Russell who finished fourth But Hamilton managed to outqualify and finish on podium in more occasions compared to Russell over the course of the season br Mercedes carried on their abnormal car concept into the season with the Mercedes W again starting with concerns over their competitiveness with Hamilton saying they were not where they wanted to be after pre season testing He finished fifth in the opening race in Bahrain over seconds behind the race winner Verstappen His first of the season and record extending podium finish was followed at the chaotic Australian Grand Prix Five more podium finishes were followed during the season including a hard fought podium at his home race in Silverstone starting from seventh on the grid At the Hungarian Grand Prix Hamilton qualified seconds ahead of Verstappen to take his th pole position and his first since It was his record ninth pole position at the Hungaroring surpassing Senna and Schumacher to the record for most pole positions at a single circuit br In the build up to the Italian Grand Prix Hamilton signed a two year contract extension worth over million to remain with Mercedes through the season Russell also signed a two year extension retaining Mercedes driver pair Although Hamilton finished second at the United States Grand Prix he was stripped of the podium due to a post race disqualification caused by a technical infringement It was recognized as a crucial turnaround in his fight for the second position in the Driver s Championship with Red Bull s Sergio P rez Outdriving the capabilities of the W throughout the season Hamilton finished at an impressive third in the Driver s Championship while teammate Russell finished eighth to secure second position for Mercedes in the Constructor s Championship three points ahead of Ferrari Hamilton was also named the second best driver on the grid by the drivers during the season behind the championship winner Verstappen br Prior to the start of the season Hamilton triggered an exit clause in his Mercedes contract allowing him to leave the team at the conclusion of the season a year before his contract was due to expire Hamilton claimed the decision was one of the hardest to make but it was made due to the need of a new challenge and a different work environment Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff insisted that the team failing to provide Hamilton with a long term contract might have been an important element in his decision to leave the team Hamilton s final car for the team the Mercedes W was unveiled in February It was claimed to have built on a completely different design approach compared to its predecessors br br br Ferrari br Following numerous rumours and speculation over the course of the season it was announced prior to the start of the Formula One season

transfer shocks the sport has known also recalled his similar shock move from McLaren to Mercedes back in Hamilton claimed driving for Ferrari was one of his childhood dreams This transition marks the first time in his Formula One career that Hamilton will not be driving for a Mercedes powered team and will end Hamilton s record breaking streak of most consecutive seasons driving for a single constructor br br br Driver profile br br br Driving style br br Hamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid excelling across a wide range of areas He has been described as having an aggressive driving style with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car Mark Hughes writing for the official Formula One website described how Hamilton is super hard on the brakes but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there s no wasted grip but no locked wheels either Paddy Lowe previously the engineering director for McLaren described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable br Hamilton has also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set up and changing track conditions throughout his career he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a result of his ability to carry momentum through corners despite instability in the car Pedro de la Rosa a former test driver for McLaren who worked with Hamilton and Alonso rated the pair as the best he had seen first hand stating that they shared a strength in terms of how much speed they can run into the apex of a corner and still have a decent exit speed highlighting in particular their ability to maintain this speed when their rear tyres have lost grip during a longer stint br Hamilton has been praised for his consistency especially in his time at Mercedes From to he finished consecutive races in point scoring positions a run only brought to an end as a result of mechanical issues as opposed to driver error Ross Brawn wrote that over the course of Hamilton hardly put a foot wrong winning not only the races he should have but also some where the opposition was stronger and that is the true mark of a champion Ahead of the season Martin Brundle commentating for Sky Sports said I think what has stood out about Lewis over the years is how few mistakes he makes how complete he is and clean he just never makes a mistake in wheel to wheel combat or in qualifying He just doesn t fade mentally or physically br br Hamilton is regarded as one of the best wet weather drivers in the sport with some of his best performances occurring in those conditions In the British Grand Prix Hamilton bested second place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute the largest margin of victory recorded since the Australian Grand Prix During the turbo hybrid era Hamilton remained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the Japanese Grand Prix up to the German Grand Prix where his almost five year streak was broken by Max Verstappen His wet weather drive at the Turkish Grand Prix where he clinched his seventh world title was widely acclaimed with Joe Saward describing it as one of his greatest performances Despite only qualifying sixth for the race after Mercedes struggled with tyre temperatures and a track that lacked grip after being recently resurfaced during the race he gambled on a one stop strategy in mixed conditions whilst his rivals chose to change their tyres for a second time enabling him to take the lead and win by over seconds His performance was contrasted with that of his team mate Bottas who spun four times and finished a lap down in th place Hamilton cited the race as his stand out performance of the season br br Ayrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton s driving style recalling I think it s partly because I watched him when I was young and I thought this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity and I went out there and tried it on the kart track My whole approach to racing has developed from there He has been compared to Senna in raw speed In Hamilton drove Senna s original title winning McLaren MP as part of a tribute documentary by the BBC motoring show Top Gear In the documentary along with fellow racing drivers he named Senna as the number one driver ever br Earlier in his career Hamilton was criticised for being hot headed at times as demonstrated when he was disqualified in Imola in the GP Series for overtaking the safety car something he went on to repeat four years later in Formula One at the European Grand Prix in Valencia Following his move to Mercedes Hamilton was credited with demonstrating greater maturity while maintaining his ruthlessness and aggression The official Formula One website describes him as invariably a fierce but fair fighter br br br Reception br br Hamilton has been described as the best driver of his generation and one of the greatest Formula One drivers including by Chase Carey and Martin Brundle Several Formula One drivers and experts have described Hamilton as the greatest Formula One driver of all time Writing in Autocar Jim Holden suggested Hamilton might not only be among the greatest British drivers in Formula One but one of the greatest British sportsmen Despite receiving plaudits from experts and fans in and out of the sport Hamilton has been a divisive figure in the eyes of the general public with some journalists arguing his exploits on the track have been underappreciated Holden has suggested that racial bias may have contributed towards Hamilton s perceived lack of popularity relative to his achievements with Hamilton s race and physical appearance being mixed race and often seen sporting earrings dreadlocks and designer clothing alienating some of the sport s traditional white elderly male fanbase Others have attributed his lack of appreciation to the perceived predictability of results during the turbo hybrid era likening his period of dominance to that of Schumacher in the early s and to tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova all of whom became more appreciated in the latter part of their careers br br Hamilton s jet set lifestyle and interests outside Formula One have been scrutinised He has been praised for disregarding convention and public opinion and has been described as one of the last superstar drivers Between race weekends Hamilton has on several occasions travelled around the world to explore a variety of interests such as in where after winning the Italian Grand Prix Hamilton flew to Shanghai and New York where he released his own designer clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger before flying immediately back to and winning the next race in Singapore His Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff has been vocal in his support for Hamilton s off track pursuits explaining how freedom allows Hamilton to function at his best br Figures in the sport such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner have voiced their support for Hamilton s ability to connect with fans while Bernie Ecclestone frequently commented on his admiration of Hamilton s ability to promote the sport observing how he is happy to engage with fans unlike some of his peers Since Hamilton s rookie season in Formula One s annual global revenue rose by to billion as of July In The Telegraph sports journalist Luke Slater went as far as to argue that t here have been few better representatives of the sport than Hamilton both on and off the track Following Hamilton s knighthood in newly appointed Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said that Hamilton is a true giant of our sport and that his influence is huge both in and out of a car br br A prodigious talent as a teenager Hamilton established himself as one of the world s best drivers following his record breaking rookie year Paddy Lowe has suggested that he turned out to be the best rookie there has ever been and that his first half season is just the most extraordinary in history After his first world title a year later many people considered Hamilton the best driver of his generation Following Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel s four year dominance of the sport Hamilton s resolve was tested both professionally and personally as he did not finish higher than fourth in the Drivers Championship from to leading some to question his status as the best driver in the sport In spite of this Hamilton s less successful years with McLaren have also been cited as a demonstration of driving ability as Hamilton has won at least one race in fifteen consecutive seasons attracting high praise from experts and fellow drivers for extracting race winning performances from cars that were not dominant br br After Hamilton clinched his second and third World Championship titles with Mercedes in and David Coulthard declared Hamilton the best driver of his generation calling him the Ayrton Senna of his era an opinion which was widely accepted among the public experts and fellow and former drivers As Hamilton became more widely considered the best driver of his era public and expert debate moved from his status in modern Formula One to his status among the greatest drivers in history The next few seasons saw Hamilton eclipse a number of records including achieving the most all time pole positions ahead of Michael Schumacher leading him to be regarded by some as the greatest qualifier in history After winning his fourth and fifth world titles Hamilton s place among the greats of the sport became firmly established in the opinions of experts rivals and teammates alike including among others Fernando Alonso Carlos Sainz Jr Felipe Massa Gerhard Berger and Ross Brawn Some journalists and pundits also consider the possibility of Hamilton being the greatest Formula One driver of all time br Following Hamilton clinching a sixth World Drivers Championship title in ex Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert acclaimed Hamilton as the greatest driver ever a sentiment echoed by Wolff who described him as maybe the best driver that has ever existed while Formula One staff writer Greg Stuart described Hamilton as arguably the most complete Formula One driver ever After Hamilton won his seventh title in John Watson stated that Hamilton is by a million miles the greatest driver of his generation and you can argue he will go on to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time and highlighted his fearlessness as being key to his success as evidenced by his performance against double world champion team mate Alonso in his rookie season and his decision to leave McLaren for Mercedes Herbert compared Hamilton to tennis player Roger Federer and golfer Tiger Woods br br br Helmet br br From a young age Hamilton s helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue green and red ribbons In later years a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space Hamilton continued to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career but in decided to change to a mostly white approach In Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions The winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details and the addition of three stars one for each of Hamilton s three Formula One championships at that time on either side Over the following seasons Hamilton continued to add more stars to his helmet on winning further World Championship titles br br Hamilton has worn specially designed one off helmets for several weekends throughout his career At the Monaco Grand Prix he sported an altered helmet design with the addition of a roulette wheel image on the top At the Malaysian Grand Prix Hamilton brought with him a striking blue and green design in honour of team sponsor Petronas but was prevented from using the helmet by the FIA Hamilton has sported gold coloured helmets three times in his career After winning his fourth title in he entered Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of the helmet with the words World Champion Hamilton wore a gold helmet at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after sealing his fifth world title towards which he made reference with five stars on either side of

influential figures in his career At the Brazilian Grand Prix he wore a special helmet in tribute to Ayrton Senna which was auctioned after the race in aid of the Ayrton Senna Foundation At the Monaco Grand Prix Hamilton like fellow driver Sebastian Vettel wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Niki Lauda who died at the start of the week The helmet was painted red and white Lauda s classic colours and had his name printed on the back After the race Hamilton reflected on Lauda s career saying Ultimately as a driver my goal one day is to hopefully be as respected as he was He s definitely someone who led by a great example left a great example and was a real hero to so many Hamilton again wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Ayrton Senna at the Brazilian Grand Prix br Hamilton switched into a different design in which used black as base colour with purple details in support of Black Lives Matter he also continued to use the same design in Hamilton wore a rainbow helmet at the Qatar Grand Prix Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in support of the LGBTQ community Ahead of the season Hamilton reverted to using a yellow helmet design for the first time since it also used purple details He also used one off designs for the Monaco Grand Prix Japanese Grand Prix and Sao Paulo Grand Prix Evolutions of the yellow helmet design were used in and He wore special designs for the Japanese Grand Prix and S o Paulo Grand Prix br br br Rivalries br br br Fernando Alonso br br Hamilton s debut season saw him partner two time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso In their time as teammates tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco in After post race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders McLaren denied favouring Alonso and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team stating that McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result br Tensions surfaced again at the Hungarian Grand Prix where during the final qualifying session Hamilton went out on track ahead of Alonso and ignored requests from the team to let him through the two drivers had been taking turns on a race by race basis to lead during qualifying which gave the leading driver an edge due to the fuel load regulations then in place and Alonso was due to lead in Hungary Hamilton was then delayed in the pits by Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of the session Alonso was relegated to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting Hamilton who had qualified second to first while McLaren was docked Constructors Championship points Hamilton said he thought the penalty was quite light if anything and only regretted the loss of points Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident British motorsport journal Autosport claimed that this led Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso s pole however McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton that denied the use of any profanity br As a result of the events over the season the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso reportedly collapsed with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for The rivalry between the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season Alonso and McLaren terminated their contract by mutual consent in November that year ending his and Hamilton s time as teammates In subsequent years tensions between the pair dissipated and the mutual respect has grown with Alonso praising Hamilton in saying Hamilton was able to win with a dominant car with a good car like or or with bad cars like and Not all the champions can say that Alonso later described Hamilton as one of the top five greatest drivers of all time On the cool down lap after Alonso s final race before his
