Steven Paul Jobs February October was an American businessman inventor and investor best known for co founding the technology company Apple Inc Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the s and s along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co founder Steve Wozniak br Jobs was born in San Francisco in and adopted shortly afterwards He attended Reed College in before withdrawing that same year In he traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism He and Wozniak co founded Apple in to further develop and sell Wozniak s Apple I personal computer Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II one of the first highly successful mass produced microcomputers Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in which was mouse driven and had a graphical user interface GUI This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in the first mass produced computer with a GUI The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript br In Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company s board and its then CEO John Sculley That same year Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher education and business markets serving as its CEO In he helped develop the visual effects industry by funding the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm that eventually spun off independently as Pixar which produced the first D computer animated feature film Toy Story and became a leading animation studio producing over films since br In Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company s acquisition of NeXT He was largely responsible for reviving Apple which was on the verge of bankruptcy He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications beginning with the Think different advertising campaign and leading to the iMac iTunes Mac OS X Apple Store iPod iTunes Store iPhone App Store and iPad In Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor in in he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom br br br Early life br br br Family br Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco California on February to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah John Jandali Arabic Abdulfattah Jandali was born in a Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents the youngest of nine siblings After obtaining his undergraduate degree at the American University of Beirut Jandali pursued a PhD in political science at the University of Wisconsin There he met Joanne Schieble an American Catholic of Swiss German descent whose parents owned a mink farm and real estate in Green Bay The two fell in love but faced opposition from Schieble s father due to Jandali s Muslim faith When Schieble became pregnant she arranged for a closed adoption and travelled to San Francisco to give birth br Schieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates A lawyer and his wife were selected but they withdrew after discovering that the baby was a boy so Jobs was instead adopted by Paul Reinhold and Clara n e Hagopian Jobs Paul Jobs an American of German descent was the son of a dairy farmer from Washington County Wisconsin After dropping out of high school he worked as a mechanic then joined the US Coast Guard When his ship was decommissioned at San Francisco he bet he could find a wife within weeks He then met Clara Hagopian an American of Armenian descent and the two were engaged ten days later in March and married that same year The couple moved to Wisconsin then Indiana where Paul Jobs worked as a machinist and later as a car salesman Since Clara missed San Francisco she convinced Paul to move back There Paul worked as a repossession agent and Clara became a bookkeeper In after having an ectopic pregnancy the couple looked to adopt a child Since they lacked a college education Schieble initially refused to sign the adoption papers and went to court to request that her son be removed from the Jobs household and placed with a different family but changed her mind after Paul and Clara promised to pay for their son s college tuition br br br Infancy br In his youth Jobs s parents took him to a Lutheran church When Steve was in high school Clara admitted to his girlfriend Chrisann Brennan that she was too frightened to love Steve for the first six months of his life I was scared they were going to take him away from me Even after we won the case Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake I wanted to return him When Chrisann shared this comment with Steve he stated that he was already aware and later said that he had been deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara Many years later Jobs s wife Laurene also noted that he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents Jobs would bristle when Paul and Clara were referred to as his adoptive parents and he regarded them as his parents Jobs referred to his biological parents as my sperm and egg bank That s not harsh it s just the way it was a sperm bank thing nothing more br br br Childhood br br Paul Jobs worked in several jobs that included a try as a machinist several other jobs and then back to work as a machinist br Paul and Clara adopted Jobs s sister Patricia in and by the family had moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View California Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to pass along his love of mechanics Jobs meanwhile admired his father s craftsmanship because he knew how to build anything If we needed a cabinet he would build it When he built our fence he gave me a hammer so I could work with him I wasn t that into fixing cars but I was eager to hang out with my dad By the time he was ten Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood He had difficulty making friends with children his own age however and was seen by his classmates as a loner br br Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom tended to resist authority figures frequently misbehaved and was suspended a few times Clara had taught him to read as a toddler and Jobs stated that he was pretty bored in school and had turned into a little terror you should have seen us in the third grade we basically destroyed the teacher He frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary School in Mountain View His father Paul who was abused as a child never reprimanded him however and instead blamed the school for not challenging his brilliant son br Jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher Imogene Teddy Hill with turning him around She taught an advanced fourth grade class and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation She bribed me into learning She would say I really want you to finish this workbook I ll give you five bucks if you finish it That really kindled a passion in me for learning things I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school They wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn t let it happen Jobs skipped the th grade and transferred to the th grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View where he became a socially awkward loner Jobs was often bullied at Crittenden Middle and in the middle of th grade he gave his parents an ultimatum either they would take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school br The Jobs family was not affluent and only by expending all their savings were they able to buy a new home in allowing Steve to change schools The new house a three bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos California was in the better Cupertino School District Cupertino California and was embedded in an environment even more heavily populated with engineering families than the Mountain View area was The house was declared a historic site in as the first site of Apple Computer As of it was owned by Jobs s sister Patty and occupied by his stepmother Marilyn br When he was in Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett of Hewlett Packard after Jobs cold called him to ask for parts for an electronics project br br br Homestead High br br The location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to attend nearby Homestead High School which had strong ties to Silicon Valley He began his first year there in late along with Bill Fernandez who introduced Jobs to Steve Wozniak and would become Apple s first employee Neither Jobs nor Fernandez whose father was a lawyer came from engineering households and thus decided to enroll in John McCollum s Electronics I class Jobs had grown his hair long and become involved in the growing counterculture and the rebellious youth eventually clashed with McCollum and lost interest in the class br Jobs underwent a change during mid I got stoned for the first time I discovered Shakespeare Dylan Thomas and all that classic stuff I read Moby Dick and went back as a junior taking creative writing classes Jobs later noted to his official biographer that I started to listen to music a whole lot and I started to read more outside of just science and technology Shakespeare Plato I loved King Lear when I was a senior I had this phenomenal AP English class The teacher was this guy who looked like Ernest Hemingway He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite During his last two years at Homestead High Jobs developed two different interests electronics and literature These dual interests were particularly reflected during Jobs s senior year as his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan br In after Wozniak began attending University of California Berkeley Jobs would visit him there a few times a week This experience led him to study in nearby Stanford University s student union Instead of joining the electronics club Jobs put on light shows with a friend for Homestead s avant garde jazz program He was described by a Homestead classmate as kind of brain and kind of hippie but he never fit into either group He was smart enough to be a nerd but wasn t nerdy And he was too intellectual for the hippies who just wanted to get wasted all the time He was kind of an outsider In high school everything revolved around what group you were in and if you weren t in a carefully defined group you weren t anybody He was an individual in a world where individuality was suspect By his senior year in late he was taking a freshman English class at Stanford and working on a Homestead underground film project with Chrisann Brennan br Around that time Wozniak designed a low cost digital blue box to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network allowing free long distance calls He was inspired by an article titled Secrets of the Little Blue Box from the October issue of Esquire Jobs decided then to sell them and split the profit with Wozniak The clandestine sales of the illegal blue boxes went well and perhaps planted the seed in Jobs s mind that electronics could be both fun and profitable In a interview he recalled that it took six months for him and Wozniak to design the blue boxes Jobs later reflected that had it not been for Wozniak s blue boxes there wouldn t have been an Apple He states it showed them that they could take on large companies and beat them br By his senior year of high school Jobs began using LSD He later recalled that on one occasion he consumed it in a wheat field outside Sunnyvale and experienced the most wonderful feeling of my life up to that point In mid after graduation and before leaving for Reed College Jobs and Brennan rented a house from their other roommate Al br br br Reed College br br In September Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland Oregon He insisted on applying only to Reed although it was an expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford Jobs soon befriended Robert Friedland who was Reed s student body president at that time Brennan remained involved with Jobs while he was at Reed br After just one semester Jobs dropped out of Reed College without telling his parents Jobs later explained this was because he did not want to spend his parents money on an education that seemed meaningless to him He continued to attend by auditing his classes including a course on calligraphy that was taught by Robert Palladino In a commencement speech at Stanford University Jobs stated that during this period he slept on the floor in friends dorm rooms returned Coke bottles for food money and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple In that same speech Jobs said If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts br br br br br br Pre Apple br In February Jobs returned to his parents home in Los Altos and began looking for a job He was soon hired by Atari Inc in Los Gatos California as a computer technician Back in Steve Wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game Pong and gave its electronics board to Jobs According to Wozniak Atari only hired Jobs because he took the board down to the company and they thought that he had built it himself Atari s cofounder Nolan Bushnell later described him as difficult but valuable pointing out that he was very often the smartest guy in the room and he would let people know that br Jobs traveled to India in mid to visit Neem Karoli Baba at his Kainchi ashram with his Reed College friend and eventual Apple employee Daniel Kottke searching for spiritual teachings When they got to the Neem Karoli ashram it was almost deserted because Neem Karoli Baba had died in September Then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of Haidakhan Babaji br After seven months Jobs left India and returned to the US ahead of Daniel Kottke Jobs had changed his appearance his head was shaved and he wore traditional Indian clothing During this time Jobs experimented with psychedelics later calling his LSD experiences one of the two or three most important things he had done in his life He spent a period at the All One Farm a commune in Oregon that was owned by Robert Friedland br During this time period Jobs and Brennan both became practitioners of Zen Buddhism through the Zen master K bun Chino Otogawa Jobs engaged in lengthy meditation retreats at the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center the oldest S t Zen monastery in the US He considered taking up monastic residence at Eihei ji in Japan and maintained a lifelong appreciation for Zen Japanese cuisine and artists such as Hasui Kawase br Jobs returned to Atari in early and that summer Bushnell assigned him to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout in as few chips as possible knowing that Jobs would recruit Wozniak for help During his day job at HP Wozniak drew sketches of the circuit design at night he joined Jobs at Atari and continued to refine the design which Jobs implemented on a breadboard According to Bushnell Atari offered equivalent to about in for each TTL chip that was eliminated in the machine Jobs made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips Much to the amazement of Atari engineers within four days Wozniak reduced the TTL count to far below the usual though Atari later re engineered it to make it easier to test and add a few missing features According to Wozniak Jobs told him that Atari paid them only instead of the actual and that Wozniak s share was thus Wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten years later but said that if Jobs had told him about it and explained that he needed the money Wozniak would have given it to him br Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club in which was a stepping stone to the development and marketing of the first Apple computer br According to a document released by the DoD circa Steve Jobs claims he was arrested in Eugene Oregon after being questioned for being a minor in possession of alcohol Jobs alleges that he didn t have any alcohol but police questioned him and subsequently determined that he had an outstanding arrest warrant for an unpaid speeding ticket Jobs claims he then paid the approximately fine The arrest allegedly occurred behind a store br br br Apple br br By March Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer and showed it to Jobs who suggested that they sell it Wozniak was at first skeptical of the idea but later agreed In April of that same year Jobs Wozniak and administrative overseer Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer Company now called Apple Inc as a business partnership in Jobs s parents Crist Drive home on April The operation originally started in Jobs s bedroom and later moved to the garage Wayne stayed briefly leaving Jobs and Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company br The two decided on the name Apple after Jobs returned from the All One Farm commune in Oregon and told Wozniak about his time in the farm s apple orchard Jobs originally planned to produce bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I and sell them to computer hobbyists for equivalent to about in each To fund the first batch Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator and Jobs sold his Volkswagen van Later that year computer retailer Paul Terrell purchased fully assembled Apple I units for each Eventually about Apple I computers were produced in total br br A neighbor on Crist Drive recalled Jobs as an odd individual who would greet his clients with his underwear hanging out barefoot and hippie like Another neighbor Larry Waterland who had just earned his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford recalled dismissing Jobs s budding business compared to the established industry of giant mainframe computers with big decks of punch cards Steve took me over to the garage He had a circuit board with a chip on it a DuMont TV set a Panasonic cassette tape deck and a keyboard He said This is an Apple computer I said You ve got to be joking I dismissed the whole idea Jobs s friend from Reed College and India Daniel Kottke recalled that as an early Apple employee he was the only person who worked in the garage Woz would show up once a week with his latest code Steve Jobs didn t get his hands dirty in that sense Kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in Jobs s kitchen where he spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the company br They received funding from a then semi retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer named Mike Markkula Scott McNealy one of the cofounders of Sun Microsystems said that Jobs broke a glass age ceiling in Silicon Valley because he d created a very successful company at a young age Markkula brought Apple to the attention of Arthur Rock which after looking at the crowded Apple booth at the Home Brew Computer Show started with a investment and went on the Apple board Jobs was not pleased when Markkula recruited Mike Scott from National Semiconductor in February to serve as the first president and CEO of Apple br br After Brennan returned from her own journey to India she and Jobs fell in love again as Brennan noted changes in him that she attributes to Kobun whom she was also still following It was also at this time that Jobs displayed a prototype Apple II computer for Brennan and his parents in their living room Brennan notes a shift in this time period where the two main influences on Jobs were Apple Inc and Kobun br In April Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire It is the first consumer product to have been sold by Apple Computer Primarily designed by Wozniak Jobs oversaw the development of its unusual case and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply During the design stage Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two expansion slots while Wozniak wanted eight After a heated argument Wozniak threatened that Jobs should go get himself another computer They later agreed on eight slots The Apple II became one of the first highly successful mass produced microcomputer products in the world br As Jobs became more successful with his new company his relationship with Brennan grew more complex In the success of Apple was now a part of their relationship and Brennan Daniel Kottke and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple Brennan s relationship with Jobs deteriorated as his position with Apple grew and she began to consider ending the relationship In October Brennan was approached by Rod Holt who asked her to take a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples Both Holt and Jobs believed that it would be a good position for her given her artistic abilities Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it Brennan s decision however was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father It took her a few days to tell Jobs whose face according to Brennan turned ugly at the news At the same time according to Brennan at the beginning of her third trimester Jobs said to her I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion I just didn t want to do that He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her br Brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple She stated that Jobs told her If you give up this baby for adoption you will be sorry and I am never going to help you According to Brennan Jobs started to seed people with the notion that I slept around and he was infertile which meant that this could not be his child A few weeks before she was due to give birth Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm She accepted the offer When Jobs was the same age as his biological parents when they had him Brennan gave birth to her baby Lisa Brennan on May br Jobs went there for the birth after he was contacted by Robert Friedland their mutual friend and the farm owner While distant Jobs worked with her on a name for the baby which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket Brennan suggested the name Lisa which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name Lisa while he was also publicly denying paternity She would discover later that during this time Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name his first choice was Claire after St Clare She stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby s name for a computer and he hid the plans from her Jobs worked with his team to come up with the phrase Local Integrated Software Architecture as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa Decades later however Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson that obviously it was named for my daughter br When Jobs denied paternity a DNA test established him as Lisa s father It required him to pay Brennan equivalent to about in monthly in addition to returning the welfare money she had received Jobs paid her equivalent to about in monthly at the time when Apple went public and made him a millionaire Later Brennan agreed to interview with Michael Moritz for Time magazine for its Time Person of the Year special released on January in which she discussed her relationship with Jobs Rather than name Jobs the Person of the Year the magazine named the generic personal computer the Machine of the Year In the issue Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test which stated that the probability of paternity for Jobs Steven is He responded by arguing that of the male population of the United States could be the father Time also noted that the baby girl and the machine on which Apple has placed so much hope for the future share the same name Lisa br In at age Jobs was worth over million equivalent to million in By age his net worth grew to an estimated million equivalent to million in He was also one of the youngest people ever to make the Forbes list of the nation s richest people and one of only a handful to have done it themselves without inherited wealth br In Jobs bought an apartment on the top two floors of The San Remo a Manhattan building with a politically progressive reputation Although he never lived there he spent years renovating it thanks to I M Pei br In Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi Cola to serve as Apple s CEO asking Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world br In Jobs bought the Jackling House and estate and resided there for a decade Thereafter he leased it out for several years until when he stopped maintaining the house allowing weathering to degrade it In Jobs received permission from the town of Woodside to demolish the house to build a smaller contemporary styled one After a few years in court the house was finally demolished in a few months before he died br br Jobs took over development of the Macintosh in from early Apple employee Jef Raskin who had conceived the project Wozniak and Raskin had heavily influenced the early program and Wozniak was on leave during this time due to an airplane crash earlier that year making it easier for Jobs to take over the project On January Apple aired a Super Bowl television commercial titled which ended with the words On January th Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh And you ll see why won t be like On January an emotional Jobs introduced the Macintosh to a wildly enthusiastic audience at Apple s annual shareholders meeting held in the Flint Auditorium at De Anza College Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld described the scene as pandemonium The Macintosh was inspired by the Lisa in turn inspired by Xerox PARC s mouse driven graphical user interface and it was widely acclaimed by the media with strong initial sales However its low performance and limited range of available software led to a rapid sales decline in the second half of br Sculley s and Jobs s respective visions for the company greatly differed Sculley favored open architecture computers like the Apple II targeting education small business and home markets less vulnerable to IBM Jobs wanted the company to focus on the closed architecture Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the board Jobs s Macintosh division it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies duplicating services Although its products provided of Apple s sales in early the company s January annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees Many left including Wozniak who stated that the company had been going in the wrong direction for the last five years and sold most of his stock Though frustrated with the company s and Jobs s dismissal of the Apple II in favor of the Macintosh Wozniak left amicably and remained an honorary employee of Apple maintaining a lifelong friendship with Jobs br br By early the Macintosh s failure to defeat the IBM PC became clear and it strengthened Sculley s position in the company In May Sculley encouraged by Arthur Rock decided to reorganize Apple and proposed a plan to the board that would remove Jobs from the Macintosh group and put him in charge of New Product Development This move would effectively render Jobs powerless within Apple In response Jobs then developed a plan to get rid of Sculley and take over Apple However Jobs was confronted after the plan was leaked and he said that he would leave Apple The Board declined his resignation and asked him to reconsider Sculley also told Jobs that he had all of the votes needed to go ahead with the reorganization A few months later on September Jobs submitted a letter of resignation to the Apple Board Five additional senior Apple employees also resigned and joined Jobs in his new venture NeXT br The Macintosh s struggle continued after Jobs left Apple Though marketed and received in fanfare the expensive Macintosh was hard to sell In Bill Gates s then developing company Microsoft threatened to stop developing Mac applications unless it was granted a license for the Mac operating system software Microsoft was developing its graphical user interface for DOS which it was calling Windows and didn t want Apple to sue over the similarities between the Windows GUI and the Mac interface Sculley granted Microsoft the license which later led to problems for Apple In addition cheap IBM PC clones that ran Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear Although the Macintosh preceded the clones it was far more expensive so through the late s the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple Windows based IBM PC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBM s TopView or Digital Research s GEM and thus the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac it seemed clear as the s wound down that Apple couldn t go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM clone market br br br br br br NeXT computer br br Following his resignation from Apple in Jobs founded NeXT Inc with million A year later he was running out of money and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon Eventually Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot who invested heavily in the company The NeXT computer was shown to the world in what was considered Jobs s comeback event a lavish invitation only gala launch event that was described as a multimedia extravaganza The celebration was held at the Louise M Davies Symphony Hall San Francisco California on Wednesday October Steve Wozniak said in a interview that while Jobs was at NeXT he was really getting his head together br NeXT workstations were first released in and priced at equivalent to about in Like the Apple Lisa the NeXT workstation was technologically advanced and designed for the education sector but was largely dismissed as cost prohibitive The NeXT workstation was known for its technical strengths chief among them its object oriented software development system Jobs marketed NeXT products to the financial scientific and academic community highlighting its innovative experimental new technologies such as the Mach kernel the digital signal processor chip and the built in Ethernet port Making use of a NeXT computer English computer scientist Tim Berners Lee invented the World Wide Web in at CERN in Switzerland br The revised second generation NeXTcube was released in Jobs touted it as the first interpersonal computer that would replace the personal computer With its innovative NeXTMail multimedia email system NeXTcube could share voice image graphics and video in email for the first time Interpersonal computing is going to revolutionize human communications and groupwork Jobs told reporters Jobs ran NeXT with an obsession for aesthetic perfection as evidenced by the development of and attention to NeXTcube s magnesium case This put considerable strain on NeXT s hardware division and in after having sold only machines NeXT transitioned fully to software development with the release of NeXTSTEP Intel The company reported its first yearly profit of million in In NeXT Software Inc released WebObjects a framework for Web application development After NeXT was acquired by Apple Inc in WebObjects was used to build and run the Apple Store MobileMe services and the iTunes Store br br br Pixar and Disney br In Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group later renamed Pixar from Lucasfilm s computer graphics division for the price of million million of which was given to the company as capital and million of which was paid to Lucasfilm for technology rights br br The first film produced by Pixar with its Disney partnership Toy Story with Jobs credited as executive producer brought financial success and critical acclaim to the studio when it was released Over the course of Jobs s life under Pixar s creative chief John Lasseter the company produced box office hits A Bug s Life Toy Story Monsters Inc Finding Nemo The Incredibles Cars Ratatouille WALL E Up Toy Story and Cars Brave Pixar s first film to be produced since Jobs s death honored him with a tribute for his contributions to the studio Finding Nemo The Incredibles Ratatouille WALL E Up Toy Story and Brave each received the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature an award introduced in br In and as Pixar s contract with Disney was running out Jobs and Disney chief executive Michael Eisner tried but failed to negotiate a new partnership and in January Jobs announced that he would never deal with Disney again Pixar sought a new partner to distribute its films after its contract expired br In October Bob Iger replaced Eisner at Disney and Iger quickly worked to mend relations with Jobs and Pixar On January Jobs and Iger announced that Disney had agreed to purchase Pixar in an all stock transaction worth billion When the deal closed Jobs became The Walt Disney Company s largest single shareholder with approximately seven percent of the company s stock Jobs s holdings in Disney far exceeded those of Eisner who holds and of Disney family member Roy E Disney who until his death held about of the company s stock and whose criticisms of Eisner especially that he soured Disney s relationship with Pixar accelerated Eisner s ousting Upon completion of the merger Jobs received of Disney shares and joined the board of directors as the largest individual shareholder Upon Jobs s death his shares in Disney were transferred to the Steven P Jobs Trust led by Laurene Jobs br After Jobs s death Iger recalled in that many warned him about Jobs that he would bully me and everyone else Iger wrote Who wouldn t want Steve Jobs to have influence over how a company is run and that as an active Disney board member he rarely created trouble for me Not never but rarely He speculated that they would have seriously considered merging Disney and Apple had Jobs lived Floyd Norman of Pixar described Jobs as a mature mellow individual who never interfered with the creative process of the filmmakers In early June Pixar cofounder and Walt Disney Animation Studios President Edwin Catmull revealed that Jobs once advised him to just explain it to them until they understand in disagreements Catmull released the book Creativity Inc in in which he recounts numerous experiences of working with Jobs Regarding his own manner of dealing with Jobs Catmull writes br br In all the years with Steve Steve and I never had one of these loud verbal arguments and it s not my nature to do that but we did disagree fairly frequently about things I would say something to him and he would immediately shoot it down because he could think faster than I could I would then wait a week I d call him up and I give my counterargument to what he had said and he d immediately shoot it down So I had to wait another week and occasionally this went on for months But ultimately one of three things happened About a third of the time he said Oh I get it you re right and that was the end of it And it was another third of the time in which I d say Actually I think he is right The other third of the time where we didn t reach consensus he just let me do it my way never said anything more about it br br br br br br Return to Apple br br In Jobs s former company Apple was struggling and its survival depended on completing its next operating system After failed negotiations to purchase Be Inc Apple eventually came to a deal with NeXT in December for million the deal was finalized in February bringing Jobs back to the company he had cofounded Jobs became de facto chief after then CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in July He was formally named interim chief executive on September In March to concentrate Apple s efforts on returning to profitability Jobs terminated several projects such as Newton Cyberdog and OpenDoc In the coming months many employees developed a fear of encountering Jobs while riding in the elevator afraid that they might not have a job when the doors opened The reality was that Jobs s summary executions were rare but a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company Jobs changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines br With the purchase of NeXT much of the company s technology found its way into Apple products most notably NeXTSTEP which evolved into Mac OS X Under Jobs s guidance the company increased sales significantly with the introduction of the iMac and other new products since then appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for Apple At the Macworld Expo Jobs officially dropped the interim modifier from his title at Apple and became permanent CEO Jobs quipped at the time that he would be using the title iCEO br The company subsequently branched out introducing and improving upon other digital appliances With the introduction of the iPod portable music player iTunes digital music software and the iTunes Store the company made forays into consumer electronics and music distribution On June Apple entered the cellular phone business with the introduction of the iPhone a multi touch display cell phone which also included the features of an iPod and with its own mobile browser revolutionized the mobile browsing scene While nurturing open ended innovation Jobs also reminded his employees that real artists ship br Jobs had a public war of words with Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell starting in when Jobs first criticized Dell for making un innovative beige boxes On October at a Gartner Symposium when Dell was asked what he would do if he ran the then troubled Apple Computer company he said I d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders Then in Jobs emailed all employees when Apple s market capitalization rose above Dell s It read br br Team it turned out that Michael Dell wasn t perfect at predicting the future Based on today s stock market close Apple is worth more than Dell Stocks go up and down and things may be different tomorrow but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today Steve br Jobs was both admired and criticized for his consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship which has been dubbed the reality distortion field and was particularly evident during his keynote speeches colloquially known as Stevenotes at Macworld Expos and at Apple Worldwide Developers Conferences br Jobs usually went to work wearing a black long sleeved mock turtleneck made by Issey Miyake Levi s blue jeans and New Balance sneakers Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson he came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself both because of its daily convenience the rationale he claimed and its ability to convey a signature style br Jobs was a board member at Gap Inc from to br br In Jobs was granted stock options in the amount of million shares of Apple with an exercise price of It was alleged that the options had been backdated and that the exercise price should have been It was further alleged that Jobs had thereby incurred taxable income of that he did not report and that Apple overstated its earnings by that same amount As a result Jobs potentially faced a number of criminal charges and civil penalties The case was the subject of active criminal and civil government investigations though an independent internal Apple investigation completed on December found that Jobs was unaware of these issues and that the options granted to him were returned without being exercised in br In Jobs responded to criticism of Apple s poor recycling programs for e waste in the US by lashing out at environmental and other advocates at Apple s annual meeting in Cupertino in April A few weeks later Apple announced it would take back iPods for free at its retail stores The Computer TakeBack Campaign responded by flying a banner from a plane over the Stanford University graduation at which Jobs was the commencement speaker The banner read Steve don t be a mini player recycle all e waste br In he further expanded Apple s recycling programs to any US customer who buys a new Mac This program includes shipping and environmentally friendly disposal of their old systems br The success of Apple s unique products and services provided several years of stable financial returns propelling Apple to become the world s most valuable publicly traded company in br Jobs was perceived as a demanding perfectionist who always aspired to position his businesses and their products at the forefront of the information technology industry by foreseeing and setting innovation and style trends He summed up this self concept at the end of his keynote speech at the Macworld Conference and Expo in January by quoting ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky br br There s an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love I skate to where the puck is going to be not where it has been And we ve always tried to do that at Apple Since the very very beginning And we always will br On July a billion class action suit was filed against several members of the Apple board of directors for revenue lost because of alleged securities fraud br In a interview with biographer Walter Isaacson Jobs revealed that he had met with US President Barack Obama complained about the nation s shortage of software engineers and told Obama that he was headed for a one term presidency Jobs proposed that any foreign student who got an engineering degree at a US university should automatically be offered a green card After the meeting Jobs commented The president is very smart but he kept explaining to us reasons why things can t get done It infuriates me br br br Health problems br In October Jobs was diagnosed with cancer In mid he announced to his employees that he had a cancerous tumor in his pancreas The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is usually very poor Jobs stated that he had a rare much less aggressive type known as islet cell neuroendocrine tumor br Jobs resisted his doctors recommendations for medical intervention for nine months in favor of alternative medicine Other doctors agree that Jobs s diet was insufficient to address his disease However cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic David Gorski wrote that it s impossible to know whether and by how much he might have decreased his chances of surviving his cancer through his flirtation with woo My best guess was that Jobs probably only modestly decreased his chances of survival if that Barrie R Cassileth the chief of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center s integrative medicine department on the other hand said Jobs s faith in alternative medicine likely cost him his life He had the only kind of pancreatic cancer that is treatable and curable He essentially committed suicide According to biographer Walter Isaacson for nine months he refused to undergo surgery for his pancreatic cancer a decision he later regretted as his health declined Instead he tried a vegan diet acupuncture herbal remedies and other treatments he found online and even consulted a psychic He was also influenced by a doctor who ran a clinic that advised juice fasts bowel cleansings and other unproven approaches before finally having surgery in July He underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy or Whipple procedure that appeared to remove the tumor successfully Jobs did not receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy During Jobs s absence Tim Cook head of worldwide sales and operations at Apple ran the company br In January only Jobs s wife his doctors and Iger knew that his cancer had returned Jobs told Iger privately that he hoped to live to see his own son Reed s high school graduation in In early August Jobs delivered the keynote for Apple s annual Worldwide Developers Conference His thin almost gaunt appearance and unusually listless delivery together with his choice to delegate significant portions of his keynote to other presenters inspired a flurry of media and internet speculation about the state of his health In contrast according to an Ars Technica journal report Worldwide Developers Conference WWDC attendees who saw Jobs in person said he looked fine Following the keynote an Apple spokesperson said that Steve s health is robust br Two years later similar concerns followed Jobs s WWDC keynote address Apple officials stated that Jobs was victim to a common bug and was taking antibiotics while others surmised his cachectic appearance was due to the Whipple procedure During a July conference call discussing Apple earnings participants responded to repeated questions about Jobs s health by insisting that it was a private matter Others said that shareholders had a right to know more given Jobs s hands on approach to running his company Based on an off the record phone conversation with Jobs The New York Times reported While his health problems amounted to a good deal more than a common bug they weren t life threatening and he doesn t have a recurrence of cancer br On August Bloomberg mistakenly published a word obituary of Jobs in its corporate news service containing blank spaces for his age and cause of death News carriers customarily stockpile up to date obituaries to facilitate news delivery in the event of a well known figure s death Although the error was promptly rectified many news carriers and blogs reported on it intensifying rumors concerning Jobs s health Jobs responded at Apple s September Let s Rock keynote by paraphrasing Mark Twain The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated At a subsequent media event Jobs concluded his presentation with a slide reading referring to his blood pressure stating he would not address further questions about his health br On December Apple announced that marketing vice president Phil Schiller would deliver

thought He announced a six month leave of absence until the end of June to allow him to better focus on his health Tim Cook who previously acted as CEO in Jobs s absence became acting CEO of Apple with Jobs still involved with major strategic decisions br In Tim Cook offered a portion of his liver to Jobs since both share a rare blood type and the donor liver can regenerate tissue after such an operation Jobs yelled I ll never let you do that I ll never do that br In April Jobs underwent a liver transplantation at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in Memphis Tennessee Jobs s prognosis was described as excellent br br br Resignation br On January a year and a half after Jobs returned to work following the liver transplant Apple announced that he had been granted a medical leave of absence Jobs announced his leave in a letter to employees stating his decision was made so he could focus on his health As it did at the time of his medical leave Apple announced that Tim Cook would run day to day operations and that Jobs would continue to be involved in major strategic decisions at the company While on leave Jobs appeared at the iPad launch event on March the WWDC keynote introducing iCloud on June and before the Cupertino City Council on June br On August Jobs announced his resignation as Apple s CEO writing to the board I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple s CEO I would be the first to let you know Unfortunately that day has come Jobs became chairman of the board and named Tim Cook as his successor as CEO Jobs continued to work for Apple until the day before his death six weeks later br br br Death br br Jobs died at his home in Palo Alto California around p m PDT on October due to

Innovations and designs br Jobs s design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism In India he experienced Buddhism while on his seven month spiritual journey and his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied Jobs gained insights regarding industrial designs from Richard Sapper br According to Apple co founder Steve Wozniak Steve didn t ever code He wasn t an engineer and he didn t do any original design Daniel Kottke one of Apple s earliest employees and a college friend of Jobs stated Between Woz and Jobs Woz was the innovator the inventor Steve Jobs was the marketing person br He is listed as either primary inventor or co inventor in United States patents or patent applications related to a range of technologies from actual

NeXT who could successfully stand up to Jobs while also engaging with him br Even while terminally ill in the hospital Jobs sketched new devices that would hold the iPad in a hospital bed He despised the oxygen monitor on his finger and suggested ways to revise the design for simplicity br Since his death he has won patents He holds over patents in total br br br Apple I br br The Apple I was designed entirely by Steve Wozniak but Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer which led to the founding of Apple Computer in Jobs and Wozniak constructed several of the Apple I prototypes by

airplane accident and temporarily left the company Jobs launched the Macintosh on January as the first mass market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse This first model was later renamed to Macintosh k among the prolific series Since Apple has phased out the Macintosh name in favor of Mac though the product family has been nicknamed Mac or the Mac since inception The Macintosh was introduced by a US million Ridley Scott television commercial It aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January received as a watershed event and a masterpiece Regis McKenna called the ad more successful than the Mac itself It uses an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh indicated by a Picasso style picture of the computer on her white tank top to save humanity from the conformity of IBM s domination of the computer industry The ad alludes to George Orwell s novel Nineteen Eighty Four which describes a dystopian future ruled by a televised Big Brother br The Macintosh however was expensive which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore for consumers and the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second largest PC manufacturer for the next decade br br br NeXT Computer br br After Jobs was forced out of Apple in he started NeXT a workstation computer company The NeXT Computer was introduced in at a lavish launch event Using the NeXT

boasted the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else s Described as cartoonlike the first iMac clad in Bondi Blue plastic was unlike any personal computer that came before In Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape color and size considerably while maintaining the all in one design Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep The Apple iMac sold for at that time The iMac s forward thinking changes include eschewing the floppy disk drive and moving exclusively to USB for connecting peripherals Through the iMac s success USB was popularized among third party peripheral makers as evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic to match the iMac design br br br iTunes br br iTunes is a media player media library online radio broadcaster and mobile device management application

Soon after the event he stated that Laurene was right there in the front row in the lecture hall and I couldn t take my eyes off of her kept losing my train of thought and started feeling a little giddy After the lecture he met her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner From that point forward they were together with a few minor exceptions for the rest of his life br Jobs proposed on New Year s Day with a fistful of freshly picked wildflowers They married on March in a Buddhist ceremony at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park Fifty people including Jobs s father Paul and his sister Mona attended The ceremony was conducted by Jobs s guru Kobun Chino Otogawa The vegan wedding cake was in the shape of Yosemite s Half Dome and the wedding ended with a hike and Laurene s

Powell had two more children daughters Erin b and Eve Jobs b who is a fashion model The family lived in Palo Alto California br Although a billionaire Jobs made it known that like Bill Gates he had stipulated that most of his monetary fortune would not be left to his children Both men had limited their children s access age appropriate to social media computer games and the Internet br br br Family br Chrisann Brennan notes that after Jobs was forced out of Apple he apologized many times over for his behavior towards her and Lisa She said Jobs said that he never took responsibility when he should have and that he was sorry By this time Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa and when she was nine Jobs had her name on her birth certificate changed from Lisa Brennan to Lisa Brennan Jobs Jobs and Brennan developed a working relationship to co parent Lisa a change which Brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister Mona Simpson who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs Jobs had found Mona after first finding his birth mother Joanne Schieble Simpson shortly after he left Apple br Jobs did not contact his birth family during his adoptive mother Clara s lifetime however He would later tell his official biographer Walter Isaacson I never wanted Paul and Clara to feel like I didn t consider them my parents because they were totally my parents I loved them so much that I never wanted them to know of my search and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out However in when Jobs was Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer He began to spend a great deal of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption information that motivated him to find his biological mother Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant Although the doctor did not help Jobs while he was alive he left a letter for Jobs to be opened upon his death As he died soon afterwards Jobs was given the letter which stated that his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble br Jobs only contacted Schieble after Clara died in early and after he received permission from his father Paul In addition out of respect for Paul he asked the media not to report on his search Jobs stated that he was motivated to find his birth mother out of both curiosity and a need to see if she was okay and to thank her because I m glad I didn t end up as an abortion She was twenty three and she went through a lot to have me Schieble was emotional during their first meeting though she wasn t familiar with the history of Apple or Jobs s role in it and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers She said that she regretted giving him up and repeatedly apologized to him for it Jobs and Schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and would spend Christmas together br During this first visit Schieble told Jobs that he had a sister Mona who was not aware that she had a brother Schieble then arranged for them to meet in New York where Mona worked Her first impression of Jobs was that he was totally straightforward and lovely just a normal and sweet guy Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other Jobs later told his biographer that Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me As we got to know each other we became really good friends and she is my family I don t know what I d do without her I can t imagine a better sister My adopted sister Patty and I were never close br br Jobs then learned his family history Six months after he was given up for adoption Schieble s father died she wed Jandali and they had a daughter Mona Jandali states that after finishing his PhD he returned to Syria to work and then Schieble left him They divorced in and he said then he lost contact with Mona for a time br br I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria but we got back in touch after years We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn t know where she was but since years ago we ve been in constant contact and I see her three times a year I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida br A few years later Schieble married an ice skating teacher George Simpson Mona Jandali took her stepfather s last name as Mona Simpson In after divorcing her second husband Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her alone br When Simpson found that their father Abdulfattah Jandali was living in Sacramento California Jobs had no interest in meeting him as he believed Jandali did not treat his children well and according to the San Francisco Chronicle this was because of finding a Seattle Times article about Jandali s abandonment of his students on a trip to Egypt in Simpson went to Sacramento alone and met Jandali who worked in a small restaurant They spoke for several hours and he told her that he had left teaching for the restaurant business He said he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that we ll never see that baby again That baby s gone He said he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that all of the successful technology people used to come there Even Steve Jobs oh yeah he used to come in and he was a sweet guy and a big tipper At the request of Jobs Simpson did not reveal to Jandali that his own story meant that he had actually already met his son br After hearing about the visit Jobs recalled that it was amazing I had been to that restaurant a few times and I remember meeting the owner He was Syrian Balding We shook hands However Jobs still did not want to meet Jandali because I was a wealthy man by then and I didn t trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it I asked Mona not to tell him about me Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog He then contacted Simpson and asked what is this thing about Steve Jobs Simpson told him that it was true and later commented My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller but he is very very passive He never contacted Steve Because Simpson herself researched her Syrian roots and began to meet the family she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father but he never did Jobs also never showed an interest in his Syrian heritage or the Middle East Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in her novel The Lost Father Malek Jandali is their cousin br br br Philanthropy br Jobs s views and actions on philanthropy and charity are a public mystery He maintained privacy even over what few of these actions were publicly known He has been a key figure in public discussions about societal obligations of the wealthy and powerful Through his career the media investigated and criticized him and Apple as unusually and inexplicably mysterious or absent among powerful leaders and especially billionaires His name is absent from the Million Dollar List of all large global philanthropy Some have speculated about his possible secret role in large anonymous donations br Mark Vermilion former charitable leader for Joan Baez Apple and Jobs attributed Jobs s lifelong minimization of direct charity to his perfectionism and limited time Jobs Vermilion and supporters said over the years that corporate products were Jobs s superior contributions to culture and society instead of direct charity In Jobs said You know my main reaction to this money thing is that it s humorous all the attention to it because it s hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that s happened to me br Shortly after leaving Apple he formed the charitable Steven P Jobs Foundation led by Mark Vermilion hired away from Apple s community leadership Jobs wanted a focus on nutrition and vegetarianism but Vermilion wanted social entrepreneurship That year Jobs soon launched NeXT and closed the foundation with no results Upon his return to Apple Jobs optimized the failing company to the core such as eliminating all philanthropic programs never to be restored In Stanford Social Innovation Review magazine listed Apple among America s least philanthropic companies A few months after another unflattering news report Apple started a program to match employees charitable gifts Jobs declined to sign The Giving Pledge launched in by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates for fellow billionaires He donated million to Stanford hospital and contributed to efforts to cure
