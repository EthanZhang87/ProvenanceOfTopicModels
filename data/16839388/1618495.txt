Formula racing known as open wheel racing in North America is any of several forms of open wheeled single seater motorsport The origin of the term lies in the nomenclature that was adopted by the FIA for all of its post World War II single seater regulations or formulae The best known of these formulae are Formula One Formula E Formula Two Formula Three regional Formula Three and Formula Four Common usage of formula racing encompasses other single seater series including the IndyCar Series and the Super Formula Championship br Categories such as Formula Three and Formula Two are described as feeder formulae which refers to their position below top level series like Formula One on their respective career ladders of single seater motor racing There are two primary forms of racing formula the open formula that allows a choice of chassis or engines and the control or spec formula that relies on a single supplier for chassis and engines Formula Three is an example of an open formula while Formula BMW is a control formula There are also some exceptions on these two forms like Formula Ford where there is an open chassis formula but a restricted single brand engine formula br While Formula One is the most expensive form of motorsport in the world not all formula series are high cost professional events Some formulas intended for juniors and amateurs including categories such as Formula and Formula Vee are among the least expensive forms of circuit racing br Most contemporary formula categories allow the use of racing slicks and extensive use of wings and Ground effects to increase cornering speeds However there are popular amateur categories such as Formula Ford and Formula Vee which do not and consequently have much slower cornering speeds and in which drafting plays a much more important role Occasionally the term wings and slicks racing is used to distinguish the faster categories br br br World championships br br br Formula One br br In the process of reviving Grand Prix racing after the end of World War II the F d ration Internationale de l Automobile s Commission Sportive Internationale was responsible for defining the standardised regulations of Formula

temporary circuits in cities such as New York Hong Kong Z rich Berlin Rome and Paris in events known as ePrix In order to cap costs but maintain technological development the series uses a spec chassis and battery that must be used by all entrants with competing teams permitted to design and build their own motors inverter and rear suspension The series has gained significant traction in recent years br br br International championships br br br Formula br br The FIA Formula Championship was introduced in by Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore following the rebranding of the long term F feeder series GP Series Designed to make racing affordable and to make it the perfect training ground for life in F F has made it mandatory for all of the teams to use the same chassis engine and tyre supplier br br br Formula br br In the GP Series was replaced by international Formula just in the same way that GP was rebranded as Formula in The series first drivers champion was Robert Shwartzman driving for Prema Racing who also won the Constructors Championship for that year At the end of the year the FIA Formula World Cup takes place during the Macau Grand Prix as a non championship season ending event br br br Regional championships br br br Formula Regional br br Formula Regional is the last category that takes place outside the F events format It was created to

motorsport with the champion set to earn million In theory it would be possible for a driver to earn up to million over the course of the season This was all done to give drivers a chance to earn a living from motorsport By the link with football was fading with more than half the teams no longer associated with football teams The later races of the season did not take place and no further
