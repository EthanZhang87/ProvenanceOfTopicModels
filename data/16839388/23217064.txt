firecrackers could also be used as a weapon Troubled by Shen s obsession his parents consulted a soothsayer who foretold them that if he continued too far down this path he would be stopped by a warrior of black and white Overhearing the prophecy Shen deduced that the warrior would be a panda and led his wolf army to exterminate the pandas Horrified by the massacre Shen s parents permanently banished him In the present day Shen and his wolf army raid villages for scrap metal hoping to build cannons that Shen can use to conquer all of China br Meanwhile Po is enjoying his new life as a kung fu master alongside the Furious Five although Master Shifu warns him that he has not yet achieved inner peace When the wolf army raids another village Po and the Five intercept them but a symbol on the leader s armor that resembles a red eye gives Po a flashback of his mother Po questions his father Mr Ping and the goose reveals that he found Po as a cub in a shipment of radishes outside his restaurant When no one came forward to claim the cub Mr Ping adopted Po as his son Po and the Five are dispatched to Gongmen City after learning that Shen killed Master Thundering Rhino a regent of the city with a cannon Shen imprisons the other regents Masters Ox and Croc and takes over the city However the soothsayer constantly reminds him of the prophecy until he learns that Po is a panda br On arrival at Gongmen City Po and the Five free Masters Ox and Croc but the duo refuse to help believing that kung fu died alongside Master Rhino Po and the Five feign surrender to Shen secretly replacing Mantis with a dummy The real Mantis frees the others when they are inside the palace and they destroy the prototype cannon but Po sees the same familiar symbol on Shen s plumage which distracts him long enough for Shen to escape and destroy Gongmen Palace with his cannonade When the masters are safe Tigress demands answers so Po reveals that he somehow remembered Shen was there the day he last saw his biological parents Tigress sympathizes but fears that Po s lack of focus will get him killed The Five abandon Po for his safety and proceed to Shen s cannon factory with the intent to blow it up br However Po follows and confronts Shen inadvertently spoiling the plan and allowing the Five to be captured Shen lies saying Po s parents hated him and shoots him with a cannon Badly wounded but alive Po floats downriver and is rescued by the soothsayer She tells him about the panda genocide and encourages him to embrace his past Po finally achieving inner peace is able to remember his father fighting off the army while his mother hid him in a radish crate drawing off Shen s army so he could survive Rejuvenated Po returns to Gongmen City where Shen is sailing downriver

cannon killing some of his own soldiers to clear the way br Po stands alone against Shen using his newfound inner peace skills to deflect the cannonballs shot at him back at the fleet destroying it Po offers mercy to Shen but Shen rejects it and attacks Po with a spear This accidentally severs the lines holding up one of the cannons and it falls onto the ship killing Shen Po is congratulated by
