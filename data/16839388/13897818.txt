one goes into Ramone s while the other into Luigi s From here the cars enter a briefing room where Doc gives guests some advice for the upcoming race The two tracks come back near one another and two cars stop side by side The race begins as the vehicles accelerate out of the mountain and through hairpin turns and steep banks ending with a randomized race result and then a brief trip through Tail
