College SFCC Her studies did not include filmmaking computer animation or computer science but rather illustration graphic design and still photography She stumbled into computer animation by accident eventually leading to her career in feature film cinematography br br br Lighting and cinematography br Calahan worked in Spokane as an art director at KXLY TV KREM TV and at documentary film company Pinnacle Productions Calahan was part of the early years of the computer generated imagery CGI industry s expansion into television and feature films as lighting director making commercials and TV programs for Pacific Data Images later PDI DreamWorks until she joined Pixar in first as a lighting supervisor on Toy Story br The first time Pixar used the title Director of Photography DP on a film was on Calahan s next project A Bug s Life representing a recognition that the processes and thinking behind computer generated film production had more in common with live action film than with cel animation At Pixar it became an established goal to make films that looked like live action not cartoons More than a dozen years later computer animated films at other studios such as How to Train Your Dragon DreamWorks and Frozen Disney still did not credit a director of photography br Calahan said that on any kind of production whether entirely made of computer generated imagery or a typical modern feature that is usually a hybrid of live action shots with large amounts of added CGI or a pre computer era movies shot entirely on film the director of photography sets the visual tone and will create and realize an artistic vision for the composition lighting and look of the movie as a whole meaning that there is little real difference between a traditional director of photography credit and the new labels that were tested during CGI s infancy virtual cinematographer director of imaging or computer graphics director of photography In a Pixar production a team of about to lighting artists is overseen by the DP whose lighting director guides master lighters who both pre light each scene and oversee shot lighters who light each shot individually This takes place in constant collaboration with the layout department and with teams doing concept art storyboarding and previsualization During pre production while sets and characters are being designed by the art department and the technical teams are designing workflows lighting has not yet begun but Calahan will paint several hundred lighting concept illustrations based on the other teams work but also influencing them as her paintings evolve alongside their design work During this iterative and mutually collaborative process Calahan will begin to settle on lighting for each scene and will ask other teams for changes like recomposing shots br Calahan s work as both visual designer and lighting director of The Good Dinosaur was based in her experience as a native of the Pacific Northwest and from her time spent painting landscapes around the area of Jackson Wyoming which became Calahan s model for the film s setting Calahan had often vacationed in the mountains to do landscape painting During location scouting in the Jackson area as well as in Yellowstone National Park including a white water rafting trip digital photos were collected and added to Calahan s own library of photos of the region By the time director Peter Sohn and director of photography camera Mahyar Abousaeedi had sets and rough character animation to work with they could establish factors such as blocking camera lens focal lengths and depth of field This allowed Calahan and her team of close to lighters to do a first lighting pass setting the initial tone for the rest of the production and giving the film its unique look For The Good Dinosaur this meant open and natural landscapes with a rugged pioneering feel while for Ratataoullie the lighting was soft and romantic and Cars a guy s film was all about shiny metal br In Calahan was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS She became a member of the American Society of Cinematographers in as the first member to be elected to that professional group who had worked only in animation without also having done live action film br br br Filmography br Toy Story Lighting Supervisor br A Bug s Life Director of Photography br
