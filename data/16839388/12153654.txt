primarily at the Yorks residences at Piccadilly their town house in London and Royal Lodge in Windsor br br br Heir presumptive br During her grandfather s reign Elizabeth was third in the line of succession to the British throne behind her uncle Edward Prince of Wales and her father Although her birth generated public interest she was not expected to become queen as Edward was still young and likely to marry and have children of his own who would precede Elizabeth in the line of succession When her grandfather died in and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII she became second in line to the throne after her father Later that year Edward abdicated after his proposed marriage to divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis Consequently Elizabeth s father became king taking the regnal name George VI Since Elizabeth had no brothers she became heir presumptive If her parents had subsequently had a son he would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession which was determined by the male preference primogeniture in effect at the time br Elizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from Henry Marten Vice Provost of Eton College and learned French from a succession of native speaking governesses A Girl Guides company the st Buckingham Palace Company was formed specifically so she could socialise with girls her

of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief br During the war plans were drawn to quell Welsh nationalism by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales Proposals such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru the Welsh League of Youth were abandoned for several reasons including fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd at a time when Britain was at war Welsh politicians suggested she be made Princess of Wales on her th birthday Home Secretary Herbert Morrison supported the idea but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent In she was inducted into the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales br Elizabeth went on her first overseas tour in accompanying her parents through southern Africa During the tour in a broadcast to the British Commonwealth on her st birthday she

Philip had no financial standing was foreign born though a British subject who had served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links Marion Crawford wrote Some of the King s advisors did not think him good enough for her He was a prince without a home or kingdom Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip s foreign origin Later biographies reported that Elizabeth s mother had reservations about the union initially and teased Philip as the Hun In later life however she told the biographer Tim Heald that Philip was an English gentleman br br Before the marriage Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles officially converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Anglicanism and adopted the style

queen throughout her realms and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom Elizabeth and Philip moved into Buckingham Palace br With Elizabeth s accession it seemed possible that the royal house would take her husband s name in line with the custom for married women of the time Lord Mountbatten advocated for House of Mountbatten and Philip suggested House of Edinburgh after his ducal title The British prime minister Winston Churchill and Elizabeth s grandmother Queen Mary favoured the retention of the House of Windsor Elizabeth issued a declaration on April that the royal house would continue to be Windsor Philip complained I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children In the surname Mountbatten Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth s male line descendants who do not carry royal titles br Amid preparations for the coronation Princess Margaret told her sister she wished to marry Peter Townsend a divorc years Margaret s senior with two sons from his previous marriage Elizabeth asked them to wait for a year in the words of her private secretary the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess but I think she thought she hoped given time the affair would peter out Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit remarriage after divorce If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession Margaret decided to abandon her plans with Townsend In she married Antony Armstrong Jones who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year They divorced in Margaret did not remarry br Despite Queen Mary s death on March the coronation went ahead as planned on June as Mary had requested The coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey

Economic Community the precursor to the European Union In November Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal Lord Mountbatten said that Elizabeth was opposed to the invasion though Eden denied it Eden resigned two months later br br The governing Conservative Party had no formal mechanism for choosing a leader meaning that it fell to Elizabeth to decide whom to commission to form a government following Eden s resignation Eden recommended she consult Lord Salisbury the lord president of the council Lord Salisbury and Lord Kilmuir the lord chancellor consulted the British Cabinet Churchill and the chairman of the backbench Committee resulting in Elizabeth appointing their recommended candidate Harold Macmillan br The Suez crisis and the choice of Eden s successor led in to the first major personal criticism of Elizabeth In a magazine which he owned and edited Lord Altrincham accused her of being out of touch Altrincham was denounced by public figures and slapped by a member of the public appalled by his comments Six years later in Macmillan resigned and advised Elizabeth to appoint Alec Douglas Home as the prime minister advice

George VI Memorial Chapel later the same day in a private ceremony attended by her closest family members br br br Legacy br br br Beliefs activities and interests br br Elizabeth rarely gave interviews and little was known of her political opinions which she did not express explicitly in public It is against convention to ask or reveal the monarch s views When Times journalist Paul Routledge asked her about the miners strike of during a royal tour of the newspaper s offices she replied that it was all about one man a reference to Arthur Scargill with which Routledge disagreed Routledge was widely criticised in the media for asking the question and claimed that he was unaware of the protocols After the Scottish independence referendum Prime Minister David Cameron was overheard saying that Elizabeth was pleased with the outcome She had arguably issued a public coded statement about the referendum by telling one woman outside Balmoral Kirk that she hoped people would think very carefully about the outcome It emerged later that Cameron had specifically requested that she register her concern br Elizabeth had a deep sense of religious and civic duty and took her Coronation Oath seriously Aside from her official religious role as supreme governor of the established Church of England she worshipped with that church and with the national Church of Scotland She demonstrated support for inter faith relations and met with leaders of other churches and religions including five popes Pius XII John XXIII John Paul II Benedict XVI and Francis A personal note about her faith often featured in her annual Christmas Message broadcast to the Commonwealth In she said br br To many of us our beliefs are of fundamental importance For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life I like so many of you have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ s words and example br Elizabeth was patron of more than organisations and charities The Charities Aid Foundation estimated that Elizabeth helped raise over billion for her patronages during her reign Her main leisure interests included equestrianism and dogs especially her Pembroke Welsh Corgis Her lifelong love of corgis began in with Dookie the first of many royal corgis Scenes of a relaxed informal home life were occasionally witnessed she and her family from time to time prepared a meal together and washed the dishes afterwards br br br Media depiction and public opinion br In the s as a young woman at the start of her reign Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous fairytale Queen After the trauma of the Second World War it was a time of hope a period of progress and achievement heralding a new Elizabethan age Lord Altrincham s accusation in that her speeches sounded like those of a priggish schoolgirl was an extremely rare criticism In the late s attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary Royal Family and by televising Prince Charles s investiture as Prince of Wales Elizabeth also instituted other new practices her first royal walkabout meeting ordinary members of the public took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in Her wardrobe developed a recognisable signature style driven more by function than fashion In public she took to wearing mostly solid colour overcoats and decorative hats allowing her to be seen easily in a crowd By the end of her reign nearly one third of Britons had seen or met Elizabeth in person br At Elizabeth s Silver Jubilee in the crowds and celebrations were genuinely enthusiastic but in the s public criticism of the royal family increased as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth s children came under media scrutiny Her popularity sank to a low point in the s Under pressure from public opinion she began to pay income tax for the first time and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public Although support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher than at any time in living memory republican ideology was still a minority viewpoint and Elizabeth herself had high approval ratings Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the conduct of Elizabeth s wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana Princess of Wales although Elizabeth s personal popularity as well as general support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana s death br br In November a referendum in Australia on the future of the Australian monarchy favoured its retention in preference to an indirectly elected head of state Many republicans credited Elizabeth s personal popularity with the survival of the monarchy in Australia In Prime Minister Julia Gillard noted that there was a deep affection for Elizabeth in Australia and that another referendum on the monarchy should wait until after her reign Gillard s successor Malcolm Turnbull who led the republican campaign in similarly believed that Australians would not vote to become a republic in her lifetime She s been an extraordinary head of state Turnbull said in and I think frankly in Australia there are more Elizabethans than there are monarchists Similarly referendums in both Tuvalu in and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in saw voters reject proposals to become republics br Polls in Britain in and revealed strong support for the monarchy and in Elizabeth s Diamond Jubilee year her approval ratings hit per cent Her family came under scrutiny again in the last few years of her life due to her son Andrew s association with convicted sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell his lawsuit with Virginia Giuffre amidst accusations of sexual impropriety and her grandson Harry and his wife Meghan s exit from the working royal family and subsequent move to the United States Polling in Great Britain during the Platinum Jubilee however showed support for maintaining the monarchy and Elizabeth s personal popularity remained strong As of she remained the third most admired woman in the world according to the annual Gallup poll her appearances on the list meaning she had been in the top ten more than any other woman in the
