California His mother Jewell Mae n e Risley was an art teacher at Bell Gardens High School and his father Paul Eual Lasseter was a parts manager at a Chevrolet dealership br Lasseter is a fraternal twin his sister Johanna Lasseter Curtis who became a baker based in the Lake Tahoe area is six minutes older br Lasseter grew up in Whittier California His mother s profession contributed to his growing preoccupation with animation He often drew cartoons during church services at the Church of Christ church his family attended As a child Lasseter would race home from school to watch Chuck Jones cartoons on television While in high school he read The Art of Animation by Bob Thomas The book covered the history of Disney animation and explored the making of Disney s film Sleeping Beauty which made Lasseter realize he wanted to do animation himself When he saw Disney s film The Sword in the Stone he finally made the decision that he should become an animator He then read Preston Blair s book about animation and made flipbooks based on Blair s walk cycles One of his friends had a Super camera that shot single frames which was used to shoot some of his earlier animation efforts br Lasseter heard of a new character animation program at the California Institute of the Arts often abbreviated as CalArts and decided to follow his dream of becoming an animator His mother further encouraged him to take up a career in animation and in he enrolled as the second student Jerry Rees was the first in the CalArts Character Animation program created by Disney animators Jack Hannah and T Hee Lasseter was taught by three members of Disney s Nine Old Men team of veteran animators Eric Larson Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston and his classmates included future animators and directors like Brad Bird John Musker Henry Selick Tim Burton and Chris Buck During his time there he produced two animated shorts Lady and the Lamp and Nitemare which each won the student Academy Award for Animation br While at CalArts Lasseter first started working for the Walt Disney Company at Disneyland in Anaheim during summer breaks and got a job as a Jungle Cruise skipper where he learned the basics of comedy and comic timing to entertain captive audiences on the ride br br br Career br br br First years at Disney br Upon graduating in Lasseter immediately obtained a job as an animator at Walt Disney Productions mostly due to his success with his student project Lady and the Lamp The studio had reviewed approximately portfolios in the late s in search of talent then selected only about candidates as apprentices of which only about were kept on permanently In the fall of Disney animator Mel Shaw told the Los Angeles Times that John s got an instinctive feel for character and movement and shows every indication of blossoming here at our studios In time he ll make a fine contribution At that same time Lasseter worked on a sequence titled The Emperor and the Nightingale based on The Nightingale by Hans Christian Andersen for a Disney project called Musicana Musicana was never released but eventually led to the development of Fantasia br However after Dalmatians which in Lasseter s opinion was the film where Disney had reached its highest plateau he felt that the studio had lost momentum and was often repeating itself Between and he coincidentally came across some video tapes from one of the then new computer graphics conferences who showed some of the very beginnings of computer animation primarily floating spheres and such which he experienced as a revelation But it was not until shortly after when he was invited by his friends Jerry Rees and Bill Kroyer while working on Mickey s Christmas Carol to come and see the first light cycle sequences for an upcoming film entitled Tron featuring state of the art computer generated imagery CGI that he saw the huge potential of this new technology in animation Up to that time the studio had used a multiplane camera to add depth to its animation Lasseter realized that computers could be used to make films with three dimensional backgrounds where traditionally animated characters could interact to add a new level of visually stunning depth that had not been possible before He knew adding dimension to animation had been a longtime dream of animators going back to Walt Disney br Later he and Glen Keane talked about how great it would be to make an animated feature where the background was computer generated and then showed Keane the book The Brave Little Toaster by Thomas Disch which he thought would be a good candidate for the film Keane agreed but first they decided to do a short test film to see how it worked out and chose Where the Wild Things Are a decision based on the fact that Disney had considered producing a feature based on the works of Maurice Sendak Satisfied with the result Lasseter Keane and executive Thomas L Wilhite went on with the project especially Lasseter who dedicated himself to it while Keane eventually went on to work with The Great Mouse Detective br Lasseter and his colleagues unknowingly stepped on some of their direct superiors toes by circumventing them in their enthusiasm to get the Where the Wild Things Are project into motion The project was canceled while being pitched to two of Lasseter s supervisors animation administrator Ed Hansen and head of Disney studios Ron W Miller due to lack of perceived cost benefits for the mix of traditional and computer animation A few minutes after the meeting Lasseter was summoned by Hansen to his office As Lasseter recalled Hansen told him Well John your project is now complete so your employment with the Disney Studios is now terminated Wilhite who was part of Disney s live action group and therefore had no obligations to the animation studio was able to arrange to keep Lasseter around temporarily until the Wild Things test project was complete in January but with the understanding there would be no further work for Lasseter at Disney Animation The Brave Little Toaster would later become a D animated feature film directed by one of Lasseter s friends Jerry Rees and co produced by Wilhite who had by then left to start Hyperion Pictures and some of the staff of Pixar would be involved in the film alongside Lasseter br br br Lucasfilm and Pixar br br While putting together a crew for the planned feature Lasseter had made some contacts in the computer industry among them Alvy Ray Smith and Ed Catmull at Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Group After being fired and feeling glum knowing his employment with Disney was to end shortly Lasseter visited a computer graphics conference in November at the Queen Mary in Long Beach where he met and talked to Catmull again Catmull inquired about The Brave Little Toaster which Lasseter explained had been shelved From his experience at Lucasfilm Catmull assumed Lasseter was simply between projects since Hollywood studios have traditionally laid off employees when they lack enough productions to keep them busy Still devastated at being forced out of the only company he had ever wanted to work for Lasseter could not find the strength to tell Catmull that he had been fired br Catmull later telephoned Smith that day and mentioned that Lasseter was not working at Disney Smith told Catmull to put down the phone and hire Lasseter right now Lasseter agreed instantly to work freelance with Catmull and his colleagues and joined them for a week of December on a project that resulted in their first computer animated short The Adventures of Andr Wally B meant to prove it was possible to do character animation on a computer After his work on the Where the Wild Things Are test Lasseter assumed hand drawn characters in a CGI environment was the only way but Catmull insisted it could be done it was just that nobody had given it an attempt before Because Catmull was not allowed to hire animators he was given the title Interface Designer Nobody knew what that was but they didn t question it in budget meetings Lasseter spent a lot of time at Lucasfilm in the San Francisco Bay Area in the spring of where he worked together closely with Catmull and his team of computer science researchers Lasseter learned how to use some of their software and in turn he taught the computer scientists about filmmaking animation and art The short turned out to be more revolutionary than Lasseter first had visualized before he came to Lucasfilm His original idea had been to create only the backgrounds on computers but in the final short everything was computer animated including the characters br br After the short CGI film was presented at SIGGRAPH in the summer of Lasseter returned to Los Angeles with the hope of directing The Brave Little Toaster at Hyperion Pictures He soon learned that funding had fallen through and called Catmull with the bad news Catmull called back with a job offer and Lasseter joined Lucasfilm as a full time employee in October and moved to the Bay Area After that he worked with ILM on the special effects on Young Sherlock Holmes where he made the first fully computer generated photorealistic animated character a knight composed of elements from a stained glass window This effect was the first CGI character to be scanned and painted directly onto film using a laser Lasseter and Catmull s collaboration which has since lasted over thirty years would ultimately result in Toy Story which was the first ever computer animated feature film Additionally Lasseter created THX s robot mascot Tex He made his first appearance in with the original theatrical release of Independence Day Since then Tex has appeared in some THX trailers br Due to George Lucas s financially crippling divorce he was forced to sell off Lucasfilm Computer Graphics by this time renamed the Pixar Graphics Group founded by Smith and Catmull with Lasseter as one of the founding employees It was spun off as a separate corporation with Apple co founder Steve Jobs as its majority shareholder in Over the next years Pixar evolved from a computer company that did animation work on the side into an animation studio
