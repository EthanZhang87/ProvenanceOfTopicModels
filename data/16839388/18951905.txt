the north Brazil to the northeast Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Drake Passage to the south Argentina is a federal state subdivided into twenty three provinces and one autonomous city which is the federal capital and largest city of the nation Buenos Aires The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions but exist under a federal system Argentina claims sovereignty over the Falkland Islands South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands the Southern Patagonian Ice Field and a part of Antarctica br The earliest recorded human presence in modern day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre Columbian times The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the th century Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R o de la Plata a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in The declaration and fight for independence was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until culminating in the country s reorganization as a federation The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability with several waves of European immigration mainly Italians and Spaniards influencing its culture and demography br Following the death of President Juan Per n in his widow and vice president Isabel Per n ascended to the presidency before being overthrown in The following military junta which was supported by the United States persecuted and murdered thousands of political critics activists and leftists in the Dirty War a period of state terrorism and civil unrest that lasted until the election of Ra l Alfons n as president in br Argentina is a regional power and retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs A major non NATO ally of the United States Argentina is a developing country with the second highest HDI human development index in Latin America after Chile It maintains the second largest economy in South America and is a member of G and G Argentina is also a founding member of the United Nations World Bank World Trade Organization Mercosur Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero American States br br br Etymology br br The description of the region by the word Argentina has been found on a Venetian map in br In English the name Argentina comes from the Spanish language however the naming itself is not Spanish but Italian Argentina masculine argentino means in Italian made of silver silver coloured derived from the Latin argentum for silver In Italian the adjective or the proper noun is often used in an autonomous way as a substantive and replaces it and it is said l Argentina br The name Argentina was probably first given by the Venetian and Genoese navigators such as Giovanni Caboto In Spanish and Portuguese the words for silver are respectively plata and prata and made of silver is plateado and prateado although argento for silver and argentado for covered in silver exist in Spanish Argentina was first associated with the silver mountains legend widespread among the first European explorers of the La Plata Basin br The first written use of the name in Spanish can be traced to La Argentina a poem by Mart n del Barco Centenera describing the region Although Argentina was already in common usage by the th century the country was formally named Viceroyalty of the R o de la Plata by the Spanish Empire and United Provinces of the R o de la Plata after independence br The constitution included the first use of the name Argentine Republic in legal documents The name Argentine Confederation was also commonly used and was formalized in the Argentine Constitution of In a presidential decree settled the country s name as Argentine Republic and that year s constitutional amendment ruled all the names since as legally valid br In English the country was traditionally called the Argentine mimicking the typical Spanish usage la Argentina and perhaps resulting from a mistaken shortening of the fuller name Argentine Republic The Argentine fell out of fashion during the mid to late th century and now the country is referred to as Argentina br br br History br br br Pre Columbian era br br The earliest traces of human life in the area now known as Argentina are dated from the Paleolithic period with further traces in the Mesolithic and Neolithic Until the period of European colonization Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations which can be divided into three main groups br The first group are basic hunters and food gatherers without the development of pottery such as the Selk nam and Yaghan in the extreme south The second group are advanced hunters and food gatherers which include the Puelche Querand and Serranos in the centre east and the Tehuelche in the south all of them conquered by the Mapuche spreading from Chile and the Kom and Wichi in the north The last group are farmers with pottery such as the Charr a Minuane and Guaran in the northeast with slash and burn semisedentary existence the advanced Diaguita sedentary trading culture in the northwest which was conquered by the Inca Empire around the Toconot and H n a and K m are in the country s centre and the Huarpe in the centre west a culture that raised llama cattle and was strongly influenced by the Incas br br br Colonial era br br Europeans first arrived in the region with the voyage of Amerigo Vespucci The Spanish navigators Juan D az de Sol s and Sebastian Cabot visited the territory that is now Argentina in and respectively In Pedro de Mendoza founded the small settlement of Buenos Aires which was abandoned in br Further colonization efforts came from Paraguay establishing the Governorate of the R o de la Plata Peru and Chile Francisco de Aguirre founded Santiago del Estero in Londres was founded in Mendoza in San Juan in San Miguel de Tucum n in Juan de Garay founded Santa Fe in and the same year Jer nimo Luis de Cabrera set up C rdoba Garay went further south to re found Buenos Aires in San Luis was established in br The Spanish Empire subordinated the economic potential of the Argentine territory to the immediate wealth of the silver and gold mines in Bolivia and Peru and as such it became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until the creation of the Viceroyalty of the R o de la Plata in with Buenos Aires as its capital br Buenos Aires repelled two ill fated British invasions in and The ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and the example of the first Atlantic Revolutions generated criticism of the absolutist monarchy that ruled the country As in the rest of Spanish America the overthrow of Ferdinand VII during the Peninsular War created great concern br br br Independence and civil wars br br Beginning a process from which Argentina was to emerge as successor state to the Viceroyalty the May Revolution replaced the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros with the First Junta a new government in Buenos Aires made up from locals In the first clashes of the Independence War the Junta crushed a royalist counter revolution in C rdoba but failed to overcome those of the Banda Oriental Upper Peru and Paraguay which later became independent states The French Argentine Hippolyte Bouchard then brought his fleet to wage war against Spain overseas and attacked Spanish California Spanish Peru and Spanish Philippines He secured the allegiance of escaped Filipinos in San Blas who defected from the Spanish to join the Argentine navy due to common Argentine and Philippine grievances against Spanish colonization Jose de San Martin s brother Juan Ferm n de San Mart n was already in the Philippines and drumming up revolutionary fervor prior to this At a later date the Argentine sign of Inca origin the Sun of May was adopted as a symbol by the Filipinos in the Philippine Revolution against Spain He also secured the diplomatic recognition of Argentina from King Kamehameha I of the Kingdom of Hawaii Historian Pacho O Donnell affirms that Hawaii was the first state that recognized Argentina s independence He was finally arrested in by Chilean patriots br Revolutionaries split into two antagonist groups the Centralists and the Federalists a move that would define Argentina s first decades of independence The Assembly of the Year XIII appointed Gervasio Antonio de Posadas as Argentina s first Supreme Director br On July the Congress of Tucum n formalized the Declaration of Independence which is now celebrated as Independence Day a national holiday One year later General Mart n Miguel de G emes stopped royalists on the north and General Jos de San Mart n He joined Bernardo O Higgins and they led a combined army across the Andes and secured the independence of Chile then it was sent by O Higgins orders to the Spanish stronghold of Lima and proclaimed the independence of Peru In Buenos Aires enacted a centralist constitution that was soon abrogated by federalists br Some of the most important figures of Argentine independence made a proposal known as the Inca plan of which proposed that the United Provinces of the R o de la Plata Present Argentina should be a monarchy led by a descendant of the Inca Juan Bautista T pac Amaru half brother of T pac Amaru II was proposed as monarch Some examples of those who supported this proposal were Manuel Belgrano Jos de San Mart n and Mart n Miguel de G emes The Congress of Tucum n finally decided to reject the Inca plan creating instead a republican centralist state br The Battle of Cepeda fought between the Centralists and the Federalists resulted in the end of the Supreme Director rule In Buenos Aires enacted another centralist constitution with Bernardino Rivadavia being appointed as the first president of the country However the interior provinces soon rose against him forced his resignation and discarded the constitution Centralists and Federalists resumed the civil war the latter prevailed and formed the Argentine Confederation in led by Juan Manuel de Rosas During his regime he faced a French blockade the War of the Confederation and an Anglo French blockade but remained undefeated and prevented further loss of national territory His trade restriction policies however angered the interior provinces and in Justo Jos de Urquiza another powerful caudillo beat him out of power As the new president of the Confederation Urquiza enacted the liberal and federal Constitution Buenos Aires seceded but was forced back into the Confederation after being defeated in the Battle of Cepeda br br br Rise of the modern nation br br Overpowering Urquiza in the Battle of Pav n Bartolom Mitre secured Buenos Aires predominance and was elected as the first president of the reunified country He was followed by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Nicol s Avellaneda these three presidencies set up the basis of the modern Argentine State br Starting with Julio Argentino Roca in ten consecutive federal governments emphasized liberal economic policies The massive wave of European immigration they promoted second only to the United States led to a near reinvention of Argentine society and economy that by had placed the country as the seventh wealthiest developed nation in the world Driven by this immigration wave and decreasing mortality the Argentine population grew fivefold and the economy fold from to Argentina s wheat exports went from to t to short tons per year while frozen beef exports increased from to t to short tons per year placing Argentina as one of the world s top five exporters Its railway mileage rose from to km to mi Fostered by a new public compulsory free and secular education system literacy quickly increased from to a level higher than most Latin American nations would reach even fifty years later Furthermore real GDP grew so fast that despite the huge immigration influx per capita income between and went from of developed country levels to In Argentina was already one of the top nations by per capita income By it had surpassed Denmark Canada and the Netherlands to reach th place behind Switzerland New Zealand Australia the United States the United Kingdom and Belgium Argentina s per capita income was higher than Italy s higher than Spain s higher than Japan s and higher than Brazil s Despite these unique achievements the country was slow to meet its original goals of industrialization after the steep development of capital intensive local industries in the s a significant part of the manufacturing sector remained labour intensive in the s br br Between and the so called Conquest of the Desert occurred with the purpose of tripling the Argentine territory by means of the constant confrontations between natives and Criollos in the border and the appropriation of the indigenous territories The first conquest consisted of a series of military incursions into the Pampa and Patagonian territories dominated by the indigenous peoples distributing them among the members of the Sociedad Rural Argentina financiers of the expeditions The conquest of Chaco lasted up to the end of the century since its full ownership of the national economic system only took place when the mere extraction of wood and tannin was replaced by the production of cotton The Argentine government considered indigenous people as inferior beings without the same rights as Criollos and Europeans br In President Roque S enz Pe a enacted universal and secret male suffrage which allowed Hip lito Yrigoyen leader of the Radical Civic Union or UCR to win the election He enacted social and economic reforms and extended assistance to small farms and businesses Argentina stayed neutral during World War I The second administration of Yrigoyen faced an economic crisis precipitated by the Great Depression br br In Yrigoyen was ousted from power by the military led by Jos F lix Uriburu Although Argentina remained among the fifteen richest countries until mid century this coup d tat marks the start of the steady economic and social decline that pushed the country back into underdevelopment br Uriburu ruled for two years then Agust n Pedro Justo was elected in a fraudulent election and signed a controversial treaty with the United Kingdom Argentina stayed neutral during World War II a decision that had full British support but was rejected by the United States after the attack on Pearl Harbor In a military coup d tat led by General Arturo Rawson toppled the democratically elected government of Ram n Castillo Under pressure from the United States later Argentina declared war on the Axis Powers on March roughly a month before the end of World War II in Europe br During the Rawson dictatorship a relatively unknown military colonel named Juan Per n was named head of the Labour Department Per n quickly managed to climb the political ladder being named Minister of Defence by Being perceived as a political threat by rivals in the military and the conservative camp he was forced to resign in and was arrested days later He was finally released under mounting pressure from both his base and several allied unions He would later become president after a landslide victory over the UCR in the general election as the Laborioust candidate br br br Peronist years br br The Labour Party later renamed Justicialist Party the most powerful and influential party in Argentine history came into power with the rise of Juan Per n to the presidency in He nationalized strategic industries and services improved wages and working conditions paid the full external debt and claimed he achieved nearly full employment He pushed Congress to enact women s suffrage in and developed a system of social assistance for the most vulnerable sectors of society The economy began to decline in due in part to government expenditures and the protectionist economic policies br He also engaged in a campaign of political suppression Anyone who was perceived to be a political dissident or potential rival was subject to threats physical violence and harassment The Argentine intelligentsia the middle class university students and professors were seen as particularly troublesome Per n fired over university professors and faculty members from all major public education institutions br Per n tried to bring most trade and labour unions under his thumb regularly resorting to violence when needed For instance the meat packers union leader Cipriano Reyes organised strikes in protest against the government after elected labour movement officials were forcefully replaced by Peronist puppets from the Peronist Party Reyes was soon arrested on charges of terrorism though the allegations were never substantiated Reyes who was never formally charged was tortured in prison for five years and only released after the regime s downfall in br Per n managed to get re elected in His wife Eva Per n who played a critical role in the party died of cancer in As the economy continued to tank Per n started losing popular support and came to be seen as a threat to the national process The Navy took advantage of Per n s withering political power and bombed the Plaza de Mayo in Per n survived the attack but a few months later during the Liberating Revolution coup he was deposed and went into exile in Spain br br br Revoluci n Libertadora br br The new head of State Pedro Eugenio Aramburu proscribed Peronism and banned the party from any future elections Arturo Frondizi from the UCR won the general election He encouraged investment to achieve energetic and industrial self sufficiency reversed a chronic trade deficit and lifted the ban on Peronism yet his efforts to stay on good terms with both the Peronists and the military earned him the rejection of both and a new coup forced him out Amidst the political turmoil Senate leader Jos Mar a Guido reacted swiftly and applied anti power vacuum legislation ascending to the presidency himself elections were repealed and Peronism was prohibited once again Arturo Illia was elected in and led an increase in prosperity across the board however he was overthrown in by another military coup d tat led by General Juan Carlos Ongan a in the self proclaimed Argentine Revolution creating a new military government that sought to rule indefinitely br br br Per n s return and death br br Following several years of military rule Alejandro Agust n Lanusse was appointed president by the military junta in Under increasing political pressure for the return of democracy Lanusse called for elections in Per n was banned from running but the Peronist party was allowed to participate The presidential elections were won by Per n s surrogate candidate Hector C mpora a left wing Peronist who took office on May A month later in June Per n returned from Spain One of C mpora s first presidential actions was to grant amnesty to members of organizations that had carried out political assassinations and terrorist attacks and to those who had been tried and sentenced to prison by judges C mpora s months long tenure in government was beset by political and social unrest Over social conflicts strikes and factory occupations took place within a single month Even though far left terrorist organisations had suspended their armed struggle their joining with the participatory democracy process was interpreted as a direct threat by the Peronist right wing faction br Amid a state of political social and economic upheaval C mpora and Vice President Vicente Solano Lima resigned in July calling for new elections but this time with Per n as the Justicialist Party nominee Per n won the election with his wife Isabel Per n as vice president Per n s third term was marked by escalating conflict between left and right wing factions within the Peronist party as well as the return of armed terror guerrilla groups such as the Guevarist ERP leftist Peronist Montoneros and the state backed far right Triple A After a series of heart attacks and signs of pneumonia in Per n s health deteriorated quickly He suffered a final heart attack on Monday July and died at He was years old After his death Isabel Per n his wife and vice president succeeded him in office During her presidency a military junta along with the Peronists far right fascist faction once again became the de facto head of state Isabel Per n served as President of Argentina from until when she was ousted by the military Her short presidency was marked by the collapse of Argentine political and social systems leading to a constitutional crisis that paved the way for a decade of instability left wing terrorist guerrilla attacks and state sponsored terrorism br br br National Reorganization Process br br The Dirty War Spanish Guerra Sucia was part of Operation Condor which included the participation of other right wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone The Dirty War involved state terrorism in Argentina and elsewhere in the Southern Cone against political dissidents with military and security forces employing urban and rural violence against left wing guerrillas political dissidents and anyone believed to be associated with socialism or somehow contrary to the neoliberal economic policies of the regime Victims of the violence in Argentina alone included an estimated to left wing activists and militants including trade unionists students journalists Marxists Peronist guerrillas and alleged sympathizers Most of the victims were casualties of state terrorism The opposing guerrillas victims numbered nearly military and police officials and up to civilians Argentina received technical support and military aid from the United States government during the Johnson Nixon Ford Carter and Reagan administrations br The exact chronology of the repression is still debated yet the roots of the long political war may have started in when trade unionists were targeted for assassination by Peronist and Marxist paramilitaries Individual cases of state sponsored terrorism against Peronism and the left can be traced back even further to the Bombing of Plaza de Mayo in The Trelew massacre of the actions of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance commencing in and Isabel Per n s annihilation decrees against left wing guerrillas during Operativo Independencia Operation Independence in are also possible events signaling the beginning of the Dirty War br Ongan a shut down Congress banned all political parties and dismantled student and worker unions In popular discontent led to two massive protests the Cordobazo and the Rosariazo The terrorist guerrilla organization Montoneros kidnapped and executed Aramburu The newly chosen head of government Alejandro Agust n Lanusse seeking to ease the growing political pressure allowed H ctor Jos C mpora to become the Peronist candidate instead of Per n C mpora won the March election issued pardons for condemned guerrilla members and then secured Per n s return from his exile in Spain br br On the day Per n returned to Argentina the clash between Peronist internal factions right wing union leaders and left wing youth from the Montoneros resulted in the Ezeiza Massacre Overwhelmed by political violence C mpora resigned and Per n won the following September election with his third wife Isabel as vice president He expelled Montoneros from the party and they became once again a clandestine organization Jos L pez Rega organized the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance AAA to fight against them and the People s Revolutionary Army ERP br Per n died in July and was succeeded by his wife who signed a secret decree empowering the military and the police to annihilate the left wing subversion stopping ERP s attempt to start a rural insurgence in Tucum n province Isabel Per n was ousted one year later by a junta of the combined armed forces led by army general Jorge Rafael Videla They initiated the National Reorganization Process often shortened to Proceso br The Proceso shut down Congress removed the judges on the Supreme Court banned political parties and unions and resorted to employing the forced disappearance of suspected guerrilla members including individuals suspected of being associated with the left wing By the end of the Montoneros had lost nearly members and by the ERP was completely subdued Nevertheless the severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in which was quickly put down effectively ending the guerrilla threat and securing the junta s position in power br In March an Argentine force took control of the British territory of South Georgia and on April Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands The United Kingdom dispatched a task force to regain possession Argentina surrendered on June and its forces were taken home Street riots in Buenos Aires followed the humiliating defeat and the military leadership stood down Reynaldo Bignone replaced Galtieri and began to organize the transition to democratic governance br br br Return to democracy br br Ra l Alfons n won the elections campaigning for the prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations during the Proceso the Trial of the Juntas and other martial courts sentenced all the coup s leaders but under military pressure he also enacted the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws which halted prosecutions further down the chain of command The worsening economic crisis and hyperinflation reduced his popular support and the Peronist Carlos Menem won the election Soon after riots forced Alfons n to an early resignation br Menem embraced and enacted neoliberal policies a fixed exchange rate business deregulation privatizations and the dismantling of protectionist barriers normalized the economy in the short term He pardoned the officers who had been sentenced during Alfons n s government The Constitutional Amendment allowed Menem to be elected for a second term With the economy beginning to decline in and with increasing unemployment and recession the UCR led by Fernando de la R a returned to the presidency in the elections br br De la R a left Menem s economic plan in effect despite the worsening crisis which led to growing social discontent Massive capital flight from the country was responded to with a freezing of bank accounts generating further turmoil The December riots forced him to resign Congress appointed Eduardo Duhalde as acting president who revoked the fixed exchange rate established by Menem causing many working and middle class Argentines to lose a significant portion of their savings By late the economic crisis began to recede but the assassination of two piqueteros by the police caused political unrest prompting Duhalde to move elections forward N stor Kirchner was elected as the new president On May he was sworn in br br Boosting the neo Keynesian economic policies laid by Duhalde Kirchner ended the economic crisis attaining significant fiscal and trade surpluses and rapid GDP growth Under his administration Argentina restructured its defaulted debt with an unprecedented discount of about on most bonds paid off debts with the International Monetary Fund purged the military of officers with dubious human rights records nullified and voided the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws ruled them as unconstitutional and resumed legal prosecution of the Junta s crimes He did not run for reelection promoting instead the candidacy of his wife senator Cristina Fern ndez de Kirchner who was elected in and reelected in Fern ndez de Kirchner s administration established positive foreign relations with countries such as Venezuela Iran and Cuba while at the same time relations with the United States and the United Kingdom became increasingly strained By the Argentine GDP grew by and real incomes had risen over since the post Menem era Despite these economic gains and increased renewable energy production and subsidies the overall economy had been sluggish since br On November after a tie in the first round of presidential elections on October center right coalition candidate Mauricio Macri won the first ballotage in Argentina s history beating Front for Victory candidate Daniel Scioli and becoming president elect Macri was the first democratically elected non peronist president since that managed to complete his term in office without being overthrown He took office on December and inherited an economy with a high inflation rate and in a poor shape In April the Macri Government introduced neoliberal austerity measures intended to tackle inflation and overblown public deficits Under Macri s administration economic recovery remained elusive with GDP shrinking inflation totaling billions of US dollars issued in sovereign debt and mass poverty increasing by the end of his term He ran for re election in but lost by nearly eight percentage points to Alberto Fern ndez the Justicialist Party candidate br President Alberto Fern ndez and Vice President Cristina Fern ndez de Kirchner took office in December just months before the COVID pandemic hit Argentina and among accusations of corruption bribery and misuse of public funds during Nestor and Cristina Fern ndez de Kirchner s presidencies On November the center left coalition of Argentina s ruling Peronist party Frente de Todos Front for Everyone lost its majority in Congress for the first time in almost years in midterm legislative elections The election victory of the center right coalition Juntos por el Cambio Together for Change limited President Alberto Fernandez s power during his final two years in office Losing control of the Senate made it difficult for him to make key appointments including to the judiciary It also forced him to negotiate with the opposition every initiative he sends to the legislature br In April President Alberto Fernandez announced that he will not seek re election in the next presidential election The November election run off vote ended in a win for libertarian outsider Javier Milei with close to of the vote against of the ruling coalition candidate Sergio Massa On December Javier Milei was sworn in as the new president of

Paraguay to the north Brazil to the northeast Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Drake Passage to the south for an overall land border length of km mi Its coastal border over the R o de la Plata and South Atlantic Ocean is km mi long br Argentina s highest point is Aconcagua in the Mendoza province m ft above sea level also the highest point in the Southern and Western Hemispheres The lowest point is Laguna del Carb n in the San Juli n Great Depression Santa Cruz province m ft below sea level also the lowest point in the Southern and Western Hemispheres and the seventh lowest point on Earth br The northernmost point is at the confluence of the Grande de San Juan and Mojinete rivers in Jujuy province the southernmost is Cape San P o in Tierra del Fuego province the easternmost is northeast of Bernardo de Irigoyen Misiones and the westernmost is within Los Glaciares National Park in Santa Cruz province The maximum north south distance is km mi while the maximum east west one is km mi br Some of the major rivers are the Paran Uruguay which join to form the R o de la Plata Paraguay Salado Negro Santa Cruz Pilcomayo Bermejo and Colorado These rivers are discharged into the Argentine Sea the shallow area of the Atlantic Ocean over the Argentine Shelf an unusually wide continental platform Its waters are influenced by two major ocean currents the warm Brazil Current and the cold Falklands Current br br br Biodiversity br br Argentina is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world hosting one of the greatest ecosystem varieties in the world continental zones marine zones and the Antarctic region are all represented in its territory This huge ecosystem variety has led to a biological diversity that is among the world s largest cataloged vascular plant species ranked th cataloged bird species ranked th cataloged mammal species ranked th cataloged reptilian species ranked th and cataloged amphibian species ranked th br The original pampa had virtually no trees some imported species such as the American sycamore or eucalyptus are present along roads or in towns and country estates estancias The only tree like plant native to the pampa is the evergreen Omb The surface soils of the pampa are a deep black color primarily mollisols known commonly as humus This makes the region one of the most agriculturally productive on Earth however this is also responsible for decimating much of the original ecosystem to make way for commercial agriculture The western pampas receive less rainfall this dry pampa is a plain of short grasses or steppe br The National Parks of Argentina make up a network of national parks in Argentina The parks cover a very varied set of terrains and biotopes from Barit National Park on the northern border with Bolivia to Tierra del Fuego National Park in the far south of the continent The Administraci n de Parques Nacionales National Parks Administration is the agency that preserves and manages these national parks along with Natural monuments and National Reserves within the country Argentina had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of ranking it th globally out of countries br br br Climate br br In general Argentina has four main climate types warm humid subtropical moderate humid subtropical arid and cold all determined by the expanse across latitude range in altitude and relief features Although the most populated areas are generally temperate Argentina has an exceptional amount of climate diversity ranging from subtropical in the north to polar in the far south Consequently there is a wide variety of biomes in the country including Subtropical rainforests semi arid and arid regions temperate plains in the Pampas and cold subantarctic in the south The average annual precipitation ranges from millimetres in in the driest parts of Patagonia to over millimetres in in the westernmost parts of Patagonia and the northeastern parts of the country Mean annual temperatures range from C F in the far south to C F in the north br Major wind currents include the cool Pampero Winds blowing on the flat plains of Patagonia and the Pampas following the cold front warm currents blow from the north in middle and late winter creating mild conditions br The Sudestada usually moderates cold temperatures but brings very heavy rains rough seas and coastal flooding It is most common in late autumn and winter along the central coast and in the R o de la Plata estuary br The Zonda a hot dry wind affects Cuyo and the central Pampas Squeezed of all moisture during the m ft descent from the Andes Zonda winds can blow for hours with gusts up to km h mph fueling wildfires and causing damage between June and November when the Zonda blows snowstorms and blizzard viento blanco conditions usually affect higher elevations br Climate change in Argentina is predicted to have significant effects on the living conditions in Argentina The climate of Argentina is changing with regards to precipitation patterns and temperatures The highest increases in precipitation from the period have occurred in the eastern parts of the country The increase in precipitation has led to more variability in precipitation from year to year in the northern parts of the country with a higher risk of prolonged droughts disfavoring agriculture in these regions br br br Politics br br In the th century Argentina experienced significant political turmoil and democratic reversals Between and the armed forces overthrew six governments in Argentina and the country alternated periods of democracy and with periods of restricted democracy and military rule Following a transition that began in full scale democracy in Argentina was reestablished Argentina s democracy endured through the crisis and to the present day it is regarded as more robust than both its pre predecessors and other democracies in Latin America According to the V Dem

the Constitution Beyond this they are fully autonomous they enact their own constitutions freely organize their local governments and own and manage their natural and financial resources Some provinces have bicameral legislatures while others have unicameral ones br La Pampa and Chaco became provinces in Misiones did so in and Formosa Neuqu n R o Negro Chubut and Santa Cruz in The last national territory Tierra del Fuego became the Tierra del Fuego Ant rtida e Islas del Atl ntico Sur Province in It has three components although two are nominal because they are not under Argentine

Air Force Ruled and monitored by Congress through the Houses Defense Committees it is organized on the essential principle of legitimate self defense the repelling of any external military aggression in order to guarantee freedom of the people national sovereignty and territorial integrity Its secondary missions include committing to multinational operations within the framework of the United Nations participating in internal support missions assisting friendly countries and establishing a sub regional defense system br Military service is voluntary with enlistment age between and years old and no conscription Argentina s defense has historically been one of the best equipped in the region even managing its own weapon research facilities shipyards ordnance tank and plane factories However real military expenditures declined steadily after the defeat in the Falklands Malvinas War and the defense budget in was only about of GDP a historical minimum below the Latin American average Within the defence budget itself funding for training and even basic maintenance has been significantly cut a factor contributing to the accidental loss of the Argentine submarine San Juan in
