Disney Television Animation DTVA formerly known as Walt Disney Pictures Television Animation Group and Walt Disney Television Animation is an American animation studio that serves as the television animation production arm of Disney Branded Television a division of Disney General Entertainment Content which is a division of Disney Entertainment The studio was originally established in by Gary Krisel during the reorganization and subsequent re incorporation of Disney following the arrival of then CEO Michael Eisner that year br The division is responsible for developing and producing animated television series films specials and short films for broadcast on the Disney branded networks Disney Channel Disney XD and Disney Jr as well as Disney br br br History br br br Background br The Walt Disney Company first ventured into the television industry as early as beginning with the one hour Christmas special One Hour in Wonderland This was followed by the Christmas special The Walt Disney Christmas Show the long running anthology series The Wonderful World of Disney which was Disney s first regular series as a whole the children s variety show The Mickey Mouse Club and the adventure series Zorro br However one element was missing from Disney s expansion into television an original animated television series Until the early s the studio had never produced its own original animated shows in house because Walt Disney felt it was economically impossible Nearly all pre TV animation was wrap around segments made to bridge the gaps on existing theatrical material on The Wonderful World of Disney Osamu Tezuka met Walt at the World s Fair at which time Disney said he hoped to make something just like Tezuka s Astro Boy someday but unfortunately nothing came of it br br br Early beginnings br The hiring of a new CEO for The Walt Disney Company in Michael Eisner led him to push to expand Disney into new areas thus the establishment of a television animation division that year whose output would be shopped to all markets networks Disney Channel and syndication Eisner held a meeting at his home in which he brought up the concept of doing a series on the Gummi bear as his kids like the candy Originally the staff was told that they could not use the principal Disney cartoon characters in the new shows br The Walt Disney Television Animation department was formed in November with Gary Krisel as president and Michael Webster as senior vice president This was considered a risky move because animated TV series was generally considered low budget investments for most of the history of TV cartoons up through the s Many critics say that Disney s own animation studio had lost most of its luster during the period from Walt Disney s passing in the s through the s However the studio took several risks that paid off handsomely The studio successfully gambled on the idea that a substantially larger investment into quality animation could be made back through both network television and over the air in syndication as well as cable The final result is a string of higher budgeted animated television productions which proved to be profitable ventures and raised the standard for the TV medium br The first productions to make it to air from the studio arrived in with Eisner s concept fleshed out into Adventures of the Gummi Bears joined by an original concept The Wuzzles both which are based upon talking animal based conceptions The third series in a similar vein Fluppy Dogs was produced as a single min long TV movie pilot that aired on ABC on Thanksgiving and was loosely based a series of children s books and line of toys about a race of anthropomorphic pastel colored dimension hopping alien called fluppy dogs Dismal viewership ensured the project never made it to series br In Disney finally unveiled the newest series yet in its cycle and the first in their successful long time line of syndicated animated shows DuckTales Though still forbidden from using the star characters minor characters such as Scrooge McDuck and Huey Dewey and Louie were allowed and Disney did concede to allow for a brief appearance by Donald Duck to establish the series allowing them to adapt the Duck universe adventure serials by Carl Barks into animation The show was successful enough to spawn a feature film DuckTales the Movie Treasure of the Lost Lamp and two spin off series Darkwing Duck and Quack Pack release Treasure of the Lost Lamp was the first movie from TV Animation Disney MovieToon unit Disney Television Animation hired a director of specials Sharon Morrill in br br br Broadcast networks and syndication era br br br The Disney Afternoon br br The success of DuckTales also paved the way for a new wave of high quality animated TV series including Disney s own The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh in Later early that spring Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers debuted on March and was paired with DuckTales in an hour long syndicated show through the television season In the season Disney expanded the idea even further to create The Disney Afternoon a two hour long syndicated block of half hour cartoons which premiered much later on September DuckTales was one of the early flagship cartoons in the block br On August with Jeffrey Katzenberg s resignation Richard Frank became head of newly formed Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications WDTT which included WDTA from units of The Walt Disney Studios Morrill was in charge of the first Aladdin direct to video sequel launching Disney Video Premiere Direct to Video unit br Three overseas Disney studios were set up to produce the company s animated television series Disney Animation Australia was started in In the Brizzi brothers sold Brizzi Films to Disney Television Animation and was renamed Walt Disney Animation France Also that year Disney Animation Japan was started Walt Disney Animation Canada was opened in January to tap Canada s

replace that network s internal UPN Kids block The syndicated block ran until the debut of One Too on September which aired mainly the same shows as One Saturday Morning br By April Disney MovieToons was folded in with Walt Disney Video Premieres films and network TV specials of Disney TV Animation as Morrill moved to executive vice president over her pre existing units At the same time Barry Blumberg was elevated to the executive vice president for network and syndicated animated TV series Both reported to Disney Television president Charles Hirschhorn br In the second quarter of due to weak financial performance Disney Animation Canada was closed David Stainton took charge of the company as executive vice president in January then as president in February under Thomas Schumacher br Due to the reconstruction Disney ABC also rebranded its One Saturday Morning block to ABC Kids a subtle tribute to the Fox Kids brand after being acquired by Disney through its purchase of Fox Family Worldwide in on September On August Disney discontinued the One Too block thus ending their deal with UPN br After the relaunch as ABC Kids many of the shows premieres moved to sister network Toon

newer animation techniques to reduce costs under the re established Disney Channels Worldwide br br The Buzz on Maggie was among the first Disney series to fully utilize Adobe Flash animation thus saving costs and allowing experimentation American Dragon Jake Long which premiered just months prior and The Replacements received cleaner redesigns for their second seasons noteworthy as both series originated as their creator s storybooks to ease the animation styles for fitting TV budgets The success of Kim Possible also helped show that there was marketing value in Disney Channel cartoons as
