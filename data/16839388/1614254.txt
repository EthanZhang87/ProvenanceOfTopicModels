through the changing of the seasons with an extended break between the sixth and seventh lines of the poem to accommodate a storm scene br To preserve the look of the original story sketches layout artist Ken O Connor came up with the idea of using frosted cels and rendering the pastel images right onto the cel Before being photographed each cel was laminated in clear lacquer to protect the

considered to be the last anthology feature made by Walt Disney Productions the next film to be released was The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad which featured two stories These package features were little known short film compilations that Disney produced and released as feature films during World War II They were financially and artistically lightweight productions meant to bring in profits to allow the studio to return to fairy tale single narrative feature form an endeavour which they successfully completed two years later with Cinderella While the shorts contrast in length form and style a common thread throughout is that each is accompanied by song s from musicians and vocalists of the s both popular and folk music This sets it apart from the similarly structured Fantasia whose segments were set to classical music instead As opposed to Fun and Fancy Free whose story was bound to the tales of Bongo and Mickey and the Beanstalk in this film Walt Disney has let his animators and his color magicians have free rein br Melody Time was the last film The Andrews Sisters took part in They sang throughout the minute segment known as Little Toot Andrews Sisters member Maxine said It was quite an experience On the wall at the studio they had the whole story in picture form Two songwriters played the score and Walt Disney explained it to us It was a new thing

Finland br Disney later released a package film entitled Music Land a nine segment film which recycled sequences from both Make Mine Music and Melody Time Five selections were from Melody Time while another was the short Two For the Record which consisted of two segments produced under Benny Goodman s direction br Melody Time was unusual in that until years after its initial release it remained

However Disney Discourse Producing the Magic Kingdom notes that an article in Time Magazine around that time celebrated the global scope of the Disney product and a review for The News Sentinel said the charm and skill that one had to expect from Disney is delightful entertainment for all children A review of the film for the Los Angeles Times said the acts Johnny Appleseed and Pecos Bill which the new variety show from Walt Disney gave special attention to are human sagas and as a result more endearing than the rest of the segments The Andrews Sisters A Biography and Career Record notes that the public liked the film and it was a box office success br A review by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette said the film was a visual and auditory delight and added that if Disney were able to reach his audience s other senses there s no doubt he d be able to please them too It says a tuneful and functional soundtrack rounds out the Disney art It said that Bumble Boogie reverted back to fantasia like interpretive technique It also notes that the abstraction ends after Trees and the final three shorts are story sequences It says the simple story of Johnny Appleseed is done with touching perception It said Little Toot is destined to become a fable of our time and adds the Andrew Sisters tell the story in lilting song The review ended with the author saying deserving accolades will go to Walt Disney and his whole production staff as well as to the staff whose voices he has used as well br A review of the film for The News Sentinel described Pecos Bill as the best segment and said it caused a stir among the small fry in the audience br br br Retrospective reviews br Later reviews are more mixed noting the film s faults but also praising it for various technical achievements br DVDizzy notes that in regard to the mix of shorts and s music the marriage often does not work and the melodies are not particularly the film s forte however it adds that this is a modern day opinion and that paying audiences at the time the film was released probably felt better about the music The site then reviewed each segment in turn saying Once Upon a Wintertime is physical slapstick that doesn t match the dramatic singing by Frances Langford Bumble Boogie is fun but forgettable The Legend of Johnny Appleseed is the most enjoyable of the segments Little Toot is rather generic Trees features some nice imagery Blame it on the Samba involve s Latin dancing and nothing more and Pecos Bill has Disney go ing back and us ing today s technology to alter Bill s smoking what admittedly is a minor point in one short of a film that s predominantly going to be watched and purchased by animation enthusiasts historians It explains the video quality is consistently satisfying and that the audio has the dated feel of other s Disney films br The film received a score of out of based on votes on the site Disney Movies Guide br In his book The Animated Movie Guide Jerry Beck gave Melody Time a rating of stars and described the film as odds and ends from a studio geared up towards revival He said that by this time the post war formula of releasing anthologies had become tired with only a few of the segments being interesting and feeling as if the animators kept pushing for something more creative to do He commented that the film a vast underachievement for Disney felt dated like its predecessor Make Mine Music and added that he found it hard to believe that the artists who made this film had also made Pinocchio eight years before He praised the exceptional designs and palettes by stylist Mary Blair including the flat styli s ed backgrounds of Wintertime and the Impressionist painting folk art look of The Legend of Johnny Appleseed He highlighted the slapstick impressive montage of Bill s impressive feats as a true treat He described the manic interpretation of Flight of the Bumblebee known as Bumble Boogie in which a bee terrorized by musical instruments and notes change s colors and outlines from one moment to the next as the backgrounds seamlessly dissolve change or morph around him as Disney s best piece of surrealism since the Pink Elephant on Parade sequence in Dumbo He also spoke about the stellar special effects involved in the dynamite exploding Ethel Smith s organ instrument in the segment Blame it on the Samba However he added that the rest of Melody Time was sad ly forgettable br In The Magic Kingdom Walt Disney and the American Way of Life Steven Watts explains that while Pecos Bill recaptured some of the old magic the film as a whole along with the other halfhearted pastiche s of short subjects came across as animated shorts surrounded with considerable filler and stuff into a concocted package He adds that as a result they never caught fire due to their varying wildly in quality with moments of creativity being outweighed by the insipid mediocre stale stretches of work br The authors of The Cartoon Music Book said Melody Time was much better than the other post Fantasia Disney package films of the era adding that it was beautifully designed and scored paving the way for the populuxe style of Disney s first renaissance starting with Cinderella in They stated that Trees and Blame it on the Samba which they described as a psychedelic Latin American sequence are charming if still obscure entries in the Disney pop song catalog ue br The Andrews Sisters A Biography and Career Record author H Arlo Nimmo said in general the Andrew Sisters sung Melody Time holds up well and the story of Little Toot is as appealing to today as when it originally appeared fifty some years ago He described the singing as unremarkable but narrat ing the story cleverly He adds Variety s quote Little Toot is colorful and engrossing Andrew Sisters give it popular vocal interpretation and said that although The New York Times preferred the film to Make Mine Music the magazine added The Andrew Sisters sing the story not very excitingly He also included Metronome s indifferent comment The Andrew Sisters sing a silly song about a tugboat The article The Walt Disney Classics Collection Gets Twitterpatted For Spring deemed Little Toot one of Melody Time s highlights br In a review of the Disney film Home on the Range the article Frisky Range doesn t measure up Disney delivers fun said that the sendup of the Wild West has some fitful comic vitality and charm but it can t hold a candle to the Pecos Bill segment of the studio s late s anthology Melody Time br Rotten Tomatoes reported that of critics have given the film a positive review with an average score of The critical consensus reads Melody Time is a charming musical anthology film that s expertly crafted and filled with high spirited numbers br A Chicago Tribune review of the film in honor of its VHS release described the film as a sweet old fashioned delight and one of the few Disney animated films that pre schoolers can watch alone without danger of being traumatized but also added that the younger generation might be bored by it as they are attuned to the faster hipper rhythms of the post Mermaid era br Beck considers the segment Blame It on the Samba to be the best Good Neighbor Disney film there is stating that it blows my mind every time I watch it Film historian J B Kaufman has noted that the segment is a cult favorite among Disney fans br br br Box office br The film returned rentals to RKO by of with being generated in the U S and Canada br br br Controversy br Due to the controversy surrounding the smoking in Pecos Bill the segment was heavily edited when the film was released onto VHS in While the character of Bill is shown smoking a cigarette in several sequences the edited version cuts these scenes resulting in the removal of almost the entire tornado sequence and creating some odd hand and mouth movements for Bill throughout In a review at DVDizzy it is noted that if one has an interest in the shorts one will probably be upset to know that Disney has decided to digitally edit out contents of the plus year old frames of animation In the Melody Time section of the Your Guide To Disney s Animated Features feature at Empire Online the review said of the editing at least it was done for the US releases but not for the rest of the world Go figure The scenes are removed on the Gold Collection DVD release although the Japanese laserdisc and the version of the DVD released in the United Kingdom are uncut For the first time in years the uncut version with Pecos Bill s cigarette can now be seen on Disney alongside a Disney Movie Club exclusive Blu ray released on November br According to a source upon reviewing the music that Ken Darby had composed for Johnny Appleseed Walt Disney scorned the music describing it as like New Deal music Darby was enraged and said to Disney THAT is just a cross section of one man s opinion Darby was only employed at The Walt Disney Company for a short while after this supposed incident br Jerry Beck in his book The Animated Movie Guide comments on a risqu joke in Pecos Bill that somehow made it past the censors when Bill kisses Sue and his guns rise from their holsters and begin to fire by themselves simulating ejaculation He adds jokingly that perhaps Roy Rogers was covering the eyes of Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten during this scene br br br Legacy br Many of the seven segments were later released as shorts and some of them became more successful than the original film Bumble Boogie was among the few segments to receive huge popularity upon individual release The article The Walt Disney Classics Collection Gets Twitterpatted For Spring notes that the Little Toot segment of the film was so popular that it was re released on its own as a short cartoon in and was subsequently featured on Walt Disney s popular weekly television series br There are many references to the Pecos Bill segment in the Frontierland part of Magic Kingdom there is a sign of Bill outside the Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn and Cafe as well as various images of him the other characters and their accessories around the cafe A pair of gloves with the inscription To Billy All My Love Slue Foot Sue is located in a glass display case In the World of Disney Jose Carioca from Blame it on the Samba appears in a mural on the ceiling among many other characters In a
