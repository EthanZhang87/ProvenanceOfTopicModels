The Walt Disney Company should form their own record label It adopted its current name in and is currently distributed by Universal Music Group for physical releases outside of North America and

with the song The Ballad of Davy Crockett both featuring series star Fess Parker These were licensed to Columbia Records but the smaller Cadence Records label released the more successful Ballad of Davy Crockett sung by Bill Hayes faster and this was the record that topped the charts instead The following year Disney saw profits for Mickey Mouse Club records in the millions being shared with Golden Records and ABC Records finally convincing Roy to allow Johnson to start the in house Disneyland Records br br br Disneyland Records br br The label was founded as Disneyland Records on February with Jimmy Johnson as president serving as the record unit of Walt Disney Productions Johnson brought in musician Tutti Camarata to head the Artists and Repertoire department of this new enterprise One ten inch LP with the Disneyland imprint had been released a few months earlier a musical version of A Child s Garden of Verses but it was distributed by the Charles Hansen music publishing company The first album produced marketed and distributed by the label was Walt Disney Takes You to Disneyland the only album Walt had ever recorded especially for his own record company Also in the first year seven Disney animated movie soundtracks were issued by the label br Disneyland Records issued Parker s Wringle Wrangle single from the Westward Ho the Wagons film within a year of starting operations the single became a hit This led the company to start recording music from outside the films However what ever was released by the company the industry categorized as children Pricing was directed towards an adult audience which was more than standard children fare The only outside success was Camarata s album Tutti s Trumpets Thus in the Disneyland label became the soundtrack and children s label and Buena Vista label for the occasional pop song record br Camarata established the label s initial forays into long form musical albums which included jazz interpretations of Disney standards from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Bambi and Cinderella as well as original musical concept albums and he expanded the format of soundtracks by including selections from the score as well as the songs Tutti s connections within the music industry also brought to the label the likes of Mary Martin Louis Armstrong Louis Prima and Phil Harris After popular Mouseketeer Annette Funicello sang a song called How Will I Know My Love on the Mickey Mouse Club TV series fans contacted the studio for the record which became a minor hit This prompted Camarata Johnson and Walt Disney to encourage Annette s career as the label s first artist in residence In the Buena Vista Records label was formed for Funicello s select recordings soundtrack albums and other contemporary audiophile music br While looking for the right material for Annette Tutti and his team discovered the songwriting duo of Richard M Sherman and Robert B Sherman after hearing one of their songs on the radio The two were brought to the Disney studio in Burbank where they eventually became the first staff songwriters for the company With the participation of the Sherman brothers and two technicians at Sunset Sound in Hollywood Camarata developed his renowned Annette Sound a specific type of double reverb recording to strengthen Annette s voice that became an industry standard The Shermans penned not only a good deal of Annette s songs but were also responsible for most of the iconic Disney songs of the s and beyond It s a Small World and The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room for the theme parks as well as the songs from Mary Poppins Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree The Jungle Book Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day and Bedknobs and Broomsticks br In Camarata left the
