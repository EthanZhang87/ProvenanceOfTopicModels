Nickelodeon produced a segment called The Big Ballot for the movie review show Rated K For Kids by Kids in named for the ballots kids voted with To vote the viewers would send in ballots and then before the show the ballots would be counted and the winners would tape a thank you video that would be shown during the program Goodman Hecht and Seibert felt that the network needed a bigger more exciting platform br Hecht selected the awards logo from a series of network designs created by original logo designers Tom Corey and Scott Nash Corey McPherson Nash Boston overseen by Goodman and Seibert Fred Alan Inc New York The award was configured into the current blimp shape kaleidoscope in The only change to the award since then has been a change to the embossed logotype on the side of the trophy for to fit the network s new logo typeface br As the Internet came into widespread use the voting finally moved from a combination of number telephone voting and filling paper ballots that were either mailed or completed at Pizza Hut locations to being conducted exclusively on the network s website and included text messaging by During the early years of Internet voting there were several issues including the digital equivalent of ballot stuffing and adult voting As a result a new system was put into place where one vote per Nick com account is allowed although it is probable adults still cast votes via the texting option which is connected to a phone number only instead of a screen name by creating an account with a false age or by having their children vote for a chosen subject instead In an iPhone application and mobile browser voting were also added br The Kids Choice Awards featured a new award called The Big Green Help Award which goes to the celebrity who goes
