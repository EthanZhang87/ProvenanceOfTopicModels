Lucchi and Paramount Pictures announced on March that a third film would be released on July which earned a surprised response from director Michael Bay I said I was taking off a year from Transformers Paramount made a mistake in dating Transformers they asked me on the phone I said yes to July but for whoops Not That would mean I would have to start prep in September No way My brain needs a break from fighting robots Screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman who had worked on the first two Transformers films declined to return for the third film with Kurtzman declaring that the franchise is so wonderful that it deserves to be fresh all the time We just felt like we d given it a lot and didn t have an insight for where to go with it next Revenge of the Fallen s co writer Ehren Kruger became the only screenwriter for Dark of the Moon Kruger had frequent meetings with Industrial Light Magic s ILM visual effects producers who suggested plot points such as the scenes in Chernobyl Additionally writer Jenni Konner was brought on to help punch up the script fleshing out the female characters and adding humorous jokes br On October Bay revealed that Dark of the Moon had already gone into pre production and its planned release returned to its originally intended date from to July Due to the revived interest in D filming technology brought on by the success of Avatar talks between Paramount ILM and Bay had considered the possibility of the next Transformers film being filmed in D and testing was performed to bring the technology into Bay s work Bay originally was not much interested in the format as he felt it did not fit his aggressive style of filmmaking but he was convinced after talks with Avatar director James Cameron who even offered the technical crew from that film Cameron reportedly told Bay about D You gotta look at it as a toy it s another fun tool to help get emotion and character and create an experience Bay was reluctant to shoot with D cameras since in test he found them to be too cumbersome for his filming style but he did not want to implement the technology in post production either since he was not pleased with the results In addition to using the D Fusion camera rigs developed by Cameron s team Bay and the team spent nine months developing a more portable D camera that could be brought into location br In a hidden extra for the Blu ray version of Revenge of the Fallen Bay expressed his intention to make Transformers not necessarily larger than Revenge of the Fallen but deeper into the mythology for it to get more character development and for it to be darker and more serious Unicron is briefly shown in a secret Transformers preview feature in the Revenge of the Fallen Blu ray disc Ultimately the producers decided to forgo a plot involving the planet eating Transformer and no further comments were ever made on the subject Having been called Transformers up to that point the film s final title was officially revealed to be Dark of the Moon in October After Revenge of the Fallen was almost universally panned by critics and audiences Bay acknowledged the general flaws of the script having blamed the Writers strike before the film for many problems Bay also said the film will get rid of the dorky comedy from the last film On March the script was said to be completed br br br Casting br br Megan Fox was originally attached to the film and Patrick Dempsey s role as Dylan Gould was to be the employer of Fox s character Mikaela Banes According to various published sources Fox s absence from the film was due to executive producer Steven Spielberg ultimately choosing not to renew her role in light of her comparing Bay and his work ethic to Adolf Hitler although representatives for the actress said that it was her decision to leave the film franchise Bay later claimed that executive producer Steven Spielberg told him to fire Fox a claim that Spielberg denied I wasn t hurt Bay stated because I know that s just Megan Megan loves to get a response And she does it in kind of the wrong way I m sorry Megan I m sorry I made you work twelve hours I m sorry that I m making you show up on time Movies are not always warm and fuzzy br With Fox not reprising her role Rosie Huntington Whiteley was chosen to play Sam s new girlfriend Ram n Rodr guez was initially planned to be in the film in a role bigger than the one he had in Revenge of the Fallen but he was dropped during early production A few well known actors such as John Malkovich and Frances McDormand also gained selected roles for the film Malkovich explains I play a guy called Bruce Brazos who s just a loudmouth kind of business man who s Shia s character s boss Who s just a jerk and a kind of a loud one But a fun character Nice It was fun Very very enjoyable just with Shia Rosie a little bit and with John Turturro So for me it was a blast Another well known actor Ken Jeong was cast as an eccentric co worker and stalker Jeong described the film Yeah it s a small role in Transformers but yeah I had an out of body experience working on that one because I just couldn t believe I was there Still that was not a thing where oh I m going to be a part of a blockbuster franchise like Transformers or even now Hangover for that matter So I can t believe I m a part of these franchises in any way It was amazing Michael Bay is brilliant and it ll blow your mind br For the role of Decepticon scientist Shockwave veteran Transformers voice actor Corey Burton was originally approached to voice the character after previously doing so in the original television series and Transformers Animated Burton declined the offer citing his work schedule and disinterest in being involved in a blockbuster franchise David Warner Burton s influence on his Shockwave voice was briefly considered but the role was ultimately given to Frank Welker adding to his already long list of Transformers characters br br br Themes and inspirations br Due to the critically panned Revenge of the Fallen Bay decided to completely remove the characters the Twins from Dark of the Moon This one really builds to a final crescendo It s not three multiple endings One thing we re getting rid of is what I call the dorky comedy The twins are basically gone Due to fan rumors that the Twins would actually be in the film the director made a public bet that the Twins would not be seen in Dark of the Moon They had a brief cameo in the N E S T headquarters in their vehicle modes in the film br Bay acknowledged that Revenge of the Fallen was disappointing to the fans and said that he doesn t want the third one to suck Bay said that he wanted Dark of the Moon s final battle to be more geographic and feature a small group of heroes like Ridley Scott s war drama Black Hawk Down Joe Dante s science fiction Small Soldiers and Hasbro s G I Joe The Rise of Cobra Bay also decided to include Shockwave because he considers the character bad and He s got a much bigger gun than Megatron and is a little bit more vicious According to The A V Club the film had several minor story inspirations from the s cartoon The Transformers including the usage of a Space Bridge and the kicking the Autobots out br Similar to the previous two installments the film was told in the human point of view to engage the audience Bay wanted Sam to have a girlfriend like in the first two films Actor Shia LaBeouf said that Sam and Mikaela had become one character and although he would miss Megan Fox with this change you have discovery again from a new perspective LaBeouf also stated that the additions of Huntington Whiteley and new characters allows Dark of the Moon to keep the magic of the first film br Dark of the Moon also had numerous Star Trek references partly because scriptwriter Ehren Kruger was a big Star Trek geek but also as a nod to the fact that new character Sentinel Prime was voiced by Leonard Nimoy who originated the iconic role of Spock on Star Trek and voiced Galvatron in The Transformers The Movie The first Star Trek reference is when refugee robots Brains and Wheelie who live in Sam and Carly s apartment complex are watching TOS episode Amok Time Wheelie comments I ve seen this one It s the one where Spock goes nuts The second reference is when Sam meets his girlfriend Carly Spencer at work and is being introduced to Carly s employer Dylan Gould Sam marvels at their workplace It s a beautiful building you guys have Like the Starship Enterprise in here The third reference is when Bumblebee says goodbye to Sam at Cape Canaveral the words my friend are sampled from Spock in Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan You are my friend I am and always shall be yours The fourth and final reference is when Sentinel Prime activates the Control Pillar quoting Spock s maxim in Star Trek II and Star Trek III The Search for Spock The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few br br br Filming br br Its production cost was reported million with the cost of the D filming accounting at million of the budget Preparation for filming began on April in Northwest Indiana specifically around Gary which played Ukraine in the film Principal photography commenced on May with shooting locations including Chicago Florida and Moscow The first six weeks were spent in Los Angeles locations included Sherman Oaks Fourth Avenue and Main The next four weeks were spent in Chicago Locations filmed in Chicago included LaSalle Street Michigan Avenue Bacino s of Lincoln Park at North Lincoln Avenue and areas surrounding the Willis Tower The scenes set in Michigan Ave featured a substantial amount of pyrotechnics and stunt work Filming in Detroit was planned to take place in August but the Chicago shoot was extended until September In late September the production moved to NASA s Kennedy Space Center in Florida just before the launch of Space Shuttle mission STS Scenes were filmed at Launch Pad A the Vehicle Assembly Building and the Orbiter Processing Facility br br While filming in Washington D C the crew shot on the National Mall and Bay said that there would be a car race on the location Two further locations announced were the Milwaukee Art Museum and the former Tower Automotive complex on Milwaukee s north side then under redevelopment for mixed use also the city s equipment yard Filming was scheduled to take place there after work was done in Chicago On September scenes were filmed at the former city hall in Detroit On October a flashback scene that takes place in the later s was shot at the Johnson Space Center in Houston using extras with period fashion and hairstyles A day of shooting was also spent at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia Other planned filming locations included Africa and China Though about of the film s live action footage was shot in D using Arri Alexa and Sony F cameras more than half of the film still had to be converted into D in post production to fix technical flaws that D filming produces Other footage that needed to be converted into D in post production was either completely computer generated imagery or shot in the anamorphic format on mm film mm film was used for scenes filmed in slow motion and scenes such as closeups of faces or shots of the sky that required higher image quality than the HD digital D cameras could provide mm cameras were also used for scenes where the D cameras proved to be too heavy or were subject to strobing or electrical damage from dust Principal photography officially concluded on November br Dark of the Moon was found to carry recycled footage from an earlier film directed by Michael Bay The Island Bay recycled the same footage from his film Pearl Harbor in the first Transformers film br br br Accidents br br Filming was delayed on September when an extra was seriously injured during a stunt in Hammond Indiana Due to a failed weld a steel cable snapped from a car being towed and hit the extra s car damaging her skull The extra identified as Gabriela Cedillo had to undergo brain surgery The injury has left her permanently brain damaged paralyzed on her left side and her left eye stitched shut Paramount admitted responsibility for the accident and covered all of Cedillo s medical costs Nevertheless Cedillo s family filed a lawsuit on October citing seven counts of negligence against Paramount and several other defendants not including Bay with total damages sought in excess of Cedillo s attorney Todd Smith said This was an attractive year old girl who had dreams and aspirations involving acting and this kind of injury may well have a serious impact on her dreams The filed complaint reads that Cedillo has endured and will in the future endure pain and suffering has become disfigured and disabled has suffered a loss of the enjoyment of a normal life has been damaged in her capacity to earn a living has incurred and will in the future incur expenses for medical services all of which are permanent in nature In response to the suit Paramount released the following statement We are all terribly sorry that this accident occurred Our thoughts prayers and best wishes are with Gabriela her family and loved ones The production will continue to provide all the help we can to Gabriela and her family during this difficult time In May it was revealed that an million settlement had been reached between Paramount and the Cedillo family br A second accident occurred on October in Washington D C While filming a chase scene at rd Street and Maryland Avenue SW a Metropolitan Police K Unit SUV was accidentally rammed by the Camaro that portrays Bumblebee in the film The area had been closed off by the Washington D C police and it is unclear why the SUV was there Both drivers were uninjured but the Camaro was severely damaged Reports indicate that the K Unit was heading to a report of a bomb threat as part of a Bomb Squad response but was not using the same radio frequency as the units guarding the filming and did not realize it had gone the wrong way until it collided with the Bumblebee Camaro Many fans who witnessed the crash were horrified at the damage the Bumblebee Camaro suffered and cast and crew members reacted quickly to cover up the damaged Camaro and secure the scene br br br Visual effects br As with the previous Transformers installments Industrial Light Magic ILM was the main CGI visual effects company for Dark of the Moon ILM had been working on the pre visualization for six months before principal photography started resulting in minutes worth of footage Digital Domain also rendered CGI shots including the characters Laserbeak Brains Wheelie and the Decepticon protoforms concealed on the Moon the space bridge and a skydiving sequence br br ILM s visual effects supervisor Scott Farrar said that not only were the film s effects ambitious they also had to be designed for D and explained the company s solutions for the new perspective We did make sure things are as bright as possible Michael called up theatre owners to make sure they keep the lamps bright in the theatres make everything a little sharper because we know that through the steps no matter what when you get to the final screening things tend to go less sharp On the last weekend of ILM s work on Dark of the Moon the company s entire render farm was being used for the film giving ILM more than hours of rendering power a day or equivalent to years of rendering time in a hour period Farrar embraced the detail in creating giant robots for D making sure that in close ups of the Transformers faces you see all the details in the nooks and crannies of these pieces It s totally unlike a plain surface subject like a human head or an animated head The supervisor said that Bay s style of cinematography helped integrate the robots into the scenes as Michael is keen on having foreground midground background depth in his shots even in normal live action shots He ll say Put some stuff hanging here It could be women s stockings or forks and knives dangling from a string out of focus it doesn t matter but it gives you depth and focus depth and makes it more interesting br br The most complicated effects involved the Driller a giant snake like creature with an eel like body and spinning rotator blades knives and teeth In Revenge of the Fallen it took hours per frame to fully render Devastator for the IMAX format which is approximately a frame amount of For the Driller which required the entire render farm it was up to hours per frame The most complex scene involved the Driller destroying a computer generated skyscraper which took hours per frame For said sequence ILM relied on its internal proprietary physics simulation engine to depict the destruction of the building which included breaking concrete floors and walls windows columns and pieces of office furnishings ILM digital production supervisor Nigel Sumner explained We did a lot of tests early on to figure out how to break the building apart exploring a lot of the procedural options A building that s feet tall to go in and hand score the geometry so when it fractures or falls apart would be a time consuming laborious process The floor of a building may be made of concrete How does concrete fracture when it tears apart The pillars would be made of a similar material but made of rebar or other engineering components We d look at how a building would blow apart and then choose the best tool to help achieve the properties of that during a simulation br br The scenes in Chicago were mostly shot on location as Bay believed the plates had to really be shot in the real city Farrar was always fascinated with the idea of shooting on location and then blending the film with computer generated imagery He said We try and shoot everything real You may have seen some films recently where the entire city has been destroyed and it s entirely CGI Well for a Transformers film it s different because we actually went to Chicago If you start with the real thing you have a lot more to work with to make it look real So for a couple of months there I was in a helicopter shooting aerial plates of the real buildings And we d add destruction to all the backgrounds smoke fire debris fighter planes war battles torn up streets to real cityscapes Four ILM employees also traveled to Chicago and photographed buildings from top to bottom at six different times of the day in order to create a digital model of the city to be used in certain scenes ILM s crew designed many major action scenes with many of the Chicago battle concepts coming from the helicopter shooting of the aerial plates br Animator Scott Benza said Sentinel Prime had a face more human like than any of the other robots with a more complex frame and a greater number of plates so it could be more expressive ILM had based most of Sentinel Prime s features on Sean Connery and after Leonard Nimoy was cast to voice the role the effects were altered to incorporate Nimoy s acting as well Every robot would take approximately weeks to build visually Originally the fight between Sentinel Prime Optimus Prime and Megatron was considered to be on water in the Chicago River but the budget was cut and ILM realized that they would not want to present that version of the final battle to Bay so they decided to have the battle take place on the bridge over the river For a sequence where Bumblebee catches Sam and Lennox while transforming in mid air a digital double of Shia LaBeouf was combined with footage of the actor in high speed so that the effects team could time it for slow motion br Since Bay shoots all his films in anamorphic format Dark of the Moon s representation would be squeezed in to distort the image and ILM would add in the robots and un distort the image The ample variety of filming formats used single camera D stereo rigs with two cameras anamorphic and spherical lenses proved a challenge especially as ILM had a deadline to deliver the D plates to the companies responsible for the D conversion ILM made D shots and Digital Domain had under while Legend D the lead D conversion company of the film completed minutes of work on the film and finalized the work of approximately minutes of challenging non visual effects and minutes of visual effects shots br br br Music br br Composer Steve Jablonsky who had before collaborated with Bay on The Island and the first two Transformers films returned to compose the Dark of the Moon score Jablonsky s musical score was lauded by critics and fans The score was released on June five days before the actual release of the film br br The album was originally set for release on June but Amazon com listed the album as unavailable while the album was still being listed for release during the week of the film s global release It was available for download on Amazon on June and the score currently features pre recorded tracks that are featured in the final film The score s length is approximately The album for the film was released on June It consists of singles produced by different artists and bands and rock tracks American rock band Linkin Park composed the lead single for the film Iridescent as they did with the first two films What I ve Done was used in the film and New Divide for the film The music video for Iridescent was directed by Joe Hahn Two other singles were released specifically for the soundtrack Monster by Paramore and All That You Are by the Goo Goo Dolls Several other unreleased songs make their debut on the album including The Pessimist by Stone Sour and The Bottom by Staind My Chemical Romance s song The Only Hope for Me Is You also appeared
