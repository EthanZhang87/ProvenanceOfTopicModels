leave the film due to failure to master a Scottish accent br br br Music br br The score for Brave was composed by Patrick Doyle and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra The orchestra was conducted by James Shearman To bring some of Scotland s native flavor to the music Doyle used traditional Celtic instruments such as bagpipes a solo fiddle Celtic harps flutes and the bodhr n a tunable handheld frame drum with an electronically treated dulcimer and cimbalom to give it a more contemporary feel I employed many classic Scottish dance rhythms such as reels jigs and strathspeys which not only serve the action but keep it authentic said Doyle As part of his research he spent time in the Hebrides studying unaccompanied Gaelic psalm singing br Doyle also composed several songs for the film The lullaby duet between characters Princess Merida and Queen Elinor entitled A Mhaighdean Uasal Bhan Noble Maiden Fair appears on three occasions in different variations within the fabric of the score and uniquely includes Gaelic vocals by Emma Thompson and Peigi Barker the first Disney film with music featuring the language The drinking song Song of Mor du lyrics by Doyle and Steve Purcell sung by Billy Connolly Scott Davies Patrick Doyle Gordon Neville Alex Norton and Carey Wilson features a rich variety of words sung authentically in Scots which is distinct from Scottish Gaelic Scots being a Germanic language while Scottish Gaelic is Celtic br In addition to Doyle s music the film features three other original songs Learn Me Right written by Mumford Sons and performed with Birdy Touch the Sky music by Alex Mandel lyrics by Mark Andrews Mandel and Into the Open Air music and lyrics by Alex Mandel Both Touch the Sky and Into the Open Air were performed by Julie

Clan Macintosh wears a red tartan similar to the nonfictional Clan Mackintosh br The Walt Disney Company registered the Clan DunBroch tartan within the Scottish Register of Tartans upon the release of the film The tartan consists of ocean blue for the North Sea subdued scarlet for bloodshed during the clan wars deep green for the Scottish Highlands navy blue for the eventual unity of the four clans and gray for the Scottish people In selecting the color scheme Pixar took historical considerations stating that t here was a concerted effort to use hues that were indicative of the less saturated dyeing techniques used during the ancient period in which the fantasy film is set br The registration was celebrated at the film s British premiere in Edinburgh where Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond presented a certificate to director Mark Andrews However Member of the Scottish Parliament Alex Johnstone criticized the registration as well as other fiction based entries such as one for Peter Rabbit as shallow and irreverent Johnstone contended that the legislation that created the Scottish Register of Tartans was intended to prevent such entries and protect Scotland s heritage br

fantasy adventure with a distaff twist and surprising depth Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore during the film s opening weekend gave it an average grade of A on a scale from A to F br Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film out of stars He wrote The good news is that the kids will probably love it and the bad news is that parents will be disappointed if they re hoping for another Pixar groundbreaker Unlike such brightly original films as Toy Story Finding Nemo WALL E and Up this one finds Pixar poaching on traditional territory of Disney He said that the film did have an uplifting message about improving communication between mothers and daughters although transforming your mother into a bear is a rather extreme first step Peter Debruge of Variety gave a positive review of the film writing that the film offers a tougher more self reliant heroine for an era in which princes aren t so charming set in a sumptuously detailed Scottish environment where her spirit blazes bright as her fiery red hair Debruge said that adding a female director Brenda Chapman to its creative boys club the studio Pixar has fashioned a resonant tribute to mother daughter relationships that packs a level of poignancy on par with such beloved male bonding classics as Finding Nemo br Conversely Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave it a negative review stating that the film diminishes into a rather wee thing as it chugs along with climactic drama that is both too conveniently wrapped up and hinges on magical elements that are somewhat confusing to boot Leonard Maltin on IndieWire said I ll give it points for originality but that story twist is so bizarre that it knocked me for a loop The movie tries to make up for this detour with a heart tugging emotional finale but the buildup to that moment has been undermined so it doesn t have the impact it should br Some reviewers saw the Merida character as a novel break from the traditional line of Disney princesses There were some dissonance and criticism among viewers and organized feminists when her character was scheduled to be crowned a Disney princess only for artists to render her thinner with less frizzy hair and rounder eyes more like the other princesses from previous Disney movies This inspired girl empowerment website A Mighty Girl to file a petition that Disney not alter their character One of the signatories was Brenda Chapman the director of the film who felt that Disney had betrayed the essence of what we were trying to do with Merida give young girls and women a better stronger role model and that the makeover was a blatantly sexist marketing move based on money The online petition was considered a success as shortly after it appeared Disney removed the redesigned image from their official website in favor of Merida s original film appearance Disney later clarified the situation assuring that Merida would remain in her original form br br br Accolades br br br Video game br br A video game based on the film was published by

another one We never make a film at Pixar to have a sequel It is always nice when you do and we kind of have a philosophy that if we find the right story then we will Surely the marketing and success
