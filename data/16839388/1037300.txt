next to Disneyland Disney announced additional details about the park s rides and attractions set to open in Among them would be a state of the art launched roller coaster named California Screamin which uses linear induction motor LIM launch technology to propel its riders to a maximum speed of mph km h Although made of steel the ride would be designed to resemble a classic wooden coaster and it would include a vertical loop in the signature shape of Mickey Mouse s head br California Screamin debuted with the park s grand opening on February Designed by Werner Stengel and built by Intamin it features a track length of feet m making it the sixth longest steel coaster in the world and third longest in the US behind Fury at Carowinds and Millennium Force at Cedar Point Materials used to build the attraction included pounds kg of concrete for the footers miles km of electric cables miles km of conductors and pounds kg of steel It also became the longest roller coaster in the world to feature an inversion after the vertical loop on Son of Beast at Kings Island was removed in br In addition to the LIM launch that propels the train up the first hill an additional LIM Boost is used on the main lift midway through the ride These motors are used in lieu of a traditional lift hill chain The coaster is one of Disney Parks fastest attractions accelerating guests from zero to mph km h in four seconds Since the resort was located next to a residential area Disney had installed tunnels throughout the ride to block the screams from riders and reduce noise complaints from nearby residents of Anaheim and neighboring Garden Grove br Like several other coasters in Disney Parks California Screamin featured an onboard audio soundtrack during the ride created by Gary Hoey and George Wilkins On January as part of the Rockin Both Parks campaign the audio track was temporarily replaced by a remixed version of Around the World by Red Hot Chili Peppers and the attraction was renamed Rockin California Screamin This was promoted along with Rockin Space Mountain a similar change made to Space Mountain in Disneyland though that ride s audio was changed to the Red Hot Chili Peppers cover version of Higher Ground The standard audio track was restored when the campaign ended br After the refurbishment of Disney California Adventure from to the Mickey Mouse head located behind the vertical loop was changed to a sunburst icon with the Paradise Pier logo br On July Disney announced a complete renovation of Paradise Pier renaming it Pixar Pier Meanwhile rumors began to circulate that California Screamin would be rethemed to Pixar Animation Studios The Incredibles On November it was confirmed that the ride would be remodeled California Screamin closed on January for the transformation into Incredicoaster The remodel would include a new queue line engineering reboots of the existing launch system new storyline enclosed scream tunnels and a new soundtrack The new trains were unveiled in April Incredicoaster opened on June to coincide with the release of Incredibles br br br Pre show and ride br TV screens display news footage of the Incredibles and Edna Mode being interviewed for a classic roller coaster s rebranding as Incredicoaster While they are being interviewed Jack Jack uses his unpredictable superpowers much to his family s frustration and Edna s amusement As the guests board the cars and take off from the station Elastigirl asks Edna to look after Jack Jack The guests pass by the VIP room where Edna watches Jack Jack as he teleports around Moments later Edna announces that Jack Jack has escaped The Incredibles then take off throughout the ride trying to catch Jack Jack as he uses his vast array of super powers to attack certain points on the ride as the coaster arrives in the launch area br After Dash gives the countdown the train is launched at mph into the first tunnel accompanied by a stream of water jets that glow red to simulate Dash s super speed In the first tunnel Dash tries to use his super speed to catch Jack Jack while Jack Jack shoots lasers from his eyes The train then exits the tunnel as it descends the drop and rises uphill onto the first block brake and then navigates a right hand turn around Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind before passing under the outbound track and climbing up the main lift which uses LIMs to propel the train When new this was the first use of Linear Induction Motor LIM technology that allowed a roller coaster vehicle to travel on an inclined angle br As the train crests the hill it enters the second tunnel where Elastigirl tries using her stretching powers to grab Jack Jack while he is phasing in and out of the tunnel wall Past the crest of the hill Mr Incredible has used his super strength to smash through the wall and is trying to catch Jack Jack by offering him a cookie after which the train drops out of the tunnel Exiting this tunnel the ride goes through a three quarter turn before diving into the vertical loop Following this the train dives through the third tunnel which Jack Jack has set ablaze with his fire powers forcing Violet to put an invisible forcefield around the tunnel to put out the flames and keep the riders safe as they make another loop around the Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind br After hitting the second block brake section the track passes through a series of airtime filled bunny hop hills as it passes over Toy Story Midway Mania where Jack Jack makes multiple versions of himself pop up everywhere The train then rises into the third and final block brake section After dropping off the block brakes the train traverses through a degree downward spiral that leads into a straight section of track with one last bunny hop Which is followed by a final degree left turn into the final brake run as Jack Jack makes it back safely This time he has increased in size but Edna manages to keep him calm by giving him a cookie The train then makes another left turn before returning to the station br br br Safety design br The original safety announcements were recorded by Dee Bradley Baker On November the announcements were updated with the voice of Neil Patrick Harris Baker and Harris also recorded audio for the launch counting down for guests There are acoustic devices to play the onboard audio aboard each train including high range speakers in the headrests mid range speakers near riders ears and subwoofers under each rider s seat br The tubes through which the coaster shoots enable the coaster to comply with Orange County sound ordinances projecting noise in the direction of the park in addition to concealing scenes with characters br br br Cast br Craig T Nelson as Mr Incredible br Holly Hunter as Elastigirl br Sarah Vowell as Violet Parr br Huck Milner as Dash Parr br Brad Bird as Edna Mode br br br Incidents br br In August Dr David Heber a Milwaukee surgeon suffered a neurological disorder and whiplash after his restraint locked at eye level He sued Disney in alleging equipment failure lack of lubrication and ride operators failing to notice his unlocked restraint However Heber lost br On July multiple guests were injured when the purple train rear ended the orange train Of the guests aboard the two trains were taken to the hospital for treatment of minor injuries The accident occurred on the section of track about feet m short of the loading station A full ride stop was activated with the orange train stopped The brake segment that was supposed to have stopped the purple train failed and the purple train continued until it collided with the stopped orange train An investigation showed that a faulty brake valve installed a few days earlier by Disney not by the ride manufacturer Intamin was the cause br On July people were rescued from California Screamin by firefighters when a rider s backpack fell out of a train and landed on the track causing the orange train to valley between the loop and the next block section It reopened two days later after the train was winched up the next hill had its damaged wheels replaced and was allowed to complete the circuit br On August passengers on the ride were stranded for minutes before being rescued when a fallen purse triggered an automatic stop br br br Rankings br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br
