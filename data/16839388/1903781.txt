The Annie Awards are accolades which the Los Angeles branch of the International Animated Film Association ASIFA Hollywood has presented each year since to recognize excellence in animation shown in American cinema and television Originally designed to celebrate lifetime or career contributions to animation the award has been given to individual works since br Membership in ASIFA Hollywood is divided into three main categories General Member for professionals Patron for enthusiasts of animation and Student Member Members in each category pay a fee to belong to the branch Selected professional members of the branch are permitted to vote to decide the awards br The th and th Annie Awards ceremonies were held virtually on April and March respectively due to the then ongoing COVID pandemic br br br History br In June Foray first conceived the idea of awards for excellence in the field of animation With the approval of ASIFA Hollywood president Nick Bosustow an Annie Award ceremony was organized The first ceremony was held at the banquet room of Sportsmen s Lodge in Ventura Boulevard in Studio City Los Angeles California Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer were the first to be honored by the first Annie Awards for creating Betty Boop bringing Popeye and Olive Oyl to the animated screen and for inventing the technique of rotoscoping br br br Naming Annie Awards br According to Foray her husband Hobart Donavan suggested that the awards be called Annie because they are presented for excellence in animation br br br Trophy br The first trophy for the Annie Award trophy was presented in the second award ceremony to Walter Lantz the founder of Walter Lantz Productions and creator of Woody Woodpecker Made of wood and plastic it was shaped like a zoetrope The next year Tom Woodward designed the trophy now presented br br br Award categories br br br Current categories br As of categories are presented including for film and television productions br br br Defunct categories br Best Animated Home Entertainment Production br Best Virtual Reality Production br Outstanding Animated Effects Live Action br Best Animated Television Production br Best Animated Video Game br br br Balloting controversies and criticism br br br Best Short Subject mixup br In the Annie Award nominees for Best Short Subject included two Walt Disney cartoons a Pixar short and two independent films Picnic Pictures The Chestnut Tree and Don Hertzfeldt s short Everything Will Be OK Official rules for the Annie Awards state that voting members must view all nominated achievements in their entirety before casting their ballot for a winner Members are directed to view the nominated films on a secure website br When the online ballot launched on January the two independent films were not included for voters to judge ASIFA acknowledged this error over a week later at which point all the votes were reportedly thrown out and the balloting system was reset Voters were instructed to return and re vote the category The Chestnut Tree was now uploaded properly to the ballot however Everything Will Be OK was again not included this time the online ballot only played a portion of this film s minute running time to voters abruptly cutting out in the middle of a scene ASIFA again took several days to repair the ballot but this time allowed voting to continue br By the time the ballot officially closed on February Everything Will Be OK was only available to voters for less than hours of the entire day voting period Even though ASIFA apologized to Hertzfeldt they took no further action and carried on with the event awarding the prize to the Pixar short Your Friend the Rat Hertzfeldt would eventually win the award for his Oscar nominated short film World of Tomorrow br br br Dreamworks upset and Disney boycott br In DreamWorks Animation s Kung Fu Panda swept the Annie Awards in a surprise upset over Pixar s WALL E which won no Annie Awards but did go on to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Many felt that the vote had been rigged DreamWorks at the time gave each of their employees a free membership to ASIFA Hollywood which in turn conferred voting rights For most film awards voting rights cannot be bought but must be conferred by one s peers br As a result Walt Disney Studios decided to cease submissions and support for the Annie Awards from their two animated film divisions Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Due to Disney s complaints ASIFA Hollywood changed the rules on voting for individual achievement categories making those categories only available to professionals within those categories ASIFA Hollywood head Antran Manoogian also said that Annie voters would in the future have to be approved by a committee and non professionals would now be ineligible to vote br That was not enough for Disney president Ed Catmull who had called for an advisory committee of relevant executives representing each studio to recommend rule changes to the ASIFA board Catmull said We believe there is an issue with the way the Annies are judged and have been seeking a mutually agreeable solution with the board Although some initial steps have been taken the board informed us that no further changes would be made to address our concerns ASIFA Hollywood did not agree to this demand br Disney and Pixar rejoined the Annie Awards in with no formal announcement Ironically earlier that year the Annie Awards had a near exact replay of the results with DreamWorks Animation s How to Train Your Dragon sweeping all the major Annie Awards over Pixar s Toy Story which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and also received a nomination for Best Picture br br br Notable nominations
