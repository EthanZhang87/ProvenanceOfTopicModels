Buzz Lightyear s Space Ranger Spin in Florida also known as Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters in California and Tokyo Disneyland Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast in Paris and Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue in Shanghai is an interactive shooting dark ride attraction located in the Tomorrowland area of the Disney theme parks Designed by Walt Disney Imagineering this attraction combines a carnival game and a third generation Omnimover system It is inspired by Disney Pixar s Toy Story franchise and contains several elements loosely based on the cartoon series Buzz Lightyear of Star Command br The attraction first opened at Magic Kingdom on November Subsequent versions can be found at Disneyland Disneyland Park in Paris and Shanghai Disneyland Although each ride may have a different name all share the same major plot and characters The ride formerly existed at Hong Kong Disneyland under the name Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters but was closed in September For a brief period from the Shanghai version s opening in until the Hong Kong version s closure in the attraction was only one of two that could be found at all six Disney castle parks worldwide the other attraction being Dumbo the Flying Elephant br br br Plot br The backstory of the ride revolves around the attempts of Evil Emperor Zurg voiced by Ken Mitchroney in Space Ranger Spin Tessh Genda in Astro Blasters at Tokyo Disneyland Andrew Stanton at Astro Blasters in Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland and Laurent Gamelon in Astro Blasters in Disneyland Paris and an unknown actor in Planet Rescue to steal the batteries known as crystallic fusion cells used to power the space vehicles of the Little Green Men voiced by Jeff Pidgeon Participants are Star Command raw recruits sent to defeat Zurg The queue area is awash in the chartreuse white and bright blue hues of Buzz Lightyear himself voiced by Pat Fraley who does voice for all Buzz Lightyear attractions minus the Shanghai and Japanese rides Since Buzz Lightyear is a toy the attraction is cleverly scaled to give the illusion that one has just been reduced to the size of an action figure featuring such detail as giant exposed Philips screw heads and an explanation of the interactive phase of the ride that resembles a toy s instruction sheet only on a gigantic scale An Audio Animatronic Buzz Lightyear figure and giant Etch a Sketch Disneyland and or View Master Walt Disney World provide explanation of the mission to destroy Zurg s secret weapon with your blasters While his body is audio animatronic Buzz s face is actually a screen with a projection of computer animation allowing better lipsync and more expressive features making him look like a more realistic representation of the character from the films br br br Technical aspects br Astro Blasters and Space Ranger Spin are equal parts shooting gallery and dark ride Visitors board an Omnimover space vehicle featuring two laser pistols and a joystick The pistols are used to shoot laser beams at targets of varying point values Targets that are hit while lit up will produce much higher scores A digital readout on the dashboard shows the player s score The joystick allows full degree rotation of the vehicle to assist in aiming During the ride if the ride slows down or completely stops this is a result of either a disabled guest or a ride breakdown this allows for bonus points as the pistols and targets do not turn off There are different shaped targets which are worth different numbers of points round points square points diamond points and triangle points br At the conclusion of the ride the digital score flashes L L displaying the ranking or level achieved for the below scores br br Level Star Cadet br Level Space Scout br Level Ranger st Class br Level Planetary Pilot br Level Space Ace br Level Cosmic Commando br Level Galactic Hero br Some of the rides feature an on ride photo which depending on the park may be available as a free electronic postcard via e mail at the exit or be available for purchase on the Disney s PhotoPass system The photos include the player s score If the score is in the top highest of the day the player s ranking may be included in the photo The Top players scores are shown on the scoreboard at the exit queue The top person gets their face posted on the screen The Disneyland version once featured at home play tied directly to the attraction itself via the Internet however this is disabled br The installation at the Magic Kingdom utilizes an existing ride system by Arrow Development originally constructed in for If You Had Wings The ride was designed and manufactured by Sansei Technologies Inc with the corporation of Walt Disney Imagineering br br br History br br br Magic Kingdom br The layout and systems of the ride date back to This space was originally home to If You Had Wings an aviation themed ride sponsored by Eastern Airlines Eastern Airlines dropped sponsorship of the ride for financial reasons in early June All Eastern themes were removed and the ride was renamed If You Could Fly If You Could Fly was closed down in January br The installation of Space Ranger Spin also impacted the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover which runs through the south show building The Tomorrowland Transit Authority or TTA as it is often called for short had opened in as the WEDway PeopleMover At that time If You Had Wings was the attraction occupying the south show building Three diorama windows were also positioned on the track two on the right and one on the left These allowed the Mexico Jamaica and Trinidad scenes to be visible to riders on the Tomorrowland Transit Authority in such a way as to hide all projectors lights and other show support equipment br The diorama windows were altered once more when If You Had Wings was transformed into Delta Dreamflight This was done because the windows no longer correctly lined up with show scenes The first window was replaced with backlit panels depicting the ride s barnstormer scene Window two looked into the Parisian Excursion scene from a viewpoint which heavily distorted the tableau s forced perspective The third window would have had TTA riders looking directly into an extremely bright light and so was completely obscured with plywood and black fabric br In October Disney announced that Buzz Lightyear s Space Ranger Spin would be added to Magic Kingdom When Delta Dreamflight transitioned yet again into the current attraction in the first window was refitted with the diorama of the hair salon and the second left open to look into the new attraction though concern was expressed over the fact that this view allows TTA riders to look directly into banks of high powered blacklights At one point during Space Ranger Spin it is possible to catch a glimpse of the TTA passing through the building The ride was briefly sponsored by Mattel from opening day to br Buzz Lightyear s Space Ranger Spin was named the Disney Magazine Reader s Choice Award winner for Best Magic Kingdom Park Attraction for Young Kids br br br Disneyland br Like the Magic Kingdom version at Walt Disney World it uses infrastructure from previous attractions Its show building originally housed the Circle Vision theater In as part of a major makeover of Tomorrowland the Circle Vision theater was removed and the space became part of the queue for the now infamous Rocket Rods The Rocket Rods which were prone to breakdowns ran from to This space was then unused until when Astro Blasters opened br br br Queue br br br Magic Kingdom br The queue of the ride shows different pictures of Buzz Lightyear and the Little Green Men It also shows the battery cells and pipes plugging into Star Command Guests then pass the Buzz Lightyear animatronic This version of the animatronic has his wings open and is not holding anything After listening to what he has to say guests then leave that room and board the XP Attached to them are ion laser canons and a joystick to spin the cart br br br Disneyland br Astro Blasters features more dialogue than Space Ranger Spin does This ride s queue as well as the other Astro Blasters Laser Blast includes a walkie talkie with Buzz Lightyear on it reading his wrist communication device The speakers provide backstory to the ride and how Zurg is attacking Green Planet home of the Little Green Men It also includes a picture of Zurg as wanted criminal number one It has pictures of The green squadron leaving to attack It also has posters describing the blasters and the XP Star cruiser In the Fast Pass line there is a picture of Buzz Lightyear shooting a purple green and orange colored alien There is also a mural that depicts Lightyear leading a team of Space rangers This mural is notable for seemingly featuring the character of Princess Mira Nova from the cartoon Buzz Lightyear of Star Command although for some reason she has eyes The guests enter the briefing room to see Buzz Lightyear This animatronic has no wings out and is holding an Astro Blaster The Astro Blaster has a timer for when Buzz does his talking As he says his line about finding Zurg s robot the astro blaster lights up and blasts its laser at the Etch A Sketch wiping off the picture of Zurg However in Paris the laser can t keep up with the timer and it shines a little early The animatronic gives a one minute speech before a red alarm goes off signaling for the line to move along The guest proceed down a long Corridor seeing the LGMs testing the Blasters The guests then board the Star cruiser br br br Shanghai Disneyland br The Queue has the look of a Star Tours type attraction and is the longest indoor queue for all of the versions of the attraction It looks like the International Space Station The walls are covered with pictures of Buzz Lightyear himself Video monitors are displayed on some of those walls The monitors play videos of the LGMS and Zurg with his new weapon Buzz Lightyear will also appear on the screen fighting the robots Most of the videos show the Star command space ship Each ship has a red and green blaster on each side After the queue guests will walk into the room where the space cruisers are br br br Attraction br br br Magic Kingdom br The Magic Kingdom s version of the ride known as Buzz Lightyear s Space Ranger Spin is the first Buzz Lightyear attraction and the third Omnimover ride to operate in Tomorrowland s south show building Unlike other versions of the attraction Magic Kingdom s version features laser guns that are stationary br The ride begins when the cart enters a room with four blue colored astronauts holding guns aimed at a disco ball The ride then enters a robot attack scene An orange robot called the Box O Bot originally labeled as a Rock Em Sock Em Robot during the Mattel sponsorship a blue and purple robot called the Gigantobot a green robot called the Battery Bot and a Dog Bot are all present in this scene The ride then slopes down a short hill into Planet Z Here guests encounter many aliens including space chickens space spiders and others There is also a volcano that is shooting green goo The guests then enter Zurg s fortress where they see a battery delivery Zurg is in his spaceship which he calls his Spiderbot In the next room the aliens show the guests that Zurg has escaped The next room is the projection tunnel and in it Zurg is shooting at the guests The final room shows Buzz Lightyear fighting with Zurg in the now destroyed Spiderbot The Little green men help Buzz tear it apart Then the unload area shows Buzz Lightyear thanking the guests while holding Zurg in the claw Guests will then exit the ride into Store Command where they can purchase a photo of themselves on the ride br Mattel having just transferred its sponsorship from the It s a Small World attraction thus in turn making that attraction sponsorless in nearby Fantasyland originally sponsored the Walt Disney World attraction from its opening to when all references to Mattel were removed from the attraction The Disney World version has been without sponsorship ever since br br br Disneyland br br Disneyland s version of the ride is called Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters br A key difference between this ride and its counterpart at Walt Disney World s Magic Kingdom is that its laser guns can be removed from their mounts to allow for more accurate shooting similar to Men in Black Alien Attack The laser guns at Space Ranger Spin at Magic Kingdom cannot be removed from their mounts and have limited movement br The ride begins in the robot attack scene with The Box O Bot The Gigantobot who have changed positions and coloring as in WDW s version The Box O Bot was neon orange and was on the left side of the track and the Gigantobot was dark blue and purple and was on the right side of the track Now Box O Bot is just orange and is on the right and the Gigantobot has a red body and red ears The Dogbot who now has a brown color and the Batterybot who is now red and has a target on his nose This variation is in Paris and in California while a similar version with a target on his forehead is in Tokyo and Hong Kong are all present during this scene There is also a mini Space Ranger in what looks like an X Wing The Guests enter Zurg s Dreadnought down a hallway shooting batteries until you reach his laboratory Zurg is shooting his Zurgatronic Ion Blaster he dubbed it this in BLoSC He is standing behind his now damaged Secret Weapon Guests are about to transition into the next room which is completely dark while robots are being electrocuted trying to land the Dreadnought The Guests enter Planet Z In the French Version of the ride Buzz Lightyear says Attention Space Rangers you ve landed on Planet Z Be ready for anything Guests can shoot aliens including a call back to the pterodactyl that belongs to Sid Phillips in the First Toy Story Film Before leaving Planet Z Zurg is laughing in when he thinks he has triumphed because he is about to shoot Green Planet Guests then enter a light tunnel with Zs around it The next room is similar to Space Ranger Spin Buzz Lightyear is using his Astro Blaster to take down Zurg s Secret Weapon The Green Squadron are helping Buzz take down the ship The final room has the LGMs signing the receipt to return Zurg to Al s Toys Barn Zurg promises revenge as the Green Squadron thank the guests Buzz Lightyear then thanks the guests He tells them to put the Blasters where they belong and to check the score board Guests exit the ride to Little Green Men s Store command br br br Hong Kong Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland br br The Tokyo version is the original version of the ride and all of the ride s audio is in Japanese At Hong Kong Disneyland the ride is also called Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters and is extremely similar to the Tokyo version with a more elaborate queue The Hong Kong version features English dialogue though safety announcements are trilingual Those two versions also featured a floating Planet Z outside of the space ship On November Disney announced that the Hong Kong version of the ride would be closing on August In its place was the park s second Marvel themed ride Ant Man and The Wasp Nano Battle which became part of a new land Stark Expo However Tokyo Disneyland s version is still operating today until it was announced on April that this version would close in October of that year to be replaced with an attraction themed to the Wreck It Ralph franchise to open in br br br Disneyland Paris br At Disneyland Paris Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast replaced the Circle Vision production Le Visionarium which closed in This version of the ride is much like the Disneyland version Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters except for the presence of a tribute to Le Visionarium When you are in the robot attack scene at the beginning if you look beneath the left arm of the Box O Bot you might be able to see Eye the Circumvisual Photodroid from Le Visionarium hiding there However it is an easy to miss tribute br In the Paris version of the ride the dialogue is the same but translated into French as well as English In the queue the Buzz Lightyear animatronic speaks English as well as French for those who speak French and don t understand English Some areas of the ride provide both dialogues but in the scene where Zurg s weapon is half destroyed it switches from English to French in a dialogue loop as it does in the California version of the ride This ride s cruiser is called the XP calling back to the California version This is also the version with the second longest indoor queue br br br Shanghai Disneyland br The most recent version of this attraction is called Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue It is based on the opening sequence of Toy Story set on Zurg s home planet and featuring the robots seen in the film br As the ride begins Buzz and the Little Green Men help guests take down the Zurg robots Later Buzz is seen fighting two of the robotic giants The vehicles then move into a mine where Zurg is engineering a mega weapon He unleashes more robots as Buzz struggles to stop the mining operation Zurg is finally defeated and vows revenge br br br Other appearances br br In the Walt Disney Company premiered a home version of the ride in the form of an internet video game that allows users to connect with guests at the parks The scores of each guest from the dark ride are tallied with the internet gamer and increase the points won br There was also a bumper car attraction at Walt Disney World s DisneyQuest with the name Buzz Lightyear s Astroblaster where players rode and controlled enclosed bumper cars while shooting asteroids black foam soccer balls at each other Getting hit by a ball at a specific target caused the cars to spin around and flash lights for a few seconds However that attraction was closed when DisneyQuest shut its doors in br The video game Kingdom Hearts III features a virtual version of the ride as one of its Attraction Flow theme park inspired attacks allowing the player to attack enemies with similar mechanics and visual style as the real ride br
