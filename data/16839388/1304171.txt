the advice of his friend John Webster an instrumentalist on the Mad Mad World album In a interview with The Canadian Press to mark the song s th anniversary Cochrane said Webster encouraged him to revisit the demo recording which at that point only had mumbled vocals and improvised lyrics but not the song s well known chorus The song became a pep talk to myself saying you can t really control all of this stuff you just do the best you can he says Cochrane says he was trying to make sense of the poverty he witnessed on his trip which he found shocking and traumatic br Eventually the
