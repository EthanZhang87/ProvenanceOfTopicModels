marks the climax of the Piston Cup season The event intensifies a rivalry between the retiring seven time champion Strip The King Weathers the cunning Chick Hicks and the talented but overconfident rookie Lightning McQueen Desperate to win and gain entry into the prestigious Dinoco team Lightning struggles with teamwork due to his self centered attitude During the high stakes race Lightning avoids a major collision instigated by Chick but blows his lead by refusing to take a pit stop causing his rear tires to blow out before he can win The race ends in a three way tie setting the stage for a decisive race at the Los Angeles International Speedway in one week br After the race Lightning rushes through the night on the interstate to reach California inside his transport truck Mack A mishap leaves Lightning stranded alone in the rundown desert town of Radiator Springs Here he inadvertently damages the main road leading to an unexpected community service assignment repaving the road under the supervision of the town s judge Doc Hudson who is prejudiced against Lightning for being a race car br Lightning repaves the road shoddily in a rush to leave and Doc challenges him to a race for his freedom on the condition that he starts over from scratch if he loses The overconfident Lightning having never raced on a dirt road before spins out on a turn and crashes Doc on the other hand handles the road with no problems Over time Lightning warms up to and befriends the town s residents especially Mater a rusty tow truck and Sally who dreams of reviving Radiator Springs As he bonds with the locals Lightning helps rejuvenate Radiator Springs and develops a newfound appreciation for its charm He discovers the town was once a bustling attraction for drivers on Route before the construction of the interstate caused them to lose all their business traffic Lightning also discovers that the bitter Doc reticent about his past used to race as the legendary Hudson Hornet until a disastrous crash ended his career Lightning is dumbfounded that Doc considers his previous Piston Cups worthless junk br Lightning finishes repairing the road and decides to spend an extra day in Radiator Springs helping the local businesses but Doc alerts the media of Lightning s location leading them and Mack to descend on the town and force Lightning to leave in time for the race Doc immediately regrets his actions after seeing the residents disappointed by his unexpected departure At the race Lightning initially struggles but is buoyed by the sudden arrival of his friends from Radiator Springs who come to his aid in the pit With Doc now acting as his crew chief Lightning stages a remarkable comeback However Chick employs a PIT maneuver that intentionally damages the King rendering him unable to continue Fearing that the King s career may end as Doc s did Lightning halts just before the finish line and pushes him across allowing Chick to win the Piston Cup while ensuring the King s safe finish br The crowd and media condemn Chick s Piston Cup victory and praise Lightning s integrity Although offered a sponsorship by Dinoco Lightning chooses loyalty to his

aged The film was the second to be dedicated to his memory after Corpse Bride The memorial showed the roles he had done in the other films directed by John Lasseter during the credits This is also the last non documentary movie for Paul Newman before his retirement in and his death in It turned out to be the highest grossing film of his career br br br Production br br br Development br br The development of Cars began in when Pixar finished production of A Bug s Life At that time Jorgen Klubien began writing a new script called The Yellow Car which was about an electric car living in a gas guzzling world inspired by The Ugly Duckling an idea triggered by the poor reception his fellow countrymen gave the Mini El car Some of the original drawings and characters were developed in and the producers agreed that Cars could be the next Pixar film after A Bug s Life and be released in early particularly around June However the idea was scrapped in favor of Toy Story Later production resumed with major script changes like giving Mater Doc and a few other characters bigger parts br John Lasseter said that inspiration for the film s story came after he took a cross country road trip with his wife and five sons in When he returned to the studio after vacation he contacted Michael Wallis a Route historian Wallis then led eleven Pixar animators in rented white Cadillacs on two different road trips across the route to research the film In the film s working title was Route after U S Route but the title was changed to Cars in order to avoid confusion with the s television series of the same name In addition Lightning McQueen s racing number was originally going to be a reference to Lasseter s birth year but was changed to a reference to the year Pixar s first feature film Toy Story was released br In Lasseter spoke about the inspiration for the film saying I have always loved cars In one vein I have Disney blood and in the other there s motor oil The notion of combining these two great passions in my life cars and animation was irresistible When Joe Ranft and I first started talking about this film in we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters Around that same time we watched a documentary called Divided Highways which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed That s when we started really researching Route but we still hadn t quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St Louis br Years later in Klubien said the film was both his best and most bitter experience because he was fired before it premiered and because he feels Lasseter wrote him out of the story of how the film got made br br br Animation br br For the cars themselves Lasseter also visited the design studios of the Big Three Detroit automakers particularly J Mays of Ford Motor Company Lasseter learned how real cars were designed br In Lasseter spoke about how they worked hard to make the animation believable saying It took many months of trial and error and practicing test animation to figure out how each car moves and how their world works Our supervising animators Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark and the directing animators Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was Some cars are like sports cars and they re much tighter in their suspension Others are older s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality We also wanted each animator to be able to put some of themself in the character and give it their own spin Every day in dailies it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way br Unlike most anthropomorphic cars the eyes of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield which resembles the Tonka Talking Trucks the characters from Tex Avery s One Cab s Family short and Disney s own Susie the Little Blue Coupe rather than within the headlights According to production designer Bob Pauley From the very beginning of this project John Lasseter had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield For one thing it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights For another he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at the front end of the car feels more like a snake With the eyes set in the windshield the point of view is more human like and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character This decision was facetiously criticized by automotive blog Jalopnik br In the supervising animator of the film Scott Clark spoke about the challenges of animating car characters saying Getting a full range of performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment but that s what animation does best You use your imagination and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design Our car characters may not have arms and legs but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in We can use steering to point a certain direction We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don t have Doug Sweetland who also served as supervising animator also spoke about the challenges saying It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the Cars models than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models With The Incredibles the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage But with Cars it departs completely from any reference Yes they re cars but no car can do what our characters do It s pure fantasy It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right br Lasseter also explained that the film started with pencil and paper designs saying Truth to materials Starting with pencil and paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley and continuing through the modeling articulation and shading of the characters and finally into animation the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible saying John didn t want the cars to seem clay like or mushy He insisted on truth to materials This was a huge thing for him He told us that steel needs to feel like steel Glass should feel like glass These cars need to feel heavy They weigh three or four thousand pounds When they move around they need to have that feel They shouldn t appear light or overly bouncy to the point where the audience might see them as rubber toys According to directing animator James Ford Murphy Originally the car models were built so they could basically do anything John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds They can t stretch He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do br Character shading supervisor on the film Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges on the film saying Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film We started out by learning as much as we could At the local body shop we watched them paint a car and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer We figured out that we needed a base paint which is where the color comes from and the clearcoat which provides the reflection We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle a pearlescent quality that might change color depending on the angle and even a layer of pin striping for characters like Ramone Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters and the reflections that those surfaces generate saying Given that the stars of our film are made of metal John had a real desire to see realistic reflections and more beautiful lighting than we ve seen in any of our previous films In the past we ve mostly used environment maps and other matte based technology to cheat reflections but for Cars we added a ray tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar br Rendering lead Jessica McMackin spoke about the use of ray tracing on the film saying In addition to creating accurate reflections we used ray tracing to achieve other effects We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows like when there are multiple light sources and you want to get a feathering of shadows at the edges Or occlusion which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces like a crease in a shirt A fourth use is irradiance An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road saying The ground locking system is one of the things I m most proud of on this film In the past characters have never known about their environment in any way A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen On Cars this system is built into the models themselves and as you move the car around the vehicle sticks to the ground It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done but we had no idea how to do it br Technical director Lisa Forsell explained that to enhance the richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats saying Digital matte paintings are a way to get a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry and write complex shaders We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other The clouds do in fact have some character and personality The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds cars see various car shaped clouds It s subtle but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan And if you look closely you ll see some that look like tire treads The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film Is there a story point Not really There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it There is nothing that is just throw away br Computers used in the development of the film were four times faster than those used in The Incredibles and times faster than those used in Toy Story To build the cars the animators used computer platforms similar to those used in the design of real world automobiles br br br Soundtrack br br The Cars soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on June Nine tracks on the soundtrack are by popular artists while the remaining eleven are score cues by Randy Newman It has two versions of the classic Bobby Troup jazz standard Route popularized by Nat King Cole one by Chuck Berry and a new version recorded specifically for the film s credits performed by John Mayer Brad Paisley contributed two of the nine tracks to the album one being Find Yourself used for the end credits br br br Release br Cars was originally going to be released on November but on December its release date was moved to June Analysts looked at the release date change as a sign from Pixar that they were preparing for the pending end of the Disney distribution contract by either preparing non Disney materials to present to other studios or they were buying time to see what happened with Michael Eisner s situation at Disney When Pixar s chief executive Steve Jobs made the release date announcement he stated that the reasoning was due to wanting to put all Pixar films on a summer release schedule with DVD sales occurring during the holiday shopping season br br br Home media br Cars was released on DVD in both its original theatrical anamorphic widescreen aspect ratio and an open matte fullscreen edition on November in the United States and Canada This DVD was also released on October in Australia and New Zealand and on November in the United Kingdom The release includes the DVD exclusive short film Mater and the Ghostlight and the film s theatrical short

DVD were sold the first two days it was available The first week it sold units and in total Unlike previous Pixar DVD releases there is no two disc special edition and no plans to release one in the future According to Sara Maher DVD Production Manager at Pixar John Lasseter and Pixar were preoccupied with productions like Ratatouille br In the US and Canada there were bonus discs available with the purchase of the film at Wal Mart and at Target The former featured a Geared Up Bonus DVD Disc that focused on the music of the film including the music video to Life Is A Highway The Making of Life Is A Highway Cars The Making of the Music and Under The Hood a special that originally aired on the ABC Family cable channel The latter s bonus was a Rev d Up DVD Disc that featured material

becoming the third film of the year to do so following X Men The Last Stand and The Da Vinci Code It went on to gross million worldwide and million in the United States Cars was the second highest grossing animated film of behind Ice Age The Meltdown br br br Critical response br On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews and an average rating of The website s

score of out of based on critics reviews indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br William Arnold of the Seattle Post Intelligencer praised it as one of Pixar s most imaginative and thoroughly appealing movies ever and Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it a work of American art as classic as it is modern Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three out of four stars saying that it tells a bright and cheery story and then has a little something profound lurking around the edges In this case it s a sense of loss Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of four saying Fueled with plenty of humor action heartfelt drama and amazing new technical feats Cars is a high octane delight for moviegoers of all ages Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review saying Existing both in turbo charged today and the gentler s straddling the realms of Pixar styling and old Disney heart this new model Cars is an instant classic Brian Lowry of Variety gave the film a negative review saying Despite representing another impressive technical achievement it s the least visually interesting of the computer animation boutique s movies and in an ironic twist for a story about auto racing drifts slowly through its semi arid midsection Robert Wilonsky of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review saying What ultimately redeems Cars from turning out a total lemon is its soul Lasseter loves these animated inanimate objects as though they were kin and it shows in every beautifully rendered frame Ella Taylor of L A Weekly gave the film a positive review saying Cars cheerfully hitches cutting edge animation to a folksy narrative plugging friendship community and a Luddite mistrust of high tech br Gene Seymour of Newsday gave the film three out of four stars saying And as pop flies go Cars is pretty to watch even as it loops drifts and at times looks as if it s just hanging in midair Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film a positive review saying It takes everything that s made Pixar shorthand for animation excellence strong characters tight pacing spot on voice casting a warm sense of humor and visuals that are pure pixilated bliss and carries them to the next stage Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four out of five stars saying What s surprising about this supremely engaging film is the source of its curb appeal It has heart Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review saying It s the latest concoction from the geniuses at Pixar probably the most inventive of the Computer Generated Imagery shop and the film s great fun if well under the level of the first Toy Story Jessica Reaves of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying While it s a technically perfect movie its tone is too manic its characters too jaded and in the end its story too empty to stand up to expectations James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars saying While Cars may cross the finish line ahead of any of s other animated films it s several laps behind its Pixar siblings Lisa Kennedy of The Denver Post gave the film three out of four stars saying Cars idles at times And it s not until its final laps that the movie gains the emotional traction we ve come to expect from the Toy Story and Nemo crews Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle gave the film three out of four stars saying It thunders ahead with breezy abandon scoring big grins on its way br Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film a positive review saying The animation is stunningly rendered But the story is always the critical element in Pixar movies and Cars story is heartfelt with a clear and unabashed moral David Edelstein of New York Magazine gave the film a positive review saying Like the Toy Story films Cars is a state of the computer art plea on behalf of outmoded wholesome fifties technology with a dash of Zen by way of George Lucas Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four saying Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter small town life may well be lost on this movie s young audience Cars finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of five stars saying Cars might get us into car world as a gimmick but it doesn t get us into car world as a state of mind Thus the animation rather than seeming like an expression of the movie s deeper truth becomes an impediment to it Derek Adams of Time Out gave the film a positive review saying There are many other brilliant scenes some just as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film s struggling to fire on all cylinders Still it s a Pixar film right And they re always worth a gander no matter what anyone says br br br Accolades br br
