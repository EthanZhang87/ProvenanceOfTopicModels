br br Production br Prior to work on Finding Dory Disney had planned to make a Finding Nemo sequel without Pixar s involvement through Circle Seven Animation a studio Disney announced in with the intention to make sequels to Pixar properties However due to the acquisition of Pixar by Disney Circle Seven was shut down by Disney without having produced a film Although it never went into production a script for the Circle Seven version was uploaded to the official Raindance Film Festival website Elements of the unmade script included the introduction of Nemo s long lost twin brother Remy and a storyline wherein Marlin is caught and must be saved br br In July Andrew Stanton was announced as the director of a Finding Nemo sequel with Victoria Strouse writing the script That same month Stanton examined the veracity of the news involving the potential sequel That August Ellen DeGeneres had entered negotiations to reprise her role of Dory and in September the film was confirmed by Stanton saying What was immediately on the list was writing a second Carter movie When that went away everything slid up I know I ll be accused by more sarcastic people that it s a reaction to Carter not doing well but only in its timing but not in its conceit In February it was confirmed by the press that Albert Brooks would reprise the role of Marlin in the sequel br In April Disney announced the sequel Finding Dory confirming that DeGeneres and Brooks would be reprising their roles as Dory and Marlin respectively Following a long campaign for a sequel on The Ellen DeGeneres Show DeGeneres stated br br I have waited for this day for a long long long long long long time I m not mad it took this long I know the people at Pixar were busy creating Toy Story But the time they took was worth it The script is fantastic And it has everything I loved about the first one It s got a lot of heart it s really funny and the best part is it s got a lot more Dory br In a July interview with Los Angeles Times Stanton spoke of the sequel s origin There was polite inquiry from Disney about a Finding Nemo sequel I was always No sequels no sequels But I had to get on board from a VP standpoint Sequels are part of the necessity of our staying afloat but we don t want to have to go there for those reasons We want to go there creatively so we said to Disney Can you give us the timeline about when we release them Because we d like to release something we actually want to make and we might not come up with it the year you want it br In a interview Stanton stated how the film s story came to be I don t watch my films that often after they re done because I have to watch them so many times before they come out So about when we were getting Finding Nemo ready for the year re release in D it was interesting to watch again after all that time Something kind of got lodged in the back of my brain and started to sort of stew I started to think about how easily Dory could get lost and not find Marlin and Nemo again She basically was in the same state that she was when Marlin found her I didn t know where she was from I knew that she had spent most of her youth wandering the ocean alone and I wanted to know that she could find her new family if she ever got lost again It s almost like the parental side of me was worried Stanton additionally stated I knew if I ever said Finding Dory or mentioned a sequel to Finding Nemo out loud I d be done T here would be no way I d be able to put that horse back in the barn So I kept it very quiet until I knew I had a story that I thought would hold and that was in early So I pitched it to John Lasseter and he was all into it Then I got a writer and once we had a treatment that we kind of liked I felt comfortable calling Ellen br br Stanton selected Victoria Strouse to write the screenplay She later said It was always collaborative with Andrew but really the screenwriting was me Of course Andrew would do passes and he and I would brainstorm a lot together and then we would bring it to the group of story artists People would weigh in and share ideas She pointed to Dory s forgetfulness as a challenge when writing the script adding You don t realize until you sit down to write a character who can t remember things how integral memory is to absolutely everything we do and that s what creates a narrative that people can follow When a main character can t self reflect and can t tell a story that character is very difficult to design because she can t really lead To get her to be able to lead and to get an audience to be able to trust her was the hardest thing to do br The fictional Marine Life Institute depicted extensively in the film is based on the production team s research trips to the Monterey Bay Aquarium the Marine Mammal Center and the Vancouver Aquarium br The film s ending was revised after Pixar executives viewed Blackfish a documentary film which focuses on the dangers of keeping orca whales in captivity Initially some of the characters were to end up in a SeaWorld like marine park but the revision gave them an option to leave br Angus MacLane was one of the first people to whom Stanton revealed his idea for the sequel Together with Bob Peterson they discussed about different ideas for places Dory would visit during her journey one of those ideas was the touch pool sequence Later during the Brave wrap party Stanton invited MacLane to join him in his first co directing duty Stanton described MacLane s role as a jack of all trades particularly utilizing his experience in animation and story as well as in production having created a few short films himself br In August at Disney s D Expo it was announced that Hayden Rolence would voice Nemo replacing Alexander Gould from the first film whose voice had deepened since reaching adulthood Gould voiced a minor character in the sequel instead At the D expo they also announced that Ed O Neill would be the voice of Hank

experience than the first film Finding Dory got me it made me cry A O Scott of The New York Times said that while the film lacks dazzling originality it still has warmth charm and good humor In his review for Variety Owen Gleiberman wrote It s a film that spills over with laughs most of them good a few of them shticky and tears all of them earned supporting characters who are meant to slay us and mostly do with their irascible sharp tongues and dizzyingly extended flights of physical comedy Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said that Finding Dory can be touching sweet and tender but it s compulsively preposterously and steadfastly funny Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of four and said that the film brims with humor heart and animation miracles despite lacking the fresh surprise of its predecessor Wendy Ide of The Observer wrote that the film reprises the central motif of Finding Nemo that of the enduring parent child bond and the special embrace of family in all its permutations but added it is approached with such charm and warmth that it hardly matters that the two films share such similar arcs br Todd McCarthy of The

the Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan said that As the year gap between Nemo and Dory indicates this was not a concept that cried out to be made Armond White of National Review wrote For anyone who is
