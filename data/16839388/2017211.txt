picture deal with Walt Disney Pictures It was also reported Sanders was working on an untitled computer animated film Nearly a year later in November the project had been titled American Dog The plot centered on Henry a famous canine star who one day finds himself stranded in the Nevada desert with a testy one eyed cat and an oversized radioactive rabbit who are themselves searching for new homes all the while believing he is still on television In August the project s conceptual artwork and synopsis were then showcased publicly at the annual SIGGRAPH conference By November American Dog had been slated for a summer release br Following the corporate acquisition of Pixar Animation Studios John Lasseter and Ed Catmull had been respectively appointed as Chief Creative Officer and President of Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar In the fall of Lasseter along with other directors from Pixar and Disney attended two screenings of the film and gave Sanders suggestive notes on how to improve the story Catmull stated somewhere along the way the plot had also come to include a radioactive cookie selling Girl Scout zombie serial killer I m all for quirky ideas but this one had metastasized In December Sanders was removed from the project and by early he had joined DreamWorks Animation According to Lasseter Sanders was replaced because he had resisted the changes that he and the other directors had suggested Lasseter was quoted as saying Chris Sanders is extremely talented but he couldn t take it to the place it had to be Earlier that same month Disney had laid off about employees within its animation division Sanders said he had no ill will over being removed from the film and hoped he could revisit some of his ideas in the future He approved of the final film and the changes made stating I think it would have been frustrating if the movie were essentially the same but with only slight changes And I suppose my scenes and storylines are still sitting there on the shelf I could actually pull them out and do them again But it would be completely different br In February Lasseter had confirmed Chris Williams and Byron Howard were the film s new directors As directors Williams focused on the story reels and layout while Howard tackled character design and animation The radioactive rabbit and eyepatch wearing cat characters were removed from the story while the dog Henry now renamed Bolt was redesigned into a White Shepherd with a lightning bolt shaped patch that runs down the left side of his body Furthermore Lasseter ordered the American Southwest setting to be removed given his then recent film Cars had a similar terrain Following the story overhaul the animation team was told to complete the animation in months instead of the usual four years that is normally required to produce a computer animated feature On June Disney announced that the film now under its current name would be released on November in Disney Digital D br br br Animation br The look of the film was inspired by the paintings of Edward Hopper and the cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond New technology in non photorealistic rendering NPR was used to give it a special visual appearance a technique later used in Tangled To give the film s D backgrounds a hand painted look the company artists used new patented technology designed specifically for the film br Bolt s characteristics are based on an amalgam of breeds although the designers started with the American White Shepherd Joe Moshier lead character designer said they American White Shepherds have really long ears a trait that I tried to caricature in order to allow the animators to emphasize Bolt s expressiveness br The design of Rhino in his plastic ball was based on executive producer John Lasseter s pet chinchilla which was brought to an animators retreat during the film s production br br br Music br br The score to Bolt was composed by John Powell The soundtrack featured the film s

the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes of critics reviews are positive with an average rating of The website s consensus reads Bolt is a pleasant animated comedy that overcomes the story s familiarity with strong visuals and likable characters Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Bolt was a sweet Disney family film but Lasseter s oversight has made it smarter than it otherwise would have been It s not in Pixar s league but it s laced with idiosyncratic characters with pleasantly wacky attitudes That may sound like the obvious thing to do but that doesn t mean anyone else has done it Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter felt the film was a notable step up for Walt Disney Animation Studios although he felt the script needed more of a comedic punch with fuller character quirks and complexities to go along with the enhanced visual dimension Nevertheless Rechtshaffen complimented the vocal performances from Travolta Cyrus and Malcolm McDowell Todd McCarthy reviewing for Variety noted the film was an OK Disney animated entry enhanced by nifty D projection as it bears some telltale signs of Pixar s trademark smarts but still looks like a mutt compared to the younger company s customary purebreds br A O Scott of The New York Times complimented the film as a real movie not a great one perhaps but a more organic and thought out piece of work than the usual animated hodgepodge that lures antsy children and their dutiful parents into the multiplexes It has its sentimental strains but it doesn t push them too hard or resort to the crude pandering humor of say the Shrek franchise Perry Seibert of TV Guide gave the film stars out of and wrote the film amuses both those who make up the film s target audience and the parents along for the ride This winning mix of exciting action heart tugging sentiment and gentle character comedy makes Bolt yet another solid addition to Disney s history of family friendly fare Tasha Robinson of The A V Club gave the film a B stating that Bolt is the studio s first film since Lilo Stitch that feels like it s trying to recapture the old Disney instead of aggressively shedding it in favor of something slick and new And yet it comes with a healthy cutting edge Pixar flavor as well br Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune awarded the film stars out of four writing he personally felt abandoned just watching it It s a seriously withholding action comedy stingy on the wit charm jokes narrative satisfactions and animals with personalities sharp enough for the big screen either in D or D I saw it in D which helped especially with an early massively destructive chase through the streets and freeways of Los Angeles Plus the herky jerky movements in the head and neck region of three credulous pigeons those were funny Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote I did not find Bolt lovable Likable yes and occasionally endearing yet the best parts involve a hamster in a plastic ball The movie dog s confusions are entertaining though they re familiar to anyone who has seen Buzz Lightyear in Pixar s peerless Toy Story films But the spunk of the hamster a corpulent rodent named Rhino is stirring and there s a timeless purity to the spectacle of him scurrying around in his private little sphere br br br Accolades br Bolt was nominated for the following awards br
