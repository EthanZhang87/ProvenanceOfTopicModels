Buckingham Palace UK is a royal residence in London and the administrative headquarters of the monarch of the United Kingdom Located in the City of Westminster the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning br Originally known as Buckingham House the building at the core of today s palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in on a site that had been in private ownership for at least years It was acquired by King George III in as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen s House During the th century it was enlarged by architects John Nash and Edward Blore who constructed three wings around a central courtyard Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in br The last major structural additions were made in the late th and early th centuries including the East Front which contains the balcony on which the royal family traditionally appears to greet crowds A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during the Second World War the King s Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection br The original early th century interior designs many of which survive include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis on the advice of Charles Long King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle poque cream and gold colour scheme Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House The palace has rooms and the garden is the largest private garden in London The state rooms used for official and state entertaining are open to the public each year for most of August and September and on some days in winter and spring br br br History br br br Pre br In the Middle Ages the site of the future palace formed part of the Manor of Ebury also called Eia The marshy ground was watered by the river Tyburn which still flows below the courtyard and south wing of the palace Where the river was fordable at Cow Ford the village of Eye Cross grew Ownership of the site changed hands many times owners included Edward the Confessor and Edith of Wessex in late Saxon times and after the Norman Conquest William the Conqueror William gave the site to Geoffrey de Mandeville who bequeathed it to the monks of Westminster Abbey br In Henry VIII acquired the Hospital of St James which became St James s Palace from Eton College and in he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost years earlier Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the th century By then the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay and the area was mostly wasteland Needing money James VI and I sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a four acre ha mulberry garden for the production of silk This is at the north west corner of today s palace Clement Walker in Anarchia Anglicana refers to new erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S James s this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery Eventually in the late th century the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Hugh Audley by the great heiress Mary Davies br br br First houses on the site br br Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of William Blake around The next owner was George Goring st Earl of Norwich who from extended Blake s house which came to be known as Goring House and developed much of today s garden then known as Goring Great Garden He did not however obtain the freehold interest in the mulberry garden Unbeknown to Goring in the document failed to pass the Great Seal before Charles I fled London which it needed to do for legal execution It was this critical omission that would help the British royal family regain the freehold under George III When the improvident Goring defaulted on his rents Henry Bennet st Earl of Arlington was able to purchase the lease of Goring House and he was occupying it when it burned down in following which he constructed Arlington House on the site the location of the southern wing of today s palace the next year In John Sheffield acquired the lease He later became the first Duke of Buckingham and Normanby Buckingham House was built for Sheffield in to the design of William Winde The style chosen was of a large three floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings It was eventually sold by Buckingham s illegitimate son Charles Sheffield in to George III for Sheffield s leasehold on the mulberry garden site the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family was due to expire in br br br From Queen s House to palace br br Under the new royal ownership the building was originally intended as a private retreat for Queen Charlotte and was accordingly known as The Queen s House Remodelling of the structure began in In an Act of Parliament settled the property on Queen Charlotte in exchange for her rights to nearby Old Somerset House and of her children were born there Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution of While St James s Palace remained the official and ceremonial royal residence the name Buckingham Palace was used from at least br After his accession to the throne in George IV continued the renovation intending to create a small comfortable home However in while the work was in progress the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash The external fa ade was designed keeping in mind the French neoclassical influence preferred by George IV The cost of the renovations grew dramatically and by the extravagance of Nash s designs resulted in his removal as the architect On the death of George IV in his younger brother William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work William never moved into the palace After the Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire in he offered to convert Buckingham Palace into a new Houses of Parliament but his offer was declined br br br Queen Victoria br br Buckingham Palace became the principal royal residence in on the accession of Queen Victoria who was the first monarch to reside there her predecessor William IV had died before its completion While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious It was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down and consequently the palace was often cold Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled and when it was decided to install gas lamps there was a serious worry about the build up of gas on the lower floors It was also said that the staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty Following the Queen s marriage in her husband Prince Albert concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff and with addressing the design faults of the palace By the end of all the problems had been rectified However the builders were to return within a decade br By the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family and a new wing designed by Edward Blore was built by Thomas Cubitt enclosing the central quadrangle The large East Front facing The Mall is today the public face of Buckingham Palace and contains the balcony from which the royal family acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and after the annual Trooping the Colour The ballroom wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period designed by Nash s student James Pennethorne Before Prince Albert s death the palace was frequently the scene of musical entertainments and the most celebrated contemporary musicians entertained at Buckingham Palace The composer Felix Mendelssohn is known to have played there on three occasions Johann Strauss II and his orchestra played there when in England Under Victoria Buckingham Palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls in addition to the usual royal ceremonies investitures and presentations br Widowed in the grief stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at Windsor Castle Balmoral Castle and Osborne House For many years the palace was seldom used even neglected In a note was found pinned to the fence of Buckingham Palace saying These commanding premises to be let or sold in consequence of the late occupant s declining business Eventually public opinion persuaded the Queen to return to London though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible Court functions were still held at Windsor Castle presided over by the sombre Queen habitually dressed in mourning black while Buckingham Palace remained shuttered for most of the year br br br Early th century br br In the new king Edward VII began redecorating the palace The King and his wife Queen Alexandra had always been at the forefront of London high society and their friends known as the Marlborough House Set were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age Buckingham Palace the Ballroom Grand Entrance Marble Hall Grand Staircase vestibules and galleries were redecorated in the Belle poque cream and gold colour scheme they retain today once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but leaving some to feel Edward s heavy redecorations were at odds with Nash s original work br The last major building work took place during the reign of George V when in Aston Webb redesigned Blore s East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni s Lyme Park in Cheshire This new refaced principal fa ade of Portland stone was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria created by sculptor Thomas Brock erected outside the main gates on a surround constructed by architect Aston Webb George V who had succeeded Edward VII in had a more serious personality than his father greater emphasis was now placed on official entertainment and royal duties than on lavish parties He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band the first jazz performance for a head of state Sidney Bechet and Louis Armstrong which earned the palace a nomination in for a Kind of Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom br During the First World War which lasted from until the palace escaped unscathed Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in residence The King imposed rationing at the palace much to the dismay of his guests and household To the King s later regret David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further and ostentatiously lock the wine cellars and refrain from alcohol to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence br George V s wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art both restoring and adding to it Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed such as the pair of marble Empire style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy dating from which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room the huge low room at the centre of the garden fa ade Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room This room feet metres long previously known as the South Drawing Room has a ceiling designed by Nash coffered with huge gilt console brackets In the northwest pavilion designed by Nash as a conservatory was converted into a swimming pool br br br Second World War br br During the Second World War which broke out in the palace was bombed nine times The most serious and publicised incident destroyed the palace chapel in This event was shown in cinemas throughout the United Kingdom to show the common suffering of the rich and poor One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while George VI and Queen Elizabeth the future Queen Mother were in the palace and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed Wartime coverage of such incidents was severely restricted however The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home it was at this time the Queen famously declared I m glad we have been bombed Now I can look the East End in the face The royal family were seen as sharing their subjects hardship as The Sunday Graphic reported br br By the Editor The King and Queen have endured the ordeal which has come to their subjects For the second time a German bomber has tried to bring death and destruction to the home of Their Majesties When this war is over the common danger which King George and Queen Elizabeth have shared with their people will be a cherished memory and an inspiration through the years br On September known as Battle of Britain Day an RAF pilot Ray Holmes of No Squadron RAF rammed a German Dornier Do bomber he believed was going to bomb the palace Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick decision to ram it Holmes bailed out and the aircraft crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station The bomber s engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London The British pilot became a King s Messenger after the war and died at the age of in On VE Day May the palace was the centre of British celebrations The King the Queen Princess Elizabeth the future queen and Princess Margaret appeared on the balcony with the palace s blacked out windows behind them to cheers from a vast crowd in The Mall The damaged palace was carefully restored after the war by John Mowlem Co br br br Mid th century to present day br br Many of the palace s contents are part of the Royal Collection they can on occasion be viewed by the public at the King s Gallery near the Royal Mews The purpose built gallery opened in and displays a changing selection of items from the collection It occupies the site of the chapel that was destroyed in the Second World War The palace was designated a Grade I listed building in Its state rooms have been open to the public during August and September and on some dates throughout the year since The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of Windsor Castle after the fire devastated many of its staterooms In the year to March people visited the palace and visited the gallery In the palace attempted to claim money from the community energy fund to heat Buckingham Palace but the claim was rejected due to fear of public backlash br The palace used to racially segregate staff In Lord Tryon acting as treasurer to Queen Elizabeth II sought to exempt Buckingham Palace from full application of the Race Relations Act He stated that the palace did not hire people of colour for clerical jobs only as domestic servants He arranged with civil servants for an exemption that meant that complaints of racism against the royal household would be sent directly to the Home Secretary and kept out of the legal system br The palace like Windsor Castle is owned by the reigning monarch in right of the Crown Occupied royal palaces are not part of the Crown Estate nor are they the monarch s personal property unlike Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle The Government of the United Kingdom is responsible for maintaining the palace in exchange for the profits made by the Crown Estate In the State Dining Room was closed for a year and a half because its ceiling had become potentially dangerous A year schedule of maintenance work including new plumbing wiring boilers and radiators and the installation of solar panels on the roof has been estimated to cost million and was approved by the prime minister in November It will be funded by a temporary increase in the Sovereign Grant paid from the income of the Crown Estate and is intended to extend the building s working life by at least years In the House of Commons backed funding for the project by votes to br Buckingham Palace is a symbol and home of the British monarchy an art gallery and a tourist attraction Behind the gilded railings and gates that were completed

Belle poque cream and gold colour scheme br br br East wing br br Between and when Blore was building the new east wing the Brighton Pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings As a result many
