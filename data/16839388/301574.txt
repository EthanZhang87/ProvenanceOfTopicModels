as Carlotta Eric s good hearted and gentle maid br Will Ryan as Harold a seahorse who serves as Triton s herald br br br Production br br br Writing br br The Little Mermaid was originally planned as part of one of Walt Disney s earliest feature films a proposed package film featuring vignettes of Hans Christian Andersen tales Development started soon after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in the late s but was delayed due to various circumstances br In Ron Clements became interested in a film adaptation of The Little Mermaid while he was serving as a director on The Great Mouse Detective alongside John Musker Clements discovered the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale while browsing through a bookstore Believing the story provided an ideal basis for an animated feature film and keen on creating a film that took place underwater Clements wrote and presented a two page treatment of The Little Mermaid at Walt Disney Studios to chief Jeffrey Katzenberg at a gong show idea suggestion meeting Katzenberg passed the project over because at that time the studio was in development on a sequel to their live action mermaid comedy Splash and felt The Little Mermaid would be too similar a project The next day however Katzenberg approved of the idea for possible development along with Oliver Company While in production in the s the staff found by chance original story and visual development work done by Kay Nielsen for Disney s proposed s Andersen feature Many of the changes made by the staff in the s to Hans Christian Andersen s original story were coincidentally the same as the changes made by Disney writers in the s br That year Clements and Musker expanded the two page idea into a page rough script eliminating the role of the mermaid s grandmother and expanding the roles of the Merman King and the sea witch However the film s plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Oliver Company as more immediate releases In songwriter Howard Ashman became involved with the writing and development of The Little Mermaid after he was asked to contribute a song to Oliver Company He proposed changing the minor character Clarence the English butler crab to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this At the same time Katzenberg Clements Musker and Ashman revised the story format to make The Little Mermaid a musical with a Broadway style story structure with the song sequences serving as the tentpoles of the film Ashman and composer Alan Menken both noted for their work as the writers of the successful Off Broadway stage musical Little Shop of Horrors teamed up to compose the entire song score In with Oliver Company out of the way The Little Mermaid was slated as the next major Disney release br br br Animation br More money and resources were dedicated to The Little Mermaid than any other Disney animated film in decades Aside from its main animation facility in Glendale California Disney opened a satellite feature animation facility during the production of The Little Mermaid in Lake Buena Vista Florida near Orlando Florida within Disney MGM Studios Theme Park at Walt Disney World Opening in the Disney MGM facility s first projects were to produce an entire Roger Rabbit cartoon short Roller Coaster Rabbit and to contribute ink and paint support to The Little Mermaid Another first for recent years was the filming of live actors and actresses for motion reference material for the animators a practice used frequently for many of the Disney animated features produced under Walt Disney s supervision Sherri Lynn Stoner a former member of Los Angeles Groundlings improvisation comedy group and Joshua Finkel a Broadway actor performed key scenes as Ariel and Eric respectively Jodi Benson had already been cast as Ariel s voice actor by this time and her recorded dialogue was used as playback to guide these live action references Before Benson was cast Melissa Fahn was considered for the part br The Little Mermaid s supervising animators included Glen Keane and Mark Henn on Ariel Duncan Marjoribanks on Sebastian Andreas Deja on King Triton and Ruben Aquino on Ursula Originally Keane had been asked to work on Ursula as he had established a reputation for drawing large powerful figures such as the bear in The Fox and the Hound and Professor Ratigan in The Great Mouse Detective Keane however was assigned as one of the two lead artists on the petite Ariel and oversaw the Part of Your World musical number He jokingly stated that his wife looks exactly like Ariel without the fins The character s body type and personality were based upon those of Alyssa Milano then starring on TV s Who s the Boss and the effect of her hair underwater was based on both footage of Sally Ride when she was in space and scenes of Stoner in a pool for guidance in animating Ariel s swimming Many of Stoner s mannerisms also became part of Ariel s character such as the way she bit her lip or the way she expressed through hand gestures br The underwater setting required the most special effects animation for a Disney animated feature since Fantasia in Effects animation supervisor Mark Dindal estimated that over a million bubbles were drawn for this film in addition to the use of other processes such as airbrushing backlighting superimposition and some computer animation The artistic manpower needed for The Little Mermaid required Disney to farm out most of the underwater bubble effects animation in the film to Pacific Rim Productions a China based firm with production facilities in Beijing An attempt to use Disney s famed multiplane camera for the first time in years for quality depth shots failed because the machine was reputedly in dilapidated condition The multiplane shots three in total were instead photographed at an outside animation camera facility br The Little Mermaid is the last Walt Disney Animation Studios feature film to use the traditional hand painted cel method of animation Disney s next film The Rescuers Down Under used a digital method of coloring and combining scanned drawings developed for Disney by Pixar called CAPS ink paint Computer Animation Production System which would eliminate the need for cels the multiplane camera and many of the optical effects used for the last time in The Little Mermaid Clements and Musker s next film Aladdin also used digital coloring via CAPS A CAPS ink paint prototype was used experimentally on a few scenes in The Little Mermaid and one shot produced using CAPS ink paint the penultimate shot in the film of Ariel and Eric s wedding ship sailing away under a rainbow appears in the finished film Computer generated imagery was used to create some of the wrecked ships in the final battle a staircase behind a shot of Ariel in Eric s castle and the carriage Eric and Ariel are riding in when she bounces it over a ravine These objects were animated using D wireframe models which were plotted as line art to cels and painted traditionally The film being both the only film of the Disney Renaissance and the last in the studio s history overall to use the xerography technology used since with One Hundred and One Dalmatians made it somewhat of a transitional film between the two Disney eras br br br Casting br The design of the villainous Ursula was based upon drag performer Divine An additional early inspiration before Divine was Joan Collins in her role as Alexis Carrington in the television series Dynasty due to a suggestion from Howard Ashman who was a fan of the series Pat Carroll was not Clements and Musker s first choice to voice Ursula the original script had been written with Bea Arthur of the Disney owned TV series The Golden Girls in mind After Arthur turned the part down actresses such as Nancy Marchand Nancy Wilson Roseanne Charlotte Rae Jennifer Saunders and Elaine Stritch were considered for the part Stritch was eventually cast as Ursula but clashed with Howard Ashman s style of music production and was replaced by Carroll Various actors auditioned for additional roles in the film including Jim Carrey for the role of Prince Eric and comedians Bill Maher and Michael Richards for the role of Scuttle br br br Music br br The Little Mermaid was considered by some as the film that brought Broadway into cartoons Alan Menken wrote the Oscar winning score and collaborated with Howard Ashman on the songs One of the film s most prominent songs Part of Your World was nearly cut from the film when it seemingly tested poorly with children who became rowdy during the scene This caused Jeffrey Katzenberg to feel that the song needed to be cut an idea that was resisted by Musker Clements and Keane Both Musker and Clements cited the similar situation of the song Over the Rainbow nearly being cut from s The Wizard of Oz when it was appealing to Katzenberg Keane pushed for the song to remain until the film was in a more finalized state During a second test screening the scene now colorized and further developed tested well with a separate child audience and the musical number was kept br br br Release br The film was originally released on November followed by a re release on November After the success of the D re release of The Lion King Disney announced a D re release of The Little Mermaid scheduled for September but this was cancelled on January due to the under performances of other Disney D re releases until further notice The D version was released on Blu ray instead but it did play a limited engagement at the El Capitan Theatre from September to October On September The Little Mermaid began playing in select theaters where audiences could bring iPads and use an app called Second Screen Live AMC Theatres screened the movie from September The film was also screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival br br br Home media br In a then atypical and controversial move for a new Disney animated film The Little Mermaid was released as part of the Walt Disney Classics line of VHS LaserDisc Betamax and Video home media releases on May six months after the release of the film Before The Little Mermaid only a select number of Disney s catalog animated films had been released to home media as the company was afraid of upsetting its profitable practice of theatrically reissuing each film every few years The Little Mermaid became that year s top selling title on home video with over million units sold including million in its first month and million units by October The home video release along with box office and merchandise sales contributed to The Little Mermaid generating a total revenue of billion This success led to future Disney animated films being released on home video soon after the end of their theatrical runs rather than delayed for several years making The Little Mermaid the first Disney animated feature to be released on home video year after its theatrical release br Following The Little Mermaid s November re release in theaters a new VHS version was released on March as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection and included a bonus music video of Jodi Benson singing Part of Your World during the end credits replacing Under the Sea as the end credits song The VHS sold million units and ranked as the third best selling video of the year br The Little Mermaid was released in a bare bones Walt Disney Limited Issue DVD on December with a standard video transfer The film was re released

Live presentations br In June Disney held special presentations of the film at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles titled The Little Mermaid in Concert The performances combined a screening of The Little Mermaid with live accompaniment by guest musicians and celebrities including Sara Bareilles who performed as Ariel Tituss Burgess who performed as Sebastian as a reprisal of his role in the stage adaptation Darren Criss who performed as Prince Eric Rebel Wilson who performed as Ursula Joshua Colley who performed as Flounder John Stamos who performed as Chef Louis and Norm Lewis who performed as King Triton as a reprisal of his role in the stage adaptation The four additional songs written for the stage adaptation were also incorporated into the presentation accompanied by scenes

Joshua Turchin singing She s in Love from the Broadway adaptation The Little Mermaid br br br Reception br br br Box office br Early in the production of The Little Mermaid Jeffrey Katzenberg cautioned Clements Musker and their staff telling them that since The Little Mermaid was a girl s film it would make less money at the box office than Oliver Company which had been Disney s biggest animated box office success in a decade However by the time the film was closer to completion Katzenberg was convinced The Little Mermaid would be a hit and the first animated feature to earn more than million in its initial run and become a blockbuster film br During its original theatrical release The Little Mermaid made million in its opening weekend ranking in third place behind Harlem Nights and Look Who s Talking Throughout this run it earned million at the North American box office falling short of Katzenberg s expectations but earning more than Oliver Company and becoming the animated film with the highest gross from its initial run The film was theatrically reissued on November on the same day as Anastasia a Don Bluth animated feature for Fox Animation Studios For this

inventive animated fantasy a movie that s so creative and so much fun it deserves comparison with the best Disney work of the past Ebert also commented positively on the character of Ariel stating she is a fully realized female character who thinks and acts independently even rebelliously instead of hanging around passively while the fates decide her destiny Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune wrote While the story won t win any prizes from the women s liberation movement the animation is so full and colorful and the songs so beguiling that this is a case of where someone made one like they used to The drawing of the evil octopus witch who is jealous of the mermaid s singing voice is particularly outstanding Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the film as a marvel of skillful animation witty songwriting and smart planning It is designed to delight filmgoers of every conceivable stripe Adults will be charmed by the film s bright outstandingly pretty look and by its robust score Small children will be enchanted by the film s sunniness and by its perfect simplicity br Variety magazine praised the film for its cast of characters Ursula in particular as well as its animation stating that the animation proves lush and fluid augmented by the use of shadow and light as elements like fire sun and water illuminate the characters They also praised the musical collaboration between Howard Ashman and Alan Menken whose songs frequently begin slowly but build in cleverness and intensity During the film s re release Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a mixed review referring to it as a likably unspectacular adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen classic br The staff of TV Guide wrote a positive review praising the film s return to the traditional Disney musical as well as the film s animation Yet they also wrote that the film is detracted from by the juvenile humor and the human characters eyes While still giving a positive review they stated that the film can t compare to the real Disney classics which appealed equally to both kids and adults Todd Gilchrist of IGN wrote a positive review of the film stating that the film is an almost perfect achievement Gilchrist also praised how the film revived interest in animation as it was released at a time when interest in animation was at a lull Empire gave a positive review of the film stating that The Little Mermaid is a charmer of a movie boasting all the ingredients that make a Disney experience something to treasure yet free of all the politically correct formulaic elements that have bogged down the more recent productions br In April years after the film s initial release in Yahoo users voted The Little Mermaid as No on the top animated films of all time In June that same year the film remained on the list but dropped six slots to end at Only three other traditionally animated Disney animated films Aladdin Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King respectively scored above it in the poll even after the update In Richard Corliss of Time magazine named it one of The All TIME Best Animated Films br br br Accolades br The film earned three Academy Award nominations making it the first Disney animated film to earn nominations since The Rescuers in br Bolstered by the film s success and the soundtrack s award wins it was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in September for shipments of two million copies of the soundtrack album an unheard of feat for an animated film at the time To date the soundtrack has been certified six times platinum br br br Legacy br br br Importance br The Little Mermaid which was Disney s first animated fairy tale since Sleeping Beauty is an important film in animation history for many reasons It was instrumental in re establishing feature length animation as a profitable venture for the Walt Disney Company as the company s theme parks television productions and live action features had overshadowed the animated output since the s The Little Mermaid was the second film following Oliver Company produced after Disney began expanding its animated output following its successful live action animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit and became Disney s first animated major box office and critical hit since The Jungle Book years earlier Walt Disney Feature Animation was further expanded as a result of The Little Mermaid and increasingly successful follow ups Beauty and the Beast Aladdin and The Lion King The staff increased from members in to in spread across three studios in Burbank California Lake Buena Vista Florida and Montreuil Seine Saint Denis France br In addition The Little Mermaid signaled the re establishment of the musical film format as a standard for Disney animated films The majority of Disney s most popular animated films from the s on had been musicals though by the s and s the role of music had been de emphasized in the films s Oliver Company had served as a test of sorts to the success of the musical format before Disney committed to the Broadway style structure of The Little Mermaid br In the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally historically or aesthetically significant br br br Controversy and criticism br Dr Michael Landis a history teacher at State University of New York Ulster writing for Smithsonian Magazine in says the film sent important messages about identity to its young audiences including topics of gay rights the central character Ariel feels constrained by her patriarchal society and is in the closet gender fluidity and body image issues Ariel turns to the only strong female in the entire film and thus Ariel s only female role model the villain Ursula who was based on famous drag queen Divine herself closely associated with gay filmmaker John Waters Landis invokes Laura Sells and her argument that Ariel learns from Ursula that gender is not a natural category but a performed construct He adds In short Ursula represents feminism the fluidity of gender and young Ariel s empowerment Ariel can be anything she wants yet she chooses the role of young bride and human conformity To ensure Ariel s transition to domesticity the men of her life murder Ursula with a conveniently phallic symbol according to Patrick D Murphy or as Sells puts it the ritual slaughtering of the archetypal evil feminine character Either way the movie implicitly offers a dark and disturbing message about the limits of American society in the late s br In an all male Princeton a capella choir the Tigertones was criticized for using the song Kiss the Girl and in particular the way their performance played into the lyrics The film depicts a mute female character in a romantic setting with a male character while the lyrics encourage him to kiss her The Tigertones would bring on stage two unsuspecting members of the audience one man and one woman and encouraged them to kiss Critics have raised issues of informed consent being at stake as well as toxic masculinity Comparisons were also drawn to other Disney animated films that provoked similar arguments such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs wherein the prince kisses an unconscious Snow White Some Princeton students told The New York Times that the lyrics were not troubling but the Tigertones choosing people at random was br Also in actor Keira Knightley said she would not permit her year old to watch Disney films including Cinderella and The Little Mermaid saying This is the one that I m quite annoyed about because I really like the film but Little Mermaid I mean the songs are great but do not give your voice up for a man Hello br br Actor comedian and writer Mindy Kaling expressed similar sentiments The Little Mermaid is a little problematic to me I love the songs I love the crab Ursula the Sea Witch is a great character but it bums me out looking back on it because she gave up her voice and left her family and friends in pursuit of a man And she s years old When my daughter and I watch it together and she gets older I ll still let her watch it but I ll have to do the running commentary of like You don t have to be mute to attract a man and get all your dreams to come true It s fine The people in your life who are your enemies are not just an older woman who s jealous of your beauty The ultimate dream in life is not to become married to a white prince br In May while reviewing the live action adaptation Film writer Vanessa Armstrong admitted to not being a fan of the original film lambasting the romance saying in full There are aspects of it I do enjoy specifically the soundtrack scored by Alan Menken with songs by Menken and Howard Ashman but the story surrounding Ariel and Prince Eric s romance hasn t aged well At all So much so in fact that when my toddler asks to watch the merfmaid Ariel s Undersea Adventure attraction at Disney California Adventure introduced her to the Disney version of the tale I turn on the direct to video prequel released in The Little Mermaid Ariel s Beginning Does the movie hold a flame to the first film It does not But even though the mom dies in Ariel s Beginning it s still Disney after all it doesn t send the message to my daughter that girls should sacrifice parts of themselves to be with someone much less someone you just met where the only connection you share is that you both think the other is attractive br br br Theme parks br Ariel is a meet and greet character appearing at Disney theme parks
