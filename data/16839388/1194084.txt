everyone to run for their lives This sends the town into a panic Eventually the Head of the Fire Department calms down enough to ask him what is going on He explains that the sky is falling because a piece of it had fallen on his head when he was sitting under the big oak tree in the town square however he cannot find the piece His father Buck Ace Cluck who was once a high school baseball star assumes that it was just an acorn that had fallen off the tree and had hit him on the head making Chicken Little the laughingstock of the town br A year later Chicken Little has become infamous in the town for being prone to ruin everything accidentally His only friends are other outcasts Abby Mallard nicknamed Ugly Duckling Runt a cowardly pig and Fish Out of Water who wears a helmet full of tap water Chicken Little joins his school s baseball team to recover his reputation and his father s pride but is made last until the ninth inning of the last game He hits the ball and makes it past first second and third bases but is met at home plate by the outfielders He tries sliding onto the home plate but is touched by the ball While it is presumed he lost the game the umpire brushes away the dust to reveal Chicken Little s foot is touching home plate thus declaring him safe and the game won Chicken Little is hailed as a hero for winning the pennant br Later that night back at home Chicken Little is hit on the head yet again by the same piece of the sky only to find out that it is not that but rather a panel that blends into the background which would thereby explain why Chicken Little could not find it last time He calls his friends over to help figure out what it is br When Fish pushes a button on the back of the hexagon it flies into the sky taking him with it It turns out to be part of the camouflage of an invisible UFO piloted by two aliens Chicken Little Abby and Runt rescue Fish and discover that the aliens are heading to Earth The two aliens attack the group chasing them through a cornfield They rush back to the school where Chicken Little rings the bell to warn everyone but the aliens escape leaving an orange alien child behind No one believes the story of the alien invasion and Chicken Little s reputation is thus ruined The next morning he and his friends discover the orange alien named Kirby and minutes later a fleet of alien ships descend on the town and start what appears to be an invasion The invasion however is actually a misunderstanding as the two aliens are looking for their lost child and attack only out of concern As the aliens rampage throughout Oakey Oaks supposedly vaporizing everything in their path Chicken Little realizes he must return Kirby to his parents to save the planet br In the invasion Buck now regaining his pride and trust in his son defends him from the aliens until they get vaporized The aliens however are not actually vaporizing people but teleporting them aboard the UFO It turns out the aliens were touring Earth and came across the town for its acorns Their ship has broken camo panels that fell and hit Chicken Little on the head After everything is explained the apologetic aliens return everything to normal and

Warburton as Alien Cop br Adam West as Ace Hollywood Chicken Little br Harry Shearer as Don Bowowser br br br Production br br br Writing br In September director Mark Dindal developed the idea for Chicken Little with its title character envisioned as a paranoid female chicken with the voice of Holly Hunter that went to summer camp to reduce her anxiety as well as repair her relationship with her father At the summer camp she would uncover a nefarious plot that her camp counselor who was to be voiced by Penn Jillette was planning against her hometown Dindal would later pitch his idea to Michael Eisner who suggested it would be better to change Chicken Little into a male because as Dindal recalled if you re a boy and you re short you get picked on However Dindal later clarified that the decision was made in part due to market research at the time stating I remember being told Girls will go see a movie with a boy protagonist but boys won t see a movie with a girl protagonist That was the wisdom at the time until Frozen comes out and makes billion br In January when David Stainton became Disney s new president of Walt Disney Feature Animation he decided the story needed a different approach He told the director the script had to be revised and during the next three months it was rewritten into a tale of a boy trying to save his town from space aliens br During the rewriting process Dindal along with three credited writers and nine others threw out twenty five scenes to improve the character development and add more emotional resonance with the parent child relationship Dindal stated that It took us about years to pretty much get back to where we started But in the course of that the story got stronger more emotional and Amazing too br br br Casting br When originally envisioned as a female character Holly Hunter provided the voice for the title character for eight months until it was decided for Chicken Little to be a male Michael J Fox Matthew Broderick and David Spade were originally considered for the role Against forty actors competing for the title role Zach Braff auditioned where Dindal noted he pitched his voice slightly to sound like a junior high kid Right there that was really unique and then he had such great energy br In April Variety reported that Sean Hayes was to voice a character named the Ugly Duckling but the character was rewritten into a female Now conceived as Abby Mallard Hunter Jamie Lee Curtis Sarah Jessica Parker Jodie Foster Geena Davis and Madonna were considered but Joan Cusack won the role for her natural comedy In December it was announced Braff and Cusack were cast along with other cast members including Steve Zahn Amy Sedaris Don Knotts Katie Finneran and Garry Marshall br Marshall was asked to provide a voice for Kingdom of the Sun which was re conceived into The Emperor s New Groove and directed by Dindal but was removed from the project for being too New York When he was approached to provide the voice for Buck Cluck Marshall claimed I said I don t do voices You want a chicken that talks like me fine So they hired me and they didn t fire me and it was like a closure on animation br Australian comedian Mark Mitchell was hired to dub the voice of Buck Cluck for the Australian release of the film as a decision by Disney to get a national celebrity to publicize the film br br br Animation br To visualize this story Disney selected percent of its D animation staff to put them in a CGI animation team and placed them through a rigorous eighteen month training program with George Lucas Industrial Light and Magic which included an introductory to Alias s Maya that would serve as the main D animation software used on the project This was due to Disney CEO Michael Eisner announcing that the studio would move to computer animation in response to a downturn caused by rising competition from Pixar and DreamWorks Animation computer animated features as well as the unsatisfactory box office performances of The Emperor s New Groove Atlantis The Lost Empire Treasure Planet and Home on the Range As some of the animators had worked on Dinosaur which used live action backgrounds the animation team took inspiration for its staging coloring and theatrical lighting from Mary Blair s background designs featured in Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan br For the aesthetics in the background designs the background layout artists sparingly use digital matte paintings to render out the naturalistic elements including the trees and the baseball diamond but they were retouched using Adobe Photoshop as background cards featured in the film The lighting department would utilize the Lumiere software to enhance virtual lighting for the shading form and depth and geometric rendering for the characters shadows as well as use real lighting to create cucaloris br For the characters designs and animation style Dindal sought to capture the roundness as seen in the Disney animated works from the s to s by which the characters fluidity of motion was inspired from the Goofy cartoon How to Play Baseball Under visual effects supervisor Steve Goldberg who spearheaded the department the Maya software included the software program Shelf Control that provided an outline of characters that can be viewed on screen and provided a direct link to the controls for specific autonomy as well as new electronic tablet screens were produced that allowed for the artists to draw digital sketches of the characters to rough out their movements which was then transferred to the D characters br All of the characters were constructed using geometric polygons For the title character there were approximately fourteen to fifteen character designs before settling the design composed of an ovular egghead shape with oversized glasses The final character was constructed of polygons muscles and more than individual feathers of which are placed on his head br Following the casting of Braff supervising animator Jason Ryan adapted Braff s facial features during recording sessions to better combine the dorkiness and adorability the filmmakers desired He s got this really appealing face and eye expressions Ryan said adding that he was amazed by Braff s natural vocal abilities Next the animators would utilize the software program Chicken Wire where digital wire deformers were provided for the animators to manipulate the basic geometric shapes to get their desired facial features Lastly a software development team constructed XGen a computer software program for grooming fur feathers and generating leaves br br br Release br The film was originally scheduled for release on July but on December its release date was pushed back to November the release date that was originally slated for Disney Pixar s Cars The release date change was also the day before DreamWorks Animation changed the release date of Shrek the Third from November to May Cars was later released on June br At the time of the release of Chicken Little the co production deal between Disney and Pixar was set to expire with the release of Cars in The result of the contentious negotiations between Disney and Pixar was viewed to depend heavily on how Chicken Little performed at the box office If successful the film would have given Disney leverage in its negotiations for a new contract to distribute Pixar s films A failure would have allowed Pixar to argue that Disney could not produce CGI films br On October the film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre with the cast and filmmakers as attendees which was followed with a ballroom bash at the Hollywood and Highland Center Along with its standard theatrical release the film was the first Disney in house release to be rendered in Disney Digital D that was produced by Industrial Light Magic and exhibited via Dolby Digital Cinema servers at approximately selected theaters in twenty five top markets To describe the process Dindal remembers that it was a last minute decision as it was suggested just months before its release For the D conversion Dindal had a specific way he wanted the film to look he wanted it to feel like a moving View Master As he puts it br br When I was a kid and I was really taken with something my first thought was Oh I want to step into that They felt like a window that you could step in I remember showing those and saying Can you make it look like this What is it about this that feels more D than most D films film like that br br br Marketing br The first trailer was released online in early It was also attached to the DVD release of Brother Bear Accompanied with the theatrical release Disney Consumer Products released a series of plush items toys activity sets keepsakes and apparel br br br

that the company had been facing since during which time it released several films that underperformed most notably Fantasia Atlantis The Lost Empire Treasure Planet and Home on the Range br br br Critical response br Rotten Tomatoes reports that of surveyed critics gave positive reviews the average score is The critical consensus states Disney expends more effort in the technical presentation than in crafting an original storyline Metacritic gave the film an average score of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br James Berardinelli writing his review for ReelViews gave the film two and a half stars out of four stating that It is bogged down by many of the problems that have plagued Disney s recent traditional animated features anonymous voice work poor plot structure and the mistaken belief that the Disney brand will elevate anything to a must see level for viewers starved for family friendly fare On the syndicated television program Ebert Roeper critics Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert gave the film Two Thumbs Down with the former saying I don t care whether the film is D D CGI or hand drawn it all goes back to the story br In his print review featured in the Chicago Sun Times Roger Ebert stated the problem was the story and wrote As a general rule if a movie is not about baseball or space aliens and you have to use them anyway you should have started with a better premise Ebert concluded his review with The movie did make me smile It didn t make me laugh and it didn t involve my emotions or the higher regions of my intellect for that matter It s a perfectly acceptable feature cartoon for kids up to a certain age but it doesn t have the universal appeal of some of the best recent animation br Writing in The New York Times film critic A O Scott stated the film is a hectic uninspired pastiche of catchphrases and clich s with very little wit inspiration or originality to bring its frantically moving images to genuine life Entertainment Weekly film reviewer Lisa Schwarzbaum who graded the film a C wrote that the banality of the acorns dropped in this particular endeavor another in a new breed of mass market comedy that substitutes self reference for original wit and pop songs for emotional content br However Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film a positive review saying the film was shiny and peppy with some solid laughs and dandy vocal performances Olly Richards of Empire gave the film a three out of five stars saying Beyond a cheeky twisty bit of genre tinkering there s more here for the under tens than over but it s still charming amusing and energetic enough to win you over br Angel Cohn of TV Guide gave the film three stars alluding the film that would delight younger children with its bright colors and constant chaos while adults are likely to be charmed by the witty banter subtle one liners and a sweet father son relationship Peter Rainer writing in The Christian Science Monitor graded the film with an A applauding that the visuals are irrepressibly witty and so is the script which morphs from the classic fable into a spoof on War of the Worlds I prefer this version to Spielberg s br Plugged In wrote A postscript for parents A single mistake defines Chicken Little and he spends the rest of his life trying to live it down As he puts it One moment destroyed my life Later another single moment his home run redefines him as a hero to his friends and his dad who says I guess that puts the whole sky is falling incident behind us once and for all Insecure and observant young viewers may latch on to this kind of oversimplification and use it as license to magnify the significance of their own bumblings whatever they might be Common Sense Media gave the film a three out of five stars writing Cute sometimes frantic movie has peril potential scares br Dindal would express regret over the final version of the film br br I think Oh that early version Then I m reconnected with what I m thinking at the time And you re thinking how that version would have turned out If we had stuck with that instead of this If we had pushed Eisner and said It has to be a girl it could have been killed With this I wish I could see an alternate reality what that would have been like br br br Accolades br At the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards this film won the award for Worst Animated Film At the rd Annie Awards it received four nominations for Best Animated Feature Best Animated Effects Best Character Design and Best Production Design losing all to Wallace Gromit The Curse of the Were Rabbit At the Kids Choice Awards it was nominated for Favorite Animated Movie but lost to Madagascar br br br

II debuted before the film in Japan with the character s inclusion serving as a promotion for the then upcoming movie br br br Cancelled franchise br Disneytoon Studios originally planned to make a direct to video sequel to Chicken Little tentatively titled Chicken Little The Ugly Duckling Story Directed by Klay Hall the story would have involved Chicken Little getting into a love triangle between Abby Mallard and a beautiful newcomer Raffaela a French sheep Being at a great disadvantage Abby would go to great lengths to give herself a makeover According to Tod Carter a story artist on the film early screenings of the story reel were very well received prompting Disney to consider increasing the production budget to match the quality of the story Soon after when John Lasseter became Walt Disney Animation Studios new chief creative officer he cancelled all sequels that were in development at Disneytoon including Chicken Little Meet the Robinsons First Date and a sequel to The Aristocats and ordered the studio to shift its focus towards spin off films and original productions According to Carter this was a reaction to the sales figures for current projects and the overall market adding The executives didn t feel that the original film had a wide enough market to draw upon to support the sequel br br br See also br List of films featuring fictional films br br br br br
