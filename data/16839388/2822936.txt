A soundtrack album is any album that incorporates music directly recorded from the soundtrack of a particular feature film or television show The first such album to be commercially released was Walt Disney s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs the soundtrack to the film of the same name in The first soundtrack album of a film s orchestral score was that for Alexander Korda s film Rudyard Kipling s Jungle Book composed by Mikl s R zsa br br br Overview br When a feature film is released or during and after a television series airs an album in the form of a soundtrack is frequently released alongside it br A soundtrack typically contains instrumentation or alternatively a film score But it can also feature songs that were sung or performed by characters in a scene or a cover version of a song in the media rerecorded by a popular artist songs that were used as intentional or unintentional background music in important scenes songs that were heard in the closing credits or songs for no apparent reason related to the media other than for promotion that were included in a soundtrack Before home video became widespread in the s many soundtrack albums would also feature snippets of dialogue as this was one of the few ways to re experience a film after its original release apart from television broadcasts or theatrical reissues br Soundtracks are usually released on major record labels just as if they were released by a musical artist and the songs and the soundtrack itself can also be on music charts and win musical awards br By convention a soundtrack record can contain any kind of music including music inspired by but not actually appearing in the movie the score contains only music by the original film s composers br Contemporaneously a soundtrack can go against normality most typically used in popular culture franchises and contains recently released or exclusive never before released original pop music selections some of which become high charting records on their own which due to being released on another franchises title peaked because of that and is simply used for promotional purposes for well known artists or new or unknown artists These soundtracks contain music not at all heard in the film television series and any artistic or lyrical connection is purely coincidental br However depending on the genre of the media the soundtrack of popular songs would have a set pattern a lighthearted romance might feature easy listening love songs whilst a more dark thriller would compose of hard rock or urban music br In Camille Saint Sa ns composed the first music specifically for use in a motion picture L assasinat du duc de Guise and releasing recordings of songs used in films became prevalent in the s Henry Mancini who won an Emmy Award and two Grammys for his soundtrack to Peter Gunn was the first composer to have a widespread hit with a song from a soundtrack br Before the s soundtracks with a few exceptions accompanied towards musicals and was an album that featured vocal and instrumental and instrumental versions of vocal songs musical selections performed by cast members Or cover versions of songs sung by another artist br After the s soundtracks started to include more diversity and music consumers would anticipate a motion picture or television soundtrack Many top charting songs were featured or released on a film or television soundtrack album br Nowadays the term soundtrack sort of subsided It now mostly commonly refers to instrumental background music used in that media Popular songs featured in a film or television series are instead highlighted and referenced in the credits not a part of a soundtrack br In advertisements or store listings soundtrack albums are sometimes confused with original cast albums These are albums made with the original stage cast of a musical and are recorded by the cast either in live performance or in a studio not transferred from a movie soundtrack br In some cases recorded dialogue may be incorporated into the soundtrack album This comes in two kinds audio clips from the movie itself used on the albums for Pulp Fiction and Apollo for example or radio dramas that involve the characters from the movie involved in other events example King of Pirates from FLCL The unusual first soundtrack album of the film The Wizard of Oz issued in in conjunction with the film s first telecast was virtually a condensed version of the film with enough dialogue on the album for the listener to be able to easily follow the plot as was the first soundtrack album of the Romeo and Juliet and the soundtrack albums of The Taming of the Shrew version Cromwell and Little Big Man In the case of Patton the bulk of the album featured the film s musical score while the opening and final tracks featured George C Scott s opening and closing speeches from the movie The highly unusual soundtrack album of the mystery film Sleuth was designed as a sort of teaser with Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine s voices heard for the first three minutes after which the dialogue was abruptly cut off and the musical score of the film took over forcing listeners to see the film if they wished to know what the mystery was all about br In a few rare instances the complete soundtrack for a film dialogue music sound effects etc has been released One notable example was a LP set of the Rankin Bass film The Hobbit Because this particular film was produced for television it lent itself well to the LP format built in commercial insert points were used to end each LP side thus avoiding any additional editing Another example was the above mentioned Zeffirelli Romeo and Juliet the movie proved so popular that two years after the film s original release an album set of the complete soundtrack was released Still another example was the Laurence Olivier Richard III the soundtrack of which was released as a LP album by RCA Victor in br br br Extra tracks br Sometimes tracks not in the movie are included in the album especially on a CD release of the soundtrack as opposed to an LP Some of these may be outtakes songs or instrumental music recorded for use in the movie but cut in the final edit as released or they may have been used in trailers but not in the movie itself Examples include the South Park Bigger Longer Uncut soundtrack Two other well known examples are the soundtrack albums to Rodgers and Hammerstein s Carousel and The King and I both of which include two or more songs not heard in the finished film br br br Popularity in cultures br br Soundtrack albums account for the bulk of the Indian music industry Music from the Indian film industry particularly the music of Bollywood usually sells more than Indian pop records br br br Lists br
