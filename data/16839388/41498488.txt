years after competing in the World Grand Prix Lightning McQueen now a five time Piston Cup champion finds himself overshadowed by Jackson Storm a rookie who is the first of a new generation of race cars called next gens that are equipped with advanced technology to improve their speed and performance As Storm goes on a winning streak throughout the season most of the veterans either retire or are dismissed by their sponsors in favor of younger next gen racers In the final race of the season at Los Angeles Lightning briefly gains first place but starts falling behind after being overtaken by Storm He desperately tries to keep up but in doing so loses control and suffers a rollover crash after hitting the outside wall leaving him severely injured and unable to race while Storm goes on to win the Piston Cup br Four months later Lightning who has since recovered from his crash decides that he will continue racing and calls his sponsors Rusty and Dusty who reveal they have sold Rust eze to a wealthy businesscar named Sterling Sterling assigns Lightning to train at the Rust eze Racing Center under Cruz Ramirez where he struggles to adapt to modern training methods After Lightning accidentally damages a simulator Sterling tries to force him to retire Adamant that he can still race Lightning instead offers that if he wins the upcoming Florida he can decide if he wants to keep racing otherwise he will retire immediately Sterling reluctantly accepts the deal on the condition that Cruz will have to go with him br Cruz s unconventional training methods and lack of real world racing experience frustrate Lightning as they attempt to record his top speed at Fireball Beach When Lightning decides to train at the Thunder Hollow Speedway they realize it is being used for a figure style demolition derby called the Crazy Eights and are forced to participate in which Cruz inadvertently wins Lightning angerly yells at Cruz after the demolition derby and accidentally breaks her trophy Cruz reveals that she had always wanted to be a racer but was never confident enough to enter a race so she resigns as Lightning s trainer and heads back to the racing center Ashamed and without other options Lightning calls his friend Mater for advice who suggests that Lightning track down Doc Hudson s mentor and crew chief Smokey in his hometown of Thomasville Georgia so Lightning catches up to Cruz and convinces her to rejoin him In Thomasville they meet up with Smokey who reveals that even though Doc never raced again he found new happiness in training Lightning After Lightning accepts that he is an older car and will never be as fast as Storm Smokey and Doc s old friends Louise Barnstormer Nash River Scott and Junior Midnight Moon help him learn new tricks to overcome his speed disadvantage using Cruz as his sparring partner After many attempts Lightning finally manages to pass Cruz during the final practice race at Thomasville Speedway However Cruz suddenly overtakes Lightning which causes him to remember being passed by Storm before his accident shaking his confidence br At the Florida Lightning starts at the back but with assistance from Smokey in the pits manages to gradually push up the ranks Sterling who still believes that Lightning cannot win orders Cruz back to the training center to prepare a rookie for the following race despite her wanting to stay Overhearing the exchange on his radio and remembering Cruz s dream of racing Lightning avoids a massive multi car pile up and has his crew outfit Cruz to take his place in the race giving her a second chance to become a race car While shaky at first Cruz slowly starts overtaking one car after another thanks to Lightning coaching her from the pits She eventually ends up right behind Storm Feeling threatened Storm tries to intimidate Cruz and even rams her against the wall in the final lap Using one of Doc Hudson s old moves Cruz flips over Storm overtaking him and wins the race br As Cruz celebrates her victory Sterling offers her a role on his team but she instead takes a counteroffer from Dinoco s owner Tex Dinoco Since Lightning and Cruz were both wearing Lightning becomes the joint winner of the race and effectively passes his deal with Sterling Returning to Radiator Springs Lightning reveals that Tex has bought Rust eze from Sterling Now decked in

John Lasseter who had directed the previous Cars films stated that the film would have a very emotional story similar in tone to the first film Co writer Kiel Murray who also co wrote the original Cars said of the return to the series roots With these franchises you always want to know who it s about The first movie was about McQueen and the second movie was a sort of off ramp to the Mater story We wanted to get back to the McQueen story When we looked at what would be next for him we wondered what that would be like both as an athlete and also for what he was dealing with in the rest of his life br According to director Brian Fee the production team did a lot of research and while they looked at athletes in other sports the team mainly focused on NASCAR racers Fee said that they even talked to a sports psychoanalyst who explained that many of these drivers can t imagine themselves doing anything else an idea that resonated with the team Mike Rich said that rookies taking over the sport is a kind of endless story in sports and compared McQueen to Wayne Gretzky and Misty May Treanor as well as many others Fee said that being a parent became his main resource to find and understand the emotion in the film s storyline Scott Morse the film s story supervisor said that he wanted to highlight the film s emotional core and the character s relationships wanting the film to feel like a sports film while also focusing on McQueen realizing what their relationship meant to Doc br On January it was announced that Armie Hammer and Cristela Alonzo would voice Jackson Storm and

scenes like the demolition derby race possible The system was previously used in Finding Dory In previous Pixar films the animators had to do the animation first before the rendering but RIS allowed animation and rendering to take place simultaneously in a process called hardware shading making it much easier for the animators to see what a completed scene would look like when finished br Fee said that the film s animation is art directed realism and stated that it causes the film s characters and sets to feel more real and alive than ever before while Bill Cone the film s production designer said that The term they use is believability which is the basis for everything Pixar does Global technology supervisor Sudeep Rangaswamy said that his team used an automatic process for the film s shots which in his words allows a lot of flexibility and that It made shots that were previously impossible to render possible Director of photography camera Jeremy Lasky and editor Jason Hudak researched NASCAR footage for the film s race scenes br br br Music br br Fee said that both the score and the soundtrack really help support the story we are telling Both the soundtrack and the score

said that the filmmakers showed him the story and some dialogue from which he pieced together a story for the song The soundtrack also features Ride an original song performed by ZZ Ward featuring Gary Clark Jr which was released as a single on April br The film s score was composed by Pixar s frequent collaborator Randy Newman who previously composed the first film s score Tom MacDougall Disney s executive vice president of music said that Newman has a real connection to the Cars world and that His ability to capture the feelings on this film its characters locations and the Americana theme throughout is extraordinary the music is so naturally fluid and inspired It really feels like Randy is coming home with this score Newman quoted tracks from the first film in moments where Fee

grade of A on an A to F scale br The film was praised for its animation story and emotional depth and it was considered an improvement over its predecessor by many critics Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote Cars is a friendly rollicking movie made with warmth and dash and to the extent that it taps our primal affection for this series it more than gets the job done Yet in many ways it s the tasteful version of a straight to DVD or streaming sequel David Fear of Rolling Stone gave the film a positive review saying There s an emotional resonance to this story about growing old chasing glory days and the joy of passing the baton that leaves the other two films choking on its digitally rendered dust The end goal this time out isn t just to sell a few more toys and Lightning McQueen lunchboxes It s actually tapping into something deeper than a corporate bottom line Mike Ryan of Uproxx called the film the Rocky III of the Cars franchise and wrote There s a hint of sadness that seems to be present throughout Cars that gives it a little more weight than the previous installments br Alonso Duralde of TheWrap gave the film a mixed review saying As a spawner of merchandise Cars fires on all pistons but as a movie it s a harmless but never stimulating minutes Vicky Roach of News com au gave the film out of stars saying Returning to the iconic backroads nostalgia of the
