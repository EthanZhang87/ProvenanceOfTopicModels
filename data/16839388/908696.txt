The Gulfstream V Model GV pronounced G five is a long range large business jet aircraft produced by Gulfstream Aerospace derived from the previous Gulfstream IV It flies up to Mach kn km h up to feet m and has a nmi km range It typically accommodates four crew and passengers It first flew on November and entered service in June It is used by the US military under the designation C A It is followed by an improved version the Gulfstream Model GV SP br br br Development br br In the early s the Gulfstream V GV was developed as a response to the Bombardier Global Express br It was certified on April br Capable of flying up to nmi km it rolled out in and was Gulfstream s first ultra long range business jet Total production of the Gulfstream V was aircraft br By Gulfstream GVs were trading at million br By a GV was worth around million below million for a fixer to up to million for a late model low time aircraft br br br Design br Compared to the Gulfstream IV the engines are changed from Rolls Royce Tay to Rolls Royce BR A with increased thrust higher bypass ratio and Full Authority Digital Engine Controls FADEC Operating ceiling is increased from to ft to m It has thrust reversers and composite flight control surfaces The horizontal tail area is larger wingspan is increased from to ft to m the fuselage is lengthened by ft m forward of the main entry door and by ft m aft of the wing Maximum takeoff and landing weights are increased by br It has a new semi supercritical wing for a fuel capacity of lb t more than the G IV br The three zone cabin is similar to the G IV smaller than the Global Express while its dispatch reliability cabin noise and fuel efficiency compare favourably against its competitors of the same era br Compared to the comparably priced Global Express the GV offers more range and is more fuel efficient while the Bombardier offers better runway performance a larger cabin and a softer ride br BR overhaul comes at hour or years if it comes earlier and
