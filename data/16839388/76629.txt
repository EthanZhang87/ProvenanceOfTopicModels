from the state of Oaxaca from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec The two dance and sing the song La Zandunga Carmen begins by singing the song with Donald quacking out the rest of the chorus with her The drunkenness slows down for a second after Donald multiplied himself while dancing but speeds up again when Carmen reappears dressed in a Charro s outfit and uses a horsewhip as a conductor s baton to make cacti appear in many different forms while dancing to Jesusita en Chihuahua a trademark song of the Mexican Revolution This scene is notable for providing the masterful combination of live action

program was the animated film Saludos Amigos in This film introduced the character Jos Carioca a Brazilian businessman taking the form of a parrot who led Donald Duck around South America The next

wild Other reviewers were taken aback by the sexual dynamics of the film particularly the idea of Donald Duck lusting towards flesh and blood women As Wolcott Gibbs put it in a negative review of the film for The New Yorker such a concept is one of those things that might disconcert less squeamish authorities than the Hays office It might even be said that a sequence involving the duck the young lady and a long alley of animated cactus plants would probably be considered suggestive in a less innocent medium br The film holds an approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews with an
