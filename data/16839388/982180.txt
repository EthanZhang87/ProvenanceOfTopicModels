Hood into an animated feature was dated back to Walt Disney s interest in the tale of Reynard the Fox following the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs The idea was repeatedly shelved for

br J Pat O Malley as Otto the blacksmith He is portrayed as a bloodhound br br br Production br br During production on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in Walt Disney became interested in adapting the twelfth century legend of Reynard the Fox However the project languished due to Disney s concern that Reynard was an unsuitable choice for a hero In a meeting held on February Disney commented I see swell possibilities in Reynard but is it smart to make it We have such a terrific kid audience parents and kids together That s the trouble too sophisticated We ll take a nosedive doing it with animals For Treasure Island Disney seriously considered three animated sections each one of the Reynard tales to be told by Long John Silver to Jim Hawkins as moral fables Ultimately the idea was nixed as Treasure Island became the studio s first fully live action film In the next decade the studio decided to make Reynard the villain of a musical feature film based on Edmond Rostand s Chanticleer but the production was scrapped in favor of The Sword in the Stone br In October during a fishing trip with Ken Anderson studio executive Card Walker suggested that a classic tale should be the subject for the next animated film after The Aristocats Anderson proposed the tale of Robin Hood to which Walker responded enthusiastically Back at the studio Anderson relayed the idea during a story meeting on The Aristocats which was met with approval In a follow up meeting with Wolfgang Reitherman Bill Anderson no relation and Larry Clemmons Ken Anderson was assigned the job to begin exploratory animal character drawings Anderson blended his ideas of Robin Hood by incorporating that the fox character could be slick but still use his skills to protect the community br Additionally Anderson wanted to set the film in the Deep South desiring to recapture the spirit of Song of the South Anderson explained Basically I had a wonderful time on Song of the South and I know that all of my friends in animation did They loved the part I played and I loved the part they played And so it was an attempt on my part to get the best of that sort of thing and get it going on again bring it up to date However the executives were wary of the reputation of Song of the South which was followed by Reitherman s decision to set the film in its traditional English location as inspired by The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men Clemmons came on board the project by writing a script with dialogue that was later storyboarded by other writers br As production went further along Robin Allan stated in his book Walt Disney and Europe that Ken Anderson wept when he saw how his character concepts had been processed into stereotypes for the animation on Robin Hood According to Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston one such casualty was the concept of making the Sheriff of Nottingham a goat as an artistic experiment to try different animals for a villain only to be overruled by Reitherman who wanted to keep to the villainous stereotype of a wolf instead Additionally Anderson wanted to include the Merry Men into the film which was again overridden by Reitherman because he wanted a buddy picture reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid so Little John was the only Merry Man who remained in the film while Friar Tuck was put as a friend of Robin s who lived in Nottingham and Alan a Dale was turned into the narrator br Because of the time spent on developing several settings and auditioning actors to voice the title character production fell behind schedule In order to meet its deadline the animators had no other choice but to recycle several dance sequences from previous Disney animated films including Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs The Jungle Book and The Aristocats that are used in the Phony King of England scene br br br Casting br By October most of the voice actors were confirmed with the exception of Tommy Steele cast in the title role Steele himself was chosen because of his performance in The Happiest Millionaire while Peter Ustinov was cast because Walt Disney had enjoyed his presence on the set of Blackbeard s Ghost However Steele was unable to make his character sound more heroic and his replacement came down to final two candidates which were Bernard Fox and Brian Bedford Disney executives had first seen Bedford performing onstage in Los Angeles in which they brought him in to test for the role in May and ultimately cast him Meanwhile Louis Prima was so angered at not being considered for a role that he personally paid the recording expenses for the subsequent album Let s Hear it For Robin Hood which he sold to Disneyland Records br br br Release br The film premiered at the Radio City Music Hall on November The film was re released on March br br br Home media br The film was first released on VHS CED Betamax and Laserdisc on December becoming the debut installment of the Walt Disney Classics home video line Disney had thought the idea of releasing any of its animated classics known as the untouchables might threaten future theatrical reissue revenue However Robin Hood was viewed as the first choice since

nicely tongue in cheek without insult to the intelligence of either child or adult She also stated that it has class in the fine cast that gives both voice and personality to the characters in the bright and brisk dialogue in its overall concept Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that it should be a good deal of fun for toddlers whose minds have not yet shriveled into orthodoxy and he called the visual style charmingly conventional Dave Billington of The Montreal Gazette wrote As a film Robin Hood marks a come back of sorts for the Disney people Ever since the old maestro died the cartoon features have shown distressing signs of a drop in quality both in art work and in voice characterization But the blending of appealing cartoon animals with perfect voices for the part makes Robin Hood an excellent evening out for the whole family Also writing in New York magazine Ruth Gilbert called it a sweet funny slam bang good hearted Walt Disney feature cartoon with a fine cast and wrote it was a feast for the eyes for kiddies and Disney nostalgics br Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the Disney hallmarks are there as they ever were the incomparably rich full animation the humanized animal characters perky individual and enchanting and the wild inventive slapstick action Awarding the film four stars out of five Ian Nathan in a retrospective review for Empire praised the vocal performances of Peter Ustinov and Terry Thomas acknowledging while this is hardly the most dazzling of animated features it has that cut corner feel that seem to hold sway in the s mainly because Disney were cutting corners the characters spark to life and the story remains as rock steady as ever br Among less favorable reviews Jay Cocks of Time gave the film a mixed verdict writing Even at its best Robin Hood is only mildly diverting There is not a single moment of the hilarity or deep eerie fear that the Disney people used to be able to conjure up or of the sort of visual invention that made the early features so memorable Robin Hood s basic problem is that it is rather too pretty and good natured Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one and a half stars out of four describing the film as minutes of pratfalls and nincompoop dialog and criticizing the animation quality as Saturday morning TV cartoon stuff John Baxter of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that for the most part the film is as bland and one dimensional as the product of less sophisticated studios and except for Peter Ustinov s plummy Prince John the voice characterisations are as insipid as the animation is unoriginal br Decades since the film s release the film has been noted for the recycled scenes of animation The review aggregator website Rotten
