with Tarzan and his family and embark on their new life together br br br Voice cast br Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan a year old man raised by gorillas who finds his human roots Glen Keane served as the supervising animator for Tarzan as an adult while John Ripa animated Tarzan as an infant and a year old child John Ripa studied the movements of young chimpanzees to use for young Tarzan s animation while Glen Keane used movements of a gibbon and used it for the animation of adult Tarzan Keane also watched his son Max Keane do his skateboarding and snowboarding and used surfers moves in the scenes where Tarzan is sliding through the trees Brendan Fraser auditioned twice for the title character before portraying the lead role in George of the Jungle Tony Goldwyn auditioned for the title role as well and according to co director Kevin Lima Goldwyn landed it because of the animal sense in his readings along with some killer baboon imitations br Alex D Linz as young Tarzan br Minnie Driver as Jane Porter the eccentric feisty benevolent and intelligent daughter of Professor Porter She is the first of the group to encounter Tarzan and becomes his love interest Ken Duncan served as the supervising animator for Jane Many of Driver s mannerisms and characteristics were incorporated into Jane s animation The scene where Jane describes meeting Tarzan for the first time to her father and Clayton was improvised by Driver resulting in Duncan animating one of the longest animated scenes on record The scene took weeks to animate and feet of film br Glenn Close as Kala Tarzan s adoptive mother who found and raised him after losing her biological son to Sabor She is also Kerchak s mate Russ Edmonds served as the supervising animator for Kala br Rosie O Donnell as Terk short for Terkina a feminization of Terkoz merged with Teeka Tarzan s best friend a wisecracking gorilla She is also Kala and Kerchak s niece making her and Tarzan adoptive cousins Michael Surrey served as the supervising animator for Terk The character was originally written as a male gorilla but after O Donnell s audition Terk was re characterized as a female Prior to changing Terk to a female Chris Rock was offered the role but turned it down br Brian Blessed as William Cecil Clayton an intelligent and suave yet arrogant and treacherous hunter who assists the Porters on their quest Randy Haycock served as the supervising animator for Clayton basing his design on Clark Gable and other film stars of the s and s Blessed also provided the iconic Tarzan yell for the title character br Nigel Hawthorne as Professor Archimedes Q Porter an eccentric short statured scientist and Jane s father Dave Burgess served as the supervising animator for Porter This was one of Hawthorne s two final acting roles before his death in br Lance Henriksen as Kerchak Kala s mate and Tarzan s reluctant adoptive father a silverback and leader of the gorilla troop who struggles to accept Tarzan since he is a human Bruce W Smith served as the supervising animator for Kerchak br Wayne Knight as Tantor a paranoid and submissive elephant and Tarzan and Terk s close friend Sergio Pablos served as the supervising animator for Tantor Woody Allen was initially cast as Tantor but Jeffrey Katzenberg persuaded Allen to leave the project and join DreamWorks Antz br Taylor Dempsey as young Tantor br br br Production br br br Development br Disney s Tarzan was the first Tarzan film to be animated Thomas Schumacher then president of Walt Disney Feature Animation expressed surprise there hadn t been any previous attempts to animate a Tarzan film saying Here is a book that cries out to be animated Yet we re the first filmmakers to have ever taken Tarzan from page to screen and presented the character as Burroughs intended He noted that in animated form Tarzan can connect to the animals on a deeper level than he can in live action versions br In when A Goofy Movie was nearly finished Kevin Lima was approached to direct Tarzan by then studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg He had desired to have the film animated through the Disney Television Animation division with a new animation studio established in Canada Lima was reluctant to the idea because of the animation complexities being done by inexperienced animators Following Katzenberg s resignation from the Walt Disney Company Lima was again contacted about the project by Michael Eisner who decided to have the film produced through the Feature Animation division by which Lima signed on br Following this Lima decided to read Tarzan of the Apes where he began to visualize the theme of two hands being held up against each other That image became an important symbol of the relationships between characters in the film and a metaphor of Tarzan s search for identity I was looking for something that would underscore Tarzan s sense of being alike yet different from his ape family Lima said The image of touching hands was first conceived as an idea for how Tarzan realizes he and Jane are physically the same br Following his two month study of the book Lima approached his friend Chris Buck who had just wrapped up work as a supervising animator on Pocahontas to ask if he would be interested in serving as co director Buck was initially skeptical but accepted after hearing Lima s ideas for the film By April the Los Angeles Times reported that the film was in its preliminary stages with Lima and Buck directing after Disney had obtained the story rights from the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs br br br Writing br Tab Murphy who had just finished work on The Hunchback of Notre Dame was attracted to the theme of man versus nature in Tarzan and began developing a treatment in January For the third act Murphy suggested that Tarzan should leave for England as he did in the book but the directors felt that it was incompatible with their central theme of what defines a family In order to keep Tarzan in the jungle the third act needed to be restructured by redefining the role of the villain and inventing a way to endanger the gorillas In this departure from Burroughs novel a villain named Clayton was created to serve as a guide for Professor Archimedes Q Porter and his daughter Jane In addition to this Kerchak was re characterized from a savage silverback into the protector of the gorilla tribe br In January husband and wife screenwriting duo Bob Tzudiker and Noni White were hired to help refocus and add humor to the script as a way to balance the emotional weight of the film Comedy writer Dave Reynolds was also brought on to write humorous dialogue for the film I was initially hired on for six weeks of rewriting and punch up Reynolds said A year and a half later I finished Either they liked my work or I was very bad at time management One challenge the writers faced was how Tarzan should learn about his past When Kala takes Tarzan back to the tree house she is essentially telling him that he was adopted Bonnie Arnold the producer for Tarzan said This is necessitated by him encountering humans and recognizing he is one of them As a way to explore the feelings in that scene Arnold brought in adoptive parents to talk with the story team br br br Animation br The animators were split into two teams one in Paris and one in Burbank The mile distance and difference in time zones posed challenges for collaboration especially for scenes with Tarzan and Jane Glen Keane was the supervising animator for Tarzan at the Paris studio while Ken Duncan was the supervising animator for Jane at the studio in Burbank To make coordinating scenes with multiple characters easier the animators used a system called a scene machine that could send rough drawings between the two animation studios Meanwhile following production on Mulan two hundred animators at Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida provided character animation and special effects animation where the filmmakers had to discuss their work through daily video conferences among the three studios br Keane was inspired to make Tarzan surf through the trees because of his son s interest in extreme sports and he began working on a test scene The directors expressed concern that Tarzan would be made into a surfer dude In October Keane revealed the test animation to them which they liked it enough that it was used during the Son of Man sequence with movements inspired by skateboarder Tony Hawk Although Keane initially thought that Tarzan would be easy to animate because he only wears a loincloth he realized that he would need a fully working human musculature while still being able to move like an animal To figure out Tarzan s movements the Paris animation team studied different animals in order to transpose their movements onto him They also consulted with a professor of anatomy This resulted in Tarzan being the first Disney character to accurately display working muscles br To prepare for animating the gorillas the animation team attended lectures on primates made trips to zoos and studied nature documentaries with a group of animators also witnessing a gorilla dissection to learn about their musculature In March the production team began a two week safari in Kenya to take reference photographs and observe the animals On the trip they visited Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda to view mountain gorillas in the wild and get inspiration for the setting In Chris Buck repeated the journey accompanied by journalists to promote the film s home video release br To create the sweeping D backgrounds Tarzan s production team developed a D painting and rendering technique known as Deep Canvas a term coined by artist engineer Eric Daniels This technique allows artists to produce CGI backgrounds that look like a traditional painting according to art director Daniel St Pierre The software keeps track of brushstrokes applied in D space For this advancement the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded the creators of Deep Canvas a Technical Achievement Award in After Tarzan Deep Canvas was used for a number of sequences in Atlantis The Lost Empire particularly large panoramic shots of the island and several action sequences Expanded to support moving objects as part of the background Deep Canvas was used to create about percent of the environments in Disney s next major animated action film Treasure Planet br br br Music br br In Phil Collins was initially brought onto the project as a songwriter following a recommendation by Disney music executive Chris Montan Early into production directors Kevin Lima and Chris Buck decided not to follow Disney s musical tradition by having the characters sing I did not want Tarzan to sing Lima stated I just couldn t see this half naked man sitting on a branch breaking out in song I thought it would be ridiculous Instead Collins would perform the songs in the film serving as the narrator The choice of Collins a popular and well established adult contemporary artist led to comparisons with Elton John s earlier music for The Lion King Tarzan was dubbed in thirty five languages the most for any Disney movie at the time and Collins recorded his songs in French Italian German and Spanish for the dubbed versions of the film s soundtrack According to Collins most of the songs he wrote for Tarzan came from improvisation sessions and his reactions while reading the treatment Three of the songs he wrote Son of Man Trashin the Camp and Strangers Like Me were based on his initial impressions after he read the source material The other two songs were You ll Be in My Heart a lullaby sung to Tarzan by Kala voiced by Glenn Close and Two Worlds a song Collins wrote to serve as the anthem for Tarzan br The instrumental scoring for the film was composed by Mark Mancina who had previously produced music for The Lion King and the musical of the same name Mancina and Collins worked closely to create music that would complement the film s setting and used many obscure instruments from Mancina s personal collection in the score The idea of score and song arrangement came together as one entity as Phil and I worked in tandem to create what s heard in the film Mancina said br br br Release br On June the film premiered at the El Capitan Theater with the cast and filmmakers as attendees followed by a forty minute concert with Phil Collins performing songs from the film On July Disney launched a digital projection release of Tarzan released only in three theatrical venues including Walt Disney World s Pleasure Island multiplex for three weeks Although Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace and An Ideal Husband had been given earlier digital projection releases despite being shot on photographic film Tarzan was notable for being the first major feature release to have been produced mastered and projected digitally br br br Marketing br Disney Consumer Products released a series of toys books and stuffed animals for Tarzan partnering with Mattel to produce a line of plush toys and action figures Mattel also produced the Rad Repeatin Tarzan action figure but discontinued it after complaints regarding the toy s onanistic arm motions Continuing its advertising alliance with McDonald s its promotional campaign began on the film s opening day with several toys accompanied with Happy Meals and soda straws that replicated the Tarzan yell Disney also worked with Nestle to create Tarzan themed candies including a banana flavored chocolate bar In early Disney partnered again with McDonald s to release a set of eight Happy Meal toys as a tie in for the film s home video They also offered Tarzan themed food options such as banana sundaes and jungle burgers br br br Home media br On February the film was released on VHS and DVD as well as on LaserDisc on June only in Japan making Tarzan the last Disney animated feature to be released on the latter format The DVD version contained bonus material including the Strangers Like Me music video the making of Trashin the Camp featuring Collins and N Sync and an interactive trivia game A Disc Collector s Edition was released on April It

successful home video release of earning retail revenues of million br On October Disney released the Tarzan Special Edition on DVD Tarzan s first Blu ray edition was released throughout Europe in early and on August Disney released the Tarzan Special Edition on Blu ray DVD and Digital HD br br br Reception br br br Box office br Pre release box office tracking indicated that Tarzan was appealing to all four major demographics noticeably for the first time for a Disney animated film since The Lion King The film was given a limited release on June and its wide release followed two days later in screens During the weekend of June Tarzan grossed million ranking first at the box office beating out Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me and The General s Daughter At the time it also ranked second behind The Lion King which had earned million as the highest earning box office opening for a Disney animated film By August the domestic gross was projected to approach million Ultimately the film closed its box office run earning million worldwide br br br Critical reaction br Rotten Tomatoes reported that of critics gave the film a positive review based on reviews with an average score of The critical consensus reads that Disney s Tarzan takes the well known story to a new level with spirited animation a brisk pace and some thrilling action set pieces Metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of from top reviews from mainstream critics calculated a score of based on reviews indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Entertainment Weekly compared the film s advancement in visual effects to that of The Matrix stating that it had the neatest computer generated background work since Keanu Reeves did the backstroke in slow motion They elaborate by describing how the characters moved seamlessly through the backgrounds themselves giving the film a unique three dimensional feel that far surpassed the quality of previous live action attempts Roger Ebert gave the film his highest rating of four stars and he had similar comments about the film describing it as representing another attempt by Disney to push the envelope of animation with scenes that move through space with a freedom undreamed of in older animated films and unattainable by any live action process Awarding the film three stars James Berardinelli wrote From a purely visual standpoint this may be the most impressive of all of Disney s traditionally animated features The backdrops are lush the characters are well realized and the action sequences are dizzying with frequent changes of perspectives and camera angles No conventional animated film has been this ambitious before Desson Howe writing for The Washington Post claimed the film isn t up there with Aladdin The Lion King and The Little Mermaid but it s easily above the riffraff ranks of Hercules and Pocahontas Todd McCarthy of Variety proved to be less amused by the animation claiming it was richly detailed and colorfully conceived but the computer animation and graphics are often intermingled and combined in ways that are more distracting in their differences than helpful in their vividness br Lisa Schwarzbaum who graded the film an A applauded the film as a thrilling saga about a natural man untainted by the complications of civilized life who can anticipate changes in the air by sniffing the wind swings because the Disney team having sniffed the wind went out on a limb and kept things simple Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle admired the film for tackling meanings of family relationships and ideas about society guardianship and compassion and cunning and greed and the ultimate evil as well as remaining faithful to Burroughs s original novel Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times wrote that the story unfolds with dangers as well as warm humor a jungle jam session called Trashin the Camp is especially hard to resist We may have seen it all before but when it s done up like this experiencing it all over again is a pleasure Janet Maslin reviewing for The New York Times similarly opined that Tarzan initially looks and sounds like more of the same to the point where Phil Collins is singing the words trust your heart by the third line of his opening song But it proves to be one of the more exotic blooms in the Disney hothouse what with voluptuous flora hordes of fauna charming characters and excitingly kinetic animation that gracefully incorporates computer generated motion br The Radio Times review was not positive stating the film falls way short of Disney s best output and featured weak comic relief The review concluded Lacking the epic sweep of Mulan or The Lion King and laced with feeble background songs from Phil Collins inexplicably awarded an Oscar this King of the Swingers may be merchandise friendly but it s no jungle VIP Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune while giving the film three stars wrote that Tarzan lacks that special pizazz that the string of Disney cartoon features from The Little Mermaid through The Lion King all had He found faults in the film s removal of all African characters lack of romantic tension between Tarzan and Jane and the songs by Phil Collins comparing them unfavorably with Elton John s showstoppers for The Lion King He wrote depriving the characters of big numbers weakens the movie br Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly gave the soundtrack a B stating that it was awkwardly split between Collins s songs and the traditional score was burdened by too many alternate versions of the tracks and in some instances bore similarities to the scores of The Lion King and Star Wars br br br Accolades br br The film is recognized by American
