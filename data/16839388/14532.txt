Europe covering an area of km sq mi and third most populous member state of the European Union with a population of nearly million Its capital and largest city is Rome other major urban areas include Milan Naples Turin Florence and Venice br In antiquity Italy was home to numerous peoples the Latin city of Rome founded as a Kingdom became a Republic that conquered the Mediterranean world and ruled it for centuries as an Empire With the spread of Christianity Rome became the seat of the Catholic Church and the Papacy During the Early Middle Ages Italy experienced the fall of the Western Roman Empire and inward migration from Germanic tribes By the th century Italian city states and maritime republics expanded bringing renewed prosperity through commerce and laying the groundwork for modern capitalism The Italian Renaissance flourished during the th and th centuries and spread to the rest of Europe Italian explorers discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World leading the European Age of Discovery However centuries of rivalry and infighting between city states left the peninsula divided During the th and th centuries Italian economic importance waned significantly br After centuries of political and territorial divisions Italy was almost entirely unified in following wars of independence and the Expedition of the Thousand establishing the Kingdom of Italy From the late th to the early th century Italy rapidly industrialized mainly in the north and acquired a colonial empire while the south remained largely impoverished fueling a large immigrant diaspora to the Americas From to Italy took part in World War I with the Entente against the Central Powers In the Italian fascist dictatorship was established During World War II Italy was first part of the Axis until its surrender to the Allied powers then a co belligerent of the Allies during the Italian resistance and the liberation of Italy Following the war the monarchy was replaced by a republic and the country enjoyed a strong recovery br A developed country Italy has the ninth largest nominal GDP in the world the second largest manufacturing industry in Europe and a significant role in regional and global economic military cultural and diplomatic affairs Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union and is part of numerous international institutions including NATO the G and G the Latin Union and the Union for the Mediterranean As a cultural superpower Italy has long been a renowned centre of art music literature cuisine fashion science and technology and the source of multiple inventions and discoveries It has the most World Heritage Sites and is the fifth most visited country br br br Name br br Hypotheses for the etymology of Italia are numerous One theory suggests it originated from an Ancient Greek term for the land of the Ital i a tribe that resided in the region now known as Calabria Originally thought to be named Vituli some scholars suggest their totemic animal to be the calf Lat vitulus Umbrian vitlo Oscan V teli Several ancient authors said it was named after a local ruler Italus br The ancient Greek term for Italy initially referred only to the south of the Bruttium peninsula and parts of Catanzaro and Vibo Valentia The larger concept of Oenotria and Italy became synonymous and the name applied to most of Lucania as well Before the Roman Republic s expansion the name was used by Greeks for the land between the strait of Messina and the line connecting the gulfs of Salerno and Taranto corresponding to Calabria The Greeks came to apply Italia to a larger region In addition to the Greek Italy in the south historians have suggested the existence of an Etruscan Italy which consisted of areas of central Italy br The borders of Roman Italy Italia are better established Cato s Origines describes Italy as the entire peninsula south of the Alps In BC Roman Italy extended from the Arno and Rubicon rivers of the centre north to the entire south The northern area Cisalpine Gaul considered geographically part of Italy was occupied by Rome in the s BC but remained politically separated It was legally merged into the administrative unit of Italy in BC Sardinia Corsica Sicily and Malta were added to Italy by Diocletian in AD which made late ancient Italy coterminous with the modern Italian geographical region br The Latin Italicus was used to describe a man of Italy as opposed to a provincial or one from the Roman province The adjective italianus from which Italian was derived is from medieval Latin and was used alternatively with Italicus during the early modern period After the fall of the Western Roman Empire the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy was created After the Lombard invasions Italia was retained as the name for their kingdom and its successor kingdom within the Holy Roman Empire br br br History br br br Prehistory and antiquity br br Lower Paleolithic artefacts dating back years have been recovered from Monte Poggiolo Excavations throughout Italy revealed a Neanderthal presence in the Middle Palaeolithic period years ago while modern humans appeared about years ago at Riparo Mochi br The ancient peoples of pre Roman Italy were Indo European specifically the Italic peoples The main historic peoples of possible non Indo European or pre Indo European heritage include the Etruscans the Elymians and Sicani of Sicily and the prehistoric Sardinians who gave birth to the Nuragic civilisation Other ancient populations include the Rhaetian people and Camunni known for their rock drawings in Valcamonica A natural mummy tzi dated BC was discovered in the Similaun glacier in br The first colonisers were the Phoenicians who established emporiums on the coasts of Sicily and Sardinia Some became small urban centers and developed parallel to Greek colonies Between the th and th centuries BC Mycenaean Greeks established contacts with Italy During the th and th centuries Greek colonies were established at Pithecusae eventually extending along the south of the Italian Peninsula and the coast of Sicily an area later known as Magna Graecia Ionians Doric colonists Syracusans and the Achaeans founded various cities Greek colonisation placed the Italic peoples in contact with democratic forms of government and high artistic and cultural expressions br br br Ancient Rome br br Ancient Rome a settlement on the river Tiber in central Italy founded in BC was ruled for years by a monarchical system In BC the Romans favouring a government of the Senate and the People SPQR expelled the monarchy and established an oligarchic republic br The Italian Peninsula named Italia was consolidated into a unified entity during Roman expansion the conquest of new territories often at the expense of the other Italic tribes Etruscans Celts and Greeks A permanent association with most of the local tribes and cities was formed and Rome began the conquest of Western Europe North Africa and the Middle East In the wake of Julius Caesar s assassination in BC Rome grew into a massive empire stretching from Britain to the borders of Persia engulfing the whole Mediterranean basin in which Greek Roman and other cultures merged into a powerful civilisation The long reign of the first emperor Augustus began an age of peace and prosperity Roman Italy remained the metropole of the empire homeland of the Romans and territory of the capital br As Roman provinces were being established throughout the Mediterranean Italy maintained a special status which made it domina provinciarum ruler of the provinces and especially in relation to the first centuries of imperial stability rectrix mundi governor of the world and omnium terrarum parens parent of all lands br The Roman Empire was among the largest in history wielding great economical cultural political and military power At its greatest extent it had an area of million square kilometres million square miles The Roman legacy has deeply influenced Western civilisation shaping the modern world The widespread use of Romance languages derived from Latin numerical system modern Western alphabet and calendar and the emergence of Christianity as a world religion are among the many legacies of Roman dominance br br br Middle Ages br br After the fall of the Western Roman Empire Italy fell under the Odoacer s kingdom and was seized by the Ostrogoths Invasions resulted in a chaotic succession of kingdoms and the supposed Dark Ages The invasion of another Germanic tribe in the th century the Lombards reduced Byzantine presence and ended political unity of the peninsula for the next years The north formed the Lombard kingdom central south was also controlled by the Lombards and other parts remained Byzantine br br The Lombard kingdom was absorbed into Francia by Charlemagne in the late th century and became the Kingdom of Italy The Franks helped form the Papal States Until the th century politics was dominated by relations between the Holy Roman Emperors and the Papacy with city states siding with the former Ghibellines or with the latter Guelphs for momentary advantage The Germanic emperor and Roman pontiff became the universal powers of medieval Europe However conflict over the Investiture Controversy and between Guelphs and Ghibellines ended the imperial feudal system in the north where cities gained independence In the Lombard League of city states defeated Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa ensuring their independence br City states e g Milan Florence Venice played a crucially innovative role in financial development by devising banking practices and enabling new forms of social organization In coastal and southern areas maritime republics dominated the Mediterranean and monopolised trade to the Orient They were independent thalassocratic city states in which merchants had considerable power Although oligarchical the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement The best known maritime republics were Venice Genoa Pisa and Amalfi Each had dominion over overseas lands islands lands on the Adriatic Aegean and Black seas and commercial colonies in the Near East and North Africa br br Venice and Genoa were Europe s gateways to the East and producers of fine glass while Florence was a centre of silk wool banking and jewellery The wealth generated meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned The republics participated in the Crusades providing support transport but mostly taking political and trading opportunities Italy first felt the economic changes which led to the commercial revolution Venice was able to sack Byzantine s capital and finance Marco Polo s voyages to Asia the first universities were formed in Italian cities and scholars such as Aquinas obtained international fame capitalism and banking families emerged in Florence where Dante and Giotto were active around Southern Italy was divided between the Kingdom of Sicily and Kingdom of Naples The Black Death of killed perhaps a third of Italy s population br br br Early modern period br br During the s and s Italy was the birthplace and heart of the Renaissance This era marked the transition from the medieval period to the modern age and was fostered by the wealth accumulated by merchant cities and the patronage of dominant families Italian polities were now regional states effectively ruled by princes in control of trade and administration and their courts became centres of the arts and sciences These princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families such as the Medici of Florence After the end of the Western Schism newly elected Pope Martin V returned to the Papal States and restored Italy as the sole centre of Western Christianity The Medici Bank was made the credit institution of the Papacy and significant ties were established between the Church and new political dynasties br br In despite activity by Pope Nicholas V to support the Byzantines the city of Constantinople fell to the Ottomans This led to the migration of Greek scholars and texts to Italy fuelling the rediscovery of Greek humanism Humanist rulers such as Federico da Montefeltro and Pope Pius II worked to establish ideal cities founding Urbino and Pienza Pico della Mirandola wrote the Oration on the Dignity of Man considered the manifesto of the Renaissance In the arts the Italian Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on European art for centuries with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci Botticelli Michelangelo Raphael Giotto Donatello and Titian and architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi Andrea Palladio and Donato Bramante Italian explorers and navigators from the maritime republics eager to find an alternative route to the Indies to bypass the Ottomans offered their services to monarchs of Atlantic countries and played a key role in ushering the br Age of Discovery and colonization of the Americas The most notable were Christopher Columbus who opened the Americas for conquest by Europeans John Cabot the first European to explore North America since the Norse and Amerigo Vespucci who demonstrated the New World was not Asia in around the continent of America is named after him br A defensive alliance known as the Italic League was formed between Venice Naples Florence Milan and the Papacy Lorenzo the Magnificent de Medici was the Renaissance s greatest patron his support allowed the League to abort invasion by the Turks The alliance however collapsed in the s the invasion of Charles VIII of France initiated a series of wars in the peninsula During the High Renaissance Popes such as Julius II fought for control of Italy against foreign monarchs Paul III preferred to mediate between the European powers to secure peace In the middle of such conflicts the Medici popes Leo X and Clement VII faced the Protestant Reformation in Germany England and elsewhere br In at the end of the Italian wars between France and the Habsburgs about half of Italy the southern Kingdoms of Naples Sicily Sardinia and the Duchy of Milan was under Spanish rule while the other half remained independent many states continued to be formally part of the Holy Roman Empire The Papacy launched the Counter Reformation whose key events include the Council of Trent adoption of the Gregorian calendar the Jesuit China mission the French Wars of Religion end of the Thirty Years War and the Great Turkish War The Italian economy declined in the s and s br br During the war of the Spanish succession Austria acquired most of the Spanish domains in Italy namely Milan Naples and Sardinia the latter was given to the House of Savoy in exchange for Sicily in Later a branch of the Bourbons ascended to the throne of Sicily and Naples During the Napoleonic Wars north and central Italy were reorganised as Sister Republics of France and later as a Kingdom of Italy The south was administered by Joachim Murat Napoleon s brother in law s Congress of Vienna restored the situation of the late th century but the ideals of the French Revolution could not be eradicated and re surfaced during the political upheavals that characterised the early th century The first adoption of the Italian tricolour by an Italian state the Cispadane Republic occurred during Napoleonic Italy following the French Revolution which advocated national self determination This event is celebrated by Tricolour Day br br br Unification br br The birth of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of efforts of Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula By the mid th century rising Italian nationalism led to revolution Following the Congress of Vienna in the political and social Italian unification movement or Risorgimento emerged to unite Italy by consolidating the states and liberating them from foreign control A radical figure was the patriotic journalist Giuseppe Mazzini founder of the political movement Young Italy in the s who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement saw the first public performance of Il Canto degli Italiani which became the national anthem in br br The most famous member of Young Italy was the revolutionary and general Giuseppe Garibaldi who led the republican drive for unification in southern Italy However the Italian monarchy of the House of Savoy in the Kingdom of Sardinia whose government was led by Camillo Benso Count of Cavour also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state In the context of the liberal revolutions that swept Europe an unsuccessful First Italian War of Independence was declared against Austria In Sardinia became an ally of Britain and France in the Crimean War Sardinia fought the Austrian Empire in the Second Italian War of Independence of with the aid of France resulting in liberating Lombardy On the basis of the Plombi res Agreement the Sardinia ceded Savoy and Nice to France an event that caused the Ni ard exodus br In Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily Teano was the site of a famous meeting between Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II the last king of Sardinia during which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel s hand and hailed him as King of Italy Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi s southern Italy in a union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on March Victor Emmanuel II became its first king and its capital was moved from Turin to Florence In Victor Emmanuel II allied with Prussia during the Austro Prussian War waged the Third Italian War of Independence which resulted in Italy annexing Venetia Finally in as France abandoned Rome during the Franco Prussian War the Italians captured the Papal States unification was completed and the capital moved to Rome br br br Liberal period br br Sardinia s constitution was extended to all of Italy in and provided basic freedoms for the new state but electoral laws excluded the non propertied classes The new kingdom was governed by a parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberals As northern Italy quickly industrialised southern and northern rural areas remained underdeveloped and overpopulated forcing millions to migrate and fuelling a large and influential diaspora The Italian Socialist Party increased in strength challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment In the last two decades of the th century Italy developed into a colonial power by subjugating Eritrea Somalia Tripolitania and Cyrenaica in Africa In male universal suffrage was adopted The pre World War I period was dominated by Giovanni Giolitti prime minister five times between and br br Italy entered into the First World War in with the aim of completing national unity so it is also considered the Fourth Italian War of Independence from a historiographical perspective as the conclusion of the unification of Italy Italy nominally allied with German and the Austro Hungarian empires in the Triple Alliance in joined the Allies entering World War I with a promise of substantial territorial gains that included west Inner Carniola the former Austrian Littoral and Dalmatia as well as parts of the Ottoman Empire The country s contribution to the Allied victory earned it a place as one of the Big Four powers Reorganization of the army and conscription led to Italian victories In October the Italians launched a massive offensive culminating in victory at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto This marked the end of war on the Italian Front secured dissolution of the Austro Hungarian Empire and was instrumental in ending the war less than two weeks later br During the war more than Italian soldiers and as many civilians died and the kingdom was on the brink of bankruptcy The Treaty of Saint Germain en Laye and Treaty of Rapallo allowed for annexation of Trentino Alto Adige the Julian March Istria the Kvarner Gulf and the Dalmatian city of Zara The subsequent Treaty of Rome led to annexation of Fiume by Italy Italy did not receive other territories promised by the Treaty of London so this outcome was denounced as a mutilated victory by Benito Mussolini which helped lead to the rise of Italian fascism Historians regard mutilated victory as a political myth used by fascists to fuel Italian imperialism Italy gained a permanent seat in the League of Nations s executive council br br br Fascist regime and World War II br br The socialist agitations that followed the devastation of the Great War inspired by the Russian Revolution led to counter revolution and repression throughout Italy The liberal establishment fearing a Soviet style revolution started to endorse the small National Fascist Party led by Mussolini In October the Blackshirts of the National Fascist Party organized a mass demonstration and the March on Rome coup King Victor Emmanuel III appointed Mussolini as prime minister transferring power to the fascists without armed conflict Mussolini banned political parties and curtailed personal liberties establishing a dictatorship These actions attracted international attention and inspired similar dictatorships in Nazi Germany and Francoist Spain br Fascism was based upon Italian nationalism and imperialism seeking to expand Italian possessions via irredentist claims based on the legacy of the Roman and Venetian empires For this reason the fascists engaged in interventionist foreign policy In Mussolini invaded Ethiopia and founded Italian East Africa resulting in international isolation and leading to Italy s withdrawal from the League of Nations Italy then allied with Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan and strongly supported Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War In Italy annexed Albania br Italy entered World War II on June At different times Italians advanced in British Somaliland Egypt the Balkans and eastern fronts They were however defeated on the Eastern Front as well as in the East African and North African campaigns losing their territories in Africa and the Balkans Italian war crimes included extrajudicial killings and ethnic cleansing by deportation of about people mainly Yugoslavs to Italian concentration camps and elsewhere Yugoslav Partisans perpetrated their own crimes against the ethnic Italian population during and after the war including the foibe massacres In Italy and Yugoslavia few war crimes were prosecuted br An Allied invasion of Sicily began in July leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime on July Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III On September Italy signed the Armistice of Cassibile ending its war with the Allies The Germans with the assistance of Italian fascists succeeded in taking control of north and central Italy The country remained a battlefield with the Allies moving up from the south br br In the north the Germans set up the Italian Social Republic RSI a Nazi puppet state and collaborationist regime with Mussolini installed as leader after he was rescued by German paratroopers What remained of the Italian troops was organised into the Italian Co belligerent Army which fought alongside the Allies while other Italian forces loyal to Mussolini opted to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army German troops with RSI collaboration committed massacres and deported thousands of Jews to death camps The post armistice period saw the emergence of the Italian Resistance who fought a guerrilla war against the Nazi German occupiers and collaborators This has been described as an Italian civil war due to fighting between partisans and fascist RSI forces In April with defeat looming Mussolini attempted to escape north but was captured and summarily executed by partisans br Hostilities ended on April when the German forces in Italy surrendered Nearly half a million Italians died in the conflict society was divided and the economy all but destroyed per capita income in was at its lowest point since The aftermath left Italy angry with the monarchy for its endorsement of the Fascist regime These frustrations contributed to a revival of Italian republicanism br br br Republican era br br Italy became a republic after the Italian institutional referendum held on June a day celebrated since as Festa della Repubblica This was the first time women voted nationally Victor Emmanuel III s son Umberto II was forced to abdicate The Republican Constitution was approved in Under the Treaty of Paris between Italy and the Allied Powers areas next to the Adriatic Sea were annexed by Yugoslavia resulting in the Istrian Dalmatian exodus which involved the emigration of around Istrian and Dalmatian Italians Italy lost all colonial possessions ending the Italian Empire Italy s border today has existed since when Trieste was formally re annexed to Italy br br Fears of a Communist takeover proved crucial in when the Christian Democrats under Alcide De Gasperi won a landslide victory Consequently in Italy became a member of NATO The Marshall Plan revived the economy which until the late s enjoyed a period called the Economic Miracle In the s Italy became a founding country of the European Communities a forerunner of the European Union From the late s until the early s the country experienced the Years of Lead characterised by economic difficulties especially after the oil crisis social conflicts and terrorist massacres br The economy recovered and Italy became the world s fifth largest industrial nation after it gained entry into the G in the s However national debt skyrocketed past of GDP Between and Italy faced terror attacks perpetrated by the Sicilian Mafia as a consequence of new anti mafia measures by the government Voters disenchanted with political paralysis massive public debt and extensive corruption uncovered by the Clean Hands investigation demanded radical reform The scandals involved all major parties but especially those in the coalition The Christian Democrats who had ruled for almost years underwent a crisis and disbanded splitting into factions The Communists reorganised as a social democratic force During the s and s centre right dominated by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi and centre left coalitions led by professor Romano Prodi alternately governed br In amidst the Great Recession Berlusconi resigned and was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of Mario Monti In PD Matteo Renzi became prime minister and the government started constitutional reform This was rejected in a referendum and Paolo Gentiloni became prime minister br During the European migrant crisis of the s Italy was the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the EU Between and it took in over migrants mainly from sub Saharan Africa which put a strain on the public purse and led to a surge in support for far right or euro sceptic parties After the general election Giuseppe Conte became prime minister of a populist coalition br With more than victims Italy was one of the countries with the most deaths in the COVID pandemic and one of the most affected economically In February after a government crisis Conte resigned Mario Draghi former president of the European Central Bank formed a national unity government supported by most main parties pledging to implement an economic stimulus to face the crisis caused by the pandemic In Giorgia Meloni was sworn in as Italy s first female prime minister br br br Geography br br Italy whose territory largely

Italy borders France Switzerland Austria and Slovenia and is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain It consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula Sicily and Sardinia the biggest islands of the Mediterranean and many smaller islands Some of Italy s territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the Eurasian continental shelf br The country s area is square kilometres sq mi of which km sq mi is land and km sq mi is water Including the islands Italy has a coastline of kilometres miles on the Mediterranean Sea the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas the Ionian Sea and the Adriatic Sea Its border with France runs for km mi Switzerland km mi Austria km mi and Slovenia km mi The sovereign states of

Monte Bianco at m ft Other well known mountains include the Matterhorn Monte Cervino in the western Alps and the Dolomites in the eastern Alps Many parts of Italy are of volcanic origin Most small islands and archipelagos in the south are volcanic islands There are active volcanoes Mount Etna in Sicily the largest in Europe Vulcano Stromboli and Vesuvius br Most rivers of Italy drain into the Adriatic or Tyrrhenian Sea The longest is the Po which flows for either km mi or km mi from the Alps on the western border and crosses the Padan plain to the Adriatic The Po Valley is the largest plain with km sq mi and contains over of the country s lowlands The largest lakes are in descending size Garda km or sq mi Maggiore km or sq mi and Como km or sq mi br br br Climate br br The climate is influenced by the seas that surround Italy on every side except the north which constitute a reservoir of heat and humidity Within the southern temperate zone they determine a Mediterranean climate with local differences Because of the length of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous hinterland the climate is highly diverse In most inland northern and central regions the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic The Po Valley is mostly humid subtropical with cool winters and hot summers The coastal areas of Liguria Tuscany and most of the south generally fit the Mediterranean climate stereotype as in the K ppen climate classification br Conditions on the coast are different from those in the interior particularly during winter when the higher altitudes tend to be cold wet and often snowy The coastal regions have mild winters and hot and generally dry summers lowland valleys are hot in summer Winter temperatures vary from C F in the Alps to C F in Sicily so average summer temperatures range from C F to over C F Winters can vary widely with lingering cold foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder sunnier conditions in the south Summers are hot across the country except at high altitude particularly in the south Northern and central areas can experience strong thunderstorms from spring to autumn br br br Biodiversity br br Italy s varied geography including the Alps Apennines central Italian woodlands and southern Italian Garigue and Maquis shrubland contribute to habitat diversity As the peninsula is in the centre of the Mediterranean forming a corridor between Central Europe and North Africa and having km mi of coastline Italy has received species from the Balkans Eurasia and the Middle East Italy has probably the highest level of faunal biodiversity in Europe with over species recorded representing more than a third of all European fauna and the highest level of biodiversity of animal and plant species within the EU br br The fauna of Italy includes endemic animal species which include the Sardinian long eared bat Sardinian red deer spectacled salamander brown cave salamander Italian newt Italian frog

endemic plant species and subspecies which include Sicilian fir Barbaricina columbine Sea marigold Lavender cotton and Ucriana violet Italy is a signatory to the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and the Habitats Directive br Italy has many botanical and historic gardens The Italian garden is stylistically based on symmetry axial geometry and the principle of imposing order on nature It influenced the history of gardening especially French and English gardens The Italian garden was influenced by Roman and Italian Renaissance gardens br The Italian wolf is the national animal of Italy while the national tree is the strawberry tree The reasons for this are that the Italian wolf which inhabits the Apennine Mountains and the Western Alps features prominently in Latin and Italian cultures such as the legend of the founding of Rome while the green leaves white flowers and red berries of the strawberry tree native to the Mediterranean

overturned by the government in with plans to build up to four nuclear power plants This was in turn struck down by a referendum following the Fukushima nuclear accident br br Air pollution remains severe especially in the industrialised north Italy is the twelfth largest carbon dioxide producer Extensive traffic and congestion in large cities continue to cause environmental and health issues even if smog levels have decreased since the s and s with smog becoming an increasingly rare phenomenon and levels of sulphur dioxide decreasing br Many watercourses and stretches of coast have been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity while because of rising water levels Venice has experienced regular intermittent flooding in recent years Waste is not always disposed legally and has led to permanent adverse health effects on some inhabitants as in the case of the Seveso disaster br Deforestation illegal building and poor land management policies have led to significant erosion in Italy s mountainous regions leading to ecological disasters such as the Vajont Dam flood and the Sarno and Messina mudslides The country had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of
