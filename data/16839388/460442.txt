conceived by Lasseter Stanton and Joe Ranft It stars the voices of Dave Foley Kevin Spacey Julia Louis Dreyfus and Hayden Panettiere In the film a misfit ant named Flik looks for tough warriors to save his ant colony from a protection racket run by a gang of grasshoppers However the warriors he brings back were a troupe of Circus Bugs The film s plot was initially inspired by Aesop s fable The Ant and the Grasshopper br Production on A Bug s Life began shortly after the release of Toy Story in The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing and Pixar s animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation Randy Newman composed the music for the film During production a controversial public feud erupted between Steve Jobs and Lasseter of Pixar and DreamWorks co founder Jeffrey Katzenberg due to the parallel production of his similar film Antz which was released the month prior br A Bug s Life premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November and was released in the United States on November It received positive reviews for its animation story humor and voice acting It became a commercial success having grossed million at the box office It was the first film to be digitally transferred frame by frame and released on DVD and has been released multiple times on home video br br br Plot br A colony of ants led by the elderly Queen and her daughter Princess Atta live in the middle of a seasonally dry creekbed on a small hill known as Ant Island Every summer they are forced to give food to a gang of grasshoppers led by Hopper br One day Flik a courageous but clumsy inventor ant inadvertently destroys the food offering with his grain harvester Hopper discovers this and demands twice as much food as compensation When Flik earnestly suggests the ants enlist the help of bigger bugs to fight the grasshoppers Atta sees it as a way to get rid of Flik and sends him off br Flik travels to the city a heap of trash under a trailer Flik mistakes a troupe of jobless Circus Bugs for the warrior bugs he seeks The bugs in turn mistake Flik for a talent agent and agree to travel with him back to Ant Island During a welcome ceremony after their arrival the Circus Bugs and Flik discover their mutual misunderstandings The Circus Bugs attempt to leave but are pursued by a nearby bird while fleeing they rescue Atta s younger sister Dot from the bird gaining the ants respect At Flik s request the Circus Bugs continue the ruse of being warriors thus enabling them to continue enjoying the ants hospitality Learning that Hopper fears birds inspires Flik to build a crewed ornithopter disguised as a bird to scare away the grasshoppers Meanwhile Hopper reminds his gang of the ants superior numbers warning them the ants will rebel if not kept in line br The ants finish constructing the fake bird During the subsequent celebration the Circus Bugs old supervisor P T Flea arrives seeking to rehire them and blowing their cover the ants exile Flik and the Circus Bugs and desperately try gathering food for a new offering Hopper returns sees the mediocre offering and takes over the island He then demands the ants own winter food supply planning to execute the Queen afterward Overhearing the plan Dot persuades Flik and the Circus Bugs to return to Ant Island br After the Circus Bugs distract the grasshoppers long enough to rescue the Queen Flik deploys the bird It initially fools the grasshoppers but P T who is also fooled sets the bird on fire Realizing the deception Hopper has Flik publicly beaten and proclaims the ants are lowly life forms who live only to serve the grasshoppers Flik asserts Hopper actually fears the colony because he has always known what they are capable of This inspires the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers driving all but Hopper and his brother Molt away br The ants shove Hopper into the circus cannon to shoot him off of the island but rain suddenly begins to fall In the ensuing chaos Hopper frees himself from the cannon and abducts Flik The Circus Bugs and Atta pursue with the latter catching up to Hopper and rescuing Flik who lures Hopper to the real bird s nest Believing the bird is another fake Hopper taunts it until it grabs him and feeds him to its chicks br With the anthill now at peace Flik improves his inventions to help gather food for the ants Flik and Atta become a couple and proceed to send Hopper s affable brother Molt and a few ants to help P T and the Circus Bugs on their new tour Atta and Dot become the new Queen and Princess The ants celebrate their victory and congratulate Flik as a hero They then bid a fond farewell to the circus troupe br br br Voice cast br br br Production br br br Development br br During the summer of Pixar s story department began turning their thoughts to their next film The storyline for A Bug s Life originated from a lunchtime conversation between John Lasseter Andrew Stanton Pete Docter and Joe Ranft the studio s head story team other films such as Monsters Inc Finding Nemo and WALL E were also conceived at this lunch Lasseter and his story team had already been drawn to the idea of insects serving as characters Like toys insects were within the reach of computer animation back then due to their relatively simple surfaces Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop s fable The Ant and the Grasshopper Walt Disney had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the short film The Grasshopper and the Ants In addition Walt Disney Feature Animation had considered producing a film in the late s entitled Army Ants that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony but this never fully materialized br As Stanton and Ranft discussed the adaptation they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise Lasseter liked the idea and offered some suggestions The concept simmered until early when the story team began work on the second film in earnest During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early July under the title Bugs Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original agreement between Disney and Pixar Lasseter assigned the co director job to Stanton both worked well together and had similar sensibilities Lasseter had realized that working on a computer animated feature as a sole director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in process In addition Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director br br br Writing br In The Ant and the Grasshopper a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter when winter comes the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food but the ants turn him away Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food After Stanton had completed a draft of the script he came to doubt one of the story s main pillars that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change Also no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act Although the film was already far along Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach br Stanton took one of the early circus bug characters Red the red ant and changed him into the character Flik The Circus Bugs no longer out to cheat the colony would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them Lasseter agreed with this new approach and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton The characters Tuck and Roll were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in the second grade Lasseter had come to envision the film as an epic in the tradition of David Lean s film Lawrence of Arabia br br br Casting br The voice cast was heavy with television sitcom stars of the time Flik was voiced by Dave Foley from NewsRadio Princess Atta was voiced by Julia Louis Dreyfus from Seinfeld Molt was voiced by Richard Kind from Spin City Slim was voiced by David Hyde Pierce from Frasier and Dim was voiced by Brad Garrett from Everybody Loves Raymond Joe Ranft member of Pixar s story team played Heimlich the caterpillar at the suggestion of Lasseter s wife Nancy who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track br For Hopper the film s villain Lasseter s top choice was Robert De Niro who repeatedly turned the part down as did a succession of other actors Kevin Spacey met John Lasseter at the Academy Awards and Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately br A Bug s Life was the final film appearance of actor Roddy McDowall who played Mr Soil dying shortly before the film s theatrical release br br br Art design and animation br It was more difficult for animators during the production of A Bug s Life than that of Toy Story as Pixar s computers ran sluggishly due to the complexity of the character models Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators Rich Quade and Glenn McQueen to assist with directing and reviewing the animation The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P T Flea s Flaming Wall of Death Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was less likely to change After Lasseter thought it would be useful to look at a view of the world from an insect s perspective two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on Lego wheels dubbed the Bugcam Fastened to the end of a stick the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect s eye outlook Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass leaves and flower petals formed a translucent canopy as if the insects were living under a stained glass ceiling The team also later sought inspiration from Microcosmos a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world br The transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines While Toy Story focused heavily on Woody and Buzz Lightyear with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks A Bug s Life required in depth storytelling for several major groups of characters Character design also presented a new challenge in that the designers had to make ants appear likable Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely natural realism would give way to the film s larger needs The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs The grasshoppers in contrast received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive The story s scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants The film would include more than such shots in the ant colony some with as many as It was impractical for animators to control them individually but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless or move identically Bill Reeves one of the film s two supervising technical directors dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual universal ants Each one of these universal ants would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways e g different color of eye or skin different heights different weights etc This ensured that no two ants were the same It was partly based on Reeves s invention of particle systems a decade and a half earlier which had let animators use masses of self guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow br The animators also employed subsurface scattering developed by Pixar co founder Edwin Catmull during his graduate student days at the University of Utah in the s to render surfaces in a more lifelike way This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result Geri s Game was attached alongside A Bug s Life in its theatrical release br br br Feud between Pixar and DreamWorks br During the production of A Bug s Life a public feud erupted between DreamWorks Jeffrey Katzenberg and Pixar s Steve Jobs and John Lasseter Katzenberg former chairman of Disney s film division had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner In response he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation After DreamWorks acquisition of Pacific Data Images PDI long Pixar s contemporary in computer animation Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI s first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film to be called Antz By this time Pixar s project was well known within the animation community Both Antz and A Bug s Life center on a young male ant a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess s hand by saving their society Whereas A Bug s Life relied chiefly on visual gags Antz was more verbal and revolved more around satire The script of Antz was also heavy with adult references whereas Pixar s film was more accessible to children br It was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split often calling to check up In October when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Universal lot s Technicolor facility in Universal City where DreamWorks was also located he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next Lasseter described what would become A Bug s Life in detail Lasseter respected Katzenberg s judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story and he was telling friends throughout the tight knit computer animation business to get cracking on their own films He told various friends If this hits it s going to be like space movies after Star Wars for computer animation companies Lasseter later recalled I should have been wary Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released br When the trades indicated production on Antz Lasseter feeling betrayed called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor Lasseter asked again and Katzenberg admitted it was true Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg s story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October Another source gives Nina Jacobson one of Katzenberg s executives as the person responsible for the Antz pitch Lasseter who normally did not use profane language cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was out to get him and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg s fight with Disney For his part Katzenberg believed he was the victim of a conspiracy Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract required bonus convincing Disney s board not to give him anything Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt which was then intended to be DreamWorks first animated release Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high Privately Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg br Katzenberg moved the opening of Antz from spring to October to compete with Pixar s release David Price writes in his book The Pixar Touch that a rumor never confirmed was that Katzenberg had given PDI rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have Antz ready first despite Pixar s head start Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling Katzenberg made an offer He would delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Bug s Life so that it did not compete with The Prince of Egypt Jobs believed it a blatant extortion attempt and would not go for it explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar s rescue by making the deal for Toy Story as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time Katzenberg said I was the one guy there for you back then and now you re allowing them to use you to screw me He suggested that if Jobs wanted to he could simply slow down production on A Bug s Life without telling Disney If he did Katzenberg said he would put Antz on hold Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition but Katzenberg denied these charges later br As the release dates for both films approached Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks battle Regardless Lasseter publicly dismissed Antz as a schlock version of A Bug s Life Lasseter who claimed to have never seen Antz told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy The bad guys rarely win Jobs told the Los Angeles Times In response DreamWorks head of marketing Terry Press suggested Steve Jobs should take a pill Despite the successful box office performance of both Antz and A Bug s Life tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years According to Jobs Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of Shrek and insisted he had never heard the pitch for A Bug s Life reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so Although the contention left all parties estranged Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from spending a long time together in computer animation br br br Music br br The film s score was composed and conducted by Randy Newman Walt Disney Records released the soundtrack on October The album s first track is a song called The Time of Your Life written and performed by Newman while all the other tracks are orchestral cues Although the album was out of print physically in the United States during the s in June Universal Music Japan announced that a re mastered edition would be released on October along with other soundtrack albums from the Walt

the film s theatrical release new outtakes were added to the theatrical prints Because the film is animated no actual outtakes exist they are animated specifically for the outtakes sequence br br br Home media br A Bug s Life was the first home video release to be entirely created using a digital transfer Every frame of animation was converted from the film s computer data as opposed to the standard analog film to videotape transfer process This allowed for the film s DVD release to retain its original widescreen format The DVD was released on April alongside a VHS release which was presented in a standard fullscreen format The film s fullscreen transfer was performed by entirely reframing the film shot by shot more than half of the film s footage was modified by Pixar animators to fit within the film s aspect ratio Several characters and objects were moved closer together to avoid being cut out of frame The film s VHS release was the best selling VHS in the United Kingdom
