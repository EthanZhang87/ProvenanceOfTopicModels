Formula One commonly known as Formula or F is the highest class of international racing for open wheel single seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the F d ration Internationale de l Automobile FIA The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the world s premier forms of racing since its inaugural running in The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participants cars must follow A Formula One season consists of a series of races known as Grands Prix Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose built circuits or closed public roads br A point system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships one for the drivers and one for the constructors the teams Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence the highest class of racing licence the FIA issues and the races must be held on grade one tracks the highest grade rating the FIA issues for tracks br Formula One cars are the world s fastest regulated road course racing cars owing to very high cornering speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce Much of this downforce is generated by front and rear wings which have the side effect of causing severe turbulence behind each car The turbulence reduces the downforce the cars following directly behind generate making it hard to overtake Major changes made to the cars for the season have resulted in greater use of ground effect aerodynamics and modified wings to reduce the turbulence behind the cars with the goal of making overtaking easier The cars depend on electronics aerodynamics suspension and tyres Traction control launch control and automatic shifting and other electronic driving aids were first banned in They were briefly reintroduced in and have more recently been banned since and respectively br With the average annual cost of running a team designing building and maintaining cars pay transport at approximately or Formula One s financial and political battles are widely reported The Formula One Group is owned by Liberty Media which acquired it in from private equity firm CVC Capital Partners for billion billion br br br History br br Formula One originated from the World Manufacturers Championship and European Drivers Championship The formula is a set of rules that all participants cars must follow Formula One was a formula agreed upon in to officially become effective in The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the Turin Grand Prix anticipating the formula s official start Before World War II a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until to become effective in The new World Championship was instituted to commence in br The first world championship race the British Grand Prix took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom on May Giuseppe Farina competing for Alfa Romeo won the first Drivers World Championship narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio Fangio won the championship in and This set the record for the most World Championships won by a single driver a record that stood for years until Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in br br A Constructors Championship was added in the season Stirling Moss despite being regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the s and s never won the Formula One championship Between and Moss finished second in the championship four times and third the other three times Fangio won of the races he entered still the record for the highest Formula One winning percentage by an individual driver National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the s and s Promoters held non championship Formula One events for many years Due to the increasing cost of competition the last of these was held in br This era featured teams managed by road car manufacturers such as Alfa Romeo Ferrari Mercedes Benz and Maserati The first seasons featured prewar cars like Alfa Romeo s which were front engined with narrow tyres and litre supercharged or litre naturally aspirated engines The and seasons were run to Formula Two regulations for smaller less powerful cars due to concerns over the dearth of Formula One cars When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to litres was reinstated for the world championship Mercedes Benz introduced its W which featured things never seen on Formula One cars before such as desmodromic valves fuel injection and enclosed streamlined bodywork Mercedes drivers won the championship for the next two years before the team withdrew from all motorsport competitions due to the Le Mans disaster br br br Technological developments br br The first major technological development in the sport was Bugatti s introduction of mid engined cars Jack Brabham the world champion in and soon proved the mid engine s superiority over all other engine positions By all teams had switched to mid engined cars The Ferguson P a four wheel drive design was the last front engined Formula One car to enter a world championship race It entered the British Grand Prix the only front engined car to compete that year br During Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional space frame design This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of mid engined cars br In sponsorship was introduced to the sport Team Gunston became the first team to run cigarette sponsorship on its Brabham cars which privately entered in orange brown and gold colours of Gunston cigarettes in the South African Grand Prix on January Five months later the first works team Lotus followed this example when it entered its cars painted in the red gold and white colours of the Imperial Tobacco s Gold Leaf livery at the Spanish Grand Prix br Aerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils during the season In the late s Lotus introduced ground effect aerodynamics previously used on Jim Hall s Chaparral J in that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car s weight As a result extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height leaving the suspension virtually solid This meant that the drivers depended entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface br br br Big business br Beginning in the s Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One s commercial rights he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion dollar business it now is When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors Association and in he became its president Previously the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually Ecclestone persuaded the teams to hunt as a pack through FOCA He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take or leave In return for the package almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising br The formation of the F d ration Internationale du Sport Automobile FISA in set off the FISA FOCA war during which FISA and its president Jean Marie Balestre argued repeatedly with FOCA over television revenues and technical regulations The Guardian said that Ecclestone and Max Mosley used FOCA to wage a guerrilla war with a very long term aim in view FOCA threatened to establish a rival series and boycotted a Grand Prix and FISA withdrew its sanction from races The result was the Concorde Agreement which guaranteed technical stability as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations Although FISA asserted its right to the TV revenues it gave FOCA the administration of those rights br FISA imposed a ban on ground effect aerodynamics during But by then turbocharged engines which Renault had pioneered in were producing over kW bhp and were essential to be competitive By a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of bar psi pressure estimated to be over kW bhp in qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix The next year power in race trim reached around kW bhp with boost pressure limited to only bar These cars were the most powerful open wheel circuit racing cars ever To reduce engine power output and thus speeds the FIA limited fuel tank capacity in and boost pressures in before banning turbocharged engines completely in br The development of electronic driver aids began in the s Lotus began to develop a system of active suspension which first appeared during on the Lotus By this system had been perfected and was driven to victory by Ayrton Senna in the Monaco Grand Prix that year In the early s other teams followed suit and semi automatic gearboxes and traction control were a natural progression The FIA due to complaints that technology was determining races outcomes more than driver skill banned many such aids for the season This resulted in cars that previously depended on electronic aids becoming very twitchy and difficult to drive Observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only as they proved difficult to police effectively br The teams signed a second Concorde Agreement in and a third in br br On the track the McLaren and Williams teams dominated the s and s Brabham was also competitive during the early s winning two Drivers Championships with Nelson Piquet Powered by Porsche Honda and Mercedes Benz McLaren won championships seven constructors and nine drivers in that period while Williams used engines from Ford Honda and Renault to also win titles nine constructors and seven drivers The rivalry between racers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became F s central focus during and continued until Prost retired at the end of Senna died at the San Marino Grand Prix after crashing into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve Tamburello The FIA worked to improve the sport s safety standards since that weekend during which Roland Ratzenberger also died in an accident during Saturday qualifying No driver died of injuries sustained on the track at the wheel of a Formula One car for years until the Japanese Grand Prix where Jules Bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit dying nine months later from his injuries Since three track marshals have died one at the Italian Grand Prix one at the Australian Grand Prix and one at the Canadian Grand Prix br Since Senna s and Ratzenberger s deaths the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule changes that otherwise under the Concorde Agreement would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams most notably the changes introduced for This so called narrow track era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres a narrower track overall and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track According to the FIA this was to reduce cornering speeds in the interest of safety br br Results were mixed as the lack of mechanical grip resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip This resulted in pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices which in turn resulted in less overtaking as these devices tended to make the wake behind the car turbulent or dirty This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on clean air to make the car stick to the track The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well br Drivers from McLaren Williams Renault formerly Benetton and Ferrari dubbed the Big Four won every World Championship from to The teams won every Constructors Championship from to as well as placing themselves as the top four teams in the Constructors Championship in every season between and and winning every race but one the Monaco Grand Prix between and Due to the technological advances of the s the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically thus increasing financial burdens This combined with the dominance of four teams largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes Benz caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive but to stay in business This effectively forced several teams to withdraw br br br Manufacturers return br Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers Championships and six consecutive Constructors Championships Schumacher set many new records including those for Grand Prix wins since beaten by Lewis Hamilton wins in a season since beaten by Max Verstappen and most Drivers Championships seven tied with Lewis Hamilton as of Schumacher s championship streak ended on September when Renault driver Fernando Alonso became Formula One s youngest champion at that time until Lewis Hamilton in and followed by Sebastian Vettel in During Renault and Alonso won both titles again Schumacher retired at the end of after years in Formula One but came out of retirement for the season racing for the newly formed Mercedes works team following the rebrand of Brawn GP br During this period FIA frequently changed the championship rules with the intention of improving the on track action and cutting costs Team orders legal since the championship started during were banned during after several incidents in which teams openly manipulated race results generating negative publicity most famously by Ferrari at the Austrian Grand Prix Other changes included the qualifying format the point scoring system the technical regulations and rules specifying how long engines and tyres must last A tyre war between suppliers Michelin and Bridgestone saw lap times fall although at the United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis seven out of ten teams did not race when their Michelin tyres were deemed unsafe for use leading to Bridgestone becoming the sole tyre supplier to Formula One for the season by default On December Bridgestone signed a contract that officially made it the exclusive tyre supplier for the next three seasons br During Max Mosley outlined a green future for Formula One in which efficient use of energy would be an important factor br Starting in with Ford s purchase of Stewart Grand Prix to form the Jaguar Racing team new manufacturer owned teams entered Formula One for the first time since Alfa Romeo s and Renault s departures in By the manufacturer teams Renault BMW Toyota Honda and Ferrari dominated the championship taking five of the first six places in the Constructors Championship The exception was McLaren which at the time was part owned by Mercedes Benz Through the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association GPMA the manufacturers negotiated a larger share of Formula One s commercial profit and a greater say in the running of the sport br br br Manufacturers decline and return of the privateers br In and Honda BMW and Toyota all withdrew from Formula One racing within a year blaming the economic recession This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance of the sport The Honda F team went through a management buyout to become Brawn GP with Ross Brawn and Nick Fry running and owning the majority of the organisation Brawn GP laid off hundreds of employees but won the year s world championships BMW F was bought out by the original founder of the team Peter Sauber The Lotus F Team was another formerly manufacturer owned team that reverted to privateer ownership together with the buy out of the Renault team by Genii Capital investors But a link with its previous owners still survived with its car continuing to be powered by a Renault engine until br br McLaren also announced that it was to reacquire the shares in its team from Mercedes Benz McLaren s partnership with Mercedes was reported to have started to sour with the McLaren Mercedes SLR road car project and tough F championships which included McLaren being found guilty of spying on Ferrari Hence during the season Mercedes Benz reentered the sport as a manufacturer after it purchased Brawn GP and split with McLaren after seasons with the team br During the season Formula One was gripped by the FIA FOTA dispute FIA President Max Mosley proposed numerous cost cutting measures for the next season including an optional budget cap for the teams teams electing to take the budget cap would be granted greater technical freedom adjustable front and rear wings and an engine not subject to a rev limiter The Formula One Teams Association FOTA believed that allowing some teams to have such technical freedom would have created a two tier championship and thus requested urgent talks with the FIA But talks broke down and FOTA teams announced with the exception of Williams and Force India that they had no choice but to form a breakaway championship series br br On June Formula One s governing body and the teams reached an agreement to prevent a breakaway series It was agreed teams must cut spending to the level of the early s within two years exact figures were not specified and Max Mosley agreed he would not stand for reelection to the FIA presidency in October Following further disagreements after Mosley suggested he would stand for reelection FOTA made it clear that breakaway plans were still being pursued On July FOTA issued a press release stating it had been informed it was not entered for the season and an FIA press release said the FOTA representatives had walked out of the meeting On August it was announced FIA and FOTA had signed a new Concorde Agreement bringing an end to the crisis and securing the sport s future until br To compensate for the loss of manufacturer teams four new teams were accepted entry into the season ahead of a much anticipated cost cap Entrants included a reborn Team Lotus led by a Malaysian consortium including Tony Fernandes the boss of Air Asia Hispania Racing the first Spanish Formula One team and Virgin Racing Richard Branson s entry into the series following a successful partnership with Brawn the year before They were also joined by the US F Team which planned to run out of the United States as the only non European based team in the sport Financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid Despite the entry of these new teams the proposed cost cap was repealed and these teams which did not have the budgets of the midfield and top order teams ran around at the back of the field until they collapsed HRT in Caterham formerly Lotus in and Manor formerly Virgin then Marussia having survived falling into administration in at the end of br br br Hybrid era br A major rule shakeup in saw the litre naturally aspirated V engines replaced by litre turbocharged hybrid power units This prompted Honda to return to the sport in as the championship s fourth power unit manufacturer Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate Nico Rosberg with the team winning out of the races that season The team continued this form in the next two seasons again winning races in before taking a record wins in with Hamilton claiming the title in the former year and Rosberg winning it in the latter by five points The season also saw a new team Haas join the grid while Max Verstappen became the youngest ever race winner at age in Spain br After revised aerodynamic regulations were introduced the and seasons featured a title battle between Mercedes and Ferrari Mercedes ultimately won the titles with multiple races to spare and continued to dominate in the next two years eventually winning seven consecutive Drivers Championships from to and eight consecutive Constructors titles from to During this eight year period between and a Mercedes driver won of the races with Hamilton winning of these and taking six Drivers Championships during this period to equal Schumacher s record of seven titles In the Honda powered Red Bull team began to seriously challenge Mercedes with Verstappen beating Hamilton to the Drivers Championship after a season long battle that saw the pair exchange the championship lead multiple times br This era has seen an increase in car manufacturer presence in the sport After Honda s return as an engine manufacturer in Renault came back as a team in after buying back the Lotus F team In Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo became Red Bull and Sauber s title sponsors respectively Sauber was rebranded as Alfa Romeo Racing for the season while Racing Point part owner Lawrence Stroll bought a stake in Aston Martin to rebrand the Racing Point team as Aston Martin for In August all ten F teams signed a new Concorde Agreement committing them to the sport until including a million budget cap for car development to support equal competition and sustainable development br The COVID pandemic forced the sport to adapt to budgetary and logistical limitations A significant overhaul of the technical regulations intended to be introduced in the season was pushed back to with constructors instead using their chassis for two seasons and a token system limiting which parts could be modified introduced The start of the season was delayed by several months and both it and seasons were subject to several postponements cancellations and rescheduling of races due to shifting restrictions on international travel Many races took place behind closed doors and with only essential personnel present to maintain social distancing br In the F governing body announced a major rule and car design change intended to promote closer racing through the use of ground effects new aerodynamics larger wheels with low profile tyres and redesigned nose and wing regulations Red Bull emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup The and Constructors and Drivers Championships were won by Red Bull and Verstappen with multiple races to spare br In the FIA opened applications for new teams to enter Formula in the then near future Of the teams that applied only Andretti were approved by the FIA with them then being rejected by Formula One Management br In early the Formula One landscape underwent a significant change in the sphere of team sponsorships and collaborations Having competed for five seasons under the Alfa Romeo name Sauber introduced a title partnership with the online casino Stake com resulting in the team s new identity as Stake F Team Kick Sauber Sauber will hold Stake s sponsorship name until the end of br The regulations governing Formula One are set to be revised for the season with big changes planned to help encourage closer and more competitive racing br Changes include br br Move to fully sustainable fuels br MGU K Motor Generator Unit Kinetic power increased from kW to kW br More stringent safety requirements br Tighter budget caps br br br Racing and strategy br A Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend It typically begins with two free practice sessions on Friday and one free practice on Saturday Additional drivers commonly known as third drivers are allowed to run on Fridays but only two cars may be used per team requiring a race driver to give up their seat A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday br br br Tyre rules br br Each driver may use no more than thirteen sets of dry weather tyres four sets of intermediate tyres and three sets of wet weather tyres during a race weekend br br br Qualifying br For much of the sport s history qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time with the grid order determined by each driver s best single lap with the fastest getting first place on the grid referred to as pole position From to the format was a one hour shootout This approach lasted until the end of before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on br Grids were generally limited to cars if the race had more entries qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race During the early s the number of entries was so high that the worst performing teams had to enter a pre qualifying session with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session The qualifying format began to change in the early s with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps determining the aggregate time over two sessions and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap br The current qualifying system was adopted in the season Known as knock out qualifying it is split into three periods known as Q Q and Q In each period drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period with the slowest drivers being knocked out of qualification but not necessarily the race at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period After each period all times are reset and only a driver s fastest lap in that period barring infractions counts Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed and will count toward that driver s placement The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship br Currently with cars Q runs for minutes and eliminates the slowest five drivers During this period any driver whose best lap takes longer than of the fastest time in Q will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards Otherwise all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions This rule does not affect drivers in Q or Q In Q the remaining drivers have minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period Finally Q lasts minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions At the beginning of the Formula season the FIA introduced a new qualifying format whereby drivers were knocked out every seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race but due to unpopularity the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP after running the format for only two races br Each car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q The cars that qualify for Q must return them after Q the cars that do not qualify for Q can use them during the race As of all drivers are given a free choice of tyre to use at the start of the Grand Prix whereas in previous years only the drivers that did not participate in Q had free tyre choice for the start of the race Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix or for changing a gearbox or engine component If a car fails scrutineering the driver will be excluded from qualifying but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race stewards discretion br saw the trialling of a sprint qualifying race on the Saturday of three race weekends with the intention of testing the new approach to qualifying The traditional qualifying would determine the starting order for the sprint and the result of the sprint would then determine the start order for the Grand Prix The system returned for the season now titled the sprint From sprint races no longer impacted the start order for the main race which would be determined by traditional qualifying Sprints would have their own qualifying session titled the sprint shootout such a system made its debut at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and is set to be used throughout all sprint sessions in place of the traditional second free practice session Sprint qualifying sessions are run much shorter than traditional qualifying and each session required teams to fit new tyres mediums for SQ and SQ and softs for SQ otherwise they cannot participate in the session br br br Race br The race begins with a warm up lap after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified This lap is often referred to as the formation lap as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground The warm up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start br br Once all the cars have formed on the grid after the medical car positions itself behind the pack a light system above the track indicates the start of the race five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time typically less than seconds to signal the start of the race The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an unsafe position signalled by raising their arm If this happens the procedure restarts a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions with the original start voided The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if race control feels a racing start would be excessively dangerous such as extremely heavy rainfall As of the season there will always be a standing restart If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary then after the track has dried sufficiently drivers will form up for a standing start There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car br Under normal circumstances the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps Race officials may end the race early putting out a red flag due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall and it must finish within two hours although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race When a situation justifies pausing the race without terminating it the red flag is deployed since a ten minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane before then the race resumed in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was shown br In the s race distances varied from km mi to km mi The maximum race length was reduced to km mi in and km mi in The race length was standardised to the current km mi in However street races like Monaco have shorter distances to keep under the two hour limit br Drivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race If a leader comes across a backmarker slower car who has completed fewer laps the back marker is shown a blue flag telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them The slower car is said to be lapped and once the leader finishes the race is classified as finishing the race one lap down A driver can be lapped numerous times by any car in front of them A driver who fails to complete more than of the race distance is shown as not classified in the results br Throughout the race drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage from to inclusive they could also refuel Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car s potential Three dry tyre compounds with different durability and adhesion characteristics are available to drivers Over the course of a race drivers must use two of the three available compounds The different compounds have different levels of performance and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make Different tyres have different colours on their sidewalls this allows spectators to understand the strategies br Under wet conditions drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves one intermediate for mild wet conditions such as after recent rain one full wet for racing in or immediately after rain A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds up to three stops are typically made although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change If rain tyres are used drivers are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres br br br Race director br This role involves managing the logistics of each F Grand Prix inspecting cars in parc ferm before a race enforcing FIA rules and controlling the lights which start each race As the head of the race officials the race director also plays a large role in resolving disputes among teams and drivers The race director may also refer incidents to the race stewards who may give penalties such as drive through penalties or stop and go penalties demotions on a pre race start grid race disqualifications and fines should parties break regulations As of the race director is Niels Wittich with Herbie Blash as a permanent advisor br br br Safety car br In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals race officials may choose to deploy the safety car This in effect suspends the race with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order with overtaking not permitted Cars that have been lapped may during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director be allowed to un lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared after it comes in the race restarts with a rolling start Pit stops are permitted under the safety car Since the main safety car driver has been German ex racing driver Bernd Mayl nder On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line After crossing this line drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more Mercedes Benz supplies Mercedes AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety cars From onwards Aston Martin supplies the Vantage to Formula One to use as the safety car sharing the duty with Mercedes Benz br br br Flags br br Flags specifications and usage are prescribed by Appendix H of the FIA s International Sporting Code br br The format of the race has changed little through Formula One s history The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops In the early days of Grand Prix racing a driver would be allowed to continue a race in their teammate s car should theirs develop a problem in the modern era cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible In recent years the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations br Since the season refuelling which was reintroduced in has not been allowed to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in again to encourage racing on the track The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience br br br Points system br br A driver must finish within the top ten to receive a point for setting the fastest lap of the race If the driver who set the fastest lap finishes outside of the top ten then the point for fastest lap will not be awarded for that race br br Various systems for awarding championship points have been used since The current system in place since awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers and Constructors Championships with the winner receiving points All points won at each race are added up and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions Regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season or switches teams all points earned by them count for the Drivers Championship br A driver must be classified in order to receive points as of a driver must complete at least of the race distance in order to receive points Therefore it is possible for a driver to receive points even if they retired before the end of the race br From some time between the and seasons to the end of the season if less than of the race laps were completed by the winner then only half of the points listed in the table were awarded to the drivers and constructors This has happened on only five occasions in the history of the championship and it had a notable influence on the final standing of the season The last occurrence was at the Belgian Grand Prix when the race was called off after just three laps behind a safety car due to torrential rain The half points rule was replaced by a distance dependent gradual scale system for br br br Constructors br br A Formula One constructor is the entity credited for designing the chassis and the engine If both are designed by the same company that company receives sole credit as the constructor e g Ferrari If they are designed by different companies both are credited and the name of the chassis designer is placed before that of the engine designer e g McLaren Mercedes All constructors are scored individually even if they share either chassis or engine with another constructor e g Williams Ford Williams Honda in br Since Formula One teams have been required to build the chassis in which they compete and consequently the distinction between the terms team and constructor became less pronounced though engines may still be produced by a different entity This requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the IndyCar Series which allows teams to purchase chassis and spec series such as Formula which require all cars be kept to an identical specification It also effectively prohibits privateers which were common even in Formula One well into the s br The sport s debut season saw eighteen teams compete but due to high costs many dropped out quickly In fact such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the first decade of Formula One that Formula Two cars were admitted to fill the grids Ferrari is the oldest Formula One team the only still active team which competed in br br Early manufacturer involvement came in the form of a factory team or works team that is one owned and staffed by a major car company such as those of Alfa Romeo Ferrari or Renault Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors Championships sixteen br Companies such as Climax Repco Cosworth Hart Judd and Supertec which had no direct team affiliation often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them In the early years independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW Ferrari Honda Mercedes Benz Renault and Toyota whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier It is estimated the major teams spend between and million million per year per manufacturer on engines alone br In the season for the first time since the rule two teams used chassis built by other teams Super Aguri started the season using a modified Honda Racing RA chassis used by Honda the previous year while Scuderia Toro Rosso used the same chassis used by the parent Red Bull Racing team which was formally designed by a separate subsidiary The usage of these loopholes was ended for with the publication of new technical regulations which require each constructor to own the intellectual property rights to their chassis The regulations continue to allow a team to subcontract the design and construction of the chassis to a third party an option used by the HRT team in and Haas currently br Although teams rarely disclose information about their budgets it is estimated they range from US million to US million each br Entering a new team in the Formula One World Championship requires a million up front payment to the FIA which is then shared equally among the existing teams As a consequence constructors desiring to enter Formula One often prefer to buy an existing team BAR s purchase of Tyrrell and Midland s purchase of Jordan allowed both of these teams to sidestep the large deposit and secure the benefits the team already had such as TV revenue br Seven out of the ten teams competing in Formula One are based close to London in an area centred around Oxford Ferrari have both their chassis and engine assembly in Maranello Italy The RB Formula One Team is based close to Ferrari in Faenza whilst Sauber Motorsport is based near Zurich in Switzerland br br br Drivers br br Every team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend and every team may use up to four drivers in a season A team may also run two additional drivers in Free Practice sessions which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car Most drivers are contracted for at least the duration of a season with driver changes taking place in between seasons in comparison to early years when drivers often competed on an ad hoc basis from race to race Each competitor must be in the possession of a FIA Super Licence to compete in a Grand Prix which is issued to drivers who have met the criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and having achieved kilometres mi of running in a Formula One car Drivers may also be issued a Super Licence by the World Motor Sport Council if they fail to meet the criteria Although most drivers earn their seat on ability commercial considerations also come into play with teams having to satisfy sponsors and financial demands br Teams also contract test and reserve drivers to stand in for regular drivers when necessary and develop the team s car although with the reduction on testing the reserve drivers role mainly takes places on a simulator such as rFactor Pro which is used by most of the F teams br Each driver chooses an unassigned number from to excluding which was retired following the death of Jules Bianchi upon entering Formula One and keeps that number during their time in the series The number one is reserved for the reigning Drivers Champion who retains their previous number and may choose to use it instead of the number one At the onset of the championship numbers were allocated by race organisers on an ad hoc basis from race to race br Permanent numbers were introduced in to take effect in when teams were allocated numbers in ascending order based on the Constructors Championship standings at the end of the season The teams would hold those numbers from season to season with the exception of the team with the World Drivers Champion which would swap its numbers with the one and two of the previous champion s team New entrants were allocated spare numbers with the exception of the number which had been unused since br As teams kept their numbers for long periods of time car numbers became associated with a team such as Ferrari s and A different system was used from to at the start of each season the current Drivers Champion was designated number one their teammate number two and the rest of the teams assigned ascending numbers according to previous season s Constructors Championship order br As of a total of separate drivers have won the World Drivers Championship with Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton holding the record for most championships with seven Lewis Hamilton achieved the most race wins too in Jochen Rindt is the only posthumous World Champion after his points total was not surpassed despite his fatal accident at the Italian Grand Prix with races still remaining in the season Drivers from the United Kingdom have been the most successful in the sport with championships among drivers and wins br br br Feeder series br br Most F drivers start in kart racing competitions and then come up through traditional European single seater series like Formula Ford and Formula Renault to Formula and finally the GP Series GP started in replacing Formula which itself had replaced Formula Two as the last major stepping stone into F GP was rebranded as the FIA Formula Championship in Most champions from this level graduate into F but GP champion Lewis Hamilton became the first F F or GP champion to win the Formula One drivers title in br Drivers are not required to have competed at this level before entering Formula One British F has supplied many F drivers with champions including Nigel Mansell Ayrton Senna and Mika H kkinen having moved straight from that series to Formula One and Max Verstappen made his F debut following a single season in European F More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level as was the case with World Champion Kimi R ikk nen who went straight from Formula Renault to F br American open wheel car racing has also contributed to the Formula One grid CART champions Mario Andretti and Jacques Villeneuve became F World Champions while Juan Pablo Montoya won seven races in F Other CART also known as ChampCar champions like Michael Andretti and Alessandro Zanardi won no races in F Other drivers have taken different paths to F Damon Hill raced motorbikes and Michael Schumacher raced in sports cars albeit after climbing through the junior single seater ranks Former F driver Paul di Resta raced in DTM until he was signed with Force India in br br br Grands Prix br br The number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years The inaugural World Championship season comprised only seven races while the and seasons each contained races the highest number of World Championship races in one season There were no more than Grands Prix per season during the early decades of the championship although a large number of non championship Formula One events also took place The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of to by the late s while non championship events ended in More Grands Prix began to be held in the s and recent seasons have seen an average of races races are scheduled for the season br Six of the original seven races took place in Europe the only non European race that counted towards the World Championship in was the Indianapolis which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the United States Grand Prix The F championship gradually expanded to other non European countries Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in and Morocco hosted the first African World Championship race in Asia and Oceania followed Japan in and Australia in and the first race in the Middle East was held in The races of the season were spread over every populated continent except for Africa with Grands Prix held outside Europe br Some of the Grands Prix pre date the formation of the World Championship such as the French Grand Prix and were incorporated into the championship as Formula One races in The British and Italian Grands Prix are the only events to have been held every Formula One season other long running races include the Belgian German and French Grands Prix The Monaco Grand Prix was first held in and has run continuously since with the exception of and is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world br All Grands Prix have traditionally been run during the day until the inaugural Singapore Grand Prix hosted the first Formula One night race in which was followed by the day night Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in and the Bahrain Grand Prix which converted to a night race in Other Grands Prix in Asia have had their start times adjusted to benefit the European television audience br br br Contracted Grands Prix br The following twenty four Grands Prix all of which appeared on the schedule have a contract to be hosted at the listed circuits for

the sport This initiative started with the Singapore Grand Prix br br br Circuits br br Formula One races must be held on grade one tracks the highest grade rating issued by the FIA for tracks br A typical circuit features a stretch of straight road on which the starting grid is situated The pit lane where the drivers stop for tyres aerodynamic adjustments and minor repairs such as changing the car s nose due to front wing damage during the race retirements from the race and where the teams work on the cars before the race is normally located next to the starting grid The layout of the rest of the circuit varies widely although in most cases the circuit runs in a clockwise direction Those few circuits that run anticlockwise and therefore have predominantly left handed corners can cause drivers neck problems due to the enormous lateral forces generated by F cars pulling their heads in the opposite direction to normal A single race requires hotel rooms to accommodate at least visitors br Most of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition The current street circuits are Monaco Melbourne Singapore Baku Miami Jeddah and Las Vegas although races in other urban locations come and go Detroit for example and proposals for such races The glamour and history of the Monaco race are the primary reasons why the circuit is still in use even though it does not meet the strict safety requirements imposed on other tracks Three time World champion Nelson Piquet famously described racing in Monaco as like riding a bicycle around your living room br Circuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated as exemplified by the Bahrain International Circuit added in and designed like most of F s new circuits by Hermann Tilke Several of the new circuits in F especially those designed by Tilke have been criticised as lacking the flow of such classics as Spa Francorchamps and Imola His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections These newer circuits however are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones br The Circuit of the Americas in Austin the Sochi Autodrom in Sochi and the Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan have all been introduced as brand new tracks since In Algarve International Circuit debuted on the F calendar as the venue of the Portuguese Grand Prix with the country having last hosted a race in In Circuit Zandvoort returned to the F calendar as the Dutch Grand Prix having last hosted a race in The Las Vegas Grand Prix entered the sport in br br br Cars and technology br br Modern Formula One cars are mid engined hybrid semi open cockpit open wheel single seaters The chassis is made largely of carbon fibre composites rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong The whole car including the driver but not fuel weighs only kg lb the minimum weight set by the regulations If the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum it can be ballasted up to add the necessary weight The race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis thereby locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight transfer br The cornering speed of Formula One cars is largely determined by the aerodynamic downforce that they generate which pushes the car down onto the track This is provided by wings mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle and by ground effect created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance The previous generation of cars sported a large number of small winglets barge boards and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over under and around the car br The other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the tyres From to the tyres in Formula One were not slicks tyres with no tread pattern as in most other circuit racing series Instead each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars Slick tyres returned to Formula One in the season Suspension is double wishbone or multilink front and rear with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis one exception being that of the specification Red Bull Racing car RB which used pullrod suspension at the rear the first car to do so since the Minardi PS in Ferrari used a pullrod suspension at both the front and rear in their car Both Ferrari F and McLaren MP of the season used a pullrod suspension at both the front and the rear In McLaren MCL and Red Bull Racing RB switched to a pullrod front suspension and push rod rear suspension br Carbon carbon disc brakes are used for reduced weight and increased frictional performance These provide a very high level of braking performance and are usually the element that provokes the greatest reaction from drivers new to the formula br In the technical regulations changed considerably in order to reduce the turbulence commonly referred to as dirty air produced by the aerodynamics of the car This includes a redesigned front and rear wing larger wheels with a lower tyre profile wheel covers small winglets the banning of barge boards and the reintroduction of Ground effect downforce production These have been changed to promote racing meaning cars lose less downforce when following another car It allows cars to follow another at a much closer distance without extending the gap due to the turbulent air See Formula One World Championship Technical regulations br Formula One cars must have four wheels made of the same metallic material which must be one of two magnesium alloys specified by the FIA Magnesium alloy wheels made by forging are used to achieve maximum unsprung rotating weight reduction As of the wheels are covered with spec Standardised Wheel Covers the wheel diameter has increased from inches to inches reducing the tyre profile and small winglets have been placed over the front tyres br br Starting with the Formula season the engines have changed from a litre naturally aspirated V to turbocharged litre V power units These get a significant amount of their power from electric motors In addition they include a lot of energy recovery technology Engines run on unleaded fuel closely resembling publicly available petrol The oil which lubricates and protects the engine from overheating is very similar in viscosity to water The generation of engines spun up to rpm and produced over kW bhp For engines were restricted to rpm with limited development areas allowed following the engine specification freeze since the end of For the Formula One season the engines were further restricted to rpm br A wide variety of technologies including active suspension are banned under the current regulations Despite this the current generation of cars can reach speeds in excess of km h mph at some circuits The highest straight line speed recorded during a Grand Prix was km h mph set by Juan Pablo Montoya during the Italian Grand Prix A BAR Honda Formula One car running with minimum downforce on a runway in the Mojave Desert achieved a top speed of km h mph in According to Honda the car fully met the FIA Formula One regulations br Even with the limitations on aerodynamics at km h mph aerodynamically generated downforce is equal to the weight of the car and the oft repeated claim that Formula One cars create enough downforce to drive on the ceiling while possible in principle has never been put to the test Downforce of times the car s weight can be achieved at full speed The downforce means that the cars can achieve a lateral force with a magnitude of up to times that of the force of gravity g in cornering Consequently the driver s head is pulled sideways with a force equivalent to the weight of kg in corners Such high lateral forces are enough to make breathing difficult and the drivers need supreme concentration and fitness to maintain their focus for the one to two hours that it takes to complete the race A high performance road car like the Enzo Ferrari only achieves around g br As of each team may have no more than two cars available for use at any time Each driver may use no more than four engines during a championship season unless they drive for more than one team If more engines are used they drop ten places on the starting grid of the event at which an additional engine is used The only exception is where the engine is provided by a manufacturer or supplier taking part in its first championship season in which case up to five may be used by a driver Each driver may use no more than one gearbox for six consecutive events every unscheduled gearbox change requires the driver to drop five places on the grid unless they failed to finish the previous race due to reasons beyond the team s control br As of each driver is limited to three power units per season before incurring grid penalties br br br Revenue and profits br br In March F Racing published its annual estimates of spending by Formula One teams The total spending of all eleven teams in was estimated at billion US This was broken down as follows Toyota million Ferrari m McLaren m Honda m BMW Sauber m Renault m Red Bull m Williams m Midland F Spyker MF m Toro Rosso m and Super Aguri million br Costs vary greatly from team to team Honda Toyota McLaren Mercedes and Ferrari were estimated to have spent approximately million on engines in Renault spent approximately million and Cosworth s V was developed for million In contrast to the season on which these figures are based the sporting regulations banned all performance related engine development br Formula One teams pay entry fees of plus per point scored the previous year or per point for the winner of the Constructors Championship Formula One drivers pay a FIA Super Licence fee which in was plus per point br There have been controversies with the way profits are shared among the teams The smaller teams have complained that the profits are unevenly shared favouring established top teams In September Force India and Sauber officially lodged a complaint with the European Union against Formula One questioning the governance and stating that the system of dividing revenues and determining the rules is unfair and unlawful br The cost of building a brand new permanent circuit can be up to hundreds of millions of dollars while the cost of converting a public road such as Albert Park into a temporary circuit is much less Permanent circuits however can generate revenue all year round from leasing the track for private races and other races such as MotoGP The Shanghai International Circuit cost over million and the Istanbul Park circuit cost million to build br A number of Formula One drivers earn the highest salary of any drivers in auto racing The highest paid driver in is Lewis Hamilton who received million in salary from Mercedes AMG Petronas F a record for any driver The very top Formula One drivers get paid more than IndyCar or NASCAR drivers however the earnings immediately fall off after the top three F drivers and the majority of NASCAR racers will make more money than their F counterparts Most top IndyCar drivers are paid around a tenth of their Formula One counterparts br In the second quarter of Formula One reported a loss revenue of million and an income of million This was a result of the delay of the racing championship start as a result of the COVID pandemic The company grossed revenues of million for the same quarter the previous year br br br Future br br The expense of Formula One has seen the FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new regulations to lower the costs for a team to compete in the sport br Following their purchase of the commercial rights to the sport in Liberty Media announced their vision for the future of Formula One at the Bahrain Grand Prix The proposal identified five key areas including streamlining the governance of the sport emphasising cost effectiveness maintaining the sport s relevance to road cars and encouraging new manufacturers to enter the championship whilst enabling them to be competitive Liberty cited as their target date as it coincided with the need to renew commercial agreements with the teams and the end of the seven year cycle of engine development that started in br On August it was announced that all teams had signed the new Concorde Agreement This came into effect at the start of the season and changed how prize money and TV revenue is distributed br br br Environmental impact br Formula One has launched a plan to become carbon neutral by By all events should become sustainable including eliminating single use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused recycled or composted br A report conducted by Formula One estimated that the series was responsible for tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in the season finding that of emissions were from logistics and only were from emissions from the cars themselves br In January FIA and Formula One signed the United Nations Sports for Climate Action framework After the signing was announced FIA President Jean Todt said As an international Federation comprising members in countries and the leader in motor sport and mobility development we are fully committed to global environmental protection The signing of this UN Sports for Climate Action Framework reinforces the momentum that has been growing in our Federation for many years Since the introduction of the hybrid power unit in F to the creation of the Environment and Sustainability Commission the entire FIA community has been investing time energy and financial resources to the benefit of environmental innovations We aim to inspire greater awareness and best practice in sustainability motor sport standards br From the season all cars will increase the bio component of their fuel using E fuel rather than the of ethanol currently used This percentage is expected to grow again in the future In December the FIA claimed that it had developed a fuel with sustainability to be used in Formula One from either or when new engine regulations come into force br br br Social inequities br Prior to the beginning of the Formula One World Championship F announced and launched the WeRaceAsOne initiative The initiative primarily focuses on visible displays of solidarity in the fight against racism on Grand Prix Weekends as well as the creation of a Formula Task Force that will listen to people from across the paddock and make conclusions on the actions required to improve the diversity and opportunity in Formula at all levels The move spurs from the growing questions about racism and global inequalities perpetuated by the sport The year history of the World Championship has been dominated by European and white drivers with the first and only black driver Lewis Hamilton participating in the world championship since br In addition to organization wide measures individual teams have also acknowledged deficiencies in the sport s cultural and political activism During the season the Mercedes AMG Petronas F Team conducted a study of its racial composition and found that approximately of its workforce was white Due to the results of the study the team changed the car s livery to promote anti racism messages and also launched the Accelerate programme The program vows that approximately of all new hires to the team will come from underrepresented minorities in the sport until br The drivers on the grid have also stood in solidarity on multiple occasions in the fight against racism both on and off the track Following the murder of George Floyd in the summer of all twenty drivers wore End Racism shirts and took part in an organised anti racism protest during the pre race formalities In the year since Lewis Hamilton has remained vocal in his pre race attire with other drivers occasionally wearing change demanding clothing br br br Media coverage br br Formula One can be seen live or tape delayed in almost every country and territory and attracts one of the largest global television audiences The season attracted a global audience of million people per race The cumulative television audience was calculated to be billion for the season broadcast to territories br During the early s Formula One Group created a number of trademarks an official logo an official TV graphics package and in an official website for the sport in an attempt to give it a corporate identity br TV stations all take what is known as the World Feed either produced historically by the host broadcaster or by Formula One Management FOM The host broadcaster either had one feed for all or two separate feeds a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers The one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents while the two feed approach meant that replays for when returning from an ad break and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected br The only station that differed from this set up was DF re branded to Premiere then to Sky Deutschland a German channel which offers all sessions live and interactive with features such as the onboard and pit lane channels This service was purchased by Bernie Ecclestone at the end of and became F Digital Plus which was made more widely available around Europe until the end of when the cost of the digital interactive service was thought too much br On January F announced that it would adopt the HD format for the season br It was announced on July that Sky Sports and the BBC would team up to show the races in F from to Sky launched a dedicated channel Sky Sports F which covered all races live without commercial interruption as well as live practice and qualifying sessions along with F programming including interviews archive action and magazine shows In the BBC broadcast live coverage of half of the races in the season The BBC ended its television contract after the season three years earlier than planned The free to air TV rights were picked up by Channel until the end of the season Sky Sports F coverage remained unaffected and BBC Radio Live and Sports Extra coverage was extended until As of BBC Radio Live and Sports Extra has rights to such coverage until br While Sky Sports and Channel are the two major broadcasters of Formula other countries show Formula One races Many use commentary from either Sky Sports or Channel In most of Asia excluding China the two main broadcasters of Formula one includes the Fox network

supported streaming television FAST channel known as the Formula Channel in the United States which shows classic Grands Prix documentaries and analysis from past races br br br Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races br Currently the terms Formula One race and World Championship race are effectively synonymous Since every Formula One race has counted towards the World Championship and every World Championship race has been run to Formula One regulations However the two terms are not interchangeable br br The first Formula One race was held in whereas the World Championship did not start until br In the s and s there were many Formula One races that did not count for the World Championship in a total of twenty two Formula One races were held of which only six counted towards the World Championship The number of non championship Formula One events decreased throughout the s and s to the point where the last non championship Formula One race was the Race of Champions br The World Championship was not always exclusively composed of Formula One events br The World Championship was originally established as the World Championship for Drivers i e without the term Formula One in the title It only officially became the FIA Formula One World Championship in br From to the Indianapolis race counted towards the World Championship This race was run to American Automobile Association and later United States Automobile Club Championship Car regulations rather than to Formula One regulations Only one of the World Championship regulars Alberto Ascari in started at Indianapolis during this period br From to all races counting towards the World Championship except the Indianapolis were run to Formula Two regulations Formula One was not changed to Formula Two during this period the Formula One regulations remained the same and numerous non championship Formula One races were staged during this time br The distinction is most relevant when considering career summaries and all time lists For example in the List of Formula One drivers Clemente Biondetti is shown with a single race against his name Biondetti actually competed in four Formula One races in but only one of these counted for the World Championship br In the earlier history of Formula One many races took place outside the World Championship and local championships run to Formula One regulations also occurred These events often took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the World Championship and featured local cars and drivers as well as those competing in the championship br br br European non championship racing br In the early years of Formula One before the world championship was established there were around twenty races held from late Spring to early Autumn in Europe although not all of these were considered significant Most competitive cars came from Italy particularly Alfa Romeo After the start of the world championship these non championship races continued In the s and s there were many Formula One races which did not count for the World Championship in a total of twenty two Formula One races were held of which only six counted towards the World Championship In and when the world championship was run to Formula Two regulations non championship events were the only Formula One races that took place br Some races particularly in the UK including the Race of Champions Oulton Park International Gold Cup and the International Trophy were attended by the majority of the world championship contenders Other smaller events were regularly held in locations not part of the championship such as the Syracuse and Danish Grands Prix although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower Formula cars to make up the grid These became less common through the s and saw the last non championship Formula One race the Race of Champions at Brands Hatch won by reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams Cosworth in a close fight with American Danny Sullivan br br br South African Formula One championship br br South Africa s flourishing domestic
