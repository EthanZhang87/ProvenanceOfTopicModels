to emergency exits The ride s name was also officially shortened in Florida to Toy Story Mania just like Tokyo br Fall With the retiring of FastPass in California Florida a new plate of text reading Lightning Lane was installed at both parks covering the old ones br br br Technology br At its debut Toy Story Midway Mania was one of the most technologically sophisticated attractions yet developed by Walt Disney Imagineering costing an estimated million to design and build It marked the company s first use of industrial Ethernet for a ride s control system Many of the parts for the attraction s control system came from two of Disney s corporate sponsors Siemens AG from Spaceship Earth and Hewlett Packard from Mission Space The ride was the biggest system that had been built at the time and ran on one of Disney s most advanced automation systems to date br The control system is divided into three components one for the ride vehicles one for the games and one more for the attraction s special effects Programmable logic controllers in the vehicles alert the control system wirelessly via ProfiNET RT to the vehicle s speed and location The central controller then sends its instructions back to the vehicles using a hard wired network within the track The one way communications flow adds a factor of safety even though the wireless network is protected against outside interference such as a denial of service attack br The attraction features more than PCs which includes one HP Windows XP PC for each of Midway Mania s game screens as well as others that control the special effects at each game At the game screens two tracking systems provide the game control system with the vehicle s exact location making sure that gameplay is not affected by even minor differences in vehicle position According to Jody Gerstner executive director of show and ride controls The game doesn t care if the car parks in the same spot every time It just needs to know where each car has actually parked and it can compensate Additional sensors in the spring action shooter provide information on its orientation which is fine tuned using data on the position of the ride vehicle at the screen and the rotation of the seats on the vehicle base br All three sub systems work together to handle any contingency For example if a delay or other vehicle stoppage is detected such as might occur if the loading and unloading of the ride vehicles is taking longer than expected the control system can command the affected game screens to launch a non scoring practice round so that guests may continue to shoot targets while they wait Similarly it can instruct the show control system to play an audio spiel telling guests about the delay br As the games are software based changes can be made to the attraction s lineup of games without significant effort In April Disney Parks announced plans to replace Bo Peep s Baaa loon Pop with Rex and Trixie s Dino Darts The change took place on May The new game includes one of the new characters from the Toy Story feature film which was released in June br br br Locations br br Disney California Adventure Pixar Pier beneath the Incredicoaster roller coaster a space formerly occupied by themed midway games and food service locations The area is designed to resemble a Victorian era seaside carnival Pixar Pier replaced Paradise Pier on June and the attraction located in California is the main attraction of a Toy Story themed area in the new land br Disney s Hollywood Studios Toy Story Land inside the studios former soundstages which were most recently used for the park s Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Play It attraction The original facade as well as the original surrounding area resembles Pixar Animation Studios campus in Emeryville California The attraction s entrance was relocated to Toy Story Land on June with the Pixar Place area closing br Tokyo DisneySea Located in the New York area of the American Waterfront in a new area called Toyville Trolley Park br br br Operational changes br In October Disney s Hollywood Studios began testing a new procedure that would require all riders to have FastPass reservations for the attraction The test scheduled to last only a few days eliminated the standby line that is used by visitors who have not already obtained a FastPass ticket for the ride either because they had all been claimed or they were holding FastPasses for other attractions Some analysts suggest that this process could become more common in years to come as amusement parks attempt to keep guests from getting frustrated or waiting in extremely long lines br br br Name variation br The attraction is being referred to as both Toy Story Midway Mania and Toy Story Mania While the attraction marquees and some in park signage read the former the latter has been used in press releases to the news media used in both resorts advertisements and on the disneyland com disneyworld com and official promotional website for the attraction along with attraction merchandise Websites for both Disneyland and Walt Disney World both identified the attraction with the registered trademark Toy Story Midway Mania as of September As of February the attraction is known as Toy Story Mania except for the Disney California Adventure version which is still known as Toy Story Midway Mania br br br Music br Music for the queue area was arranged and recorded by Jennifer Hammond at Capitol Studios with a live orchestra More than an hour of music was recorded all based on the first two Toy Story
