aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a approval rating with an average rating of based on reviews The website s consensus reads Planes has enough bright colors goofy voices and slick animation to distract some young viewers for minutes and probably sell plenty of toys in the bargain but on nearly every other level it s a Disney disappointment Another review aggregator Metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of top reviews from mainstream critics calculated a score of based on reviews indicating generally unfavorable reviews However the film earned an average grade of A on an A to F scale from audiences polled by CinemaScore during the opening week br Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two and half stars out of four saying Many will enter theaters thinking this is a Pixar film with the raised expectations that accompany that mistake But even cynical animation fans will see there s quality here After a little turbulence Planes comes in for a nice landing Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a positive review saying As shameless an attempt by Disney to sell more bedspreads to the under s as Planes is it nonetheless manages to be a minor lark that will at least mildly amuse anyone who ever thrust their arms outward and pretended to soar over the landscape Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a negative review saying Planes is so overrun with broad cultural stereotypes that it should come with free ethnic sensitivity training for especially impressionable kids James Rocchi of MSN Movies gave the film one out of five stars saying Planes borrows a world from Cars but even compared to that soulless exercise in well merchandised animated automotive adventure Planes is dead in its big googly eyes and hollow inside Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review saying Despite the more aerodynamic setting this Cars D offshoot emerges as an uninspired retread Jordan Hoffman of the New York Daily News gave the film one out of five stars saying The jokes in Planes are runway flat and parents will likely reach for the air sickness bag br Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film two out of five stars saying Planes was originally scheduled to be released straight to video Although the smallest children might like bits and pieces of it there s nothing in the movie that suggests why Disney strayed from its original plan David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film one out of four stars saying The animated film has all the hallmarks of a straight to DVD project inferior plot dull writing cheap drawing perhaps because it was intended for the bargain bin at Target Walmart and Costco Jen Chaney of The Washington Post gave the film one and a half stars out of four saying This film is percent devoid of surprises It s the story of an underestimated underdog that s like every other kid friendly life coachy story about an underestimated underdog Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film one and a half stars out of four saying If Planes were a reasonably priced download you d gladly use it to sedate your kids during a long car ride As a theatrical D release however Planes will sedate you too Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times gave the film two out of five stars saying Planes is for the most part content to imitate rather than innovate presumably hoping to reap a respectable fraction of the box office numbers of Cars and Cars which together made hundreds of millions of dollars br Bruce Demara of the Toronto Star gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying While the plotting is rather pedestrian the humour mostly lame what makes Planes a stand out experience not surprisingly based on Disney s vast and impressive history of animated classics is the visuals Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars saying It s engaging enough driving home the familiar message of following one s dreams and the less hackneyed theme of facing one s fears But it feels far too familiar Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying As with Cars the world of Planes feels safe A little too safe perhaps Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film a C saying Planes moves along quickly at a running time of minutes occasionally taking flight with some pretty nifty flight sequences The animation is first rate and the Corningware colors are soothing eye candy br Tom Keogh of The Seattle Times gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying Though not officially a Pixar production the new Planes released by the beloved animation studio s parent company Disney has the look and feel of Pixar s hit Cars if not the latter s charm or strong story Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star Ledger gave the film two out of four stars saying It s strictly by the numbers from the believe in yourself moral to the purely predictable ending Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B saying What Planes lacks in novelty it makes up for with eye popping aerial sequences and a high flying comic spirit A A Dowd of The A V Club gave the film a D saying Planes cuts corners at every turn a strategy that leaves it feeling like the skeletal framework of an incomplete Pixar project R Kurt Osenlund of Slant Magazine gave the film one out of four stars saying The film feels second rate in every sense from the quality of its animation to its C list voice cast Dave Calhoun of Time Out gave the film three out of five stars saying Planes isn t a Pixar film even if it s related to one Disney bought Pixar in and there s nothing groundbreaking about the animation or script That said the characters and story still offer low key
