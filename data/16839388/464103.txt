title: Professional video camera
id: 464103
A professional video camera often called a television camera even though its use has spread beyond television is a high end device for creating electronic moving images as opposed to a movie camera that earlier recorded the images on film Originally developed for use in television studios or with outside broadcast trucks they are now also used for music videos direct to video movies see digital movie camera corporate and educational videos wedding videos among other uses Since the s most professional video cameras are digital instead of analog br br The distinction between professional video cameras and movie cameras narrowed as HD digital video cameras with sensors the same size as mm movie cameras plus dynamic range exposure latitude and color rendition approaching film quality were introduced in the late s Nowadays HDTV cameras designed for broadcast television news sports events and other works such as reality TV are termed as professional video cameras A digital movie camera is designed for movies or scripted television to record files that are then color corrected during post production The video signal from a professional video camera can be broadcast live or is meant to be edited quickly with little or no color or exposure adjustments needed br br br History br The earliest video cameras were mechanical flying spot scanners which were in use in the s and s during the period of mechanical television Improvements in video camera tubes in the s ushered in the era of electronic television Earlier cameras were very large devices almost always in two sections The camera section held the lens and camera tube pre amplifiers and other necessary electronics and was connected to a large diameter multicore cable to the remainder of the camera electronics usually mounted in a separate room in the studio or a remote truck The camera head could not generate a video picture signal on its own The video signal was output to the studio for switching and transmission By the fifties electronic miniaturization had progressed to the point where some monochrome cameras could operate standalone and even be handheld But the studio configuration remained with the large cable bundle transmitting the signals back to the camera control unit CCU The CCU in turn was used to align and operate the camera s functions such as exposure system timing video and black levels br br The first color cameras s in the US early s in Europe notably the RCA TK series were much more complex with their three and in some models four pickup tubes and their size and weight drastically increased Handheld color cameras did not come into general use until the early s the first generation of cameras were split into a camera head unit the body of the camera containing the lens and pickup tubes and held on the shoulder or a body brace in front of the operator connected via a cable bundle to a backpack CCU br br The Ikegami HL the RCA TKP and the Thomson Microcam were portable two piece color cameras introduced in the early s For field work a separate VTR was still required to record the camera s video output Typically this was either a portable reel to reel VTR or a portable U matic VCR Typically the two camera units would be carried by the camera operator while a tape operator would carry the portable recorder With the introduction of the RCA TK in camera operators were finally able to carry on their shoulders a one piece camera containing all the electronics to output a broadcast quality composite video signal A separate videotape recording unit was still required br Electronic news gathering ENG cameras replaced the mm film cameras for TV news production from the s onwards because the cost of shooting on film was significantly more than shooting on a reusable tape Portable video tape production also enabled much faster turnaround time for the quick completion of news stories compared to the need to chemically process film before it could be shown or edited However some news feature stories for weekly news magazine shows continued to use mm film cameras until the s br At first all these cameras used tube based sensors but charge coupled device CCD imagers came on the scene in the mid s bringing numerous benefits Early CCD cameras could not match the colour or resolution of their tube counterparts but the benefits of CCD technology such as introducing smaller and lightweight cameras a better and more stable image that was not prone to image burn in or lag and no need for registration meant development on CCD imagers quickly took off and once rivaling and offering a superior image to a tube sensor began displacing tube based cameras the latter of which were all but disused by the early s Eventually cameras with the recorder permanently mated to the camera head became the norm for ENG In studio cameras the camera electronics shrank and CCD imagers replaced the pickup tubes The thick multi core cables connecting the camera head to the CCU were replaced in the late seventies with triax connections a slender video cable that carried multiple video signals intercom audio and control circuits and could be run for a mile or more As the camera innards shrunk the electronics no longer dictated the size of the enclosure however the box shape remained as it is necessary to hold the large studio lenses teleprompters electronic viewfinder EVF and other paraphernalia needed for studio and sports production Electronic Field Production cameras were often mounted in studio configurations inside a mounting cage This cage supported the additional studio accessories br In the late s as HDTV broadcasting commenced HDTV cameras suitable for news and general purpose work were introduced Though they delivered much better image quality their overall operation was identical to their standard definition predecessors New methods of recording for cameras were introduced to supplant video tape tapeless cameras Ikegami and Avid introduced EditCam in based on interchangeable hard drives Panasonic introduced P cameras These recorded a DVCPro signal on interchangeable flash memory media Several other data storage device recording systems were introduced notably XDCAM from Sony Sony also introduced SxS S by S a flash memory standard compliant to the Sony and Sandisk created ExpressCard standard Eventually flash storage largely supplanted other forms of recording media br In s major manufacturers like Sony Philips introduced the digital professional video cameras These cameras used CCD sensors and recorded video digitally on flash storage These were followed by digital HDTV cameras As digital technology improved and also due to digital television transition digital professional video cameras have become dominant in television studios ENG EFP and even in other areas since s CCD sensors were eventually replaced by CMOS sensors br br br Chronology br br to cameras were a type of flying spot scanner using mechanical disk br saw the arrival of RCA s iconoscope camera br RCA s TK studio camera used a IO Image Orthicon tube with a lens turret The RCA TK was widely used as a field camera A TK is simply a TK with a portable camera control unit br The Dumont Marconi MK IV was an Image Orthicon camera Marconi s first camera was shown in EMI cameras from the UK were used in the US in the early s like the EMI Later in the s the EMI and EMI br In the arrival of the Vidicon camera tube made smaller cameras possible saw the first Walkie Lookie portable cameras Image Orthicon tubes were still used till the arrival of the Plumbicon br The RCA TK is considered to be the first color television camera for broadcasts in RCA continued its lead in the high end camera market till the TK last of the high end tube cameras from RCA br RCA s TK studio camera used a IO Image Orthicon tube with a four lens turret The RCA TK was widely used as a field camera A TK is simply a TK with a portable camera control unit There is some commonality between the TK TK and the earlier TK TK br Ikegami introduced the first truly portable hand held TV camera in br Philips line of Norelco cameras were also very popular with models such as PC PC and PCP Handheld Major US broadcaster CBS was a notable early customer of the PC and PC units Philips BTS Broadcast Television Systems Inc later came out with an LDK line of camera like its last high end tube camera the LDK Philips invented the Plumbicon pick up video camera tube in that gave tube cameras a cleaner picture BTS introduced its first handHeld Frame transfer CCD Charge coupled device CCD camera the LDK in br Bosch Fernseh marketed a line of high end cameras KCU KCN KCP KCK in the US ending with the tube camera KCK Image Transform in Universal City California used specially modified frame KCK for their Image Vision system This had a MHz bandwidth almost twice NTSC bandwidth This was a custom pre HDTV video System At its peak this system was used to make Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl in This was the first major high definition analog wideband videotape to film post production using a film recorder for film out br In the s major manufacturers like Sony Philips introduced the flash storage based digital television cameras Since the s these digital cameras have become most widely used of all other systems br br br Usage types br Most professional cameras utilize an optical prism block directly behind the lens This prism block a trichroic assembly comprising two dichroic prisms separates the image into the three primary colors red green and blue directing each color into a separate charge coupled device CCD or Active pixel sensor CMOS image sensor mounted to the face of each prism Some high end consumer cameras also do this producing a higher resolution image with better color fidelity than is normally possible with just a single video pickup br In both single sensor Bayer filter and triple sensor designs the weak signal created by the sensors is amplified before being encoded into analog signals for use by the viewfinder and also encoded into digital signals for transmission and recording The analog outputs were normally in the form of either a composite video signal which combined the color and luminance information to a single output or an R Y B Y Y component video output through three separate connectors br br br Studio cameras br br Most television studio cameras stand on the floor usually with pneumatic or hydraulic mechanisms called pedestals to adjust the height and position in the studio The cameras in a multiple camera setup are controlled by a device known as a camera control unit CCU to which they are connected via a triax fibre optic or the almost obsolete multicore cable The CCU along with genlock and other equipment is installed in the central apparatus room CAR of the television studio A remote control panel in the production control room PCR for each camera is then used by the vision engineer s to balance the pictures br When used outside a formal television studio in outside broadcasting OB they are often on tripods that may or may not have wheels depending on the model of the tripod Initial models used analog technology but are now obsolete supplanted by digital models br Studio cameras are light and small enough to be taken off the pedestal and the lens changed to a smaller size to be used handheld on a camera operator s shoulder but they still have no recorder of their own and are cable bound Cameras can also be mounted on a tripod a dolly or a crane thus making the cameras much more versatile than previous generations of studio cameras These cameras have a tally light a small signal lamp used that indicates for the benefit of those being filmed as well as the camera operator that the camera is live i e its signal is being used for the main program at that moment br br br ENG cameras br br ENG electronic news gathering video cameras were originally designed for use by news camera operators While they have some similarities to the smaller consumer camcorder they differ in several regards br br ENG cameras are larger and heavier helps dampen small movements and usually supported by a camera shoulder support or shoulder stock on the camera operator s shoulder taking the weight off the hand which is freed to operate the zoom lens control br The camera mounts on tripods with Fluid heads and other supports with a quick release plate br CCDs or CMOS active pixel sensors are used one for each of the primary colors br They have interchangeable lenses br The lens is focused manually and directly without intermediate servo controls However the lens zoom and focus can be operated with remote controls with a television studio configuration operated by a camera control unit CCU br A rotating behind the lens filter wheel for selecting an A and neutral density filters br Controls that need quick access are on hard physical switches all in the same general place on the camera irrespective of the camera manufacturer such as Gain Select White Black balance color bar select and record start controls and not in menu selection br All settings white balance focus and iris can be manually adjusted and automatics can be completely disabled br Professional BNC connectors for video out and genlock in br Can operate an electronic viewfinder EVF or external CRT viewfinder br At least two XLR input connectors for audio are included br Direct slot in for portable wireless microphones br Audio is adjusted manually with easily accessed physical knobs br A complete time code section is available allowing time presets multiple camera setups can be time code synchronized or jam synced to a master clock br Bars and tone are available in camera the SMPTE color bars Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers Bars a reference signal that simplifies calibration of monitors and setting levels when duplicating and transmitting the picture br Recording is to a professional medium like some variant of Betacam or DVCPRO or Direct to disk recording or flash memory If as in the latter two it s a data recording much higher data rates or less video compression are used than in consumer devices br br br EFP cameras br br Electronic field production cameras are similar to studio cameras in that they are used primarily in multiple camera switched configurations but outside the studio environment for concerts sports and live news coverage of special events These versatile cameras can be carried on the shoulder or mounted on camera pedestals and cranes with the large very long focal length zoom lenses made for studio camera mounting These cameras have no recording ability on their own and transmit their signals back to the broadcast truck through a fiber optic triax radio frequency or the virtually obsolete multicore cable br br br Others br br Remote cameras are typically very small camera heads designed to be operated by remote control Despite their small size they are often capable of performance close to that of the larger ENG and EFP types br Block cameras are so called because the camera head is a small block often smaller than the lens itself Some block cameras are completely self contained while others only contain the sensor block and its pre amps thus requiring connection to a separate camera control unit in order to operate All the functions of the camera can be controlled from a distance and often there is a facility for controlling the lens focus and zoom as well These cameras are mounted on pan and tilt heads and may be placed in a stationary position such as atop a pole or tower in a corner of a broadcast booth or behind a basketball hoop They can also be placed on robotic dollies at the end of camera booms and cranes or flown in a cable supported harness as shown in the illustration br Lipstick cameras are so called because the lens and sensor block combined are similar in size and appearance to a lipstick container These are either hard mounted in a small location such as a race car or on the end of a boom pole The sensor block and lens are separated from the rest of the camera electronics by a long thin multi conductor cable The camera settings are manipulated from this box while the lens settings are normally set when the camera is mounted in place br br br See also br br br br br br Bibliography br Zettl H Television Production Handbook Thomson Wadsworth ISBN br br br External links br br
