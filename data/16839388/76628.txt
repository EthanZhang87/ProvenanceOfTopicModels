of four different segments Donald Duck stars in two of them and Goofy stars in one It also features the first appearance of Jos Carioca the Brazilian cigar smoking parrot Saludos Amigos premiered in Rio de Janeiro on August It was released in the United States on February br Commissioned by the United States Department of State as part of the Good Neighbor policy the film is a notable example of American propaganda promoting goodwill towards Latin America The film was a success helping launch the international popularity of Donald Duck and leading Disney to produce The Three Caballeros another government funded film aimed at Latin American goodwill br br br Background br br In early before U S entry into World War II the United States Department of State commissioned a Disney goodwill tour of South America intended to lead to a movie to be shown in the US Central and South America as part of the Good Neighbor Policy This was being done because several Latin American governments had close ties with Nazi Germany and the US government wanted to counteract those ties Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters were popular in Latin America and Walt Disney acted as ambassador The tour facilitated by Nelson Rockefeller who had recently been appointed as Coordinator of Inter American Affairs CIAA took Disney and a group of roughly twenty composers artists technicians etc from his studio to South America mainly to Brazil and Argentina but also to Chile Bolivia and Peru br The film itself was given federal loan guarantees because the Disney studio had over expanded just before European markets were closed to them by the war and because Disney was struggling with labor unrest at the time including a strike that was underway at the time the goodwill journey began br The film included live action documentary sequences featuring footage of modern Latin American cities with skyscrapers and fashionably dressed residents This surprised many contemporary US viewers who associated such images only with US and European cities and contributed to a changing impression of Latin America Film historian Alfred Charles Richard Jr has commented that Saludos Amigos did more to cement a community of interest between peoples of the Americas in a few months than the State Department had in fifty years br The film also inspired Chilean cartoonist Ren R os Boettiger to create Condorito one of Latin America s most ubiquitous cartoon characters R os perceived that the character Pedro a small incapable airplane was a slight to Chileans and created a comic that could supposedly rival Disney s comic characters br br br Film segments br This film features four different segments each of which begin with various clips of the Disney artists roaming the country drawing cartoons of some of the local cultures and scenery they see br br br Lake Titicaca br In this segment the Disney artists make a cartoon where Donald Duck visits Lake Titicaca in Bolivia and Peru and meets some of the locals including an obstinate llama as an American tourist When Donald tries to ride the llama over a bridge he ends up falling into the sea and rows away in pots and pans br br br Pedro br Pedro is a story about a small anthropomorphic airplane from an airport near Santiago Chile engaging in his first flight to retrieve air mail from Mendoza with disastrous consequences He manages to safely return to the airfield with the mail which happens to be a single postcard RKO Pictures released this particular segment as a theatrical short on May br Chilean cartoonist Ren R os Boettiger known popularly as Pepo was disappointed with how the character Pedro represented his country In response he developed the character Condorito who went on to become one of the most iconic comic magazine characters in Latin America br br br El Gaucho Goofy br In this segment American cowboy Goofy gets taken from Texas to the Argentinian pampas by the Narrator to learn the ways of the native gaucho This segment was later edited for the film s Gold Classic Collection VHS DVD release to remove one scene in which Goofy is shown smoking a cigarette
