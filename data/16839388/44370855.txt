Dawn and her elf friend Sunny are nearly devoured by a giant lizard before Marianne rescues them After falling through the border and into the Dark Forest Sunny finds a primrose petal and hides it At the Spring Ball Roland tries to win back Marianne who angrily drives him away Roland consults his warriors who jokingly tell him to procure the love potion to woo Marianne Roland then encounters Sunny

Bog interrupts the celebrations and captures Dawn just as she is sprayed by the love potion and the imp steals it in order to spread it throughout the forest Bog orders them to deliver the potion to

and Marianne finally admit their feelings for each other and kiss br br br Voice cast br br br Production br George Lucas had long wanted to make a film for his three daughters with the original idea for the movie being generated years prior He described the film as Star Wars for a female audience stating Star Wars was for year old boys I figured I d make one for year old girls On the film s plot co writer and director Gary Rydstrom stated We pitched it as a Beauty and the Beast story where the Beast doesn t change According to Rydstrom Lucas who ultimately served as executive producer and story writer on the project really wanted to make a beautiful fairy tale with goblins and elves and do it in a way that only this company can do He had been working on it for a long time Rydstrom mentioned that Lucas emphasized that the story should be about finding beauty in strange places Rydstrom also stated It was important for him to tell this story where you saw the beauty in something you didn t expect to see that it looked ugly on the outside but you saw the beauty underneath The film was in the works for years including at one point development alongside the Star Wars prequels Before The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in late production on Strange Magic was already well underway The crew including Rydstrom screened the film for Disney executives Rydstrom stated We re not Pixar or Disney Animation so in some ways George was our John Lasseter on this one I like the fact not that I don t like advice from all over but this is our own thing this is a Lucasfilm project I remember when Labyrinth came out and how exciting that was There was a magic to that this has the same vibe to me br One of the biggest inspirations for the film s soundtrack was another Lucasfilm production American Graffiti For Strange Magic Lucas revealed I had a lot of Beatles songs in there originally but we couldn t afford them Many of the songs that did make it into the film were tweaked to help tell the story such as Bad Romance which became a march for an invading army and I ll Never Fall in Love Again which was made into a warrior anthem for Marianne According to Lucas the main message of the film is that A real relationship rests in a much deeper place where you love somebody and you ve thought through it carefully as you ve been carrying on conversations and doing things You fall in love with their mind and everything else more than just the way they look At one point during production the crew experimented with the idea of having the entirety of the dialogue sung br The hair design of sisters Marianne and Dawn went through several revisions According to Meredith Anne Bull the voice of Dawn The sisters hair has changed a lot since the beginning we used to have long brown hair It was red for a while and now it has ended up short and blonde There s a lot of work that goes into creating the hair of an animated character There are actually groups of people where that s their only job to do the animation of hair That was really cool learning that On the subject of voice recording Bull stated There s just a lot of really cool stuff that our director would show us tricks and stuff to do when we were recording Special effects with our mouths or by chewing stuff One time I watched Peter Stormare chew an entire pack of gum while he was trying to record Bull also noted that while recording she did not have many visuals to reference For the first year of production I really had no idea sometimes they would have drawings but other than that I just had to use my imagination of what was going on br br br Music br br The film s soundtrack includes cast performances of new versions of pop and classic rock songs which were chosen for the film by George Lucas The soundtrack was released by Buena Vista Records on January followed by a physical release on February br Additionally there are songs used in the film but not in the album An instrumental of People Are Strange can be heard during the mushrooms first spread messages through the bog forest and the chorus from Bad Romance is used as a march for an invading army br br br Track listing br br

terrible character design combined with a painful lack of laughs and a crushing plethora of ghastly songs makes Strange Magic perhaps the worst animated feature ever to come out of Disney Conversely Drew Taylor of Indiewire gave the film a B stating in his review Strange Magic does manage to enchant you mostly with its oddball charm Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a negative review saying This noisy unappealing children s fantasy fails to distinguish itself among January s many many reasons to steer clear of the multiplex Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice described Strange Magic as the best Lucas film in years funny idiosyncratic hippy dippy packed with creatures and visions worth beholding Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter called the film A shrill garish hodgepodge of familiar elements from other animated vehicles most evidently s Epic there s virtually nothing about this forced fractured fairy tale that feels remotely fresh or involving Michael Ordo a of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film one out of four stars saying The plot movement feels very much like an unpleasant formality shoved forward by tiresome devices Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars saying Strange Magic is strange all right but hardly magical Jesse Hassenger of The A V Club gave the film a B saying The movie maintains its own level of oddball invention that at least feels pleasantly removed from the grind of big studio cartoon manufacturing Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film one out of four stars saying A noxious cauldron of ingredients that shouldn t have been mixed fairies Shakespeare and classic rock br Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review saying Strange Magic the new animated musical fairy tale from the mind and the mixtape of George Lucas is indeed strange What s missing is the magic Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times gave the film a negative review saying Said to be inspired by A Midsummer Night s Dream the film plays more like Avatar scored to a karaoke competition Bilge Ebiri of New York magazine gave the film a negative review saying The problem with Strange Magic isn t so much its derivative story as it is the odd half complete way it unfolds You can sense the weird mixture of tones influences ideas as if the whole thing were still in its planning stages Glenn Kenny of RogerEbert com gave the film one and a half stars out of four saying Strange Magic is essentially a jukebox musical so song laden as to practically be an operetta and the songs are so eclectic that they never quite fit into the movie s flying insect world which is divided into dark and light forests Keith Phipps of The Dissolve gave the film one and a half stars out of five saying Strange Magic certainly isn t an ordinary sort of mess and the personal nature of the project is still evident in the finished film br br br Accolades br Rudolph received a nomination for Best Voice Performance at
