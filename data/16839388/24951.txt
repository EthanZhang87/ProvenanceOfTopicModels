Sony cited security concerns as the rationale The firmware update was mandatory for access to the PlayStation Network br The removal caused some controversy as the update removed officially advertised features from already sold products and gave rise to several class action lawsuits aimed at making Sony return the feature or provide compensation br On December U S District Judge Richard Seeborg dismissed the last remaining count of the class action lawsuit other claims in the suit had previously been dismissed stating As a legal matter plaintiffs have failed to allege facts or articulate a

year bug br On March UTC many of the original PlayStation models worldwide were experiencing errors related to their internal system clock The error had many symptoms Initially the main problem seemed

PS models could connect to PSN successfully and the clock no longer showed December Sony stated that the affected models incorrectly identified as a leap year because of a bug in the BCD method of storing the date However for some users the hardware s operating system clock mainly updated from the internet and not associated with the internal clock needed to be updated manually or by re syncing it via the internet br On June Sony released PS system software update which improved the functionality of the internal clock to properly account for leap years br br br Features br br br PlayStation

PSN members two free downloadable PS games and a free one year enrollment in an identity theft protection program br br br Sales and production costs br br Although its PlayStation predecessors had been very dominant against the competition and were hugely profitable for Sony PlayStation had an inauspicious start and Sony chairman and CEO Sir Howard Stringer initially could not convince investors of a turnaround in its fortunes The PS lacked the unique gameplay of the more affordable Wii which became that generation s most successful console in terms of units sold Furthermore PS had to compete directly with Xbox which had a market head start and as a result the platform no longer had exclusive titles that the PS enjoyed such as the Grand Theft Auto and Final Fantasy series regarding cross platform games Xbox versions were generally considered superior in although by the PS versions had reached parity or surpassed and it took longer than expected for PS to enjoy strong sales and close the gap with Xbox Sony also continued to lose money on each PS sold through although the redesigned slim PS cut these losses br PlayStation s initial production cost is estimated by iSuppli to have been US for the GB model and US for the GB model However they were priced at US and US respectively meaning that units may have been sold at an estimated loss of or depending on model if the cost estimates were correct and thus may have contributed to Sony s games division posting an operating loss of billion US billion in the fiscal year ending March In April soon after these results were published Ken Kutaragi President of Sony Computer Entertainment announced plans to retire Various news agencies including The Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that this was due to poor sales while SCEI maintains that Kutaragi had been planning his retirement for six months prior to the announcement br In January Kaz Hirai CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment suggested that the console may start making a profit by early stating that the next fiscal year starts in April and if we can try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing and that profitability is not a definite commitment but that is what I would like to try to shoot for However market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that PlayStation could be profitable by August In a July interview Hirai stated that his objective is for PlayStation to sell million units by its ninth year surpassing PlayStation s sales of million in its nine years on the market In January Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q br br After the system s launch production costs were reduced significantly as a result of phasing out the Emotion Engine chip and falling hardware costs The cost of manufacturing Cell microprocessors had fallen dramatically as a result of moving to the nm production process and Blu ray Disc diodes had become cheaper to manufacture As of January each unit cost around to manufacture by August Sony had reduced costs by a total of meaning it only cost Sony around per unit br br br Critical reception br Early PlayStation reviews after launch were critical of its high price and lack of quality games Game developers regarded the architecture as difficult to program for PS was however commended for its hardware including its Blu ray home theater capabilities and graphics potential br Critical and commercial reception to PS improved over time after a series of price revisions Blu ray s victory over HD DVD and the release of several well received titles Ars Technica s original launch review gave PS only a but second review of the console in June rated it a In September IGN named PlayStation the th best gaming console of

said The PS is a total disaster on so many levels I think it s really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted He continued I d say even at this late date they should just cancel it and do a do over Just say This was a horrible disaster and we re sorry and we re going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that Valve is interested in developing for the console and is looking to hire talented PS programmers for future projects He later restated Valve s position Until we have the ability to get a PS team together until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that I don t really see us moving to that platform At Sony s E

on the PlayStation Kotick also claimed that Activision Blizzard may stop supporting the system if the situation is not addressed Sony has to cut the PS s retail price because if they don t the attach rates are likely to slow If we are being realistic we might have to stop supporting Sony Kotick received heavy criticism for the statement notably from developer BioWare who questioned the wisdom of

out of five stars praising its Blu ray capabilities GB hard drive free online gaming service and more affordable pricing point but complained about the lack of backward compatibility for PlayStation

large been tastefully done and said It s nothing short of a massive win for Sony br br br Super Slim model br The Super Slim model of PS has received positive reviews Gaming website Spong praised the new Super Slim s quietness stating The most noticeable noise comes when the drive seeks a new area of the disc such as when starting to load a game and this occurs infrequently They added that the fans are quieter than those of Slim and went on to praise the new smaller lighter size br Criticism was placed on the new disc loader stating The cover can be moved by hand if you wish there s also an eject button to do the work for you but there is no software eject from the triangle button menus in the Xross Media Bar XMB interface In addition you have to close the cover by hand which can be a bit fiddly if it s upright and the PS won t start reading a disc unless you do close the cover They also said there is no real drop in retail price br Tech media website CNET gave new Super Slim out of stars Excellent saying The Super Slim PlayStation shrinks a powerful gaming machine into an even tinier package while maintaining the same features as its predecessors a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services whilst also criticising the cheap design and disc loader stating Sometimes the cover doesn t catch and you feel like you re using one of those old credit card imprinter machines In short it feels cheap You don t realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they re gone Whether it was to cut costs or save space this move is ultimately a step back The criticism also was due to price stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive should not be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is the easiest yet Simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay which can quickly be unscrewed They also stated that whilst the Super Slim model is not in any way an upgrade it could be an indicator as to what s to come It may not be revolutionary but the Super Slim PS is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package There doesn t seem to be any reason for existing PS owners to upgrade but for the prospective PS buyer the Super Slim is probably the way to go if you can deal with not having a slot loading disc drive br Pocket Lint gave Super Slim a very positive review saying It s much more affordable brilliant gaming second to none video and media player They think it is A blinding good console and one that will serve you for years to come with second hand games and even new releases Without doubt if you don t have a PS this is the time to buy They gave Super Slim and a half stars out of br Technology magazine T gave the Super Slim model a positive review stating the console is almost nostalgic in the design similarities to the original fat model While we don t know whether it will play PS games or Blu ray discs any differently yet the look and feel of the new PS Slim is an obvious homage to the original PS minus the considerable excess weight Immediately we would be concerned about the durability of the top loading tray that feels like it could be yanked straight out off the console but ultimately it all feels like Sony s nostalgic way of signing off the current generation console in anticipation for the PS br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br br br Official websites br Asia Archived March at
