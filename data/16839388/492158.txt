Pocahontas director Mike Gabriel considered adapting Western legends such as Annie Oakley Buffalo Bill and Pecos Bill into animated films While he pitched both projects at the Gong Show meeting the executives were more interested in Pocahontas which went into production first When Pocahontas was finished Gabriel went back to his Western pitch and came up with an idea that might combine Captains Courageous with a Western The initial story involved a young boy from the Far East whose father owns a railroad and sends his son to the Western United States to teach him maturity According to Gabriel the train gets held up by outlaws over a train trestle and the little boy gets knocked off the train He splashes in the river and ends up on a cattle drive Gabriel developed his story into a forty page film treatment which was well received by then Feature Animation president Peter Schneider Soon after the project then titled Sweating Bullets went into development br Inspired by the song Ghost Riders in the Sky the story was then revised into a supernatural western about a timid cowboy who visits a ghost town and confronts an undead cattle hustler named Slim In this version he and the Willies rode their ghost herds through the clouds and constantly drove livestock off cliffs to increase their herd It was later reconceived into a story about a little bull named Bullets that wanted to be more like the horses that led the herd In in an attempt to salvage the production and retain the existing characters and background art story artist Michael LaBash suggested a different approach to the story with one that involved three cow protagonists who become bounty hunters to save the farm Building on the idea fellow story artists Sam Levine Mark Kennedy Robert Lence and Shirley Pierce developed a new storyline However by October Gabriel and co director Mike Giaimo were removed from the project because of persistent story problems Will Finn who had returned to Disney Feature Animation after co directing The Road to El Dorado at DreamWorks Animation and John Sanford were hired as the new directors br By this point there were twelve storyboard artists and four screenwriters including David Reynolds working on the film Finn and Sanford decided to downsize the writing team with Reynolds later being recruited to write the Finding Nemo screenplay At one point the story incorporated elements from the Pied Piper story Following a suggestion by Alan Menken Alameda Slim was reconceived into a cattle huster who used his yodeling talents to hypnotize and abscond with the herd The character Pearl Gesner who was to be voiced by Sarah Jessica Parker was rewritten into an elderly woman Relatively late into production the character Maggie was also rewritten to make her an outsider to the other farm animals in order to differentiate the group dynamic br br br Music br br In February Alan Menken had signed a long term agreement with the Walt Disney Studios to compose songs and or scores for animated and live action films Following this according to Menken he was attached to provide music for Sweating Bullets maybe a year and a half after Hercules Shortly after winning the ASCAP Foundation Richard Rodgers New Horizons Award lyricist Glenn Slater was brought to the attention of Menken who invited Slater to work with him on Sweating Bullets br Together they wrote the first of the film s six original songs back in the first of which was Little Patch of Heaven recorded by k d lang before Finn and Sanford were brought on board as directors The villain song Yodel Adle Eedle Idle Oo which incorporates the William Tell Overture Beethoven s Ninth Symphony and the Overture into the yodel dance was added following several story changes throughout production Although Randy Quaid did his own singing for Yodel Adle Eedle Idle Oo including the consonants heard during the yodels the vowel sounds in the yodeling were overdubbed from ghost singers Randy Erwin and Kerry Christianson two world champion yodelers Following the September attacks Menken composed the song Will the Sun Ever Shine Again in reaction which was performed by Bonnie Raitt br The soundtrack album of the film was released on March by Walt Disney Records It contains vocal songs performed by k d lang Randy Quaid Bonnie Raitt Tim McGraw and The Beu Sisters along with the film s score composed by Alan Menken br br br Songs br Original songs performed in the film include br br br Release br Home on the Range was initially scheduled for a release while Brother Bear was originally slated for a spring release However Disney announced that the release dates were switched with both movies Contrary to speculation news writer Jim Hill stated the release date switch was not because Home on the Range was suffering from story rewrites but to promote Brother Bear on the Platinum Edition release of The Lion King br br br Home media br Home on the Range was released on VHS and DVD on September The DVD came with an animated short A Dairy Tale a series of little shorts called the Joke Corral and animated intros to the DVD menu All three featuring the voice cast from the film The film was released on Blu ray on July br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes of critics reviews are positive with an average rating of The website s consensus reads Though Home on the Range is likeable and may keep young children diverted it s one of Disney s more middling titles with garish visuals and a dull plot On Metacritic the film has a score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Nathan Rabin reviewing for The A V Club praised the film describing it as a sweet raucously funny comic Western that corrects a glaring historical injustice by finally surveying the Old West through the eyes of cows rather than cowboys Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film stars out of saying that A movie like this is fun for kids bright quick paced with broad outrageous characters But Home on the Range doesn t have the crossover quality of the great Disney films like Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King And it doesn t have the freshness and originality of a more traditional movie like Lilo Stitch Its real future I suspect lies in home video It s only minutes long but although kids will like it their parents will be sneaking looks at their watches Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote favorably in her review that Home on the Range is a throwback to old Disney cartoons fun rather than message laden with broad humor and entertaining action The cheerful plucky characters have heart and loyalty and that s enough to make this a worthy family friendly animated fest Nell Minow of Common Sense Media gave the film four out of five stars saying that I love it when Disney doesn t take itself too seriously No one tried to reach for the stars or make this into a classic Home on the Range is just a cute little story about some not so contented cows who save the day It modestly aspires to be nothing more than a lot of fun and it does that job very well br Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times criticized the weak comedy writing that Unrestrained energy is hardly a bad thing for animation the best cartoons are built on the contradictory pursuit of meticulously arranged anarchy but they never seem needy or desperate for laughs as Home on the Range does The film seems hungrier for a pat on the head than a chuckle Similarly Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan claimed Home on the Range may be acceptable on reflection but its formulaic desire to mix wisecracks for adults with pratfalls for kids is feeling thin and its overall air of frantic hysteria does not wear well either Michael Wilmington of The Chicago Tribune noted Satirizing the movie Western can make for a great cartoon as it does in Jiri Trnka s brilliant Czech short Song of the Prairie a puppet version of Stagecoach But Home isn t good satire or good slapstick It does have those lyrical catchy Menken tunes and the film perks up whenever Raitt or lang sing one of them But much of this movie is deadly Home keeps milking the same gags and throwing the same bull and after a while you feel cowed watching it br br br Box office br On its opening box office weekend Home on the Range grossed about million in box office estimates opening fourth behind Scooby Doo Monsters Unleashed Walking Tall and Hellboy Following the disappointing box office weekend financial analysts predicted that Disney would be forced to write down the production costs which totaled more than million Following the latter release of The Alamo which also met poor box office returns it was reported that Disney would have to write down about million The film ended its box office run with million in domestic
