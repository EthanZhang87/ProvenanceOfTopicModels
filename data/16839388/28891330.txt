beloved old filmmaking style the film mostly feels like second generation photocopies of things Burton has done before Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars writing that it is not one of Burton s best but it has zealous energy and the charm of a boy and his dog retains its appeal Chris Packham of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review saying Frankenweenie scripted by John August and based on a screenplay by Lenny Ripps from Burton s original story is tight and brief hitting all the marks you d expect from an animated kid s film and enlivened by Burton s visual style The man should make more small movies like this one Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film three out of four stars saying Revisiting the past his own and that of the masters who came before him seems to have brought this filmmaker s boyish enthusiasm back to life as well Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic gave the film three out of five stars saying It s all perfectly entertaining but never really reaches the heights of hilarity perhaps because everything about the plot is underdeveloped Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A saying The resulting homage to Frankenstein in particular and horror movies in general is exquisite macabre mayhem and a kind of reanimation all its own br Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying The monster movie component of Frankenweenie stomps all over the appeal of the original minute version Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star gave the film three out of four stars saying High concept and stylish Frankenweenie is a playlist of films and characters from Burton s movie loving childhood James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four

three out of four stars saying Some audiences might feel that Frankenweenie is creaky but those on the same wavelength as Burton will gratefully declare it s alive Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the

Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of five saying Frankenweenie is enlivened with beguiling visuals and captivating action sequences The science is murky at best but the underlying themes are profound and the story is equal parts funny and poignant It s Burton s most moving film Rafer Guzm n of Newsday gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying It s a quintessential Burton film but also more Disney than a lot of Disney films Amy Biancolli of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars saying The overall effect is great cinema good fun a visual feast for pie eyed Burton fans and a terrifically warped reminder of just how freaky a PG film can be br Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of five stars saying Burton s extraordinary powers of imagination are in dazzling bloom from the gorgeous stop motion animation to the goofy homemade horror movies the children direct Peter Travers of Rolling

distinctive creature pieced together from the essential bits of the minute original But he just doesn t know when to stop and his overgrown creation gets the better of him Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times gave the film three out of five stars saying There are so many horror auteurs Burton wants to thank that the film is absolutely bursting at the seams with knowing nods A O Scott of The New York Times gave the film three out of five stars saying While Frankenweenie is fun it is not nearly strange or original enough to join the undead monstrous ranks of the classics it adores br Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film four out of four stars saying Frankenweenie is a mere minutes long which turns out to be just the right length there s not enough time for Burton to go off the rails as he does in so many of his films Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film a B saying Frankenweenie may just be a wacky horror cartoon but it s an awfully good wacky horror cartoon Frighteningly good you might say Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review saying This D black and white family comedy is the year s most inventive endearing animated feature Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star Ledger gave the film four out of four stars saying The stop motion animation a favorite tool of Burton s is given loving attention and the character design is full of terrific touches such as the hulking flat topped schoolmate who looks a bit like a certain man made monster Michael O Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars saying Designed to appeal to both discriminating adults and older kids the gorgeous black and white stop motion film is a fresh clever and affectionate love letter to classic horror movies Moira Macdonald of
