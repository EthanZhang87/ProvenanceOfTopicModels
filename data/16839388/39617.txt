id: 39617
In the United Kingdom and the British Overseas Territories personal bravery achievement or service are rewarded with honours The honours system consists of three types of award br br Honours are used to recognise merit in terms of achievement and service br Decorations tend to be used to recognise specific deeds br Medals are used to recognise service on a particular operation or in a specific theatre long or valuable service and good conduct br Appointments to the various orders and awards of other honours are usually published in The London Gazette br br br Brief history br Although the Anglo Saxon monarchs are known to have rewarded their loyal subjects with rings and other symbols of favour it was the Normans who introduced knighthoods as part of their feudal government The first English order of chivalry the Order of the Garter was created in by Edward III Since then the system has evolved to address the changing need to recognise other forms of service to the United Kingdom br br br Modern honours br As the head of state the Sovereign is the fount of honour but the system for identifying and recognising candidates to honour has changed considerably over time Various orders of knighthood have been created see below as well as awards for military service bravery merit and achievement which take the form of decorations or medals Most medals are not graded Each one recognises specific service so there are normally set criteria which must be met These criteria may include a period of time and will often delimit a particular geographic region Medals are not normally presented by the Sovereign A full list is printed in the order of wear published infrequently by the London Gazette br br br Orders of honours br Honours are split into classes orders and are graded to distinguish different degrees of achievement or service according to various criteria Nominations are reviewed by honours committees made up of government officials and private citizens from different fields who meet twice a year to discuss the candidates and make recommendations for appropriate honours to be awarded by the King br br br New Year and Birthday honours br br A list of approximately names are published twice a year at the New Year and on the date of the Sovereign s official birthday Since decisions are inevitably subjective the twice yearly honours lists often provoke criticism from those who feel strongly about particular cases Candidates are identified by public or private bodies by government departments or are nominated by members of the public Depending on their roles those people selected by the honours committee are submitted either to the Prime Minister Secretary of State for Foreign Commonwealth and Development Affairs or Secretary of State for Defence for their approval before being sent to the Sovereign for final approval Certain honours are conferred solely at the Sovereign s discretion such as appointments to the Order of the Garter the Order of the Thistle the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of Merit The honours insignia are then presented by the Sovereign or his representative at investitures held at Buckingham Palace Windsor Castle or the Palace of Holyroodhouse Prince William and Princess Anne deputised for Queen Elizabeth II and continue to do so for King Charles III br br br Prime Minister s Resignation Honours br By convention a departing prime minister is allowed to nominate Prime Minister s Resignation Honours to reward political and personal service In recent history only Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have not taken up this privilege although Brown did issue the Dissolution Honours to similar effect br br br Special Honours br As part of the British honours system Special Honours are issued at the Monarch s pleasure at any given time The Special Honours refer to the awards made within royal prerogative operational honours political honours and other honours awarded outside the New Years Honours and Birthday Honours br br br Crown Honours Lists br br br Current orders of chivalry br br The current system is made up of six orders of chivalry and four orders of merit The statutes of each order specify matters such as the size of the order the use of post nominal letters and insignia design and display These are ordered by date of formation which does not necessarily correspond to order of wear br br br Dormant orders of chivalry br Orders were created for particular reasons at particular times In some cases these reasons have ceased to have any validity and orders have fallen into abeyance primarily due to the decline of the British Empire during the twentieth century Reforms of the system have sometimes made other changes For example the British Empire Medal temporarily ceased to be awarded in the UK in as was the companion level award of the Imperial Service Order although its medal is still used The British Empire Medal was revived however in with BEMs awarded for the Birthday Honours and has continued to be awarded in some other Commonwealth nations br br br Order of St Patrick br br The Order of St Patrick was founded in by George III for the Kingdom of Ireland and after the Acts of Union continued for Irish peers in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland After the Irish Free State s secession in only members of the royal family were appointed to the order the last in The last surviving knight was Prince Henry Duke of Gloucester who died on June Although dormant the order technically still exists and may be used as an award at any time br br br Imperial orders br br These orders relating to the British Raj or the British Indian Empire are also dormant The senior order the Order of the Star of India was divided into three grades Knight Grand Commander Knight Commander and Companion of which the first and highest was conferred upon the Princes and Chiefs of Indian states and upon important British civil servants working in India Women were not eligible to receive the award The junior order the Order of the Indian Empire was divided into the same ranks and also excluded women The third order the Order of the Crown of India was used exclusively to honour women Its members all sharing a single grade consisted of the wives and close female relatives of Indian Princes or Chiefs the Viceroy or Governor General the Governors of Bombay Madras and Bengal the Principal Secretary of State for India and the Commander in Chief in India Upon Indian independence in appointments to all these orders ceased br HH Maharaja Tej Singh Prabhakar Bahadur of Alwar who was a KCSI and the last surviving member of the Order of the Star of India died in February aged The last surviving member of the Order of the Indian Empire HH Maharaja Meghrajji III of Dhrangadhra Halvad a KCIE died in August aged Queen Elizabeth II was appointed to the Order of the Crown of India then as Princess Elizabeth and was the last surviving former member of that order until her death in September aged The King still remains the Sovereign of the Indian orders as they have never been abolished br The Order of Burma was created in May by King George VI of the United Kingdom to recognise subjects of the British colony of Burma Myanmar after it became a distinct colony separate from British India This order had one class which entitled the member to the postnominal letters OB but no title It was originally intended to reward long and faithful service by military and police In the Royal Warrant was altered to allow for membership for acts of gallantry as well as meritorious service The Order was one of the rarest awarded with only appointments by the time appointments were discontinued in when Burma declared independence br br br Orders formerly associated with the British monarch br br br Royal Guelphic Order br br The Royal Guelphic Order also known as the Hanoverian Guelphic Order was an honour founded by George Prince Regent in the name of his father King George III in In the United Kingdom it was used only briefly until the death of William IV in That is when the personal union with the Kingdom of Hanover ended due to the Hanover throne succession which followed Salic Law unlike the United Kingdom where women could inherit the throne The order continued for some time as a national order of Hanover until the Kingdom of Prussia s defeat and forced dissolution in Since then it has been a house order to be awarded by the House of Hanover The order s current head is Ernst August Prinz von Hanover head of the House of Hanover The Order includes two Divisions Civil and Military During the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover it originally had three classes Today after several reorganizations since it is a house order with four classes and an additional Cross of Merit br br br Decorations br Current awarded decorations in order of wear br br On July BBC News reported that the Queen had approved a new posthumous award the Elizabeth Cross honouring members of the armed forces killed in action or by terrorist attack since World War II The cross itself is given to the deceased s family br br br Other honours and appointments br br br Hereditary peerage br There are five ranks of hereditary peerage duke marquess earl viscount and baron Until the mid th century peerages were usually hereditary Until the end of the th century English Scottish British and UK peerages except until very recent times those for the time being held by women carried the right to a seat in the House of Lords br Hereditary peerages are now normally given only to Royal Family members The most recent were the grants to then Queen Elizabeth s youngest son Prince Edward Earl of Wessex on his marriage in the Queen s grandson Prince William made the Duke of Cambridge on the morning before his marriage to Catherine Middleton on April and the Queen s grandson Prince Harry made the Duke of Sussex on the morning before his marriage to Meghan Markle on May No hereditary peerages were granted to commoners after the Labour Party came to power in until Margaret Thatcher tentatively reintroduced them by two grants to men with no sons in Speaker of the House of Commons George Thomas and former deputy prime minister William Whitelaw Both titles died with their holders She followed this with an earldom in for former prime minister Harold Macmillan not long before his death reviving a traditional honour for former prime ministers Macmillan s grandson succeeded him on his death in No hereditary peerages have been created since and Thatcher s own title was a life peerage see further explanation below The concession of a baronetcy i e hereditary knighthood was granted to her husband Denis following her resignation explained below br Hereditary peerages are not honours under the crown and cannot normally be withdrawn A peerage can be revoked only by a specific Act of Parliament and then only for the current holder in the case of hereditary peerages A hereditary peer can disclaim his peerage for his own lifetime under Peerage Act within a year of inheriting the title br br br Life peerage br Modern life peerages were introduced under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act following a test case the Wensleydale Peerage Case which established that non statutory life peers would not have the right to sit in the House of Lords At that time life peerages were intended only for law lords who would introduce appellate legal expertise into the chamber without conferring rights on future generations which might not have legal experts br Subsequently under the Life Peerages Act life peerages became the norm for all new grants outside the Royal Family This was viewed as a modest reform of the second legislative chamber However its effects were gradual because hereditary peers and their successors retained their rights to attend and vote with the life peers All hereditary peers except chosen in a secret ballot of all hereditary peers have now lost their rights to sit in the second chamber All hereditary peers however retain dining rights to the House of Lords viewed as the best club in London br All life peers hold the rank of baron and automatically have the right to sit in the House of Lords The title exists only for the duration of their own lifetime and is not passed to their heirs although the children of life peers enjoy the same courtesy titles as those of hereditary peers Some life peerages are created as an honour for achievement some for the specific purpose of introducing legislators from the various political parties known as working peers and some under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act with a view to judicial work There is a discrete number appointed as People s Peers recommended by the general public Twenty six Church of England bishops have a seat in the House of Lords br As a life peerage is not technically an honour under the Crown it cannot normally be withdrawn once granted Thus while knighthoods have been withdrawn as honours under the Crown convicted criminals who have served their sentences have returned to the House of Lords In the case of Lord Archer of Weston super Mare he has chosen only to exercise dining rights and has not spoken in Parliament since released from his perjury conviction br br br Baronetcy br A baronetcy is the lowest hereditary title in the United Kingdom It carries the title sir In order of precedence a Baronetcy is below a Barony but above most knighthoods Baronetcies are not peerages When a baronetcy becomes vacant on the holder s death the heir is required to register the proofs of succession if he wishes to be addressed as Sir The Official Roll of Baronets is kept at the Ministry of Justice transferred from the Home Office in by the Registrar of the Baronetage Anyone who considers that he is entitled to be entered on the roll may petition the Crown through the Lord Chancellor Anyone succeeding to a baronetcy must exhibit proofs of succession to the Lord Chancellor A person who is not entered on the roll will not be addressed or mentioned as a baronet or accorded precedence as a baronet effectively declining the honour The baronetcy can be revived at any time on provision of acceptable proofs of succession As of baronetcies are listed as presumedly not extinct but awaiting proofs of succession br As with hereditary peerages baronetcies generally ceased to be granted after the Labour Party came to power in The sole subsequent exception was a baronetcy created in for the husband of Margaret Thatcher Sir Denis Thatcher later inherited by their son Mark Thatcher br br br Knighthood br br Descended from medieval chivalry knights exist both within the orders of chivalry and in a class known as Knights Bachelor Regular recipients include High Court judges and to a lesser extent Chief Constables of larger police forces Knighthood carries the title Sir the female equivalent Dame exists only within the orders of chivalry Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire DBE is usually awarded as an equivalent of a Knight Bachelor br br br Order of St John br br Members of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem founded may wear the Order s insignia but the ranks within the Order of St John do not confer official rank in the order of precedence Likewise the abbreviations or post nominal initials associated with the various grades of membership in the Order of St John do not indicate precedence among the other orders Thus someone knighted in the order does not take precedence over the knights of other British orders nor should they be addressed as Sir or Dame br br br Other orders br Other British and Commonwealth orders decorations and medals exist that do not carry titles but entitle the holder to place post nominal letters after his or her name as do a small number of Royal Family Orders br br br British honours in the Commonwealth realms br br Until the mid th century the British honours system was the primary and generally the sole honours system utilised across the various dominions and territories of the British Empire which became the Commonwealth of Nations from Today British honours and decorations continue to be awarded to citizens of Commonwealth realms and British Overseas Territories Within the Commonwealth realms however the nature of the British honour or decoration awarded and the permissibility of its conferment varies from government to government The British honours system comprises both dynastic honours the personal gift of the Sovereign and British state honours or decorations known as imperial honours or decorations outside the UK which are not Dynastic honours continue to be conferred by the Sovereign across the Commonwealth realms although outside the United Kingdom they are typically non titular honours such as the Order of Merit or the lower grades of the Royal Victorian Order br In and the Canadian House of Commons passed the Nickle Resolutions which although non binding gradually ended the conferment of titular honours peerages baronetcies and knighthoods to Canadians Occasional conferments of knighthoods in and and imperial honours notably after the Second World War continued until when the Canadian government officially ended all awards of imperial honours to Canadians In Canada established its own honours system with the Order of Canada created its own system of bravery decorations in and its own system of military decorations for valour in Canadian service personnel remained eligible to receive the imperial Victoria Cross until when a Canadian version was instituted Canadian citizens remain eligible for imperial honours including peerages and knighthoods presumably for achievements within Great Britain however such conferment may involve individual approval by the Canadian government br In the Australian government established its own honours system creating the Order of Australia and its own system of bravery decorations Indigenous police and fire service decorations followed from with a new system of military decorations created in Imperial honours continued to be conferred on Australians through when the last recommendations were made With effect from October the Australian government discontinued the awarding of imperial honours br In New Zealand also instituted its first indigenous honour the Queen s Service Order followed by the Order of New Zealand in In it replaced imperial honours with the New Zealand Order of Merit and replaced imperial gallantry and bravery decorations with New Zealand decorations in br Other Commonwealth realms have continued to apply the imperial honours system together with their own honours systems Jamaica established its own honours system in passing the National Honours and Awards Act Saint Lucia followed in the Solomon Islands in Belize in Antigua and Barbuda in Papua New Guinea in and Grenada in The government of the Bahamas continues to solely use imperial honours In it passed a National Honours Act establishing a Bahamian honours system however it had not come into effect as of br In practice legislation across the Commonwealth realms regulating the awarding of imperial honours to citizens of a realm including knighthoods and damehoods does not necessarily prevent a citizen of a Commonwealth realm from receiving a substantive award of an imperial honour for service in the United Kingdom or to its government There continue to be numerous examples of Canadians New Zealanders and Australians who the British government have honored and can use the honour or its accompanying style when they are resident in their own nation or the United Kingdom br br br Honorary awards br br Citizens of countries that do not have the King as their head of state sometimes have honours conferred upon them in which case the awards are honorary In the case of knighthoods the holders are entitled to place initials after their name but not style themselves Sir as they are not entitled to receive the accolade Examples of foreigners with honorary knighthoods are Billy Graham Bill Gates Bob Geldof Bono and Rudolph Giuliani while Ars ne Wenger and G rard Houllier are honorary OBEs Honorary knighthoods are of Orders of Chivalry rather than as Knights Bachelor as the latter confers no postnominal letters br Recipients of honorary awards who later become subjects of His Majesty may apply to convert their awards to substantive ones Examples of this are Marjorie Scardino American CEO of Pearson PLC and Yehudi Menuhin the American born violinist and conductor They were granted an honorary damehood and knighthood respectively while still American citizens and converted them to substantive awards after they assumed British nationality becoming Dame Marjorie and Sir Yehudi Menuhin later accepted a life peerage with the title Lord Menuhin br Sir Tony O Reilly who holds both British and Irish nationality uses the style Sir but has also gained approval from the Irish Government to accept the award as is necessary under the Irish Constitution Elisabeth Schwarzkopf the German soprano became entitled to be known as Dame Elisabeth when she took British nationality Irish born Sir Terry Wogan was initially awarded an honorary knighthood but by the time he collected the accolade from the Queen in December he had obtained dual nationality and the award was upgraded to a substantive knighthood br Bob Geldof is often erroneously referred to as Sir Bob he is not entitled to this style as an honorary knight as he is a citizen of the Republic of Ireland i e he is not a citizen of a Commonwealth realm br There is no law in the UK preventing foreigners from holding a peerage e g Newburgh though only Commonwealth and Irish citizens may sit in the House of Lords This has yet to be tested under the new arrangements However some other countries have laws restricting the acceptances of awards granted to would be recipients by foreign powers In Canada where the House of Commons of Canada but not the Senate of Canada has opposed the granting of titular honours with its non binding Nickle Resolution then Prime Minister Jean Chr tien advised the Queen not to grant Conrad Black a titular honour while he remained a Canadian citizen see Black v Chr tien br br br Ceremony br Each year around people receive their awards personally from the monarch or another member of the Royal Family The majority of investitures take place at Buckingham Palace but an annual ceremony also takes place at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh during Holyrood Week and some happen at Windsor Castle There are approximately recipients at each Investiture In recent years the King the Prince of Wales and The Princess Royal have all held investitures br During the ceremony the monarch enters the ballroom of Buckingham Palace attended by two Gurkha orderly officers a tradition begun in by Queen Victoria On duty on the dais are five members of the King s Body Guard of the Yeomen of the Guard which was created in by Henry VII they are the oldest but not most senior military corps in the United Kingdom Three Lady or Gentleman Ushers are on duty to help look after the recipients and their guests br The King or his representative is escorted by either the Lord Chamberlain or the Lord Steward After the national anthem has been played he stands to the right of the King and announces the name of each recipient and the achievement for which they are being decorated The King or his representative is provided with a brief background for each recipient by their equerry as they approach to receive their decorations br Men who are to be knighted kneel on an investiture stool to receive the accolade which the King bestows Elizabeth II used the sword used by her father George VI as Duke of York and Colonel of the Scots Guards Only men are knighted Women receive their honours in the same fashion as men receiving decorations or medals even if they are receiving a damehood Occasionally an award for gallantry may be made posthumously and in this case the King or his representative presents the decoration or medal to the recipient s next of kin in private before the public investiture begins The Elizabeth Cross was created especially for this purpose br After the investiture ceremony those honoured are ushered out of the ballroom into the Inner Quadrangle of Buckingham Palace where the royal rota s photographers are stationed Here recipients are photographed with their awards In some cases members of the press may interview some of the more well known people who have been honoured br br br Refusal br br In Sunday Times published a list of almost people who had declined an honour between and In the Guardian reported based on a Freedom of Information request that the number of people refusing an honour had more than doubled in the previous nine years br br br Notable examples br Outgoing prime ministers br Neville Chamberlain declined an earldom and appointment as Knight of

accepted it in She also accepted a CBE in br Gareth Peirce declined a CBE br br br Revocation br br Honours are sometimes revoked forfeited for example if a recipient is subsequently convicted of a serious criminal offence The Honours Forfeiture Committee is an ad hoc committee convened under the chairmanship of the Head of the Home Civil Service to consider cases where information has been received which indicates an individual is unsuitable to hold an award Sometimes the original decision to grant an honour was made on the basis of inaccurate information including through manipulation of the public nominations system but normally cases relate to actions that took place after the award was made Recommendations are made to the monarch of the United Kingdom who has the sole authority to rescind an honour br br In Gordon Brown confirmed that the process remains as set out in by the then Prime Minister John Major in a written answer to the House of Commons The statutes of most orders of knighthood and the royal warrants of decorations and medals include provision for the Queen to cancel and annul appointments and awards Cancellation is considered in cases where retention of the appointment or award would bring the honours system into disrepute There are no set guidelines for cancellations which are considered on a case by case basis Since the London Gazette has published details of cancellations of appointments and awards three knighthoods one CBE five OBEs four MBEs and two BEMs br In October the House of Commons approved a motion to ask the Honours Forfeiture Committee to strip Sir Philip Green of his knighthood for his role in the downfall of British Home Stores It was the first time MPs voted to recommend rescinding a knighthood br br br Notable examples br Kaiser Wilhelm II was a Knight of the Garter prior to the start of the First World War when it was revoked br Roger Casement had been honoured for his human rights work while a British diplomat however upon being convicted on June of High Treason for his role in the Irish Easter Rising the King directed that Casement would cease to be a member of the Order of St Michael and St George his

br br Honours decorations and medals are arranged in the Order of Wear an official list which describes the order in which they should be worn Updates to the Order of Wear are published in The London Gazette when necessary The current Order of Wear was published on January Additional information on the social events at which an award may be worn is contained in the insignia case given to each recipient br The list places the Victoria Cross and George Cross at the top followed by the orders of knighthood arranged in order of date of creation Below the Knights of the Garter and Thistle individuals of a higher rank precede those of a lower rank For instance a Knight Grand Cross of any order precedes any Knight Commander For those of equal rank members of the higher ranked Order take precedence Within the same Order precedence is accorded to that individual who received the honour earlier br Not all orders have the same number of ranks The Order of Merit the Order of the Companions of Honour the Distinguished Service Order and the Imperial Service Order are slightly different being single rank honours and have been placed at appropriate positions of seniority The precedence of Knight Bachelor is below the knights of the different orders and above those with the rank of Commander or lower br Decorations are followed by medals of various categories being arranged in date order within each section These are followed by Commonwealth and honorary foreign awards of any level Miscellaneous details are explained in notes at the bottom of the list br The order of wear is not connected to and should not be confused with the order of precedence br br br Style br For peers see forms of address in the United Kingdom br For baronets the style Sir John

honours bestowed upon those in the entertainment industry e g Anthony Hopkins Maggie Smith it is an accepted practice to omit the title for professional credits br br br Reform br br Reforms of the system occur from time to time In the last century notable changes to the system have included a Royal Commission in following the scandal in which Prime Minister David Lloyd George was found to be selling honours The sale of British Honours including titles is now prohibited by the Honours Prevention of Abuses Act There was a further review in when Prime Minister John Major created the public nominations system br In July the Public Administration Select Committee PASC of the House of Commons and concurrently Sir Hayden Phillips Permanent Secretary at the Department of Constitutional Affairs both concluded reviews of the system The PASC recommended some radical changes Sir Hayden concentrated on issues of procedure and transparency In February the Government responded to both reviews by issuing a Command paper detailing which of the proposed changes it had accepted These included diversifying and opening up the system of honours selection committees for the Prime Minister s list and also the introduction of a miniature badge Furthermore the review suggested a regular report on the transparency and operation of the system at a suggested frequency of every years These reviews have taken place in and The most recent review covers the period to and shows a notable shift towards community and voluntary recognition and a continued emphasis on ensuring that the Honours System reflects British societal diversity br As of same sex civil partners of individual recipients of British honours are not themselves granted honours by way of their partnered relation In July Conservative MP Oliver Colvile introduced a private member s bill titled Honours Equality of Titles for Partners Bill to amend the honours system to both allow husbands of those made dames and for civil partners of recipients to receive honours by their relationship statuses br In May a special COVID nomination process was introduced to provide a more streamlined consideration process and accessible route for the public to nominate those in society who had responded to the COVID pandemic Compared with the existing public nomination form it required substantially less information in
