ruling a country Merlin returns from Bermuda and resolves to help Arthur become the great king he has foreseen him to be br br br Voice cast br Sebastian Cabot as Sir Ector Arthur s foster father and

Production br br br Development br In early Walt Disney purchased the film rights to T H White s The Sword in the Stone which he revealed in February Following the outbreak of World War II the studio focused instead on producing cartoons for the United States government and armed forces such as Der Fuehrer s Face In June following the successful re release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Disney assigned writers to work on The Sword in the Stone along with Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland It continued to be announced that the project was in active development throughout the late s and early s In June Disney told the Los Angeles Times that following the release of One Hundred and One Dalmatians two animated projects were in development which were Chanticleer and The Sword in the Stone Around that same time Disney s elder brother Roy O Disney attempted to persuade him to discontinue their feature animation division as enough films remained to make successful re releases The younger Disney refused but because of his plans to build another theme park in the United States he would approve only one animated film to be released every four years br Chanticleer was developed by Ken Anderson and Marc Davis who aimed to produce a feature animated film in a more contemporary setting They visited the Disney archives and decided to work on adapting the satirical tale after glancing at earlier conceptions dating back to the s Anderson Davis Milt Kahl and director Wolfgang Reitherman spent months preparing elaborate storyboards for Chanticleer Following a silent response to one pitch presentation a voice from the back of the room said You can t make a personality out of a chicken When the time came to approve either Chanticleer or The Sword in the Stone Disney remarked that the problem with making a rooster a protagonist was you don t feel like picking a rooster up and petting it br Meanwhile The Sword in the Stone was developed solely by veteran story artist Bill Peet After Disney had seen the Broadway production of Camelot he approved the project to enter production Ollie Johnston stated that Kahl got furious with Bill for not pushing Chanticleer after all the work he had put in on it He said I can draw a damn fine rooster you know Bill said So can I Peet recalled about how humiliated they were to accept defeat and give in to The Sword in the Stone He allowed them to have their own way and they let him down They never understood that I wasn t trying to compete with them just trying to do what I wanted to work I was in the midst of all this competition and with Walt to please too br Writing in his autobiography Peet said he decided to write a screenplay before producing storyboards though he found the narrative complicated with the Arthurian legend woven into a mixture of other legends and myths and that finding a direct storyline required sifting and sorting After Disney received the first screenplay draft he told Peet that it should have more substance Peet lengthened his second draft by elaborating on the more dramatic aspects of the story which Disney approved of through a phone call from Palm Springs Florida br br br Casting br Rickie Sorensen who was cast as Arthur entered puberty during the film s production forcing director Wolfgang Reitherman to cast two of his sons Richard and Robert to replace him This resulted in Arthur s voice noticeably changing between scenes and sometimes within the same scene The three voices also portray Arthur with an American accent sharply contrasting with the English setting and the accents spoken by most of the other characters Mari Ness of the online magazine Tor com suggests given that the film is about growing up this problem might have been overcome with the three voices being interpreted as symbolizing Arthur s mental and physical development but Reitherman inexplicably chose to leave all three voices in for some scenes drawing attention to the problem that they were not the same actor She notes even further that two of the voice actors were brothers and sound somewhat similar the third was not and sounds distinctly different Finally she notes the issue of the American accents of the voices contrasting with the English setting and the accents spoken by most of the other characters in the film noting the only positive the vocal issues with Wart do help distract attention from the fact that the Brits aren t particularly good here either br Wolfgang Reitherman estimated that actors read for the part but none of them had eccentricity that they were seeking as Wolfgang said that they wanted Merlin to be eccentric but not hokey Swenson initially read for Archimedes but the filmmakers eventually decided to cast him as Merlin br br br Animation br The film continued the Xerox method of photocopying drawings onto animation cels that had been used in One Hundred and One Dalmatians An additional animation technique touch up was created during production to replace the clean up process The clean up process had required assistant animators to transfer the directing animators sketches onto new sheets of paper which were then copied onto the animation cels To do a touch up the assistants would instead draw directly on the animators sketches This streamlined the process but it also caused assistants of directing animator Milt Kahl to fear they would ruin his linework br br br Release br The Sword in the Stone premiered in London on December It was released to theaters on December in the United Kingdom and on December in the United States It was re released on December The film was again re released to theaters on March as a double bill with the animated short Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore br br br Home media br The Sword

gross of million in North America br br br Critical reception br The Sword in the Stone received mixed reviews from critics who thought that its humor failed to balance out a thin narrative Gene Arneel of Variety wrote that the film demonstrates anew the magic of the Disney animators and imagination in character creation But one might wish for a script which stayed more with the basic story line rather than taking so many twists and turns which have little bearing on the tale about King Arthur as a lad Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised the film claiming it is an eye filling package of rollicking fun and thoughtful common sense The humor sparkles with real knowing sophistication meaning for all ages and some of the characters on the fifth century landscape of Old England are Disney pips Philip K Scheuer reviewing for the Los Angeles Times described the film as more intimate than usual with a somewhat smaller cast of characters animal as well as human Otherwise the youngsters should find it par the usual Disney cartoon course It may not be exactly what T H White had in mind when he wrote this third of his sophisticated trilogy about King Arthur but it s a good bit livelier than the stage Camelot derived from another third br On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews with an average score of The website s critical consensus reads A decent take on the legend of King Arthur The Sword in the Stone suffers from relatively indifferent animation but its characters are still memorable and appealing Nell Minow of Common Sense Media gave the film four out of five stars writing that delightful classic brings Arthur legend to life In his book The Best of Disney Neil Sinyard states that despite not being well known the film has excellent animation a complex structure and is actually more philosophical than other Disney features Sinyard suggests that Walt Disney may have seen something of himself in Merlin
