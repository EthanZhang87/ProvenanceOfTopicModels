The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature is given each year for the best animated film An animated feature is defined by the academy as a film with a running time of more than minutes in which characters performances are created using a frame by frame technique a significant number of the major characters are animated and animation figures in no less than percent of the running time The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first awarded in for films released in br The entire AMPAS membership has been eligible to choose the winner since the award s inception If there are sixteen or more films submitted for the category the winner is voted from a shortlist of five films otherwise there will only be three films on the shortlist br br br History br For much of the Academy Awards history AMPAS was resistant to the idea of a regular award for animated features considering there were simply too few produced to justify such consideration Instead the Academy occasionally bestowed special Oscars for exceptional productions usually for Walt Disney Pictures such as for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in and the Special Achievement Academy Award for the live action animated hybrid Who Framed Roger Rabbit in and Toy Story in In fact prior to the award s creation only one animated film was nominated for Best Picture s Beauty and the Beast also by Disney br By the rise of sustained competitors to Disney in the feature animated film market such as DreamWorks Animation founded by former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg created an increase of film releases of significant annual number enough for AMPAS to reconsider The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first given out at the th Academy Awards held on March The academy included a rule that stated that the award would not be presented in a year in which fewer than eight eligible films opened in theaters It dropped the rule on April to make voting for animated films more acceptable People in the animation industry as well as fans expressed hope that the prestige from this award and the resulting boost to the box office would encourage the increased production of animated features br In when the nominee slots for Best Picture were doubled to ten Up was nominated for both Animated Feature and Picture at the nd Academy Awards the first to do so since the inception of the Animated Feature category This feat was repeated the following year by Toy Story br In the academy enacted a new rule regarding the motion capture technique employed in films such as A Christmas Carol and The Adventures of Tintin directed by Academy Award for Best Director winners Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg respectively and how they might not be eligible in this category in the future This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live action films that rely heavily on motion capture such as Avatar br In it was unclear whether Marcel the Shell with Shoes On would be eligible for the award at the th Academy Awards due to being a live action stop motion animated hybrid Director Dean Fleischer Camp said that he and A had to submit documentation in order to prove the film had enough animation to meet the award s minimum requirements Nonetheless the AMPAS officially deemed the film eligible for consideration in the Animated Feature category and was eventually nominated for said category br br br Best Picture criticism br Some members and fans have criticized the award however saying it is only intended to prevent animated films from having a chance of winning Best Picture DreamWorks had advertised heavily during the holiday season for Shrek but was disappointed when the rumored Best Picture nomination did not materialize though it was nominated for and ultimately won the inaugural Best Animated Feature award br The criticism surrounding the Best Animated Feature category was particularly prominent at the st Academy Awards in which WALL E won the award but was not nominated for Best Picture despite receiving widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike and being generally considered to be one of the best films of This sparked controversy over whether the film was deliberately snubbed of such nomination by the academy Film critic Peter Travers commented that if there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for Best Picture it s WALL E However official Academy Award regulations state that any film nominated for this category can still be nominated for Best Picture This as well as more backlash that The Dark Knight was also not another Best Picture nominee meant that next year the academy expanded the Best Picture category After the expansion two animated films Up and Toy Story were nominated for Best Picture br From onward with the increasing competitiveness of the Animated Feature category Pixar a perennial nominee did not receive nominations for several recent films due to the more mixed critical response and comparatively low box office receipts while Pixar s sister studio Disney Animation won their first three awards br br br Winners and nominees br br br s br br br s br
