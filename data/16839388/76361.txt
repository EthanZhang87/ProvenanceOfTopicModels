living with her wicked and cold hearted stepmother the Queen Fearing that Snow White s beauty will outshine her own the Queen forces her to work as a scullery maid and asks her Magic Mirror daily who is the fairest one of all For years the mirror always answers that the Queen is pleasing her br One day Snow White meets and falls in love with a prince who overhears her singing On that same day the Magic Mirror informs the Queen that Snow White is now the fairest in all of the land Angered the Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest kill her and bring back her heart in a jeweled box as proof The Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White and reveals to her the Queen s plot He then urges her to flee into the woods and never return br Lost and frightened Snow White is befriended by woodland animals who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods Finding seven small chairs in the cottage s dining room Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children With the animals help she proceeds to clean the place and cook a meal Snow White soon learns that the cottage is the home of seven dwarfs named Doc Grumpy Happy Sleepy Bashful Sneezy and Dopey who work in a nearby mine Returning home they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home Snow White introduces herself and the dwarfs welcome her after she offers to clean and cook for them Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day and at night they all sing play music and dance br Back at the castle the Magic Mirror reveals that Snow White is still living and with the dwarfs Enraged that the Huntsman tricked her the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into a death like sleep She learns the curse can be broken by love s first kiss but is certain Snow White will be buried alive before this can happen Using a potion to disguise herself as an old hag the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away The animals see through the disguise but are unable to warn Snow White they rush off to find the dwarfs The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the apple and she falls into a death like slumber br The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase trapping her on a cliff She tries to roll a boulder onto them but lightning strikes the cliff before she can do so causing her to fall and get crushed to death by the boulder In their cottage the dwarfs find Snow White asleep by the poison Unwilling to bury her in the ground they instead place her in a glass coffin in the forest Together with the animals they keep watch over her br The following spring the prince learns of Snow White s eternal sleep and visits the coffin

Walt Disney conceived the idea of making his first feature length film in when his animation studio was focusing on production of animated short films such as the Silly Symphonies series Although they were popular with the audience Disney believed that the shorts did not bring enough profit for the further growth of the studio he also saw the full length film as a way to expand his storytelling possibilities allowing for elaborate plots and character development By late March he was approached by Mary Pickford co founder of United Artists that was distributing Disney s works at the time with a proposal for a feature length animated live action version of Lewis Carroll s novel Alice s Adventures in Wonderland however the project was soon scrapped when Paramount Pictures began production of their own film version Disney then considered using the same concept for a film adaptation of Washington Irving s short story Rip Van Winkle starring Will Rogers but it did not work out either due to Paramount which held the rights to the story refusing to give permission br After the successful release of the Silly Symphony short Three Little Pigs in May Disney was strengthened in his decision to make a feature film and began introducing the idea to his staff through a slow infiltration sharing it with everyone individually during casual conversations He entered into negotiations with Merian C Cooper to produce a full length animated version of Victor Herbert s operetta Babes in Toyland in Technicolor the project was offered to RKO Radio Pictures which owned the rights to the play but RKO executives rejected it In July Disney first revealed his plans on making a feature film to The Film Daily although he had not yet managed to find a response from the United Artists executives and around the same time he was approached with an offer for an animated version of Felix Salten s novel Bambi a Life in the Woods in alliance with Sidney Franklin Disney eventually rejected the idea feeling that his studio was not ready for the technical challenges that Bambi would have presented Homer s poems Iliad and Odyssey as well as Jonathan Swift s book Gulliver s Travels were also suggested to Disney at the time br br Disney settled on the Brothers Grimm s fairy tale Snow White in the spring of He had been familiar with the story since he was a teenager having seen the silent film version which he later cited as the primary reason for choosing Snow White for his first feature production Disney had originally planned to produce Snow White as a Silly Symphony short but reconsidered believing that the story had enough potential for a feature film adaptation He formally announced his plans on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The New York Times in June estimating that the film could be produced for a budget of which was roughly ten times the budget of an average Silly Symphony The project then known as the Feature Symphony was initially developed by a small unit of writers that Disney personally supervised before it was introduced to the studio staff at large on October when the basic story outline was completed As some animators later recalled Disney assembled them on the sound stage in the evening and acted out the entire story of Snow White for three hours concluding with announcement of their first feature film br Although the studio staff were excited about the project they were unsure that the full length cartoon would sustain an audience s attention Ward Kimball said that they were told by Hollywood moguls such as W C Fields that it was OK six seven minutes like the shorts but an hour and a half no way Big reason was that you run out of funny things to do you had to have a laugh a minute And the bright colors would hurt your eyes everybody would get up and walk out Walt of course plugged ahead he didn t believe that He felt that if you had a solid story not only laughs in it but tragedy it would go Both Disney s wife Lillian and his brother Roy who was also his business partner attempted unsuccessfully to talk him out of it and movie industry insiders derisively referred to the film as Disney s Folly while it was in production br br br Early writing br The earliest known story outline entitled Manuscript was compiled by staff writer Richard Creedon on August featuring twenty one pages of suggestions for characters scenes and songs including Some Day My Prince Will Come At the time Disney adopted a wide ranging approach remaining open to any idea that could be proposed notably one of the suggestions included Snow White traveling through a series of enchanted sites such as the Sleepy Valley the Morass of Monsters and the Valley of the Dragons before arriving at the dwarfs cottage Snow White was originally envisioned to be more tomboyish with the Queen described as stately beautiful in the way of a Benda mask a cool serene character who demonstrates her fury only in moments of great passion One of the potential storylines developed for Manuscript involved the Queen imprisoning the Prince in her dungeon after seeing his affection for Snow White with the Prince later fighting his way out of her castle with tricks that Doug Fairbanks would like to have thought Other story suggestions included the Queen having a collection of her former enemies reduced to a few inches in size a Gilbert and Sullivan style musical number for the scene where the Queen orders the Huntsman to kill Snow White and the sequence of the Queen trying to break the mirror upon learning that Snow White has survived with the mirror detaching itself from the wall and smashing against the Queen after chasing her around the chamber Disney also decided from the beginning that each of the Seven Dwarfs whom he considered the strongest lure of the story because of their comedic potential should have a distinctive personality identified by a respective name a pool of over fifty possibilities was compiled for Manuscript with names such as Sleepy Hoppy Bashful Happy Sneezy Wheezy Biggo Ego and Awful as the top contenders br In October Disney began holding weekly story meetings with a small unit of writers which included Creedon Larry Morey Ted Sears Albert Hurter and Pinto Colvig During the first meeting on October several scenes were proposed the Soup Eating where Snow White has dinner with dwarfs and Bed Building where dwarfs build a bed for Snow White sequences Snow White teaching the dwarfs to pray and the climactic scene of the dwarfs chasing the disguised Queen followed by her death from falling off a cliff For the next meeting held on October a typed sheet was complied featuring a redefined selection of names for the dwarfs Wheezy Jumpy Baldy Grumpy Happy Doc and Sleepy and their respective characteristics several alternatives were also suggested including Hickey Gabby Nifty Sniffy Lazy Puffy Stuffy Shorty Wheezy Burpy Dizzy and Dopey From the outset Disney decided to discard the part from the Grimms original story where the Queen tries to kill Snow White with a tightly laced bodice but considered retaining the other two attempts with a poisoned comb and a poisoned apple both of which were discussed at the meeting The storyline of the Prince s imprisonment by the Queen first introduced in Manuscript was also elaborated after failing to kill Snow White with the comb the Queen would throw the Prince into a dungeon and use magic to make the skeletons of her previous victims dance for him identifying one skeleton as Prince Oswald When the disguised Queen would have left for the dwarfs cottage with the poisoned apple Snow White s bird friends were to help the Prince escape from the dungeon fight the Queen s guards and find his horse the Prince would then go after the Queen taking the wrong road in the process Other discussions included the dwarfs discovery of Snow White in their cottage two disguises for the Queen a fat bulgy peddler and a thin hawk faced witch for each of her attempts to kill Snow White and the scene of Snow White kissing the dwarfs goodbye before they leave for work At the meeting Disney also insisted that the writers refer to the dwarfs as seven little men which was maintained for the rest of the production br Other examples of the more comical nature of the story at this point included suggestions for a fat batty cartoon type self satisfied Queen The Prince was also more of a clown and was to serenade Snow White in a more comical fashion Walt Disney encouraged all staff at the studio to contribute to the story offering five dollars for every gag such gags included the dwarfs noses popping over the foot of the bed when they first meet Snow White br Disney became concerned that such a comical approach would lessen the plausibility of the characters and sensing that more time was needed for the development of the Queen advised in an outline circulated on November that attention be paid exclusively to scenes in which only Snow White the Dwarfs and their bird and animal friends appear The names and personalities of the dwarfs however were still open to change A meeting of November resulted in another outline entitled Dwarfs Discover Snowwhite which introduced the character of Dopey who would ultimately prove to be the most successful of the dwarf characterizations In the original storyboard Dopey was very talkative but no suitable voice actors could be found Mel Blanc was given a try without success It was suggested to make him mute instead For the rest of Disney further developed the story by himself finding a dilemma in the characterization of the Queen who he felt could no longer be fat and batty but a stately beautiful type a possibility already brought up in previous story meetings br br br Reworking br Disney did not focus on the project again until the autumn of It was believed that the Silly Symphony short The Goddess of Spring may have placed doubt in his studio s abilities to animate a realistic girl Apparently a three month trip to Europe that summer restored his confidence At this point Disney and his writers focused on the scenes in which Snow White and the dwarfs are introduced to the audience and each other He laid out the likely assignments for everyone working on the film in a memorandum of November and had decided on the personalities of the individual dwarfs br It had first been thought that the dwarfs would be the main focus of the story and many sequences were written for the seven characters However at a certain point it was decided that the main thrust of the story was provided by the relationship between the Queen and Snow White For this reason several sequences featuring the dwarfs were cut from the film The first which was animated in its entirety before being cut showed Doc and Grumpy arguing about whether Snow White should stay with them Another also completely animated would have shown the dwarfs eating soup noisily and messily Snow White unsuccessfully attempts to teach them how to eat like gentlemen A partially animated sequence involved the dwarfs holding a lodge meeting in which they try to think of a gift for Snow White this was to be followed by the elaborate bed building sequence in which the dwarfs and the forest animals construct and carve a bed for the princess This was also cut as it was thought to slow down the movement of the story The soup eating and bed building sequences were animated by Ward Kimball who was sufficiently discouraged by their removal to consider leaving the studio Disney however persuaded him to stay by promoting Kimball to supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket in his next feature Pinocchio br br br Casting br Adriana Caselotti was the first actress to be tested for the role of Snow White in September She was invited to audition after Disney s casting director telephoned her father who was a vocal coach in search for voice talents and Caselotti overhearing their conversation picked up the phone to offer her candidacy Over other actresses and singers auditioned for the role including Deanna Durbin whose voice Disney found too mature Virginia Davis who had portrayed the title character in the Alice Comedies series was almost cast as Snow White and provided some preliminary live action reference for the character but eventually refused as her mother found the contract unacceptable Davis herself later elaborated that she also dropped out of the role because her singing was not good enough However some miscellaneous vocal tracks which were provided by Davis were used in the final film Caselotti was eventually cast as Snow White in September exactly one year after her first audition and recorded her first tracks on January she was called in for forty four days of recording sessions within two years receiving for each day in total Caselotti was paid Thelma Hubbard provided Snow White s screams in the forest flight scene and would later voice the character in the film s Spanish dub and Lux Radio Theatre adaptation br Story meeting notes from October indicate that Eddie Holden and Billy Bletcher were initially considered for the role of Doc until Atwell was cast in early Radio actor John Gibson initially auditioned for the part of Sleepy and recorded some dialogue at a prerecording session in February After reading about the casting in a Variety article Gilbert who was known for his signature sneeze telephoned Disney to try out for the role Disney agreed to audition him and upon witnessing Gilbert s sneezing routine hired him on the spot br The studio auditioned dozens of actresses for role of the Queen before Lucille La Verne was cast because of her regal with a lot of depth voice several members of Disney s staff however contended that her voice was too deep and a bit old for the character La Verne also auditioned for the Witch the animators initially felt that her voice was too smooth and not rough enough for the part but La Verne managed to achieve the desired result by removing her false teeth Kenny Baker who provided vocals for several Silly Symphony shorts was temporarily considered for the role of the Prince until Stockwell was cast in His voice acting was performed in the style of the operetta which was often used in musical films of the s Reginald Barlow and Cy Kendall originally auditioned for the role of the Huntsman until Buchanan who was hired in as a studio casting director and dialogue coach was cast br br br Animation br br br Art direction br Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs features contributions from three European artists who came to work at the Walt Disney Studios in the s By Albert Hurter was assigned to supervise the film s art direction all the designs used in the film from character costume designs to layouts and backgrounds had to meet his approval before being finalized Having had an academic art training Hurter was instrumental in devising the film s overall Germanic look incorporating European illustrations and painting techniques into the animation Ferdinand Horvath who had been working at the studio since was also hired as the film s inspirational sketch artist providing a number of dark concepts for the film Many of his other designs were ultimately rejected since they were less easily translated into animation than Hurter s and Hovarth didn t receive a credit for the film By the spring of as the animation process begun Hurter and Hovarth were joined by Gustaf Tenggren Tenggren was used as a color stylist and to determine the staging and atmosphere of many of the scenes in the film as his style borrowed from the likes of Arthur Rackham and John Bauer and thus possessed the European illustration quality that Walt Disney sought He also designed the posters for the film and illustrated the press book Other artists to work on the film included Joe Grant whose most significant contribution was the design for the Queen s Witch form br br br Character animation br br Art Babbitt an animator who joined the Disney studio in invited seven of his colleagues who worked in the same room as him to come with him to an art class that he himself had set up at his home in the Hollywood Hills Though there was no teacher Babbitt had recruited a model to pose for him and his fellow animators as they drew These classes were held weekly each week more animators would come After three weeks Walt Disney called Babbit to his office and offered to provide the supplies working space and models required if the sessions were moved to the studio Babbitt ran the sessions for a month until animator Hardie Gramatky suggested that they recruit Don Graham an art teacher from the Chouinard Institute Graham taught his first class at the studio on November and was joined by Philip L Dike a few weeks later These classes were principally concerned with human anatomy and movement though instruction later included action analysis animal anatomy and acting br Though the classes were originally described as a brutal battle with neither instructor nor students well versed in the other s craft the enthusiasm and energy of both parties made the classes stimulating and beneficial for all involved Graham often screened Disney shorts and along with the animators provided critique featuring both strengths and weaknesses For example Graham criticised Babbitt s animation of Abner the mouse in The Country Cousin as taking a few of the obvious actions of a drunk without coordinating the rest of the body while praising it for maintaining its humour without getting dirty or mean or vulgar The country mouse is always having a good time br br Very few of the animators at the Disney studio had had artistic training most had been newspaper cartoonists among these few was Grim Natwick who had trained in Europe The animator s success in designing and animating Betty Boop for Fleischer Studios showed an understanding of human female anatomy and when Walt Disney hired Natwick he was given female characters to animate almost exclusively Attempts to animate Persephone the female lead of The Goddess of Spring had proved largely unsuccessful Natwick s animation of the heroine in Cookie Carnival showed greater promise and the animator was eventually given the task of animating Snow White herself Though live action footage of Snow White the Prince and the Queen was shot as reference for the animators the artists animators disapproved of rotoscoping considering it to hinder the production of effective caricature Nevertheless all of the above mentioned characters were fully rotoscoped and utilized by their respective artists some more some less Despite Graham and Natwick s objections however some scenes of Snow White and the Prince were directly traced from the live action footage br It proved difficult to add color to Snow White s and the Queen s faces Eventually they found a red dye that worked and which was added with a small piece of cotton wrapped around a tipple pencil on each individual cel Helen Ogger an employee at the ink department was also an animator and decided to use the same system used in animation The method was so time consuming that it was never used again on the same scale It was also used to a smaller degree in Pinocchio and Fantasia but after Ogger left the studio in there was no one else with the same skills who could replace her br br br Music and records br br The songs in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs were composed by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey Paul J Smith and Leigh Harline composed the incidental music score Songs from the film include Heigh Ho Someday My Prince Will Come and Whistle While You Work Since Disney did not have its own music publishing company at the time the publishing rights for the music and songs were administered through Bourne Co Music Publishers which continues to hold these rights In later years the studio was able to acquire back the music rights from many of their other films but not Snow White Pinocchio Dumbo or most Silly Symphony cartoons Snow White became the first American film to have a soundtrack album released in conjunction with the feature film br br br Cinematic influences br At this time Disney also encouraged his staff to see a variety of films These ranged from the mainstream such as MGM s Romeo and Juliet to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin to the more obscure including European silent cinema Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as well as the two Disney films to follow it were also influenced by such German expressionist films as Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen s transformation into the Witch The latter scene was also inspired by Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings br br br Financial issues br br Disney had to mortgage his house to help finance the film s production which eventually ran up a total cost of a massive sum for a feature film in Midway through Disney needed a loan to finish the film Disney ran a rough cut for Joseph Rosenberg of Bank of America who sat impassively during the showing Then Rosenberg turned to the worried Disney and said Walt that thing is going to make a hatful of money and approved the loan br br br Release br br br Original theatrical run br br Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre on December The film received a standing ovation at its completion from an audience that included Judy Garland Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton Six days later Walt Disney and the seven dwarfs appeared on the cover of Time magazine Three weeks later it opened at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City and a theater in Miami in January in which the strong box office sales encouraged RKO Radio Pictures to place the film into general release on February It became a major box office success becoming the most successful sound film of all time in which it displaced Al Jolson s The Singing Fool Snow White would soon be displaced from this position by Gone with the Wind in br br Snow White proved equally popular with foreign audiences In September Variety reported that the film was having a remarkably long box office run at theaters in Sydney Australia In that city it noted Walt Disney s Snow White RKO experienced no difficulty at hitting weeks with more ahead Variety reported as well that Snow White was having even longer runs in other cities overseas such as in London where the

anniversary the film was re released in cinemas across the UK on August for one week br br br Critical reaction br The film was a tremendous critical success with many reviewers hailing it as a genuine work of art recommended for both children and adults Although film histories often state that the animation of the human characters was criticized more recent scholarship found that contemporary reviewers praised the realistic style of the human animation with several stating that audiences had forgotten that they are watching animated humans rather than real ones Frank S Nugent of The New York Times felt that Mr Disney and his technical crew have outdone themselves The picture more than matches expectations It is a classic as importantly cinematically as The Birth of a Nation or the birth of Mickey Mouse Nothing quite like it has been done before and already we have gone impolite enough to clamor for an encore Variety observed that so perfect is the illusion so tender the romance and fantasy so emotional are certain portions when the acting of the characters strikes a depth comparable to the sincerity of human players that the film approaches real greatness Harrison s Reports wrote Snow White was entertainment that should be enjoyed by every one Intelligent adults will marvel at the mechanical ingenuity that went into the making of it and it is something to marvel at for at times the characters seem lifelike That is brought about by the expert synchronization of the action with the music and the dialogue br At the th Academy Awards the film won an Academy Honorary Award for Walt Disney as a significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field Disney received a full size Oscar statuette and seven
