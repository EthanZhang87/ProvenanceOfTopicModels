Production br br br Story development br Walt Disney first adapted Charles Perrault s fairy tale Cinderella as part of his cartoon shorts series for the Laugh O Gram Studio in He was interested in producing a second version in December as a Silly Symphony short Burt Gillett was attached as the director while Frank Churchill was assigned as the composer A story outline included white mice and birds as Cinderella s playmates To expand the story storyboard artists suggested visual gags some of which ended up in the final film However by early the story proved to be too complicated to be condensed into a short so it was suggested as a potential animated feature film starting with a fourteen page outline written by Al Perkins Two years later a second treatment was written by Dana Cofy and Bianca Majolie in which Cinderella s stepmother was named Florimel de la Pochel her stepsisters as Wanda and Javotte her pet mouse Dusty and pet turtle Clarissa the stepsisters cat Bon Bob the Prince s aide Spink and the stepsisters dancing instructor Monsieur Carnewal This version stuck closely to the original fairy tale until Cinderella arrives home late from the second ball Her stepfamily then imprisons Cinderella in a dungeon cellar When Spink and his troops arrive at the la Pochel residence Dusty takes the slipper and leads them to free Cinderella br By September Disney had assigned Dick Huemer and Joe Grant to begin work on Cinderella as story supervisors and given a preliminary budget of million However by their preliminary story work was halted During the writing stages of Song of the South Dalton S Reymond and Maurice Rapf quarreled and Rapf was reassigned to work on Cinderella In his version Cinderella was written to be a less passive character than Snow White and more rebellious against her stepfamily Rapf explained My thinking was you can t have somebody who comes in and changes everything for you You can t be delivered on a platter You ve got to earn it So in my version the Fairy Godmother said It s okay till midnight but from then on it s up to you I made her earn it and what she had to do to achieve it was to rebel against her stepmother and stepsisters to stop being a slave in her own home So I had a scene where they re ordering her around and she throws the stuff back at them She revolts so they lock her up in the attic I don t think anyone took my idea very seriously br In spring Disney held three story meetings and subsequently received treatment from Ted Sears Homer Brightman and Harry Reeves dated March In the treatment the Prince was introduced earlier in the story reminiscent of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and there was a hint of the cat and mouse conflict By May the first rough phase of storyboarding was in the process and an inventory report that same month suggested a different approach with the story largely through the animals in the barnyard and their observations of Cinderella s day to day activities br Following the theatrical release of Fun and Fancy Free Walt Disney Productions bank debt declined from million to million Around this time Disney acknowledged the need for sound economic policies but emphasized to the loaners that slashing production would be suicidal To restore the studio to full financial health he expressed his desire to return to producing full length animated films By then three animated projects Cinderella Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan were in development Disney felt the characters in Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan were too cold while Cinderella contained elements similar to Snow White and greenlit the project Selecting his top tier animation talent Ben Sharpsteen was assigned as supervising producer while Hamilton Luske Wilfred Jackson and Clyde Geronimi became the sequence directors Nevertheless production on Alice resumed so that both animation crews would effectively compete against each other to see which film would finish first br By early Cinderella had progressed further than Alice in Wonderland and was fast tracked to become the first full length animated film since Bambi During a story meeting on January the cat and mouse sequences began to grow into an important element in the film so much that Disney placed veteran story artist Bill Peet in charge of the cat and mouse segments br By the late s Disney s involvement during production had shrunken noticeably As he was occupied with trains and the filming of Treasure Island the directors were left to exercise their own judgment more on details Although Disney no longer held daily story meetings the three directors still communicated with him by mailing him memoranda scripts Photostats of storyboards and acetates of soundtrack recordings while he was in England for two and a half months during the summer of When Disney did not respond work resumed and then had to be undone when he did In one instance when Disney returned to the studio on August he reviewed Luske s animation sequences and ordered numerous minor changes as well as a significant reworking of the film s climax Production was finished by October br br br Casting br Around applicants auditioned for the role of Cinderella until Ilene Woods was cast in March br Mack David and Jerry Livingston had asked Woods to sing on several demo recordings of the songs They had previously known her from her eponymous radio show which was broadcast on ABC The show featured fifteen minutes of music in which David and Livingston had their music presented Two days later Woods received a telephone call from Disney with whom she immediately scheduled an interview Woods recalled in an interview with the Los Angeles Times We met and talked for a while and he said How would you like to be Cinderella to which she agreed br For the role of Lucifer a studio representative asked June Foray if she could provide the voice of a cat Well I could do anything recalled Foray So he hired me as Lucifer the cat in Cinderella br br br Animation br br br Live action reference br br Starting in spring actors were filmed on large soundstages mouthing to a playback of the dialogue soundtrack Disney had previously used live action reference on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Pinocchio and Fantasia but as part of an effort to keep the production cost down the footage was used to check the plot timing and movement of the characters before animating it The footage was then edited frame by frame onto large Photostat sheets to duplicate in which the animators found too restrictive as they were not allowed to imagine anything that the live actors did not present since that kind of experimentation might necessitate changes and cost more money Additionally the animators were instructed to draw from a certain directorial perspective to avoid difficult shots and angles Frank Thomas explained Anytime you d think of another way of staging the scene they d say We can t get the camera up there Well you could get the animation camera up there So you had to go with what worked well in live action br Walt Disney hired actress Helene Stanley to perform the live action reference for Cinderella allowing artists to draw animated frames based on the movements of the actress She later did the same kind of work for the characters of Princess Aurora in Sleeping Beauty and Anita Radcliffe in One Hundred and One Dalmatians Animators modeled Prince Charming on actor Jeffrey Stone who also provided some additional voices for the film Claire Du Brey served as the live action reference for the Fairy Godmother although the design for the character was based on Mary Alice O Connor the wife of layout artist Ken O Connor br br br Character animation br By the animation board which had been established as early as to help with the management of the animation department had settled down to nine supervising animators including Frank Thomas Ollie Johnston Les Clark Wolfgang Reitherman Eric Larson Ward Kimball Milt Kahl John Lounsbery and Marc Davis Although they were still in their thirties they were jokingly referred by Disney as the Nine Old Men after President Franklin D Roosevelt s denigration of the Supreme Court br br Eric Larson and Marc Davis were both tasked with designing and animating Cinderella Larson was the first to animate the character whom he envisioned as a sixteen year old with braids and a pug nose However Disney grew displeased with this approach and assigned Davis as the second supervising animator whose designs suggested a more the exotic dame with a long swan like neck To minimize the differences and set the final design Disney assigned animator Ken O Brien who as Larson said made his gals and Marc s gals look like the same gal Due to the extensive use of the live action reference for the film Helene Stanley s physical features also influenced the character s final appearance br Frank Thomas was assigned as the supervising animator of Lady Tremaine which he was astounded with since he had previously mainly specialized in more charming characters like Pinocchio or Bambi br Milt Kahl was the directing animator of the Fairy Godmother the King and the Grand Duke Originally Disney intended for the Fairy Godmother to be a tall regal character as he viewed fairies as tall motherly figures as seen in the Blue Fairy in Pinocchio but Kahl disagreed with this characterization Following the casting of Verna Felton Kahl managed to convince Disney of his undignified concept of the Fairy Godmother br Unlike the human characters the animal characters were animated without live action reference During production none of Kimball s designs for Lucifer had pleased Disney After visiting Kimball s steam train at his home Disney saw his calico cat and remarked Hey there s your model for Lucifer Reitherman animated the sequence in which Jaq and Gus laboriously drag the key up the flight of stairs to Cinderella br br br Music br br In story artist and part time lyricist Larry Morey joined studio music director Charles Walcott to compose the songs Cinderella would sing three songs Sing a Little Dream a Little while overloaded with work The Mouse Song as she dressed the mice and The Dress My Mother Wore as she fantasizes about her mother s old wedding dress To recycle an unused fantasy sequence from Snow White the song Dancing on a Cloud was used as Cinderella and the Prince waltz during the ball After the ball she would sing I Lost My Heart at the Ball and the Prince would sing The Face That I See in the Night However none of their songs were used br Two years later Disney turned to Tin Pan Alley songwriters Mack David Jerry Livingston and Al Hoffman to compose the songs They were the first professional composers to be hired outside the production company The trio had previously written the song Chi Baba Chi Baba that Disney heard on the radio and decided would work well with the Fairy Godmother sequence They finished the songs in March In total six songs were performed in the film Cinderella A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes Oh Sing Sweet Nightingale The Work Song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo and So This is Love br Oliver Wallace and Paul Smith composed the score but only after the animation was ready for inking which was incidentally similar to scoring a live action film This was a drastic change from the earlier Disney animated features in which the music and action were carefully synchronized in a process known as Mickey Mousing br The film also marked the launching of the Walt Disney Music Company The soundtrack was also a first in using multi tracks for vocals with the song Oh Sing Sweet Nightingale Ilene Woods recorded a second and third vocal track to enable her to sing harmony with herself br On February Billboard announced that RCA Records and Disney would release a children s album in conjunction with the theatrical release The RCA Victor album release sold about copies during its first release and hit number one on the Billboard pop charts br On September a special edition of the soundtrack entitled Walt Disney Records Presents The Music of Cinderella was released to coincide with the film s re release on home video The album opened with cover versions of the songs from the film including Linda Ronstadt singing A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes in English and Spanish Take singing The Work Song James Ingram singing So This is Love David Benoit and David Sanborn performing a jazz medley from the film and Bobby McFerrin s take on Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo br The soundtrack for Cinderella was released by Walt Disney Records on CD and audio cassette on February and included a bonus demo On October Disney released a special edition of the soundtrack

Walt Disney director Michael Curtiz hailed the film as the masterpiece of all pictures you have done Producer Hal Wallis declared If this is not your best it is very close to the top A review in Chicago Tribune remarked The film not only is handsome with imaginative art and glowing colors to bedeck the old fairy tale but it also is told gently without the lurid villains which sometimes give little tots nightmares It is enhanced by the sudden piquant touches of humor and the music which appeal to old and young Time magazine wrote that Cinderella is beguiling proof that Walt Disney knows his way around fairyland Harking back to the style of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a small army of Disney craftsmen have given the centuries old Cinderella story a dewy radiance of comic verve that

Cinderella has a voluptuous face and form not to mention an eager disposition to compare with Al Capp s Daisy Mae However criticizing her role and personality Crowther opined As a consequence the situation in which they are mutually involved have the constraint and immobility of panel expressed episodes When Mr Disney tries to make them behave like human beings they re banal Similarly Variety claimed the film found more success in projecting the lower animals than in its central character Cinderella who is on the colorless doll faced side as is the Prince Charming br Contemporary reviews have remained positive Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times awarded the film three out of four stars during its re release Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote the film shows Disney at the
