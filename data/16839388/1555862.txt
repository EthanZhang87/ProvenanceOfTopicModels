title: Computer Animation Production System
id: 1555862
The Computer Animation Production System CAPS was a proprietary collection of software scanning camera systems servers networked computer workstations and custom desks developed by The Walt Disney Company and Pixar in the late s Although outmoded by the mid s it succeeded in reducing labor costs for ink and paint and post production processes of traditionally animated feature films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios WDAS then formerly known as Walt Disney Feature Animation WDFA division until It also provided an entirely new palette of digital tools to the animation filmmakers br br br History and evolution br The Computer Graphics Lab at the New York Institute of Technology NYIT developed a scan and paint system for cel animation in the late s It was used to produce a minute computer animated television show called Measure for Measure Industry developments with computer systems led Marc Levoy of Cornell University and Hanna Barbera Productions to develop a video animation system for cartoons in the early s br The first usage of the CAPS process was Mickey standing on Epcot s Spaceship Earth for The Magical World of Disney titles The system s first feature film test was in the production of The Little Mermaid in where it was used in a single shot of the rainbow sequence at the end of the film After Mermaid films were made completely using CAPS the first of these The Rescuers Down Under was the first digital feature film ever produced Later films including Beauty and the Beast Aladdin The Lion King and The Hunchback of Notre Dame took more advantage of CAPS D and D integration br In the early days of CAPS Disney did not discuss the system in public being afraid that the magic would go away if people found out that computers were involved Computer Graphics World magazine in was the first to have a look at the process br br br Awards br In the team that developed CAPS won an Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Scientific and Engineering Award

films the first at a major studio Using CAPS enclosed areas and lines could be easily colored in a computer environment using an unlimited palette This replaced the expensive process of transferring animated drawings to cels using India ink or xerographic technology and painting the reverse sides of the cels with gouache paint It also allowed for sophisticated new techniques such as transparent shading and blended colors br The completed digital cels were composited over scanned background paintings and camera or pan movements were programmed into a computer exposure sheet simulating the actions of old style animation cameras Additionally complex multiplane shots giving a sense of depth were possible Unlike the analog multiplane camera the CAPS multiplane cameras were not limited by artwork size Extensive camera movements never before seen were incorporated into the films The final version of the sequence was composited and recorded onto film Since the animation elements existed digitally it was easy to integrate other types of film and video elements including three dimensional computer animation br CAPS was capable of a high level of image quality using significantly slower computer systems than are available today The final frames were rendered at a K digital film resolution x pixels at a aspect ratio and the artwork was scanned so that it always held resolution in the final output no matter how complex the camera motion in the shot Using the Pixar Image Computer images were stored at bits per pixel The compositing system allowed complex multi layered shots that was used almost immediately in The Rescuers Down Under to create a layer opening dolly shot The DALS system made use of one of the first large scale custom RAID systems in the film industry br br br Decline and eventual replacement br br Treasure Planet and Home on the Range under performed financially in their theatrical runs This combined with the success of CGI animated feature films from Pixar Animation Studios and competitor DreamWorks Animation eventually prompted Walt Disney Feature Animation s management team to close down their traditional D animation department in The CAPS desks were removed and the custom automated scanning cameras were dismantled and officially scrapped By only one desk system remained and that was only for reading the data for the films that had been made with CAPS br In John Lasseter became the studio s new head of management team and called for the D animation unit s reopening Rather than return to CAPS however Disney s subsequent traditionally animated feature and short film production projects How to Hook Up Your Home Theater The Princess and the Frog The Ballad of Nessie and Winnie the Pooh were produced using Toon Boom Animation s Toon
