Metacritic is a website that aggregates reviews of films television shows music albums video games and formerly books For each product the scores from each review are averaged a weighted average Metacritic was created by Jason Dietz Marc Doyle and Julie Doyle Roberts in and was acquired by Fandom Inc in br Metacritic s scoring converts each review into a percentage either mathematically from the mark given or what the site decides subjectively from a qualitative review Before being averaged the scores are weighted according to a critic s popularity stature and volume of reviews The site provides an excerpt from each review and hyperlinks to its source where a color of green yellow or red summarizes the critics reviews br Metacritic won two Webby Awards for excellence as an aggregation website It is regarded as the foremost online review aggregation site for the video game industry Criticism of the site has focused on the assessment system the assignment of scores to reviews that do not include ratings third party attempts to influence the scores and the reported lack of staff oversight for user reviews br br br History br br Metacritic was launched in January by Marc Doyle his sister Julie Doyle Roberts and his University of Southern California law classmate Jason Dietz after two years of developing the site Rotten Tomatoes was already compiling movie reviews but Doyle Roberts and Dietz saw an opportunity to cover a broader range of media br Metacritic was sold to CNET in CNET and Metacritic were later acquired by the CBS Corporation In Metacritic and other CNET titles were bought by Red Ventures In Red Ventures sold Metacritic and other entertainment websites to Fandom Inc br br br Influence br Metacritic has been used by businesses to predict future sales In Nick Wingfield of The Wall Street Journal wrote that Metacritic influence s the sales of games and the stocks of video game publishers He explains its influence as coming from the higher cost of buying video games than music or movie tickets Many executives say that low scores can hurt the long term sales potential Wingfield wrote that Wall Street pays attention to Metacritic and GameRankings because the sites typically post scores before sales data are publicly available citing the respective rapid rise and fall in company values after BioShock and Spider Man were released In an interview with The Guardian Marc Doyle cited two major publishers that conducted comprehensive statistical surveys through which they ve been able to draw a correlation between high metascores and stronger sales in certain genres He claimed that an increasing number of businesses and financial analysts use Metacritic as an early indicator of a game s potential sales and by extension the publisher s stock price However a study analyzing over Xbox and PS games from found that Metacritic scores did not impact actual sales br Controversially the website has been used by game publishers as a means of determining whether a game s developer receives additional royalties One notable example is the game Fallout New Vegas which received an average Metascore of one short of the points required by Bethesda Softworks the game s publisher As a result its developer Obsidian Entertainment received no additional bonus Columnists took issue with the company s use of Metacritic with one suggesting that this makes game critics ultimately accountable for deciding the developer s profits and another pointing out that a Metascore of is not significantly lower than The latter also pointed out the impressive sales of five million sold units and US million in revenue and also noted a series of Obsidian s layoffs in and br The website has also been used by columnists and commentators as a general reference for critical reception and by publishers as a tool of improving their products Along with other executives in John Riccitiello then CEO of Electronic Arts showed Wall Street analysts a chart illustrating a downward trend in the average critical ratings of the company s games He took the ratings seriously and stressed the need for the company to bounce back Also in Microsoft used Metacritic averages to delist underperforming Xbox Live Arcade games br br br Metascores br Scores are weighted averages Certain publications are given more significance because of their stature Metacritic has said that it will not reveal the relative weight assigned to each reviewer br Games Editor Marc Doyle was interviewed in by Keith Stuart of The Guardian to get a look behind the metascoring process Stuart wrote The Metascore phenomenon namely Metacritic and GameRankings have become an enormously important element of online games journalism over the past few years Doyle said that because video games lead to a greater investment of time and money gamers are more informed about reviews than are fans of film or music they want to know whether that hotly anticipated title is going to deliver br br In June Metacritic established the Must See label for a movie that achieves a Metascore of or higher and has been reviewed by a minimum of professional critics In September it added the Must Play certification for video games attaining a score of or more and a minimum number of reviews from industry professionals br The standalone highest rated game of all time on the site is The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time with a The three games with a are Tony Hawk s Pro Skater Grand Theft Auto IV and Soulcalibur There are about two dozen rated games with

a The standalone lowest rated album of all time is Playing with Fire by Kevin Federline with a br br br Reception br Metacritic has received mixed reviews from website critics commentators and columnists Its efficacy has been analyzed with conclusions finding it to be generally useful or unreliable and biased The website won two annual Webby Awards for excellence in the Guides Ratings Reviews category in and br br br Criticism br Metacritic has been criticized for converting all scoring systems into a single quantitative percentage based scale For example an A score equates to the value of an F the value of zero and a B the value of Joe Dodson former editor at Game Revolution criticized Metacritic and similar sites for turning reviews into scores that he found to be too low Doyle defended the grading system believing that every scale should be converted directly to that of the website with its lowest possible score being and the highest Further criticism was directed to the website s refusal to publicize how it aggregates scores br According to Doyle publishers often try to persuade him to exclude reviews they feel are unfair but he said that once a publication is included he refuses to omit any of its reviews A Washington Post review of Uncharted was assigned with a rating of by Metacritic this was the only negative review of the game Readers who disapproved of the review petitioned Metacritic to remove the Post as a trusted source As a result of its perceived negative influence on the industry several reviewing sites including Kotaku and Eurogamer have dropped numerical reviews that would appear in Metacritic instead favoring a qualitative assessment of a game Kotaku also highlighted a practice alleged to be used by some publishers who use Metacritic scores as a way to leverage more favorable terms for the publisher or deny developers bonuses should they not reach a certain score Doyle countered this by saying Metacritic has absolutely nothing to do with how the industry uses our numbers Metacritic has always been about educating the gamer We re using product reviews as a tool to help them make the most of their time and money br Metacritic has also been criticized for how it handles banning users and their reviews with no notice or formal process for appeal Critics and developers have pointed out that a product can suffer from rating manipulation by users as by garnering low ratings that purposely damage its reputation or by receiving high ratings from throwaway accounts to make it appear more popular than it actually is Signal Studios president and creative director Douglas Albright described the website as having no standards In July Metacritic added a hour waiting period for user reviews to be posted for video games at launch in an effort to reduce user score review bombing during that period by users that have not played or barely played the game during a period when most players will not have finished the game br Some have noted that Metacritic scores for modern video games may not be accurately reflective of a game s state in the future due to post release updates and patches as well as most press reviews of games taking place around their launch For example the metascore for MediEvil was mixed mainly due to performance issues that existed around the time of the game s launch These issues were fixed in post release patches that made the game run smoothly which would have led to a higher metascore in its patched state Another example is online games such as Final Fantasy XIV Online and Warframe which received mixed scores initially but became more well received following improvements made after launch br br br See also br Internet Movie Database IMDb br Rating site br OpenCritic br
