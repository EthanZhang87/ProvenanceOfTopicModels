id: 163806
An oil platform also called as oil rig offshore platform oil production platform etc is a large structure with facilities to extract and process petroleum and natural gas that lie in rock formations beneath the seabed Many oil platforms will also have facilities to accommodate the workers although it is also common to have a separate accommodation platform linked by bridge to the production platform Most commonly oil platforms engage in activities on the continental shelf though they can also be used in lakes inshore waters and inland seas Depending on the circumstances the platform may be fixed to the ocean floor consist of an artificial island or float In some arrangements the main facility may have storage facilities for the processed oil Remote subsea wells may also be connected to a platform by flow lines and by umbilical connections These sub sea facilities may include one or more subsea wells or manifold centres for multiple wells br Offshore drilling presents environmental challenges both from the produced hydrocarbons and the materials used during the drilling operation Controversies include the ongoing US offshore drilling debate br There are many different types of facilities from which offshore drilling operations take place These include bottom founded drilling rigs jackup barges and swamp barges combined drilling and production facilities either bottom founded or floating platforms and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units MODU including semi submersibles and drillships These are capable of operating in water depths up to metres ft In shallower waters the mobile units are anchored to the seabed However in deeper water more than metres ft the semisubmersibles or drillships are maintained at the required drilling location using dynamic positioning br br br History br br Around the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the Grand Lake St Marys a k a Mercer County Reservoir in Ohio The wide but shallow reservoir was built from to to provide water to the Miami and Erie Canal br Around the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the Summerland field extending under the Santa Barbara Channel in California The wells were drilled from piers extending from land out into the channel br Other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the Canadian side of Lake Erie since and Caddo Lake in Louisiana in the s Shortly thereafter wells were drilled in tidal zones along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana The Goose Creek field near Baytown Texas is one such example In the s drilling was done from concrete platforms in Lake Maracaibo Venezuela br The oldest offshore well recorded in Infield s offshore database is the Bibi Eibat well which came on stream in in Azerbaijan Landfill was used to raise shallow portions of the Caspian Sea br In the early s the Texas Company developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf br In Pure Oil Company now Chevron Corporation and its partner Superior Oil Company now part of ExxonMobil Corporation used a fixed platform to develop a field in feet m of water one mile km offshore of Calcasieu Parish Louisiana br In Humble Oil built a mile long wooden trestle with railway tracks into the sea at McFadden Beach on the Gulf of Mexico placing a derrick at its end this was later destroyed by a hurricane br In concern for American control of its offshore oil reserves caused President Harry Truman to issue an Executive Order unilaterally extending American territory to the edge of its continental shelf an act that effectively ended the mile limit freedom of the seas regime br In Magnolia Petroleum now ExxonMobil drilled at a site miles km off the coast erecting a platform in feet m of water off St Mary Parish Louisiana br In early Superior Oil erected a drilling production platform in ft m of water some miles off Vermilion Parish Louisiana But it was Kerr McGee Oil Industries now part of Occidental Petroleum as operator for partners Phillips Petroleum ConocoPhillips and Stanolind Oil Gas BP that completed its historic Ship Shoal Block well in October months before Superior actually drilled a discovery from their Vermilion platform farther offshore In any case that made Kerr McGee s well the first oil discovery drilled out of sight of land br The British Maunsell Forts constructed during World War II are considered the direct predecessors of modern offshore platforms Having been pre constructed in a very short time they were then floated to their location and placed on the shallow bottom of the Thames and the Mersey estuary br In the first jackup oil rig was ordered by Zapata Oil It was designed by R G LeTourneau and featured three electro mechanically operated lattice type legs Built on the shores of the Mississippi River by the LeTourneau Company it was launched in December and christened Scorpion The Scorpion was put into operation in May off Port Aransas Texas It was lost in br When offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to metres ft fixed platform rigs were built until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the metres ft to metres ft depth of the Gulf of Mexico the first jack up rigs began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ENSCO International br The first semi submersible resulted from an unexpected observation in Blue Water Drilling Company owned and operated the four column submersible Blue Water Rig No in the Gulf of Mexico for Shell Oil Company As the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck It was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small and Blue Water Drilling and Shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in its floating mode The concept of an anchored stable floating deep sea platform had been designed and tested back in the s by Edward Robert Armstrong for the purpose of operating aircraft with an invention known as the seadrome The first purpose built drilling semi submersible Ocean Driller was launched in Since then many semi submersibles have been purpose designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet br The first offshore drillship was the CUSS developed for the Mohole project to drill into the Earth s crust br As of June there were over mobile offshore drilling rigs Jackups semisubs drillships barges available for service in the competitive rig fleet br One of the world s deepest hubs is currently the Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico floating in meters of water It is operated by Shell plc and was built at a cost of billion The deepest operational platform is the Petrobras America Cascade FPSO in the Walker Ridge field in meters of water br br br Main offshore basins br br Notable offshore basins include br br the North Sea br the Gulf of Mexico offshore Texas Louisiana Mississippi Alabama and Florida br California in the Los Angeles Basin and Santa Barbara Channel part of the Ventura Basin br the Caspian Sea notably some major fields offshore Azerbaijan br the Campos and Santos Basins off the coasts of Brazil br Newfoundland and Nova Scotia Atlantic Canada br several fields off West Africa south of Nigeria and central Africa west of Angola br offshore fields in South East Asia and Sakhalin Russia br major offshore oil fields are located in the

anchored directly onto the seabed supporting the deck with space for drilling rigs production facilities and crew quarters Such platforms are by virtue of their immobility designed for very long term use for instance the Hibernia platform Various types of structure are used steel jacket concrete caisson floating steel and even floating concrete Steel jackets are structural sections made of tubular steel members and are usually piled into the seabed To see more details regarding Design construction and installation of such platforms refer to and br Concrete caisson structures pioneered by the Condeep concept often have in built oil storage in tanks below the sea surface and these tanks were often used as a flotation capability allowing them to be built close to shore Norwegian fjords and Scottish firths are popular because they are sheltered and deep enough and then floated to their final position where they are sunk to the seabed Fixed platforms are economically feasible for installation in water depths up to about m ft br br br Compliant towers br br These platforms consist of slender flexible towers and a pile foundation supporting a conventional deck for drilling and production operations Compliant towers are designed to sustain significant lateral deflections and forces and are typically used in water depths ranging from to metres to ft br br br Semi submersible platform br br These platforms have hulls columns and pontoons of sufficient buoyancy to cause the structure to float but of weight sufficient to keep the structure upright Semi submersible platforms can be moved from place to place and can be ballasted up or down by altering the amount of flooding in buoyancy tanks They are generally anchored by combinations of chain wire rope or polyester rope or both during drilling and or production operations though they can also be kept in place by the use of dynamic positioning Semi submersibles can be used in water depths from to metres to ft br br br Jack up drilling rigs br br Jack up Mobile Drilling Units or jack ups as the name suggests are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered much like jacks These MODUs Mobile Offshore Drilling Units are typically used in water depths up to metres ft although some designs can go to m ft depth They are designed to move from place to place and then anchor themselves by deploying their legs to the ocean bottom using a rack and pinion gear system on each leg br br br Drillships br br A drillship is a maritime vessel that has been fitted with drilling apparatus It is most often used for exploratory drilling of new oil or gas wells in deep water but can also be used for scientific drilling Early versions were built on a modified tanker hull but purpose built designs are used today Most drillships are outfitted with a dynamic positioning system to maintain position over the well They can drill in water depths up to m ft br br br Floating production systems br br The main types of floating production systems are FPSO floating production storage and offloading system FPSOs consist of large monohull structures generally but not always shipshaped equipped with processing facilities These platforms are moored to a location for extended periods and do not actually drill for oil or gas Some variants of these applications called FSO floating storage and offloading system or FSU floating storage unit are used exclusively for storage purposes and host very little process equipment This is one of the best sources for having floating production br The world s first floating liquefied natural gas FLNG facility is in production See the section on particularly large examples below br br br Tension leg platform br br TLPs are floating platforms tethered to the seabed in a manner that eliminates most vertical movement of the structure TLPs are used in water depths up to about meters feet The conventional TLP is a column design that looks similar to a semisubmersible Proprietary versions include the Seastar and MOSES mini TLPs they are relatively low cost used in water depths between and metres and ft Mini TLPs can also be used as utility satellite or early production platforms for larger deepwater discoveries br br br Gravity based structure br br A GBS can either be steel or concrete and is usually anchored directly onto the seabed Steel GBS are predominantly used when there is no or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform for example in the Caspian Sea There are several steel GBS s in the world today e g offshore Turkmenistan Waters Caspian Sea and offshore New Zealand Steel GBS do not usually provide hydrocarbon storage capability It is mainly installed by pulling it off the yard by either wet tow or and dry tow and self installing by controlled ballasting of the compartments with sea water To position the GBS during installation the GBS may be connected to either a transportation barge or any other barge provided it is large enough to support the GBS using strand jacks The jacks shall be released gradually whilst the GBS is ballasted to ensure that the GBS does not sway too much from target location br br br Spar platforms br br Spars are moored to the seabed like TLPs but whereas a TLP has vertical tension tethers a spar has more conventional mooring lines Spars have to date been designed in three configurations the conventional one piece cylindrical hull the truss spar in which the midsection is composed of truss elements connecting the upper buoyant hull called a hard tank with the bottom soft tank containing permanent ballast and the cell spar which is built from multiple vertical cylinders The spar has more inherent stability than a TLP since it has a large counterweight at the bottom and does not depend on the mooring to hold it upright It also has the ability by adjusting the mooring line tensions using chain jacks attached to the mooring lines to move horizontally and to position itself over wells at some distance from the main platform location The first production spar was Kerr McGee s Neptune anchored in m ft in the Gulf of Mexico however spars such as Brent Spar were previously used as FSOs br Eni s Devil s Tower located in m ft of water in the Gulf of Mexico was the world s deepest spar until The world s deepest platform as of was the Perdido spar in the Gulf of Mexico floating in metres of water It is operated by Royal Dutch Shell and was built at a cost of billion br The first truss spars were Kerr McGee s Boomvang and Nansen br The first and as of only cell spar is Kerr McGee s Red Hawk br br br Normally unmanned installations NUI br br These installations sometimes called toadstools are small platforms consisting of little more than a well bay helipad and emergency shelter They are designed to be operated remotely under normal conditions only to be visited occasionally for routine maintenance or well work br br br Conductor support systems br br These installations also known as satellite platforms are small unmanned platforms consisting of little more than a well bay and a small process plant They are designed to operate in conjunction with a static production platform which is connected to the platform by flow lines or by umbilical cable or both br br br Particularly large examples br br The Petronius Platform is a compliant tower in the Gulf of Mexico modeled after the Hess Baldpate platform which stands feet m above the ocean floor It is one of the world s tallest structures br The Hibernia platform in Canada is the world s heaviest offshore platform located on the Jeanne D Arc Basin in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland This gravity base structure GBS which sits on the ocean floor is metres ft high and has storage capacity for million barrels m of crude oil in its metre ft high caisson The platform acts as a small concrete island with serrated outer edges designed to withstand the impact of an iceberg The GBS contains production storage tanks and the remainder of the void space is filled with ballast with the entire structure weighing in at million tons br Royal Dutch Shell has developed the first Floating Liquefied Natural Gas FLNG facility which is situated approximately km off the coast of Western Australia It is the largest floating offshore facility It is approximately m long and m wide with displacement of around t when fully ballasted br br br Maintenance and supply br A typical oil production platform is self sufficient in energy and water needs housing electrical generation water desalinators and all of the equipment necessary to process oil and gas such that it can be either delivered directly onshore by pipeline or to a floating platform or tanker loading facility or both Elements in the oil gas production process include wellhead production manifold production separator glycol process to dry gas gas compressors water injection pumps oil gas export metering and main oil line pumps br Larger platforms are assisted by smaller ESVs emergency support vessels like the British Iolair that are summoned when something has gone wrong e g when a search and rescue operation is required During normal operations PSVs platform supply vessels keep the platforms provisioned and supplied and AHTS vessels can also supply them as well as tow them to location and serve as standby rescue and firefighting vessels br br br Crew br br br Essential personnel br Not all of the following personnel are present on every platform On smaller platforms one worker can perform a number of different jobs The following also are not names officially recognized in the industry br br OIM offshore installation manager who

supervisor br Wireline or coiled tubing operators br Pump operator br Pump hanger and ranger br br br Drawbacks br br br Risks br The nature of their operation extraction of volatile substances sometimes under extreme pressure in a hostile environment means risk accidents and tragedies occur regularly The U S Minerals Management Service reported offshore deaths injuries and fires and explosions on offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico from to On July people died when Occidental Petroleum s Piper Alpha offshore production platform on the Piper field in the UK sector of the North Sea exploded after a gas leak The resulting investigation conducted by Lord Cullen and publicized in the first Cullen Report was highly critical of a number of areas including but not limited to management within the company the design of the structure and the Permit to Work System The report was commissioned in and was delivered in November The accident greatly accelerated the practice of providing living accommodations on separate platforms away from those used for extraction br The offshore can be in itself a hazardous environment In March the flotel floating hotel platform Alexander L Kielland capsized in a storm in the North Sea with the loss of lives br In Petrobras in Brazil exploded and sank five days later killing people br Given the number of grievances and conspiracy theories that involve the oil business and the importance of gas oil platforms to the economy platforms in the United States are believed to be potential terrorist targets Agencies and military units responsible for maritime counter terrorism in the US Coast Guard Navy SEALs Marine Recon often train for platform raids br On April the Deepwater Horizon platform miles off shore of Venice Louisiana property of Transocean and leased to BP exploded killing people and sank two days later The resulting undersea gusher conservatively estimated to exceed million US gallons m as of early June became the worst oil spill in US history eclipsing the Exxon Valdez oil spill br br br Ecological effects br br In British waters the cost of removing all platform rig structures entirely was estimated in at billion br Aquatic organisms invariably attach themselves to the undersea portions of oil platforms turning them into artificial reefs In the Gulf of Mexico and offshore California the waters around oil platforms are popular destinations for sports and commercial fishermen because of the greater numbers of fish near the platforms The United States and Brunei have active Rigs to Reefs programs in which former oil platforms are left in the sea either in place or towed to new locations as permanent artificial reefs In the US Gulf of Mexico as of September former oil platforms about percent of decommissioned platforms have been converted to permanent reefs br On the US Pacific coast marine biologist Milton Love has proposed that oil platforms off California be retained as artificial reefs instead of being dismantled at great cost because he has found them to be havens for many of the species of fish which are otherwise declining in the region in the course of years of research Love is funded mainly by government agencies but also in small part by the California Artificial Reef Enhancement Program Divers have been used to assess the fish populations surrounding the platforms br br br Effects on the environment br Offshore oil production involves environmental risks most notably oil spills from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities and from leaks and accidents on the platform Produced water is also generated which is water brought to the surface along with the oil and gas it is usually highly saline and may include dissolved or unseparated hydrocarbons br Offshore rigs are shut down during hurricanes In the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes are increasing because of the increasing number of oil platforms that heat surrounding air with methane it is estimated that U S Gulf of Mexico oil and gas facilities emit approximately tons of methane each year corresponding to a loss of produced gas of percent The increasing number of oil rigs also increase movement of oil tankers which also increases CO levels which directly warm water in the zone warm waters are a key factor for hurricanes to form br To reduce the amount of carbon emissions otherwise released into the atmosphere methane pyrolysis of natural gas pumped up by oil platforms is a possible alternative to flaring for consideration Methane pyrolysis produces non polluting hydrogen in high volume from this natural gas at low cost This process operates at around C and removes carbon in a solid form from the methane producing hydrogen The carbon can then be pumped underground and is not released into the atmosphere br It is being evaluated in such research laboratories as Karlsruhe Liquid metal Laboratory KALLA and the chemical engineering team at University of California Santa Barbara br br br Repurposing br If not decommissioned old platforms can be repurposed to pump CO into rocks below the seabed Others have been converted to launch rockets into space and more are being redesigned for use with heavy lift launch vehicles br br br Challenges br Offshore oil and gas production is more challenging than land based installations due to the remote and harsher environment Much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges including the need to provide very large production facilities Production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment such as the Troll A platform standing on a depth of meters br Another type of offshore platform may float with a mooring system to maintain it on location While a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities br The ocean can add several thousand meters or more to the fluid column The addition increases the equivalent circulating density and downhole pressures in drilling wells as well as the energy needed to lift produced fluids for separation on the platform br The trend today is to conduct more of the production operations subsea by separating water from oil and re injecting it rather than pumping it up to a platform or by flowing to onshore with no installations visible above the sea Subsea installations help to exploit resources at progressively deeper waters locations that had been inaccessible and overcome challenges posed by sea ice such as in the Barents Sea One such challenge in shallower environments is seabed gouging by drifting ice features means of protecting offshore installations against ice action includes burial in the seabed br Offshore manned facilities also present logistics and human resources challenges An offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria sleeping quarters management and other support functions In the North Sea staff members are transported by helicopter for a two week shift They usually receive higher salaries than onshore workers do Supplies and waste are transported by ship and the supply deliveries need to be carefully planned because storage space on the platform is limited Today much effort goes into relocating as many of the personnel as possible onshore where management and technical experts are in touch with the platform by video conferencing An onshore job is also more attractive for the aging workforce in the petroleum industry at least in the western world These efforts among others are contained in the established term integrated operations The increased use of subsea facilities helps achieve the objective of keeping more workers onshore Subsea facilities are also easier to expand with new separators or different modules for different oil types and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an above water installation br br br Deepest platforms br The world s deepest oil platform is the floating Perdido which is a spar platform in the Gulf of Mexico in a water depth of metres ft br Non floating compliant towers and fixed platforms by water depth br br Petronius Platform m ft br Baldpate Platform m ft br Troll A Platform m ft br Bullwinkle Platform m
