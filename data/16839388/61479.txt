fellow Cockney who was Caine s friend because he looked more Cockney than Caine did Endfield then told the Caine that he did not look like a Cockney but like an officer and offered him a screen test for the role of a snobbish upper class officer after Caine assured him that he could do a posh accent Caine believes Endfield offered him a Cockney the role of an aristocrat because being American he
