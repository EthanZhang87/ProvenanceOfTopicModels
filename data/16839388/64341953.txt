Villanueva br br br Production br br br Development br In Shi had recently completed the Pixar short Bao when Pixar invited her to pitch three ideas for a full length film Her proposed concepts were all coming of age stories centered on teenage girls The one that became Turning Red was based on a girl going through a magical puberty which Shi wrote based on her own personal experiences Shi said Everyone has been there Everyone has been thirteen and feeling like they re turning into some wild hairy hormonal beast and I think that s why Pixar was drawn to it Shi pitched all three concepts including Turning Red to Pixar on October According to Pixar producer Lindsey Collins who sat in on Shi s pitch meeting the Pixar staff were drawn to the Turning Red idea as it was so clear that Domee had such a sense of who these two main characters were that Mei and Ming were really clear and special and unique more than any of the other ideas and that she had this really personal experience with these two characters that were kind of versions of her own life That s like the magic equation right there The approach of using more personable stories followed from Luca under Pixar s new chief creative officer Pete Docter s oversight which shifted the direction the studio took with both storytelling and film production Brenda Hsueh writer of the subsequent Pixar film Elemental worked on the film as a consultant to Shi for the ideas br The film was developed under the working title of Red Shi was announced as writer and director of an upcoming Pixar full length film on May making her the first woman to solely direct a film in the studio The film s creative leads were also the first all female team for Pixar which Pixar s CEO Jim Morris said happened very organically rather than by intent Rona Liu served as production designer after doing so for Bao Liu said that working on a feature film was a dream come true By November Shi confirmed that the film was in the early stages of development with the story still being worked on and that she is really excited to play in this new minute film format The title Turning Red was finalized by December According to Morris Turning Red had one of the fastest development times of a Pixar feature film taking only four years to complete br br br Casting br In Pixar hired Chiang to provide scratch vocals to support the development of the film Chiang then only years old was selected in part because she was a local child actor conveniently based in nearby Fremont which is only about miles km from Pixar s Emeryville headquarters After two years of development Shi and Collins reached the point where the film was solid enough to start casting professional voice actors Despite listening to various auditions the two realized they had already fallen in love with Chiang s scratch vocals and could not envision anyone else playing Mei They escalated the issue to Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter who personally approved the casting of Chiang in the film s lead role br During an early recording session Shi suddenly surprised Chiang with an additional script page where Shi reading in character as Ming offered Chiang the role This session right before the onset of the COVID pandemic in the United States turned out to be their last one conducted in person To keep production going Pixar shipped an enormous amount of professional audio equipment to Chiang who turned one of the rooms in her parents house into a makeshift recording studio br Sandra Oh was Shi s top pick for Ming Besides the fact that Oh was a fellow Canadian Shi felt Oh could convey the range of complex emotions they wished to portray in Ming br br br Design br br br Setting br The film takes place in Toronto Ontario Canada in as confirmed by a production designer in February As it takes place through the eyes of a thirteen year old girl named Mei Lee the entire environment has been stylized to convey a specific feeling Shi described the film s overall look as an Asian tween fever dream According to executive producer Dan Scanlon It feels more like a very soft colorful magical idyllic almost youthful version of the city Shi also considered how video games like Pok mon EarthBound and The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild were able to stylize their world in such an appealing chunky cute kind of way Part of this desired setting was capturing the popularity of boy bands at the turn of the millennium and how teenage girls reacted to them Pixar animators visited locations around Northern California for inspiration and visual references They studied red pandas at the San Francisco Zoo and looked at architecture in Chinatown in San Francisco and the Bok Kai Temple in Marysville br br br Inspirations br Shi said that several anime influenced the film including Sailor Moon Ranma Fruits Basket and Inuyasha To capture these anime influences hand drawn D animated effects were added atop Pixar s D animation Shi was also inspired by My Neighbor Totoro in creating an iconic grabbable giant animal that you just want to rub your face in Nintendo games such as Earthbound Pok mon and The Legend of Zelda have also been cited as a major influence for the film Shi also compared the plot of the film to Disney s A Goofy Movie a similar coming of age movie involving a parent and child trying to mend their relationship with a pop band as part of the film s climax The film also deals with puberty though the film does not directly talk of biological changes For example Mei s mother mistakes Mei s reaction to her transformation for her first menstruation Shi said they were unapologetic about the discussion of these topics in the film the title Turning Red is an allegory for menstruation The color red also reflects other feelings experienced by teenagers according to Shi such as embarrassment or lust Shi and her staff had feared that studio executives would want the scenes referencing puberty removed but the scenes were accepted br Liu oversaw the production of the food scenes as she had done for Bao They partnered with the non profit organization Gold House that specializes in promotion of East Asian and Pacific cultures to identify what foods to include For rendering the foods they were inspired by the approach that Studio Ghibli had done with foods in their works as well as exaggerating their look in the same manner that Sanrio uses to bring cuteness into their products and the way the film The God of Cookery showed food in a dream glow br br br Music br br The film s music is scored by Ludwig G ransson in his first animated film project and was recorded within a two week period after COVID lockdown relaxations The film also featured three original songs written by Billie Eilish and Finneas O Connell Nobody Like U True Love and U Know What s Up These songs were performed in the film by the fictional boy band Town which O Connell was a part of Producer Lindsey Collins said that her child was a fan of Eilish s music which inspired her to approach Eilish and O Connell at the start of production Collins had pitched to their pair using a scrapbook featuring scenes from the film and cutouts of the duo Walt Disney Records released the soundtrack album digitally and on CD on March Subsequently tracks from Town appeared in multiple languages some of which were performed by boy bands such as Da ice Japanese and W LF S Mandarin The album debuted at number on the Billboard chart on the week of March and peaked at on the week of April br br br Marketing br br br Promotion

reads Heartwarming humorous beautifully animated and culturally expansive Turning Red extends Pixar s long list of family friendly triumphs Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating universal acclaim br The Washington Post s Michael O Sullivan gave stars out of and concludes The film delivers a bigger and in some ways more universal message It s okay to not always be in control to let your freak flag fly To paraphrase Sigmund Freud sometimes a red panda is just a red panda And sometimes it s a metaphor for that inner spark of creativity the flame of originality that is to be cherished not extinguished With Turning Red Shi demonstrates that she s got it in spades IGN s Siddhant Adlakha gave a rating of out of and concludes A story of magical transformation as a metaphor for personal and cultural change Turning Red from Bao director Domee Shi is Pixar s funniest and most imaginative film in years It captures the wild energy of adolescence uses pop stars as a timeless window into puberty and tells a tale of friendship and family in the most delightfully kid friendly way Vanity Fair s Richard Lawson commented that The film often seems squarely deliberately aimed at parents instead offering them a gentle if busy reminder that they were young once too once bursting at the seams with enthusiasm and curiosity and yes budding lust The film was also praised for its realistic depiction of female friendships and their ups and downs which producer Lindsey Collins credited to having mostly women on the creative team Sara Michelle Fetters describes the film as a coming of age sensation where the supernatural and the mundane happily walk hand in hand with each eye popping surprise grounded in lifelike normality br The Guardian s Benjamin Lee gave stars out of and concludes The journey is slick and diverting and at times incisive but Turning Red is yet another Pixar film that coasts rather than glides Hopefully its next offering can turn into something more Chicago Sun Times Richard Roeper gave stars out of and comments that The problems are mostly with the script which often requires Meilin to be almost irritatingly obnoxious Meanwhile her mother behaves like a monster for much of the story which takes on an increasingly supernatural element to the point where there s a Ghostbusters homage World s Collin Carbarino comments that With Turning Red Pixar abandons decades of nuanced storytelling and warms over Disney s clich d advice to follow your heart The Gospel Coalition s Brett McCracken said that For all of its merits the film ultimately advocates a wrongheaded central message under the guise of empowerment embrace who you are even your reckless vices and dangerous impulses and don t let anyone stop you br CinemaBlend s Sean O Connell called the focus on a Chinese Canadian girl as limiting to a broad audience By rooting Turning Red very specifically in the Asian community of Toronto the film legitimately feels like it was made for Domee Shi s friends and immediate family members Which is fine but also a tad limiting in its scope The New Yorker s Jane Hu echoed O Connell s views accusing the film of relying on East Asian stereotypes and of being hyper specific and alienating The review received backlash by members of the press on social media who called it sexist and racist crew and cast members of the movie eventually spoke up on the case Lead voice actress Rosalie Chiang said the film was meant to appeal to all This is a coming of age film everyone goes through this change I think different people of different cultures are going to go through it differently but at the end of the day the core messiness and change is something everyone can relate to As a result of the push back CinemaBlend s editor in chief Mack Rawden pulled O Connell s review and apologized publicly for it and that the site had failed to properly edit the review before posting O Connell also posted his own apology for the review br The attention drawn by O Connell s review led to parents and other audience critics to raise further issues with the film due to the character specificity bringing up concerns that the film aimed at a family audience brings up the issues of menstruation teenage crushes and sexuality and disobedience of one s parents which these people felt were topics best left for parents to discuss with their children on their own Movie critics for The New York Times The Atlantic The Daily Beast and Vox argued that these are natural topics that reflect the realities of year old girls and should not be considered taboo and praised the film for its honest portrayal of these behaviors br In Barry Hertz of The Globe and Mail named the film as one of the best Canadian comedy films ever made acknowledging that it was not a Canadian production but writing that Turning Red gets a pass because it not only reminds audiences of what Pixar can do when it s not in an Elemental y slump but showcases one of this country s brightest funniest filmmakers who is surely just getting started Kimberly Jones from the Austin Chronicles summarizes the film as a funny sweet and empathetic portrait of cultural identity gentle teen rebellion and tetchy mother daughter relations br br br Accolades br br At the th Academy Awards Turning Red received a nomination for Best Animated Feature The film s other nominations include seven Annie Awards a British Academy Film Award a Critics Choice Movie Award and a Golden Globe Award br br br Future br Domee Shi has expressed interest in a follow up stating We are open but we haven t talked about it But yeah it s an invitation at the end for more stories Chiang and Oh also expressed interest and came up with
