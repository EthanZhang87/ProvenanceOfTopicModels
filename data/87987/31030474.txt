by writer Peter Milligan and featuring artists Tomm Coker Dalibor Talajic Laurence Campbell Goran Parlov and Leandro Fernandez in December Milligan stated that the idea of the series came from editor Sebastian Girner expressing The egg of this idea was born in Sebastian s great interest and passion in all things Japanese Sebastian and I made an omelet out of that egg Milligan remarked that he is big fan of Akira Kurosawa s Seven Samurai and what drew him to the project was that this era of Japan was in such a state of flux One era was ending and a new one beginning These times are difficult to live through people are unsure where they stand and this is a great arena for looking at character and seeing how characters act when taken to uncomfortable places br Writer Peter Milligan on the series setting br br In there was a famously bloody and pivotal battle at Sekigahara where the Western and Eastern clans fought This battle ended what became known as the era of the warring states In other words the world of Japan that we find is going through a some kind of cataclysmic epochal change It s a violent age an age of deep anxiety Though it s a very alien time and place I feel that this era speaks to us about our own troubled times We have our own cataclysmic changes going on our own sense of anxiety and uprooted ness br Milligan also explained that each of the five issues focuses on one character but the stories are all inter linked All these characters have to rediscover as the story continues that there s a reason they re all connected and drawn together They each have problems that stem from the same source As to why he chose the characters Milligan remarked that they each represent an aspect of Japanese society Wolverine made the most sense and Psylocke is the character that fit in most beautifully Deadpool is perfect he could have been originally designed for this story Punisher also perfectly fits with what we wanted Both of these characters manage to be archetypes and that s why they so neatly and usefully worked with this story Hulk is a little different Part of the fun there was writing against type or character expectation Though again an integral part of Banner Hulk s character perfectly matches what we wanted in this book br br br Premise br Bound together by the same fate yet alone in their existence Wolverine Psylocke the Punisher

Together the Ronin leave to seek another quest br br br Reception br The first issue of Ronin was received with mixed reviews Dan Iverson of IGN gave it a out of praising the art by Tomm Corker and colorist Daniel Freedman but calling the story a bit too ambiguous and typical for the genre David Pepose of Newsarama stated Ronin is a confusing unexciting read that doesn t really do much to justify its Marvel superheroes as samurai premise Kelly Thompson of Comic Book Resources gave it out of stars declaring While there are definitely things to appreciate in this first issue of Ronin from evocative art to Milligan s sometimes beautiful writing in the end it feels a bit soulless An emotional connection of some kind could have made something as blas as revenge a bit more engaging However Matthew Meylikhov of Multiversity Comics gave the first and fifth issues out of saying that Milligan crafted a fairly well organized tale of revenge featuring some of Marvel s biggest characters and the various artists that have worked on each issue have made this title a must read for fans of both the characters and samurai in general br br br br br br External links br Ronin at
