The Nintendo VS System is an arcade system that was developed and produced by Nintendo It is based on most of the same hardware as the Family Computer Famicom later released as the Nintendo Entertainment System NES As Nintendo was planning to release the NES in North America they were aware of the video game crash of and its effects on the home console market However by March the arcade industry recovered enough for a plan to introduce NES titles there with the VS System later being a presentation to players who did not yet own the console It became the first version of the Famicom hardware to debut in North America br Most of its games are conversions from the Famicom and NES some heavily altered for the arcade format and some debuted on the VS System before being released on the Famicom or NES The system focuses on two player cooperative play It was released in three different configurations upright VS UniSystem cabinets upright VS DualSystem cabinets and sit down VS DualSystem cabinets Games are on pluggable circuit boards allowing for each side to have a different game br The VS System did not have lasting popularity in Japan leading to Nintendo s departure from arcade game development In contrast it was a commercial success in the United States with about arcade cabinets sold becoming the highest grossing arcade machine of The system s success in arcades proved the market for the test release of the NES in North America in The final VS System game was released in br br br Background br In Data East had introduced the concept of a convertible arcade system board or arcade conversion system with the DECO Cassette System but it was not a major success The first successful arcade conversion system is Sega s Convert a Game system in the early s Its success led to several other arcade manufacturers introducing their own arcade conversion systems by the mid s including the Nintendo VS System in br The Nintendo VS System is important in the history of the Nintendo Entertainment System NES The VS System is the first version of the Family Computer Famicom hardware to debut in North America during the success of which proved the market for the official release of the NES console Following the video game crash of the North American home video game market had collapsed Nintendo s negotiations with Atari to introduce the Famicom in North America failed due to Atari s collapse and Nintendo of America s market research garnered warnings from retailers and distributors to stay away from home consoles with US retailers refusing to stock game consoles Meanwhile the arcade game industry also had a slump as the golden age of arcade video games ended but the arcade industry recovered and stabilized with the help of software conversion kit systems such as Sega s Convert a Game system the Atari System and the Nintendo Pak system Hiroshi Yamauchi realized there was still a market for video games in North America where players were gradually returning to arcades in significant numbers Yamauchi still had faith there was a market for the Famicom so he introduced it to North America through the arcade industry br Nintendo based the VS System hardware on the Famicom and introduced it as the successor to its Nintendo Pak arcade system which had been used for games such as Mario Bros and Donkey Kong Though technologically weaker than Nintendo s Punch Out arcade hardware the VS System was relatively inexpensive The Nintendo Pak and Punch Out hardware also have a limited game library whereas the VS System accessed a wider variety of games by easily converting Famicom games Nintendo of America hired Jeff Walker from Bally to help market the VS System in North America where it debuted at the ASI show along with Punch Out in February br br br Hardware br The VS System was designed primarily as a kit to retrofit Donkey Kong Donkey Kong Jr Donkey Kong Popeye and Mario Bros cabinets so they require the same special monitor These monitors use inverse voltage levels for their video signals as compared to most arcade monitors br Almost all VS System cabinets have identical hardware powered by a Ricoh A central processing unit CPU the same in the NES except for special PPUs or video chips Each chip contains a different palette that arrange the colors in different configurations chosen apparently at random Most boards can be switched to a new game simply by swapping the program ROMs and the appropriate PPU or the game will have incorrect colors Several of the later units employ further copy protection by using special PPUs which swap pairs of I O registers or return special data from normally unimplemented regions of memory and games are not interchangeable with these models br Some dedicated double cabinets look like two games butted together at an angle with a single motherboard The Red Tent a steel sit down cabinet for the VS DualSystem allows play for up to four players simultaneously It has the same motherboard as the double cabinet br Because the VS System has the same CPU as the NES its games can be ported to the NES with modifications to the console including extra memory banks and additional DIP switches Some games differ from their home console versions For example VS Super Mario Bros is considerably more difficult than Super Mario Bros some of the levels were reused in Super Mario Bros The Lost Levels for the Famicom Disk System Some games graphics differ such as VS Duck Hunt having more details and animation sequences br br br Reception br Upon release the VS System generated excitement in the arcade industry receiving praise for its easy conversions affordability flexibility and multiplayer capabilities Eddie Adlum of RePlay magazine said Nintendo had suddenly become the big guy on the block in due to the VS System which not only meant interchangeable games but interaction between players on dual monitor games For Play Meter magazine Roger C Sharpe called it a highly attractive and open ended interchangeable game system featuring excellent graphics and realistic on screen visuals in and Gene Lewin gave the system a rating of out of in Others criticized the system s graphics as technologically weaker than more recent rival arcade systems and than Nintendo s own powerful Punch Out arcade hardware br In Japan VS Tennis topped Japan s chart for table arcade cabinets in April and May and VS Baseball topped the chart in June and July By however the VS System had declined in Japan which led to Yamauchi deciding to withdraw Nintendo from the Japanese coin op industry in late and Nintendo focusing more on the Famicom br br In North America by contrast the VS System became a major success Following the arcade success of sports video games such as Konami s Track Field Nintendo capitalized on this trend with sports games Punch Out VS Tennis and VS Baseball with great success in the US arcade market Sharpe considered Nintendo a force to reckon with based on this strong performance The VS System was declared an overwhelming hit by Play Meter attributing its success to good games and low price Between and arcade cabinets were sold in and individual VS games were top earners on arcade charts VS Tennis topped the arcade charts for software conversion kits in July on the RePlay charts and August on the Play Meter charts and VS Baseball topped the charts from September through November Hogan s Alley and Duck Hunt then became even more popular in American arcades popularizing light gun shooter video games By cabinets had been sold establishing Nintendo as an industry leader in the arcades In November five VS games were on the US RePlay top arcade charts with Hogan s Alley holding the top spot Duck Hunt was also popular in arcades at the time The VS System went on to become the highest grossing arcade platform of in the United States and Hogan s Alley and Excitebike became the top two highest grossing arcade system games that year br The success of the VS System gave Nintendo the confidence to repackage the Famicom for North America as the NES Nintendo s strong positive reputation in the arcades also generated significant interest in the NES It also gave Nintendo the opportunity to test new games as VS Paks in the arcades to determine which games to release for the NES launch Nintendo s software strategy was to first release games for the Famicom then the VS System and then for the NES This allowed Nintendo to build a solid launch line up for the NES Many games North American debut was on the VS System before being released for the NES which gave players the impression of being amazed at the accuracy of the arcade ports for the NES br Within a few months of its release VS Super Mario Bros arcade units were sold becoming the best selling VS release with each unit consistently earning more than equivalent to in per week Its arcade success helped introduce Super Mario Bros to many players who did not yet own an NES By the time the NES was launched in North America from late to about VS Systems had been sold to American arcades According to Ken Horowitz the VS System was perhaps the most vital catalyst in the rise of the NES to the top of the home video game market br In Europe the VS System was also a success in arcades by early before the launch of the NES there At London s Amusement Trades Exhibition International ATEI show in January David Snook of Play Meter magazine listed VS Super Mario Bros as one of the top five hits of the show along with Space Harrier Halley s Comet Gauntlet and Tehkan World Cup br Nintendo of America announced on July that it would stop making arcade machines The announcement included the last upcoming titles for the NES based PlayChoice and the SNES based Nintendo Super System but none for the VS System br br br List of games br Unknown prototypes of VS System games may have been either unreleased or released briefly for market
