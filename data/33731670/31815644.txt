title: CIC (Nintendo)
id: 31815644
The Checking Integrated Circuit CIC is a lockout chip designed by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System NES video game console in the chip is part of a system known as NES in which a key which is stored in the game is used by the lock stored in the console to both check if the game is authentic and if the game is the same region as the console br The chip was designed in response to the North American video game crash of which was partially the result of a lack of both publishing and quality control the idea was that by forcing third party developers to have their games go through an approval process Nintendo could stop shovelware from entering the market Improved designs of the CIC chip were also used in the later Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Nintendo although running an updated security program that performs additional checks br The lockout chip was controversial with several developers opting to release their games without Nintendo s approval by using workarounds the most well known of these was Tengen a subsidiary of Atari Games which copied the CIC chip resulting in their games running without issue In response Nintendo sued Atari for copyright infringement br br br NES br The NES system is a lock out system designed for the North American and European versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System NES video game console The electronic chip serves as a digital lock which can be opened by a key in the games designed to restrict the software that could be operated on the system br The chip was not present for the original Famicom in leading to a large amount of unlicensed cartridges in the Asian market They were however added for international variants as a response to the video game crash in North America partially caused by an oversaturated market of console games due to lack of publishing control Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi said in Atari collapsed because they gave too much freedom to third party developers and the market was swamped with rubbish games By requiring the presence of the NES in a game cartridge Nintendo prevented third party developers from producing games without Nintendo s approval and provided the company with licensing fees a practice it had already established earlier with Famicom games br br br Design br The system consists of two parts a Sharp Corporation bit SM microcontroller in the console the lock that checks the inserted cartridge for authentication and a matching chip in the game cartridge the key that gives the code upon demand If the cartridge does not successfully provide the authentication then the CIC repeatedly resets the CPU at a frequency of Hz This causes the television and power LED to blink at the same Hz rate and prevents the game from being playable br The program used in the NES CIC is called NES and was patented under U S patent The source code is copyrighted only Nintendo can produce the authorization chips The patent covering the NES expired on January although the copyright is still in effect for exact clones br br br Circumvention br br br Nintendo Entertainment System br br Some unlicensed companies created circuits that used a voltage spike to shut off the CIC before it can perform the authentication checks br A few unlicensed games released in Europe and Australia such as HES games came in the form of a dongle that would be connected to a licensed cartridge in order to use that cartridge s CIC lockout chip for authentication This method also worked on the SNES and was utilized by Super Noah s Ark D br Tengen Atari Games s NES games subsidiary took a different tactic the corporation obtained a description of the code in the lockout chip from the United States Copyright Office by claiming that it was required to defend against present infringement claims in a legal case Tengen then used these documents to design their Rabbit chip which duplicated the function of the NES Nintendo sued Tengen for these actions The court found that Tengen did not violate the copyright for copying the portion of code necessary to defeat the protection with current NES consoles but did violate the copyright for copying portions of the code not being used in the communication between the chip and console Tengen had copied this code in its entirety because future console releases could have been engineered to pick up the discrepancy On the initial claim the court sided with Nintendo on the issue of patent infringement but noted that Nintendo s patent would likely be deemed obvious as it was basically U S patent with the addition of a reset pin which was at the time already commonplace in the world of electronics An eight person jury later found that Atari did infringe While Nintendo was the winner of the initial trial before they could actually enforce the ruling they would need to have the patent hold up under scrutiny as well as address Tengen s antitrust claims Before this occurred the sides settled br A small company called RetroZone the first company to publish games on the NES in over a decade uses a multi region lockout chip for NTSC PAL A and PAL B called the Ciclone which was created by reverse engineering Tengen s Rabbit chip It will allow games to be played in more than one region It is intended to make the games playable on older hardware that uses the NES lockout chip and the two other regions although the top loading NES does not use a lockout chip The Ciclone chip is the first lockout chip to be developed after the patent for the NES had expired Since then there have been a few other open source implementations to allow the general public to reproduce multi region CICs on AVR microcontrollers br Because the NES in the model NES Control Deck occasionally fails to authenticate legal cartridges a common modification is to disable the chip entirely by cutting pin on the Control Deck s internal NES lockout chip br br br Super Nintendo Entertainment System br Towards the end of the SNES lifespan the CIC was cloned and used in pirate games Alternatively the aforementioned method of using a licensed game s CIC chip was possible as it was used in the SNES
