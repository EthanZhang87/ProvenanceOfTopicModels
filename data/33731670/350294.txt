The Game Boy Printer known as the Pocket Printer in Japan is a thermal printer accessory released by Nintendo in which ceased production in early The Game Boy Printer is compatible with all the Game Boy systems except the Game Boy Micro and is designed to be used in conjunction with the Game Boy Camera It also prints images from compatible late generation Game Boy and Game Boy Color games listed below It runs on six AA batteries and uses a proprietary mm wide thermal paper with adhesive backing originally sold in white red yellow and blue colors In Japan a bright yellow Pok mon version of the Game Boy Printer was released featuring a feed button in the style of a Pok Ball br br br Games with Game Boy Printer support br br br Game Boy Printer Thermal Paper br br Released alongside the Game Boy Printer in Nintendo manufactured thermal paper refill rolls were produced in white cream blue yellow and red variants all of which had an integrated adhesive backing br After powering the printer on a clip at the rear of the protruding translucent grey refill housing is depressed allowing this to be lifted away The thermal paper roll inserted upside down and unravelled end facing down with this end being fed into a thin slot The maroon FEED button is then pressed down which engages the uptake motor and pulls the paper through to the exit slot which has an integrated serrated edge which allows finished prints to be ripped away from the roll Forcibly pulling the paper opposite to the feed direction causes permanent damage to the gearing within the feed mechanism br When a picture was printed from the Game Boy Camera it would print with a mm in margin above and below the picture and print the picture at a mm in height This would give the total of mm in height per picture Although on box advertisements boasted up to pictures per roll in actuality a typical roll could only print between and pictures br Sold on the official Nintendo e Shop as triple packs of blue cream and white rolls until Game Boy branded official replacement thermal paper is now difficult to source Even brand new sealed un opened official rolls degrade relatively quickly once opened if they were stored correctly and their seal has not failed Most however have suffered degradation whilst in storage due to a chemical reaction between the thermal paper and adhesive backing layer Due to the proprietary nature of the adhesive backing replacement thermal paper that is able to be adhered to surfaces once printed upon including brands such as MAXStick is prohibitively expensive br Instead the thermal paper rolls can be successfully substituted with a mm x m alternative with or without core less spindle cores without repercussions on the printer Such rolls are also compatible with some hand held printing calculators such as the Canon TP Texas Instruments Sharp and Casio FX Alternatively wider rolls such as mm x mm x mm can be cut or trimmed to mm and function without issue br Please note however that due to the inherent limitations of thermal paper photographs printed on thermal paper will fade over time this depends heavily on the thermal paper variant used and could be as short as a few months or instead a few years until the paper is virtually blank Paper in this state can usually be re used as long as the length of the strip is long enough to be manually fed into the takeup br It is unknown whether original Game Boy Printer paper contains the chemicals Bisphenol A BPA or its analog Bisphenol S BPS Previously very widely used in plastics and thermal receipt paper due to their heat resistance and stability these are currently being phased out of thermal paper coatings due to their in vivo accrual via direct dermal absorption and resultant oestrogen mimicking and endocrine disruption Modern thermal paper roll replacements or their manufacturers usually clearly state if they are Bisphenol free BP Free br br br Game Boy Printer Protocol br The communication between the Game Boy and the Game Boy Printer is via a simple serial link Serial clock provided by the Game Boy for the printer serial data output from Game Boy to printer as well as serial data input to Game Boy from printer The Game Boy sends a packet to the printer to which the printer responds with an acknowledgement as well as a status code br br br Packet Format br Communication is via the Game Boy sending to the printer a simple packet structure as shown below In general between the first sync word til the checksum is the Game Boy communicating to the printer The last two bytes of the packet are for the printer to acknowledge and show its current status code br br Command may be either Initialize x Data x Print x or Inquiry x F br Payload byte count size depends on the value of the DATA LENGTH field br Compression field is a compression indicator No compression x br Checksum is a simple sum of bytes in command data length and the data payload br Status byte is a bit field byte indicating various status of the printer itself e g If it is still printing br br br Commands br br br Initialize x br Typical Payload Size br This packet is sent without a data payload It signals to the printer to clear the settings and prepare for the first data payload br br br Data x br Typical Payload Size br The data packet is for transferring the image data to the printer data buffer The typical size of the data payload is bytes since it can store two printable rows of standard Game Boy tile bit color in x pixels grid of which the Game Boy tile takes bytes br br br Print x br Typical Payload Size br This commands the printer to start printing It also has settings bytes for printing br br br Inquiry x F br Typical Payload Size br Used for checking the printer status byte This may be for checking if there is enough data in the printer buffer to start printing smoothly or if the printer is currently printing br br br Printer Status Reply Byte br br br Usage today br Mad Catz and Xchanger sold a kit that enabled users to connect a Game Boy to a PC and print images using the PC s printer Hobbyists outside the UK can also make their own cable for uploading images to their computer A Game Boy Printer emulator is needed for the Game Boy to interface with the PC once linked via cable The Game Boy Printer Paper has also been discontinued and rolls of the genuine article that still produce a reliable image are becoming more difficult to find Regular thermal paper such as the kind used for POS terminals can be cut to the proper width and used successfully with the Game Boy Printer br The system will print a test message reading Hello if it is turned on while the feed button is held According to the manual this is used to test if the printer is functioning properly To get around using six AA batteries volts each for the printer a single V battery can be used if wired properly because the printer requires V DC br br br Notes br br br Further Information br br br
