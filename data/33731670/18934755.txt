title: Video game console emulator
id: 18934755
A video game console emulator is a type of emulator that allows a computing device to emulate a video game console s hardware and play its games on the emulating platform More often than not emulators carry additional features that surpass limitations of the original hardware such as broader controller compatibility timescale control such as fast forwarding and rewinding easier access to memory modifications like GameShark and unlocking of gameplay features Emulators are also a useful tool in the development process of homebrew demos and the creation of new games for older discontinued or rare consoles br The code and data of a game are typically supplied to the emulator by means of a ROM file a copy of game cartridge data or an ISO image a copy of optical media While emulation software itself are legal as long as they don t infringe copyright protections on the console emulating games is only so when legitimately purchasing the game physically and ripping the contents Freely downloading or uploading game ROMs across various internet sites is considered to be a form of piracy and users may be sued for copyright infringement br br br History br By the mid s personal computers had progressed to the point where it was technically feasible to replicate the behavior of some of the earliest consoles entirely through software and the first unauthorized non commercial console emulators began to appear These early programs were often incomplete only partially emulating a given system resulting in defects Few manufacturers published technical specifications for their hardware which left programmers to deduce the exact workings of a console through reverse engineering Nintendo s consoles tended to be the most commonly studied for example the most advanced early emulators reproduced the workings of the Nintendo Entertainment System the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Game Boy The first such recognized emulator was released around being one of the prototype projects that eventually merged into the SNES X product Programs like Marat Fayzullin s iNES VirtualGameBoy Pasofami NES Super Pasofami SNES and VSMC SNES were the most popular console emulators of this era A curiosity was also Yuji Naka s unreleased NES emulator for the Genesis possibly marking the first instance of a software emulator running on a console Additionally as the Internet gained wider availability distribution of both emulator software and ROM images became more common helping to popularize emulators br Legal attention was drawn to emulations with the release of UltraHLE an emulator for the Nintendo released in while the Nintendo was still Nintendo s primary console its next console the GameCube would not be released until UltraHLE was the first emulator to be released for a current console and it was seen to have some effect on Nintendo sales though to what degree compared with diminishing sales on the aging consoles was not clear Nintendo pursued legal action to stop the emulator project and while the original authors ceased development the project continued by others who had gotten the source code Since then Nintendo has generally taken the lead in actions against emulation projects or distributions of emulated games from their consoles compared to other console or arcade manufacturers br This rise in popularity opened the door to foreign video games and exposed North American gamers to Nintendo s censorship policies This rapid growth in the development of emulators in turn fed the growth of the ROM hacking and fan translation The release of projects such as RPGe s English language translation of Final Fantasy V drew even more users into the emulation scene Additionally the development of some emulators has contributed to improved resources for homebrew software development for certain consoles such as was the case with VisualBoyAdvance a Game Boy Advance emulator that was noted by author Casey O Donnell as having contributed to the development of tools for the console that were seen as superior to even those provided by Nintendo so much so that even some licensed game developers used the tools to develop games for the console br On April Apple began allowing emulators on the App Store lifting a ban that had lasted nearly years Following this decision numerous emulators such as Delta Sut to and Retroarch appeared on the store br br br Methods br Emulators can be designed in three ways purely operating in software which is the most common form such as MAME using ROM images purely operating in hardware such as the ColecoVision s adapter to accept Atari VCS cartridges br An emulator is created typically through reverse engineering of the hardware information as to avoid any possible conflicts with non public intellectual property Some information may be made public for developers on the hardware s specifications which can be used to start efforts on emulation but there are often layers of information that remain as trade secrets such as encryption details Operating code stored in the hardware s BIOS may be disassembled to be analyzed in a clean room design with one person performing the disassembling and another person separately documenting the function of the code Once enough information is obtained regarding how the hardware interprets the game software an emulation on the target hardware can then be constructed Emulation developers typically avoid any information that may come from untraceable sources to avoid contaminating the clean room nature of their project For example in a large trove of information related to Nintendo s consoles was leaked and teams working on Nintendo console emulators such as the Dolphin emulator for GameCube and Wii stated they were staying far away from the leaked information to avoid tainting their project br Once an emulator is written it then requires a copy of the game software to be obtained a step that may have legal consequences Typically this requires the user to make a copy of the contents of the ROM cartridge to computer files or images that can be read by the emulator a process known as dumping the contents of the ROM A similar concept applies to other proprietary formats such as for PlayStation CD games While not required for emulation of the earliest arcade or home console most emulators also require a dump of the hardware s BIOS which could vary with distribution region and hardware revisions In some cases emulators allow for the application of ROM patches which update the ROM or BIOS dump to fix incompatibilities with newer platforms or change aspects of the game itself The emulator subsequently uses the BIOS dump to mimic the hardware while the ROM dump with any patches is used to replicate the game software br ROM files and ISO files are created by either specialized tools for game cartridges or regular optical drives reading the data As an alternative specialized adapters such as the Retrode allow emulators to directly access the data on game cartridges without needing to copy it into a ROM image first br br br Perspectives br Outside of official usage emulation has generally been seen negatively by video game console manufacturers and game developers The largest concern is nature of copyright infringement related to ROM images of games typically distributed freely and without hardware restrictions While this directly impacts potential sales of emulated games and thus the publishers and developers the nature of the value chain of the industry can lead to potential financial harm to console makers Further emulation challenges the industry s use of the razorblade model for console games where consoles are sold near cost and revenue instead obtained from licenses on game sales With console emulation being developed even while consoles are still on the market console manufacturers are forced to continue to innovate bring more games for their systems to market and move quickly onto new technology to continue their business model There are further concerns related to intellectual property of the console s branding and of games assets that could be misused though these are issues less with emulation itself but with how the software is subsequently used br Alternatively emulation is seen to enhance video game preservation efforts both in shifting game information from outdated technology into newer more persistent formats and providing software or hardware alternates to aged hardware Concerns about cost availability and longevity of game software and console hardware have also been cited as a reason for supporting the development of emulators Some users of emulation also see emulation as means to preserve games from companies that have long since gone bankrupt or disappeared from the industry s earlier market crash and contractions and where ownership of the property is unclear Emulation can also be seen as a means to enhance functionality of the original game that would otherwise not be possible such as adding in localizations via ROM patches or new features such as save states In November Phil Spencer stated that he hoped for video game companies to eventually develop and propagate legal emulation which would allow users to play any game from the past that they already owned a copy of characterizing it as a great North Star for the industry to aim towards in the future br br br Legal issues br br br United States br As computers and global computer networks continued to advance and become more popular emulator developers grew more skilled in their work the length of time between the commercial release of a console and its successful emulation began to shrink Fifth generation consoles such as Nintendo PlayStation and sixth generation handhelds such as the Game Boy Advance saw significant progress toward emulation during their production This led to an effort by console manufacturers to stop unofficial emulation but consistent failures such as Sega v Accolade F d th Cir Sony Computer Entertainment Inc v Connectix Corporation F d and Sony Computer Entertainment America v Bleem F d have had the opposite effect which has ruled that emulators developed through clean room design are legal The Librarian of Congress under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA has codified these rules as allowed exemptions to bypass technical copyright protections on console hardware However emulator developers cannot incorporate code that may have been embedded within the hardware BIOS nor ship the BIOS image with their emulators br Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted code remains illegal according to both country specific copyright and international copyright law under the Berne Convention Accordingly video game publishers and developers have taken legal action against websites that illegally redistribute their copyrighted software successfully forcing sites to remove their titles or taking down the websites entirely br Under United States law obtaining a dumped copy of the original machine s BIOS is legal under the ruling Lewis Galoob Toys Inc v Nintendo of America Inc F d th Cir as fair use as long as the user obtained a legally purchased copy of the machine To mitigate this however several emulators for platforms such as Game Boy Advance are capable of running without a BIOS file using high level emulation to simulate BIOS subroutines at a slight cost in emulation accuracy br Newer consoles have introduced one or more layers of encryption to make emulation more difficult from a technical perspective but also can create further legal challenges under the DMCA which forbids the distribution of tools and information on how to bypass these layers The Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu had been sued by Nintendo because the group behind the emulator had provided such information on how to obtain the required decryption keys leading the group to settle with Nintendo and removing the emulator from distribution Forked projects from Yuzu since appeared taking the route of informing users what decryption items they would need but otherwise not stating how to acquire these as to stay within Nintendo s stance against emulation and copyright infringement br br br Impersonation by malware br Due to their popularity emulators have also been a target of online scams in the form of trojan horse programs designed to mimic the appearance of a legitimate emulator which are then promoted through spam on YouTube and elsewhere Some scams such as the purported PCSX emulator have even gone so far as to setting up a fake GitHub repository presumably for added trustworthiness especially to those unfamiliar with open source software development The Federal Trade Commission has since issued an advisory warning users to avoid downloading such software in response to reports of a purported Nintendo Switch emulator released by various websites as a front for a survey scam br br br Official use br Due to the high demand of playing old games on modern systems consoles have begun incorporating emulation technology The most notable of these is Nintendo s Virtual Console Originally released for the Wii but present on the DS and Wii U Virtual Console uses software emulation to allow the purchasing and playing of games for old systems on this modern hardware Though not all games are available the Virtual Console has a large collection of games spanning a wide variety of consoles The Virtual Console s library of past games currently consists of titles originating from the Nintendo Entertainment System Super NES Game Boy Game Boy Color Nintendo Game Boy Advance Nintendo DS and Wii as well as Sega s Master System and Genesis Mega Drive NEC s TurboGrafx and SNK s Neo Geo The service for the Wii also includes games for platforms that were known only in select regions such as the Commodore Europe and North America and MSX Japan as well as Virtual Console Arcade which allows players to download video arcade games Virtual Console titles have been downloaded over ten million times Each game is distributed with a dedicated emulator tweaked to run the game as well as possible However it lacks the enhancements that unofficial emulators provide and many titles are still unavailable br Until the firmware update the Nintendo Switch system software contained an embedded NES emulator referred to internally as flog running the game Golf with motion controller support using Joy Con The Easter egg was believed to be a tribute to former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata who died in the game was only accessible on July the date of his death Golf was programmed by Iwata and the game was activated by performing a motion gesture with a pair of Joy Con that Iwata had famously used during Nintendo s video presentations It was suggested that the inclusion of Golf was intended as a digital form of omamori a traditional form of Japanese amulets intended to provide luck or protection As part of its Nintendo Switch Online subscription service Nintendo subsequently released an app featuring an on demand library of NES and SNES titles updated regularly The app features similar features to Virtual Console titles including save states as well as a pixel scaler mode and an effect that simulates CRT television displays br Due to differences in hardware the Xbox is not natively backwards compatible with original Xbox games However Microsoft achieved backwards compatibility with popular titles through an emulator On June Microsoft announced the Xbox One would be backwards compatible with Xbox through emulation In June they announced original Xbox titles would also be available for backwards compatibility through emulation but because the Xbox original runs on the x architecture CPU emulation is unnecessary greatly improving performance The PlayStation uses software emulation to play original PlayStation titles and the PlayStation Store sells games that run through an emulator within the machine In the original Japanese and North American GB and GB models original PS hardware is present to run titles however all PAL models and later models released in Japan and North America removed some PS hardware components replacing it with software emulation working alongside the video hardware to achieve partial hardware software emulation In later releases backwards compatibility with PS titles was completely removed along with the PS graphics chip and eventually Sony released PS titles with software emulation on the PlayStation Store br Commercial developers have also used emulation as a means to repackage and reissue older games on newer consoles in retail releases For example Sega has created several collections of Sonic the Hedgehog games Before the Virtual Console Nintendo also used this tactic such as Game Boy Advance re releases of NES titles in the Classic NES Series br br br Other uses br Although the primary purpose of emulation is to make older video games execute on newer systems there are several advantages inherent in the extra flexibility of software emulation that were not possible on the original systems br br br ROM hacking and modification br Disk image loading is a necessity for most console emulators as most computing devices do not have the hardware required to run older console games directly from the physical game media itself Even with optical media system emulators such as the PlayStation and PlayStation attempting to run games from the actual disc may cause problems such as hangs and malfunction as PC optical drives are not designed to spin discs the way those consoles do This however has led to the advantage of it being far easier to modify the actual game s files contained within the game ROMs Amateur programmers and gaming enthusiasts have produced translations of foreign games rewritten dialogue within a game applied fixes to bugs that were present in the original game as well as updating old sports games with modern rosters It is even possible to use high resolution texture pack upgrades for D games and sometimes D if available and possible br br br Enhanced technical features br Software that emulates a console can be improved with additional capabilities that the original system did not have These include Enhanced graphical capabilities such as spatial anti aliasing upscaling of the framebuffer resolution to match high definition and even higher display resolutions as well as anisotropic filtering texture sharpening br Emulation software may offer improved audio capabilities e g decreased latency and better audio interpolation enhanced save states which allow the user to save a game at any point for debugging or re try and decreased boot and loading times Some emulators feature an option to quickly boot a game bypassing the console manufacturer s original splash screens br Furthermore emulation software may offer online multiplayer functionality and the ability to speed up and slow down the emulation speed This allows the user to fast forward through unwanted cutscenes for example or the ability to disable the framelimiter entirely useful for benchmarking purposes br br br Bypassing regional lockouts br Some consoles have a regional lockout preventing the user from being able to play games outside of the designated game region This can be considered a nuisance for console gamers as some games feature seemingly inexplicable localization differences between regions such as differences in the time requirements for driving missions and license tests on Gran Turismo and the PAL version of Final Fantasy X which added more ingame skills changes to some bosses and even more bosses Dark Aeons that weren t available in the North American NTSC release of the game br Although it is usually possible to modify the consoles themselves to bypass regional lockouts console modifications can cause problems with screens not being displayed correctly and games running too fast or slow due to the fact that the console itself may not be designed to output to the correct format for the game These problems can be overcome on emulators as they are usually designed with their own output modules which can run both NTSC and PAL games without issue br br br Cheating and widescreen functionality br Many emulators for example Snes x make it far easier to load console based cheats without requiring potentially expensive proprietary hardware devices such as those used by GameShark and Action Replay Freeware tools allow codes given by such programs to be converted into code that can be read directly by the emulator s built in cheating system and even allow cheats to be toggled from the menu The debugging tools featured in many emulators also aid gamers in creating their own such cheats br Similar systems can also be used to enable Widescreen Hacks for certain games allowing the user to play games which were not originally intended for widescreen without having to worry about aspect ratio distortion on widescreen monitors br br br See also br List of video game console emulators br br br Notes br br br
