The Atari Lynx is a bit fourth generation hand held game console released by Atari Corporation in September in North America and in Europe and Japan It was the first handheld game console with a color liquid crystal display Powered by a MHz C bit CPU and a custom bit blitter the Lynx was more advanced than Nintendo s monochrome Game Boy released two months earlier It also competed with Sega s Game Gear and NEC s TurboExpress released the following year br The system was developed at Epyx by two former designers of the Amiga personal computers The project was called the Handy Game or simply Handy In Atari replaced the Lynx with a smaller model internally referred to as the Lynx II Atari published a total of games for the Lynx before it was discontinued in br br br History br The Lynx system was originally developed by Epyx as the Handy Game In two former Amiga designers RJ Mical and Dave Needle had been asked by a former manager at Amiga Dave Morse to design a portable gaming system Morse now worked at Epyx a game software company with a recent string of hit games Morse s son had asked him if he could make a portable gaming system prompting a meeting with Mical and Needle to discuss the idea Morse convinced Mical and Needle and they were hired by Epyx to be a part of the design team Planning and design of the console began in and was completed in Epyx first showed the Handy system at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show CES in January Facing financial difficulties Epyx sought partners Nintendo Sega and other companies declined but Atari and Epyx eventually agreed that Atari would handle production and marketing and Epyx would handle software development Epyx declared bankruptcy by the end of the year so Atari essentially owned the entire project Both Atari and others had to purchase Amigas from Atari arch rival Commodore in order to develop Lynx software br The Handy was designed to run games from the cartridge format and the game data must be copied from ROM to RAM before it can be used Thus less RAM is then available and each game s initial loading is slow There are trace remnants of a cassette tape interface physically capable of being programmed to read a tape Lynx developers have noted that there is still reference of the tape and some hardware addresses and an updated vintage Epyx manual describes the bare existence of what could be utilized for tape support ch A retrospective interview with Mical clarifies that there is no truth to some early reports claiming that games were loaded from tape and elaborates We did think about hard disk a little br The networking system was originally developed to run over infrared links and codenamed RedEye This was changed to a cable based networking system before the final release as the infrared beam was too easily interrupted when players walked through the beam according to Peter Engelbrite Engelbrite developed the first recordable eight player co op game and the only eight player game for the Lynx Todd s Adventures in Slime World br Atari changed the internal speaker and removed the thumb stick on the control pad At Summer CES Atari s press demonstration included the Portable Color Entertainment System which was changed to Lynx when distributed to resellers initially retailing in the US at US equivalent to about in br Its launch was successful Atari reported that it had sold of the units shipped in the launch month in the U S with a limited launch in New York US sales in were approximately units according to the Associated Press In late it was reported that Atari sales estimates were about which Atari claimed was within its expected projections Lifetime sales by amount to fewer than million units when combined with the Game Gear In comparison million Game Boy units were sold by because of its superior durability pricing battery life and game library notably the pack in hit Tetris br As with the console units the game cartridge design evolved over the first year of the console s release The first generation of cartridges are flat and designed to be stackable for ease of storage However this design proved to be very difficult to remove from the console and was replaced by a second design This style called tabbed or ridged adds two small tabs on the underside to aid in removal The original flat style cartridges can be stacked on top of the newer cartridges but the newer cartridges can not be easily stacked on each other nor were they stored easily Thus a third style the curved lip style was produced and all official and third party cartridges during the console s lifespan were released or re released using this style br In May Sega launched its Game Gear portable gaming handheld with a color screen In comparison to the Lynx it had shorter battery life hours as opposed to for the Lynx but it is slightly smaller has significantly more games and cost less than the Lynx at launch br Retailers such as Game and Toys R Us continued to sell the Lynx well into the mid s on the back of the Atari Jaguar launch helped by magazines such as Ultimate Future Games which continued to cover the Lynx alongside the new generation of bit and bit consoles br br br Lynx II br br In July Atari introduced a new version of the Lynx internally called the Lynx II with a new marketing campaign new packaging slightly improved hardware better battery life and a sleeker look It has rubber hand grips and a clearer backlit color screen with a power save option which turns off the backlighting The monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx was replaced with one wired for stereo The Lynx II was available without any accessories dropping the price to equivalent to in br br br Decline br In Atari started shifting its focus away from the Lynx in order to prepare for the launch of the Jaguar a few games were released during that time including Battlezone Support for the Lynx was formally discontinued in br After the respective launches of the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation caused the commercial failure of the Jaguar Atari ceased all game development and hardware manufacturing by early and would later merge with JTS Inc on July of that year br br br Features br The Atari Lynx has a backlit color LCD display switchable right and left handed upside down configuration and the ability to network with other units via Comlynx cable The maximum stable connection allowed is eight players Each Lynx needs a copy of the game and one cable can connect two machines The cables can be connected into a chain br br The Lynx was cited as the first gaming console with hardware support for zooming and distortion of sprites With a color palette and integrated maths and graphics co processors including a sprite engine unit its color graphics display was said to be the key defining feature in the system s competition against Nintendo s monochromatic Game Boy The fast pseudo D graphics features were made possible on a minimal hardware system by co designer Dave Needle having invented the technique for planar expansion shrinking capability and using stretched triangles instead of full polygons br br br Technical specifications br br

Legacy br Telegames released several games in the late s including a port of Raiden and a platformer called Fat Bobby in and an action sports game called Hyperdrome in br On March nearly three years after the Lynx s discontinuation JTS Corporation sold all of the Atari assets to Hasbro Interactive for million On May Hasbro which held on to those properties until selling Hasbro Interactive to Infogrames in released into the public domain all rights to the Jaguar opening up the platform for anyone to publish software on without Hasbro s interference Internet theories say that the Lynx s rights may have been released to the public at the same time as the Jaguar but this is clearly disputed Nevertheless since discontinuation the Lynx like the Jaguar has continued to receive support from a grassroots community which would go on to produce many successful homebrew games such as T Tris the first Lynx game with a save game feature Alpine Games and Zaku br In Atari was honored at the
