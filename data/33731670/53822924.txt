also sold out quickly on a first come first served basis The Target website became glitched out removing the items from users carts and pre orders from Walmart were sold out in less than a minute This led to Nintendo of America being criticized as inept or underhanded and that they contributed to a chaotic situation br Polygon also confirmed that the Tai Ding internet bot was being used to quickly
