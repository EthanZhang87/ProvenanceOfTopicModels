USB C or USB Type C is a pin connector not a protocol that supersedes previous USB connectors and can carry audio video and other data e g to drive multiple displays or to store a backup to an external drive It can also provide and receive power such as powering a laptop or a mobile phone It is applied not only by USB technology but also by other protocols including Thunderbolt PCIe HDMI DisplayPort and others It is extensible to support future standards br Design for the USB C connector was initially developed in by Apple Inc and Intel Type C Specification was published by the USB Implementers Forum USB IF on August In July it was adopted by the IEC as IEC br The USB Type C connector has pins and is reversible The designation C is to distinguish it from the various former USB connectors it replaced all termed either Type A or Type B Whereas earlier every USB cable had a host end A and a peripheral device end B USB C replaces both a USB C cable connects either way and for older equipment a legacy cable has a Type C plug at one end and either a Type A host or a Type B peripheral device plug at the other The designation C refers only to the connector s physical configuration or form factor not to be confused with the connector s specific capabilities such as Thunderbolt DisplayPort or USB Gen x Based on the protocols supported by both devices host and peripheral device a USB C connection normally provides much higher signaling and therefore data rates than the superseded connectors br A device with a Type C connector does not necessarily implement any USB transfer protocol USB Power Delivery or any of the Alternate Modes the Type C connector is common to several technologies while mandating only a few of them br USB released in September fully replaced the USB specification It preserves previously called USB SuperSpeed and SuperSpeed data transfer modes and introduces two additional data transfer modes by newly applying two lane operations with signaling rates of Gbit s SuperSpeed USB Gbps nominal data rate GB s and Gbit s SuperSpeed USB Gbps nominal data rate GB s They are only applicable with Full Featured USB C connectors and cables on both ends br USB released in is the first USB transfer protocol standard that is only available exclusively via USB C br br br Ease of use br The USB C standard simplifies usage by specifying cables having identical plugs on both ends which can be inserted without concern about orientation When connecting two devices the user can plug either end of the cable into either device The plugs are flat but will work if inserted right side up or upside down br The USB C plugs have two fold rotational symmetry because a plug may be inserted into a receptacle in either of two orientations Electrically USB C plugs are not symmetric as can be seen in the tables of pin layouts Also the two ends of the USB C are electrically different as can be seen in the table of cable wiring The illusion of symmetry results from how devices respond to the cable Software makes the plugs and cables behave as though they are symmetric According to the specifications Determination of this host to device relationship is accomplished through a Configuration Channel CC that is connected through the cable br The USB C standard attempts to eliminate the need to have different cables for other communication technologies such as Thunderbolt PCIe HDMI DisplayPort and more USB C cables can contain circuit boards and processors giving them much more capability than simple circuit connections br br br Overview br USB C cables interconnect hosts and peripheral devices replacing various other electrical cables and connectors including all earlier legacy USB connectors HDMI connectors DisplayPort ports and mm audio jacks br br br Name br USB Type C and USB C are trademarks of the USB Implementers Forum br br br Connectors br br The pin double sided connector is slightly larger than the micro B connector with a USB C receptacle measuring millimetres in wide millimetres in high and millimetres in deep br br br Cables br USB cables are considered full featured USB C cables They are electronically marked cables that contain a chip with an ID function based on the configuration channel and vendor defined messages VDM from the USB Power Delivery specification Cable length should not exceed metres ft in for Gen and metre ft in for Gen The electronic ID chip provides information about product vendor cable connectors USB signaling protocol Gen Gen passive active construction use of VCONN power available VBUS current latency RX TX directionality SOP controller mode and hardware firmware version br USB C cables that do not have shielded SuperSpeed pairs sideband use pins or additional wires for power lines can have increased cable length up to metres ft These USB C cables only support USB up to Mbit s and do not support Alternate Modes Active cables those with built in repeaters can support SuperSpeed USB Gbps USB Gen x USB Gen USB only over lengths up to metres ft br All USB C cables must be able to carry a minimum of A current at V for W but some can carry A current at V for W USB C to USB C cables supporting A current must contain e marker chips also marketed as E Mark chips programmed to identify the cable and its current capabilities USB charging ports should be clearly marked with power capability br Full featured USB C cables that implement USB Gen can provide Gbit s full duplex signalling rate They are marked with a SuperSpeed USB Gbps previously marketed as SuperSpeed logo There are also cables which can support only USB with a nominal data rate of Mbit s with maximal effective data rate of MB s The USB Implementers Forum certifies valid cables so they can be marked accordingly and users can distinguish them from non compliant products br br br Hosts and peripheral devices br For any two pieces of equipment connecting over USB one is a host with a downstream facing port DFP and the other is a peripheral device with an upstream facing port UFP Some products such as mobile phones can take either role whichever is opposite that of the connected equipment Such equipment is said to have Dual Role Data DRD capability which was known as USB On The Go in the previous specification With USB C when two such devices are connected the roles are first randomly assigned but a swap can be commanded from either end although there are optional path and role detection methods that would allow equipment to select a preference for a specific role Furthermore Dual Role equipment that implements USB Power Delivery may swap data and power roles independently using the Data Role Swap or Power Role Swap processes This allows for charge through hub or docking station applications such as a portable computer acting as a host to connect to peripherals but being powered by the dock or a computer being powered by a display through a single USB C cable br USB C devices may optionally provide or consume bus power currents of A and A at V in addition to baseline bus power provision power sources can either advertise increased USB current through the configuration channel or implement the full USB Power Delivery specification using both the BMC coded configuration line and the legacy BFSK coded VBUS line br All older USB connectors all Type A and Type B are designated legacy Connecting legacy and modern USB C equipment requires either a legacy cable assembly a cable with any Type A or Type B plug on one end and a Type C plug on the other or in very specific cases a legacy adapter assembly br An older device can connect to a modern USB C host by using a legacy cable with a Standard B Mini B or Micro B plug on the device end and a USB C plug on the other Similarly a modern device can connect to a legacy host by using a legacy cable with a USB C plug on the device end and a Standard A plug on the host end Legacy adapters with USB C receptacles are not defined or allowed by the specification because they can create many invalid and potentially unsafe cable combinations being any cable assembly with two A ends or two B ends However exactly two types of adapter with USB C plugs are defined one with a Standard A receptacle for connecting a legacy device such as a flash drive not a cable to a modern host and supporting up to USB and one with a Micro B receptacle for connecting a modern device to a legacy host and supporting up to USB br br br Non USB modes br br br Audio adapter accessory mode br A device with a USB C port may support analog headsets through an audio adapter with a mm jack providing three analog audio channels left and right output and microphone The audio adapter may optionally include a USB C charge through port to allow mA device charging The engineering specification states that an analog headset shall not use a USB C plug instead of a mm plug In other words headsets with a USB C plug should always support digital audio and optionally the accessory mode br Analog signals use the USB differential pairs Dp and Dn for Right and Left and the two side band use pairs for Mic and GND The presence of the audio accessory is signaled through the configuration channel and VCONN br br br Alternate modes br br An Alternate Mode dedicates some of the physical wires in a USB C cable for direct device to host transmission using non USB data protocols such as DisplayPort or Thunderbolt The four high speed lanes two side band pins and for dock detachable device and permanent cable applications only five additional pins can be used for Alternate Mode transmission The modes are configured using vendor defined messages VDM through the configuration channel br br br

readable strings with product description and user support information Billboard messages can be used to identify incompatible connections made by users They optionally appear to negotiate multiple Alternate Modes and must appear when negotiation fails between the host source and device sink br USB Audio Device Class Specification br USB Audio Device Class defines powered digital audio headsets with a USB C plug The standard supports the transfer of both digital and analog audio signals over the USB port br USB Power Delivery Specification br While it is not necessary for USB C compliant devices to implement USB Power Delivery for USB C DRP DRD Dual Role Power Data ports USB Power Delivery introduces commands for altering a port s power or data role after the roles have been established when a connection is made br USB Specification br USB released in September replaces the USB standard It preserves existing USB SuperSpeed and SuperSpeed data modes and introduces two new SuperSpeed transfer modes over the USB C connector using two lane operation doubling the data rates to and Gbit s and GB s USB is only supported by USB C making micro USB connectors obsolete br USB Specification br The USB specification released in is the first USB data transfer specification to exclusively use the Type C connector br br br Alternate Mode partner specifications br As of five system defined Alternate Mode partner specifications exist Additionally vendors may support proprietary modes for use in dock solutions Alternate Modes are optional Type C features and devices are not required to support any specific Alternate Mode The USB Implementers Forum is working with its Alternate Mode partners to make sure that ports are properly labelled with respective logos br br Other protocols like Ethernet have been proposed although Thunderbolt and later are also capable of Gigabit Ethernet networking br All Thunderbolt controllers support both Thunderbolt Alternate Mode and DisplayPort Alternate Mode Because Thunderbolt can encapsulate DisplayPort data every Thunderbolt controller can either output DisplayPort signals directly over DisplayPort Alternative Mode or encapsulated within Thunderbolt in Thunderbolt Alternate Mode Low cost peripherals mostly connect via DisplayPort Alternate Mode while some docking stations tunnel DisplayPort over Thunderbolt br DisplayPort Alternate Mode DisplayPort can run directly over USB C alongside USB DisplayPort can support K resolution at Hz with HDR color and can use up to Gbps which is double the amount available to USB data br The USB SuperSpeed protocol is similar to DisplayPort and PCIe Thunderbolt in using packetized data transmitted over differential LVDS lanes with embedded clock using comparable bit rates so these Alternate Modes are easier to implement in the chipset br Alternate Mode hosts and sinks can be connected with either regular Full Featured Type C cables or with converter cables or adapters br br USB Type C to Type C Full Featured cable br DisplayPort Mobile High Definition Link MHL HDMI and Thunderbolt Gbit s or Gbit s with cable length up to m Alternate Mode Type C ports can be interconnected with standard passive Full Featured USB Type C cables These cables are only marked with standard trident SuperSpeed USB logo for Gen cables or the SuperSpeed USB Gbit s logo for Gen cables on both ends Cable length should be m or less for Gen and m or less for Gen br Thunderbolt Type C to Type C active cable br Thunderbolt Gbit s Alternate Mode with cables longer than m requires active Type C cables that are certified and electronically marked for high speed Thunderbolt transmission similarly to high power A cables These cables are marked with a Thunderbolt logo on both ends They do not support USB backwards compatibility only USB or Thunderbolt Cables can be marked for both Thunderbolt and A power delivery at the same time br Active cables and adapters contain powered electronics to allow for longer cables or to perform protocol conversion The adapters for video Alternate Modes may allow conversion from native video stream to other video interface standards e g DisplayPort HDMI VGA or DVI br Using Full Featured Type C cables for Alternate Mode connections provides some benefits Alternate Mode does not employ USB lanes and the configuration channel lane so USB and USB Power Delivery protocols are always available In addition DisplayPort and MHL Alternate Modes can transmit on one two or four SuperSpeed lanes so two of the remaining lanes may be used to simultaneously transmit USB data br br br USB C receptacle pin usage in different modes br The diagrams below depict the pins of a USB C receptacle in different use cases br br br USB br A simple USB device mates using one pair of D D pins Hence the source host does not require any connection management circuitry but it lacks the same physical connector so therefore USB C is not backward compatible VBUS and GND provide V up to mA of current br However to connect a USB device to a USB C host use of Rd on the CC pins is required as the source host will not supply VBUS until a connection is detected through the CC pins br This means many USB A to USB C cables will only work in the A to C direction connecting to a USB C devices e g for charging as they do not include the termination resistors needed to work in the C to A direction from a USB C host Adapters or cables from USB C to a USB A receptacle usually do work as they include the required termination resistor br br br USB Power Delivery br The USB Power Delivery specification uses one of CC or CC pins for power negotiation between source device and sink device up to V at A It is transparent to any data transmission mode and can therefore be used together with any of them as long as the CC pins are intact br An extension to the specification has added V V and V to support up to W of power for laptops monitors hard disks and other peripherals br br br USB br In the USB mode two or four high speed links are used in TX RX pairs to provide or Gbit s only by USB x two lane operations signalling rates respectively One of the CC pins is used to negotiate the mode br VBUS and GND provide V up to mA in accordance with the USB specification A specific USB C mode may also be entered where V at nominal either A or A is provided A third alternative is to establish a USB Power Delivery USB PD contract br In single lane mode only the differential pairs closest to the CC pin are used for data transmission For dual lane data transfers all four differential pairs are in use br The D D link for USB is typically not used when USB x connection is active but devices like hubs open simultaneous and x uplinks in order to allow operation of both types of devices connected to it Other devices may have the ability to fall back to in case the x connection fails br br br Alternate Modes br In Alternate Modes one of up to four high speed links are used in whatever direction is needed SBU SBU provide an additional lower speed link If two high speed links remain unused then a USB link can be established concurrently to the Alternate Mode One of the CC pins is used to perform all the negotiation An additional low band bidirectional channel other than SBU may share that CC pin as well USB is also available through D D pins br In regard to power the devices are supposed to negotiate a Power Delivery contract before an Alternate Mode is entered br br br Debug Accessory Mode br The external device test system DTS signals to the target system TS to enter debug accessory mode via CC and CC both being pulled down with an Rd resistor value or pulled up as Rp resistor value from the test plug Rp and Rd defined in Type C specification br After entering debug accessory mode optional orientation detection via the CC and CC is done via setting CC as a pullup of Rd resistance and CC pulled to ground via Ra resistance from the test system Type C plug While optional orientation detection is required if USB Power Delivery communication is to remain functional br In this mode all digital circuits are disconnected from the connector and the bold pins can be used to expose debug related signals e g JTAG interface USB IF requires for certification that security and privacy consideration and precaution has been taken and that the user has actually requested that debug test mode be performed br br If a reversible Type C cable is required but Power Delivery support is not the test plug will need to be arranged as below with CC and CC both being pulled down with an Rd resistor value or pulled up as Rp resistor value from the test plug br br This mirroring of test signals will only provide test signals for debug usage instead of but with the benefit of minimizing extra parts count for orientation detection br br br Audio Adapter Accessory Mode br In this mode all digital circuits are disconnected from the connector and certain pins become reassigned for analog outputs or inputs The mode if supported is entered when both CC pins are shorted to GND D and D become audio output left L and right R respectively The SBU pins become a microphone pin MIC and the analog ground AGND the latter being a return path for both outputs and the microphone Nevertheless the MIC and AGND pins must have automatic swap capability for two reasons firstly the USB C plug may be inserted either side secondly there is no agreement which TRRS rings shall be GND and MIC so devices equipped with a headphone jack with microphone input must be able to perform this swap anyway br This mode also allows concurrent charging of a device exposing the analog audio interface through VBUS and GND however only at V and mA as CC pins are unavailable for any negotiation br br Plug insertions detection is performed by the TRRS plug s physical plug detection switch On plug insertions this will pull down both CC and VCONN in the plug CC and CC in the receptacle This resistance must be less than ohms which is the minimum Ra resistance specified in the USB Type C specification This is essentially a direct connection to USB digital ground br br br Software support br Android from version Marshmallow onwards works with USB and USB C br ChromeOS starting with the

Delivery and USB Dual Role br br br Authentication br USB Type C Authentication is an extension to the USB C protocol which can add security to the protocol br br br Hardware support br br br USB C devices br An increasing number of motherboards notebooks tablet computers smartphones hard disk drives USB hubs and other devices released from onwards include the USB C receptacles However the initial adoption of USB C was limited by the high cost of USB C cables and the wide use of Micro USB chargers br br br Video output br Currently DisplayPort is the most widely implemented alternate mode and is used to provide video output on devices that do not have standard size DisplayPort or HDMI ports such as smartphones and laptops All Chromebooks with a USB C port are required to support DisplayPort alternate mode in Google s hardware requirements for manufacturers A USB C multiport adapter converts the device s native video stream to DisplayPort HDMI VGA allowing it to be displayed on an external display such as a television set or computer monitor br It is also used on USB C docks designed to connect a device to a power source external display USB hub and optional extra such as a network port with a single cable These functions are sometimes implemented directly into the display instead of a separate dock meaning a user connects their device to the display via USB C with no other connections required br br br Compatibility issues br br br Power issues with cables br Many cables claiming to support USB C are actually not compliant to the standard These cables can potentially damage a device There are reported cases of laptops being destroyed due to the use of non compliant cables br Some non compliant cables with a USB C connector on one end and a legacy USB A plug or Micro B receptacle receptacles also being invalid on cables on the other end incorrectly terminate the Configuration Channel CC with a k pull up to VBUS instead of the specification mandated k pull up causing a device connected to the cable to incorrectly determine the amount of power it is permitted to draw from the cable Cables with this issue may not work properly with certain products including Apple and Google products and may even damage power sources such as chargers hubs or PC USB ports br When a defective USB C cable or power source is used the voltage seen by a USB C device can be different from the voltage expected by the device This may result in an overvoltage on the VBUS pin Also due to the fine pitch of the USB C receptacle the VBUS pin from the cable may contact with the CC pin of the USB C receptacle resulting in a short to VBUS electrical issue due to the fact that the VBUS pin is rated up to V while the CC pins are rated up to V To overcome these issues USB Type C port protection must be used between a USB C connector and a USB C Power Delivery controller br br br Compatibility with audio adapters br The USB C port can be used to connect wired accessories such as headphones br There are two modes of audio output from devices digital and analog There are primarily two types of USB C audio adapters active e g those with digital to analog converters DACs and passive without electronics br When an active set of USB C headphones or adapter is used digital audio is sent through the USB C port The conversion by the DAC and amplifier is done inside of the headphones or adapter instead of on the phone The sound quality is dependent on the headphones adapter s DAC Active adapters with a built in DAC have near universal support for devices that output digital and analog audio adhering to the Audio Device Class and Audio Adapter Accessory Mode specifications br Examples of such active adapters include external USB sound cards and DACs that do not require special drivers and USB C to mm headphone jack adapters by Apple Google Essential Razer HTC and Samsung br On the other hand when a passive adapter is used digital to analog conversion is done on the host device and analog audio is sent through the USB C port The sound quality is dependent on the phone s onboard DAC Passive adapters are only compatible with devices that output analog audio adhering to the Audio Adapter Accessory Mode specification br br br Compatibility with other fast charging technology br In Benson Leung an engineer at Google pointed out that Quick Charge and technologies developed by Qualcomm are not compatible with the USB C standard Qualcomm responded that it is possible to make fast charge solutions fit the voltage demands of USB C and that there are no reports of problems however it did not address the standard compliance issue at that time Later in the year Qualcomm released Quick Charge which it claimed was as an advancement over previous generations USB Type C and USB PD compliant br br br Regulations for compatibility br br In the European Commission proposed the use of USB C as a universal charger On October the European Parliament voted in favor of the new law Radio Equipment Directive with votes in favor against and abstentions The regulation requires that all new mobile phones tablets cameras headphones headsets handheld video game consoles portable speakers e readers keyboards mice portable navigation systems and earbuds sold in the European Union and supporting wired charging would have to be equipped with a USB C port and charge with a standard USB C to USB C cable by the end of Additionally if these devices support fast charging they must support USB Power Delivery These regulations will extend to laptops by early To comply with these regulations Apple Inc replaced its proprietary Lightning connector with USB C beginning with the iPhone and AirPods Pro second generation released in br br br See
