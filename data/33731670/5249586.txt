Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game console However there have also been a number of Super Mario video games released on non Nintendo gaming platforms There are more than games in the series br The Super Mario games are set primarily in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom typically with Mario as the player character He is usually joined by his brother Luigi and often by other members of the Mario cast As platform games they involve the player character running and jumping across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels The games have simple plots typically with Mario and Luigi rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist Bowser The first game in the series Super Mario Bros released for the Nintendo Entertainment System NES in established the series core gameplay concepts and elements These include a multitude of power ups and items that give the character special powers such as fireball throwing and size changing br The Super Mario series is part of the greater Mario franchise which includes other video game genres and media such as film television printed media and merchandise More than million copies of Super Mario games have been sold worldwide making it the fifth bestselling video game series behind the larger Mario franchise the puzzle series Tetris the Pok mon video games and first person shooter series Call of Duty br br br Gameplay br br The objective of the game is to progress through levels by defeating enemies collecting items and solving puzzles without dying Power up use is integral to the series The series has installments featuring both two and three dimensional gameplay In the D games the player character usually Mario jumps on platforms and enemies while avoiding their attacks and moving to the right of the scrolling screen D Super Mario game levels have single exit objectives which must be reached within a time limit and lead to the next sequential level Super Mario Bros introduced the overworld a map of nonlinear levels that branches according to the player s choice Super Mario World introduced levels with multiple exits br D installments in the series have had two subgenres open world exploration based games and more linear D games with a predetermined path Levels in the open world games Sunshine and Odyssey allow the player to freely explore multiple enclosed environments in degree movement As the game progresses more environments become accessible The linear D games Galaxy Galaxy D Land and D World feature more fixed camera angles and a predetermined path to a single goal br br br Playable characters br The series often features the option to play as characters other than Mario usually Luigi Earlier games have offered an alternating multiplayer mode in which the second player controls Luigi on their turn Luigi is often only playable by player one in a second more challenging iteration of the base game such as in The Lost Levels Galaxy New Super Luigi U and the special worlds in D Land these feature lower gravity and reduced friction for Luigi Later games allow four player simultaneous play Playable characters other than Mario and Luigi have included Toads Peach Yoshi Wario Rosalina Miis Toadette Nabbit Daisy and Bowser Jr Characters are sometimes differentiated by special abilities Super Mario Maker includes costumes that depict many more characters Super Mario Maker includes only a Link costume br br br Power ups and transformations br br Mushroom power ups appear in almost every Super Mario game The most iconic of these is the Super Mushroom The Super Mushroom increases the character s size turning them into a Super variant and allows them to break certain blocks When hit by an enemy the character reverts to their smaller size instead of losing a life When the character is in their Super form most blocks that would contain a Super Mushroom instead offer a more powerful power up such as the Fire Flower The Super Mushroom is similar in appearance to the Amanita muscaria with an ivory stalk below a most commonly red and white originally red and orange spotted cap Created by chance Shigeru Miyamoto stated in an interview that beta tests of Super Mario Bros proved Mario too tall so the development team implemented mushrooms to grow and shrink Mario Different variants of mushroom power ups appear in the series For example Super Mario Bros The Lost Levels introduces the Poison Mushroom which causes damage when collected and New Super Mario Bros introduces the Mini Mushroom which shrinks the character to miniature size and the Mega Mushroom grows the character into a towering invulnerable giant who destroys enemies and the environment by running through them br Super Mario Bros introduces suits to the Super Mario series many of which are based on animals or Mario enemies The Raccoon Suit provisioned by a Super Leaf and the Tanooki Suit each provide the character with a tail that enables flight In addition the Tanooki Suit lets the character spontaneously change into an invincible statue for about five seconds Super Mario Bros includes a Hammer Bros suit which allows Mario and Luigi to throw hammers as projectiles to defeat enemies at a distance Other suits in later games in the series include the Frog Suit Penguin Suit Cat Suit Boomerang Suit and Bee Suit br br br Projectiles br The flower power ups let the player character shoot projectiles The Fire Flower introduced in Super Mario Bros transforms the character into a Fire variant who can throw bouncing fireballs at enemies Galaxy is the first D Super Mario game to have the Fire Flower In Land and Maker the Superball is a bouncing ball obtained from a Super Flower which the character can use to defeat enemies and collect coins The Ice Flower transforms the character into an Ice variant who can shoot balls of ice as projectiles similar to those of the Fire Flower they freeze enemies in blocks of ice that can be used as platforms or thrown as projectiles as seen in New Super Mario Bros Wii and New Super Mario Bros U In Galaxy the Ice Flower turns Mario or Luigi into ice and lets him walk on lava or water for a limited time by freezing the surface Lastly New Super Mario Bros s Gold Flower lets Mario or Luigi turn bricks into coins and earn bonus coins for defeating enemies br Koopa Shells serve as a major projectile in the series featuring since the original game The character can throw them to defeat enemies collect coins and activate the functions of blocks Power ups are available for Yoshi to breathe fire in World Yoshi s Island and DS breathe freezing air and spit seeds in Yoshi s Island spit out enemies in the World games and spit juice in Sunshine Other power ups let the character throw bombs boomerangs and baseballs and shoot cannonballs In Odyssey Mario can possess characters some of which can launch various projectiles Flying shoot em up gameplay also appears in the series Mario pilots the armed Sky Pop biplane and Marine Pop submarine in Land The Koopa Clown Car aircraft of Bowser and the Koopalings can sometimes shoot fireballs in Maker br br br Ridable animals and vehicles br Apart from automated objects in levels that may transport the player character certain ridable animals and vehicles have appeared that the player controls Mario s dinosaur friend Yoshi has appeared as a mount to the player character in several Super Mario games since Super Mario World In Yoshi s Island and DS instead of the player character merely riding on Yoshi s back Yoshi is the player character Yoshis generally have abilities including eating enemies flying and breathing fire Miyamoto had originally wished for Mario to be able to ride a dinosaur in Super Mario Bros but this wasn t possible due to the technical restraints of the system Poochi is a dog featuring in Yoshi s Island who Yoshi can ride Plesiosaurs Dorrie and Plessie can be ridden by the player characters in and D World respectively with Plessie serving a larger role in Bowser s Fury br Various vehicles that the player character can control have also appeared These include a magic carpet in flying clouds in several D games submarines in Land and Yoshi s Island an airplane in Land a helicopter train and mole tank in Yoshi s Island cars in Yoshi s Island and Maker and the Koopa Clown Car aircraft in the Maker games br br br Blocks br Most items in the Super Mario series appear from item blocks when hit which originated in Super Mario Bros and have persisted throughout the series where the character hits a block to receive either coins or power ups Variations include those that are invisible until hit advice dispensers produce another block move frozen contingent on a switch bouncy etc The propeller block lets the character spin up into the air and slowly descend and the Gold Block generates coins through running A single block is the unit of measurement in the design of Super Mario levels br br br Extra lives br Player characters can gain extra lives in most of the games The Up mushroom was introduced in Super Mario Bros with the term up subsequently being used generically in other video game series to refer to extra lives In the monochromatic Super Mario Land and Super Mario Land instead of a differently colored mushroom the Up is shown as a heart Super Mario World introduced the Up Moon Ups can also be earned through collecting a certain number of coins or playing minigames br br br Invincibility br Invincibility is an effect first appearing in the three Super Mario Bros games where it is granted by a Starman an anthropomorphized flashing star The star has also been named the Super Star in the two Super Mario World games as well as the New Super Mario Bros games and the Rainbow Star in the two Super Mario Galaxy games Picking up the star makes the character temporarily invincible able to resist any harm Use of the item is accompanied by a distinctive music track that appears consistently across most of the games The player character flickers a variety of colors and in some games moves with increased speed and enhanced jumping ability while under the Star s influence While invincible the character defeats any enemy upon contact with it In Super Mario World Yoshi s Island the star gives the normally immobile baby Mario the ability to run as well as become invincible In Super Mario and DS invincibility is provided when the character becomes metal or intangible The Mega Mushroom provides temporary invincibility with the addition of giant size and environment destruction see Power ups and transformations br br br Collectibles br Super Mario level design traditionally incorporates many distributed coins as puzzles rewards and guidance through the level Coins are often found floating in the air in groups Most Super Mario games award the player an extra life once a certain amount of gold coins are collected commonly or Several coin variants exist such as silver coins dragon coins star coins and more In Sunshine Galaxy and Galaxy coins replenish health and air when the character is underwater In and Sunshine collecting coins in a level results in a Power Star or Shine Sprite respectively There are also stages in that game reward a Power Star for collecting eight red coins in a level worth two normal coins each In a blue coin is worth five normal coins In Sunshine blue coins act as a side quest when brought to the Delfino Bank and for every ten blue coins deposited Mario will earn a Shine Sprite In the Galaxy series after finishing each game once stages unlock where Mario or Luigi can collect purple coins to earn a Power Star In Galaxy they can also be used to feed some hungry Luma characters that can turn into either an item or another planet br The games often feature other tokens found in levels to progress in the overworld most frequently with the visual motif of a star They are typically situated in locations that are not readily found or reached or awarded for completing stunts or objectives given by NPCs They include the Power Stars in Super Mario and the Super Mario Galaxy games Shine Sprites in Super Mario Sunshine and Bowser s Fury Star Coins in the New Super Mario Bros series and Super Mario D Land Green Stars in the Galaxy games and Super Mario D World and Power Moons in Super Mario Odyssey In Super Mario Land there are six Golden Coin tokens that must be collected to finish the game br br br Warp Pipes and Warp Cannons br br The Warp Pipe is a common method of transportation used in many of the Mario series games Warp Pipes are most often green but also appear in other colors early games included silver pipes newer games have introduced red green blue and yellow pipes and have many uses in the series Warp Pipes can also contain enemies usually Piranha Plants and sometimes launch the player into the air most commonly seen in the New Super Mario Bros series In early Mario games such as Super Mario Bros special well hidden areas known as Warp Zones contain pipes that allow players to skip several worlds handfuls of levels at once In the New Super Mario Bros series pipe shaped Warp Cannons work similarly to the Warp Zones of the earlier games and are unlocked by finding secret exits in levels Cannons appear in most of the D games in the series starting with Super Mario The character uses the cannon by jumping into the barrel aiming themself and being fired at a distant target This allows the character to progress through a level or reach otherwise inaccessible areas br br br Minigames br Many games in the series feature minigames supplemental to the platforming gameplay usually offering the chance to win extra lives or power ups Super Mario Bros and D World feature slot machines Super Mario Bros and the New Super Mario Bros games contain Toad Houses that host skill and luck based activities such as shell games The Land games feature end of level minigames for acquiring extra lives The Battle Mode in the All Stars version of Super Mario Bros and the Advance series of remakes all feature versions of Mario Bros as a minigame Yoshi s Island enables a minigame when certain conditions are met when completing a level DS contains over minigames that can be accessed independently of the original mode of play D World contains Luigi Bros a version of Mario Bros with two Luigis and the Switch version of D World includes Bowser s Fury a D platformer of smaller size in one enclosed environment br br br Music br Much of the original Super Mario Bros music and sound effects have become iconic to the series and incorporated into modern games The original Super Mario Bros theme composed by Koji Kondo has become one of the most well known video game themes around the world br Super Mario Galaxy released in became the first game in the Super Mario series to feature orchestrated music which would return in its sequel and other subsequent games such as Super Mario D World br br br Development br br br D origins br br Super Mario Bros the first side scrolling D platform game to feature Mario was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System NES in It was derived through collaboration by Nintendo s Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as a successor to the arcade game Mario Bros which starred two characters Mario the titular character that first appeared in Donkey Kong as the original player character and its sequel where he was a final boss and Luigi who first appeared in Mario Bros Super Mario Bros established many core Mario elements such as Goombas Koopa Troopas Bowser Peach and its three power ups the Super Mushroom increasing the character s size and providing an extra hit point Fire Flower allowing the character to throw fireballs as weapons and Super Star granting temporary invincibility The Super in the title came from the integration of the Super Mushroom into the game The brothers Mario and Luigi must rescue Princess Toadstool Peach from Bowser King Koopa in the Mushroom Kingdom The game consists of eight worlds of four levels each totaling levels altogether Though the worlds differ in themes the fourth level is always a fortress or castle that ends with a fight against Bowser or one of his minions disguised as him Super Mario Bros is one of the best selling video games of all time br Super Mario Bros The Lost Levels known as Super Mario Bros in Japan is the first sequel to the original Super Mario Bros It uses the Super Mario Bros engine with additions such as weather character movements and more complex levels altogether yielding a much higher difficulty The game follows the same style of level progression as Super Mario Bros with eight initial worlds of four levels each At that time this sequel was not released outside Japan since Nintendo of America did not want the Super Mario series to be known to players outside Japan for frustrating difficulty It remained inaccessible to a steadily broadening market of American video game players becoming stylistically outdated by the time the Japanese Super Mario Bros could be eventually delivered to America The game later debuted outside Japan in as Super Mario Bros The Lost Levels in the compilation game Super Mario All Stars for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES br In Super Mario Bros known as Super Mario USA in Japan Mario and his companions seek to defeat the evil frog Wart in the Subcon dreamland Based on a discarded prototype the game was instead originally released as Yume K j Doki Doki Panic in Japan and was ultimately converted into a Mario game for the rest of the world as Super Mario Bros before being released in Japan as Super Mario USA as part of Super Mario All Stars One of the game s most defining aspects is the four player characters not only Mario but Luigi Princess Peach and Toad are available for single player gameplay each with defined character movements Luigi jumps higher the Princess can hover in the air for a short amount of time and Toad is the fastest Characters here also can pluck items from the ground to throw at enemies This is also the first Super Mario game to use a life meter which allows the characters to be hit up to four times before dying br Super Mario Bros is divided into eight themed worlds each with levels and several bonus stages displayed as locations on a mapped overworld These locations are not necessarily in a linear order and the player is occasionally permitted to skip levels or play the game out of order Completed levels cannot be replayed The penultimate boss stage in each world is a side scrolling level atop an airship Doom Ship with a fight against one of Bowser s seven Koopalings The game introduced a diverse array of new power ups including flight as Raccoon Mario and Raccoon Luigi or the level long P Wing allowing flight through a whole level Bowser is again the final boss br Super Mario Land is the first handheld Super Mario game apart from the Game Watch conversion of Super Mario Bros and was released for the Game Boy in Like the Super Mario Bros games it is a sidescrolling platformer Mario sets out to save Princess Daisy from the spaceman Tatanga Items include the Super Mushroom Super Flower which allows Mario to shoot projectiles Super Star and hearts which give Mario an extra life The game consists of twelve levels split across four worlds Reaching the higher of two exits at each level s end activates a minigame where the player can try to get extra lives br br Super Mario World was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and consists of nine worlds displayed via a world map It is a direct successor to the Super Mario Bros games bearing the subtitle Super Mario Bros in Japan Unlike Super Mario Bros however where each world map is separate the world map here covers the whole game Some of the levels have hidden alternate exits leading to different areas New abilities include a spin jump and the rideable Yoshi who can eat enemies and either swallow or spit them out Power ups include the new Cape Feather which lets Mario and Luigi fly with a cape and the P balloon which inflates the player character to allow him to float br Super Mario Land Golden Coins was released for the Game Boy in It introduces Mario s rival Wario who took over Mario s castle during the events of Super Mario Land and forces Mario to collect the six golden coins to reenter and reclaim his castle While its predecessor is similar to the original Super Mario Bros Super Mario Land has more in common with Super Mario World featuring a world map and the ability to move back to the left within levels There are levels divided into several themed worlds that each have their own boss Three power ups return the Super Mushroom Fire Flower and Super Star The game also introduces the Carrot power up which gives Mario large rabbit ears that let him glide when falling for a limited time Its story was continued in Wario Land Super Mario Land which retroactively became the first of a spin off series Wario Land br br Super Mario World Yoshi s Island was released for the SNES in To reunite baby Mario with his brother Luigi who has been kidnapped by Kamek the player controls Yoshi as the primary character through levels while carrying Baby Mario Yoshi runs and jumps to reach the end of the level while solving puzzles and collecting items In a style new to the series the game has a hand drawn aesthetic The game introduces his signature abilities to flutter jump and produce eggs from swallowed enemies Yoshi s Island received instant and universal acclaim according to IGN and review aggregator Metacritic and sold over four million copies Yoshi s signature characteristics established in Yoshi s Island would carry throughout a series of cameos spin offs and sequels Sources have debated on whether Super Mario World Yoshi s Island where the player primarily controls a Yoshi carrying Baby Mario should count as a Super Mario game with some sources considering it strictly a Yoshi game Miyamoto responded affirmatively when asked if Yoshi s Island is a Super Mario game with Tezuka later adding When that game debuted I wanted people to understand that Yoshi was part of the Mario world and that be conveyed whether through title or gameplay To me it s part of the Mario series but today s Yoshi games They ve changed from those origins so I think it s okay to think of Yoshi living in his own universe You can think of it separately from Mario s world br br br Introduction of D and open ended exploration br br In the early s director and producer Shigeru Miyamoto had conceived a D Mario design during development of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES game Star Fox He considered using the Super FX chip to develop a SNES game Super Mario FX with gameplay based on an entire world in miniature like miniature trains He eventually reformulated the idea for the Nintendo not for its substantially greater power but because its controller has more buttons for gameplay Super Mario was developed over approximately three years with one year spent on the design concept and approximately two years on production Production began on September and concluded on May Super Mario is the first D and open world game in the series and a launch game for the Nintendo home console Each level is an enclosed environment where the player is free to explore in all directions without time limits The player collects Power Stars from the paintings in Peach s castle to unlock later courses and areas The Nintendo s analog stick makes an extensive repertoire of precise movements in all directions possible The game introduced moves such as punching triple jumping and using a Wing Cap to fly It is the first Super Mario series game to feature Charles Martinet s voice acting for Mario Mario must once again save Princess Peach from Bowser The game s power ups differ from previous games now being three different hats with temporary powers the Wing Cap allowing Mario to fly the Metal Cap turning him into metal and the Vanish Cap allowing him to walk

explained that when he was developing Super Mario with Yoshiaki Koizumi they realized that the title would be more directed towards the core gamer rather than the casual pick up and go gamer After Sunshine their focus shifted to more accessible casual games leading them to develop Super Mario Galaxy with more progression oriented paths Galaxy was launched in for the Wii It is set in outer space where Mario or Luigi travel between galaxies to collect Power Stars earned by completing quests or defeating enemies It introduced motion controls to the series Each galaxy contains a number of planets and other space objects for the player to explore The game s physics system gives each celestial object its own gravitational force which lets the character circumnavigate rounded or irregular planetoids by walking sideways or upside down The character is usually able to jump from one independent object and fall towards another close object Though the main gameplay and physics are in D there are several points in the game where the character s movements are restricted into a D axis Several new power ups appear following the new game mechanics br New Super Mario Bros Wii features player co op and new power ups the Propeller Mushroom the Ice Flower and the Penguin Suit All characters can ride Yoshi br Super Mario Galaxy released on May was initially developed as an expansion
