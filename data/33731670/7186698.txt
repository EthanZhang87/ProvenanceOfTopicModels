The Gamate known as pinyin ch oj xi ozi literally Super Boy in Taiwan and pinyin ch oj sh nt ng literally Super Child Prodigy in China is a handheld game console manufactured by Bit Corporation in the early s and released in Australia some parts of Europe Asia Taiwan and China Argentina and the United States br The only emulator that supports it is MAME with games also playable on a MiSTer Over games not all dumped are known to have been produced for the system br br br History br The Gamate was first of the many handheld consoles released following Nintendo s Game Boy br br It was originally released by the Taiwanese game company Bit Corporation in conjunction with local distributors around the world such as Alston Research in the USA the joystick maker Cheetah Marketing in the UK toy company GIG in Italy video game importer Uranium in Switzerland Greek Software in Greece ITMC subsidiary Yeno in Germany Famiclone manufacturer Electrolab in Argentina and PlayMix in Sweden br Bit Corp ceased operating in but UMC and its subsidiary Funtech continued to produce Gamate hardware and software br br br Hardware br Unlike other Taiwanese or Hong Kong Game Boy competitors such as the Watara Supervision Hartung Game Master and the Mega Duck the Gamate s internal hardware contains no epoxy covered chips and was assembled in a quality manner The build quality is relatively akin to that of the Game Boy The shell is made of thick plastic and with batteries installed the unit feels very similar to the weight of a Game Boy br br br Screen br The screen on the Gamate is very similar to the Game Boy It is a greenish color with manual contrast adjustment and non backlit Backlit screens were not common in Moving objects appear blurry and faint the quality known as ghosting which can make game play very frustrating br The Gamate seems however to have had two different types of LCD screen used throughout its lifespan The easiest way to tell which type one has is by turning the Gamate on without a game in the bad one displays vertical lines while the good one displays a slightly corrupted checkerboard pattern br br br Sound br The Gamate internally uses an AY sound chip that can generate channels of square waves and one for noise The Gamate s mono internal speaker is of poor quality giving off sound that is quite distorted particularly at low volumes However if a user plugs into the headphone jack some of the sound channels are mapped to the headphone s left right channels that forms stereo audio and the output is of a relatively high quality br br br Shell br The G Gamate is dark grey in color and has a x D pad and small speaker vents The G Gamate are dark grey in color and have a D pad design and large speaker vents A variant in the latter design with a white shell and red buttons also exists br br br Serial numbers br All Gamates have a seven digit serial number near the card port on the rear of the console The first two digits represent the year of manufacture while the last five represent the unit s chronology Therefore a unit with the number was the th produced in The newest unit thus far discovered was produced in br br

illustrations are the game title and unlike most systems a simple numerical designation C C etc making organization reasonably simple for collectors The exact number of games released remains unknown Some articles regarding the Gamate state it has about games or so but the true number may be closer to One contributing factor to this ambiguity is that as Bit Corp had passed into bankruptcy games continued to be published by UMC but very few left the Asian market br Many titles are clones of popular games from the era Tetris Bomberman Lode Runner Battle City etc Bit Corp and later UMC is given sole credit within each game but inconsistencies in game content and labeling make it far more likely that several developers were involved in designing individual games two external developers are currently known Gamtec and Hengmao Electronics Some titles suffer from assorted bugs A few titles seem to be original concepts and a great many more remain mysterious due to their scarcity br While in general the higher numbered games were released later and in smaller quantities there seems to be little correlation with this principle prior to the C s with random numbers inexplicably difficult to
