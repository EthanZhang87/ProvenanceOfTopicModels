not involve the original series developer Rare The game was a critical and commercial success it has sold over million copies worldwide making it one of the best selling titles on the Wii and received

February and ported for the Nintendo Switch in May A high definition version developed by Forever Entertainment titled Donkey Kong Country Returns HD will be released for the Nintendo Switch in January br br br Gameplay br br Players take control of the series s protagonist Donkey Kong as well as his friend Diddy Kong in certain situations with many traditional elements of the Donkey Kong Country series returning including mine cart levels the ability to swing between vines and collect bananas the golden KONG letters and puzzle pieces New gameplay elements include levels in which the characters and foreground environments appear as silhouettes spawning several new gameplay mechanics In single player mode players can only play as Donkey Kong although Diddy Kong rides on Donkey Kong s back and Donkey Kong can use Diddy s jetpack to jump further Multiplayer mode enables a second player to control Diddy Kong If a player s character dies in two player mode it can be brought back by using the other character to hit a DK Barrel that floats into view a mechanic similar to the one used in New Super Mario Bros Wii To avoid problems arising from differences in the players skills Diddy can hop on Donkey s back to take on a more passive role while his jetpack can be used to make his partner s jumps easier Both Donkey and Diddy can pound the ground to defeat enemies and unveil secret items br The game has two control schemes with the standard system using the Wii Remote in conjunction with the Nunchuk while a more classical approach requires that the Wii Remote be held sideways Both methods use motion controls for the Ground Pound move In addition to common series elements like secrets and unlockables there is also an optional time attack mode Two animal buddies Rambi and Squawks appear and assist Donkey Kong at certain points in the game The game also utilises the Super Guide feature that previously appeared in New Super Mario Bros Wii and Super Mario Galaxy If the player loses eight lives in a single level they will be given the option to allow a white colored Donkey Kong named Super Kong to take over and complete the level for them However Super Kong will not look for collectible items nor will he show the player where they are He also keeps anything he happens to collect so the player is not rewarded for these items br After beating Tiki Tong an additional stage called The Golden Temple is unlocked In order to play the stage the player has to find objects called Rare orbs hidden in each world s temple Upon completing the Golden Temple a new mode is unlocked known as the Mirror Mode In this mode the stages are flipped Donkey Kong only has one unit of health he cannot use items bought from Cranky Kong and he cannot get any help from Diddy Kong br br br Plot br The game s story revolves around creatures known as Tikis which are new to the series The different types of Tikis fill the role of the antagonists in the story replacing the Kremlings from Donkey Kong Country Cranky Kong who owns shops throughout the island is the only Kong family member that appears other than Donkey and Diddy The story begins when a group of evil Tikis known as the Tiki Tak Tribe arrive on Donkey Kong Island after being awoken by a volcanic eruption and play music to hypnotize the animals mostly elephants zebras giraffes and squirrels on the island into stealing Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong s bananas Since Donkey Kong is resistant to the Tikis music he works with Diddy Kong to retrieve their hoard of bananas from the Tikis Throughout the game the pair travel through nine worlds to recover their stolen bananas the Golden Temple the Volcano the Factory the Cliff the Forest the Cave the Ruins the Beach and the Jungle In each world they must defeat a Tiki Tak Tribe leader Kalimba the Maraca Gang Gong Oh Banjo Bottom Wacky Pipes Xylobone Cordian who hypnotizes other inhabitants on the island to fight the Kongs and Tiki Tong the king of the Tiki Tak Tribe After Tiki Tong is defeated the Kongs are launched into space where they punch and headbutt down on the Moon crushing Tiki Tong s base and sending bananas flying everywhere br br br Development br br br Conception br br The idea for Donkey Kong Country Returns originated at Retro Studios following the completion of Metroid Prime Echoes in when Retro president and CEO Michael Kelbaugh told Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe that Retro was interested in developing a Donkey Kong game Kelbaugh had worked as a tester on the Donkey Kong Country series for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES which had been on a hiatus following Donkey Kong Country Dixie Kong s Double Trouble Its developer the British studio Rare was acquired by Nintendo s competitor Microsoft in Retro was directed to develop Metroid Prime Corruption instead Tanabe noting that Nintendo depended on Retro to make games that could not be developed in Japan br After the completion of Corruption Retro began experimenting for potential projects but in April three core staff design director Mark Pacini art director Todd Keller and principal technology engineer Jack Matthews left and those experiments had to be discarded Tanabe was unsure what Retro s next project would be until Donkey Kong creator Shigeru Miyamoto totally by chance expressed interest in a Donkey Kong Country revival Miyamoto said that Nintendo had been receiving requests from the North American audience for a new Donkey Kong Country and Tanabe suggested that Retro would be a suitable developer for such a project br Retro staff flew to Nintendo s headquarters in Kyoto to meet with Miyamoto and Nintendo president Satoru Iwata where they determined Returns direction Miyamoto told Retro Donkey Kong is my baby and you better get it right Iwata was confident in Retro s ability to develop the game given that many staff were avid fans of the original Donkey Kong Country He felt they dispelled any concerns that it was possible for a studio besides Rare to continue Donkey Kong Country Iwata referred to the set of circumstances that led to Retro taking on Returns as goen fate so Retro chose F as the project s codename Retro was excited to work on a series different from Metroid senior designer Mike Wikan noted that Donkey Kong s light tone was a contrast from Metroid s somber one Iwata said their passion for Donkey Kong Country generated an energy that was poured into Returns br br br Design br br Returns was designed for Donkey Kong Country fans and the team spent the first week of development playing the SNES games to gather inspiration Retro sought to carry memorable elements such as side scrolling gameplay barrel cannons and minecart sequences while refining them to create a new experience and continue the series broad appeal and accessibility The team felt a lot of responsibility because they did not want to disappoint fans The assistant producer Risa Tabata had never played Donkey Kong Country so she saw herself as the one who conceived new ideas br Similar to the role he played during the development of Donkey Kong Country and Donkey Kong Jungle Beat Miyamoto supervised Retro and reviewed Returns content throughout development He wanted Retro to keep Donkey Kong Country s unique visuals and feel in mind and emphasized elements he felt should be retained from prior games He also mandated which characters could return The staff worked with Miyamoto for hours to perfect Donkey Kong s movement and referred to him as Yoda for his input Miyamoto suggested the blowing mechanic after playing a prototype and noticing that one of Diddy Kong s animations resembled blowing The team was initially baffled by the suggestion but found it added interactivity and whimsy br Miyamoto wanted players to move similarly to Donkey Kong when he slaps the terrain so Retro designed Returns around the Wii Remote and Nunchuk Retro introduced the option to play without the Nunchuk following the release of New Super Mario Bros Wii which allowed players to hold the Wii Remote horizontally like a Nintendo Entertainment System controller Unlike Rare s games which allowed players to swap between the two Kongs at will Retro designed Donkey and Diddy as a combined character They introduced surface clinging to expand gameplay to walls and ceilings and chose not to include underwater levels because they did not fit the pace Team members competed and asked each other for input with Ivey noting coworkers sought to surprise each other Retro felt they were able to incorporate more ideas than they were in the Metroid Prime series br Kelbaugh decided that Returns needed to be difficult to appease Donkey Kong Country fans but still be fair enough for inexperienced players Pearson and Wikan wanted it to challenge players in a way that would encourage them to learn from their mistakes and keep trying They introduced Diddy s jetpack and pop gun to ease the difficulty for inexperienced players and distinguish him from previous games Retro was aware that the difficulty would be tough for some players to manage so the team integrated the Super Guide system from New Super Mario Bros Wii Since the Metroid Prime and Donkey Kong Country series were popular among speedrunners and hardcore gamers Retro added the time trial mode late in development br When development began Tanabe and Tabata discussed how they could distinguish Returns from the previous Donkey Kong game Jungle Beat Tanabe felt that simultaneous multiplayer was one way Returns should differ since previous Donkey Kong games only let players take turns Miyamoto advised Tanabe to only focus on single player gameplay before considering multiplayer but Tanabe still told Retro to incorporate multiplayer early in development To distinguish Returns multiplayer from New Super Mario Bros Wii s and allow skilled gamers to play swiftly Retro removed the collision detection between Donkey and Diddy Retro refrained from lowering the difficulty for multiplayer though the team did discuss making it easier to obtain lives and allowed Diddy to ride Donkey s back if one player was having trouble br br br Art and programming br Retro wanted Returns to look fun and whimsical and discarded many initial designs for being too similar to Metroid s darker aesthetic Impactful visuals were a primary focus since the original Donkey Kong Country was famous for its graphics though Kelbaugh and director Bryan Walker said developing the silhouette levels taught us not to rely so much on graphics Retro retained the previous Donkey Kong Country games art style but developed environments using polygons rather than the pre rendering technique that Rare used to create the SNES trilogy Tanabe noted that unlike the SNES games which featured static backgrounds due to technical limitations Retro could incorporate real time animation into Returns and allow characters and backgrounds to interact Retro drew inspiration from Virtual Boy Wario Land which allows the player to jump between the background and the foreground br Unlike most Western game developers Retro spent a considerable amount of time developing prototypes For Metroid Prime Retro based the development on its design documents but learned from Tanabe that it was more efficient to develop prototypes first and create design documents after the gameplay had been polished Returns was developed using the Metroid Prime game engine but required far more detail in polygons and textures The team noted that while audiences often perceive side scrolling games as simple and archaic they are actually quite difficult to develop due to the amount of care that goes into each level They tried to adapt the Prime games Morph Ball virtual camera system to create the side scrolling effect However the player character s movements were too fast and complicated for it so a new camera system had to be developed br Retro updated approximately two thirds of its technology for Returns including its renderers animation tools and collision detection systems Kelbaugh and Walker estimated that every level required around three times the amount of detail that Metroid Prime Corruption s did It took around six months to shift from the Prime development environment and Kelbaugh and Walker said that the artists had to be retrained to design a Donkey Kong game The player character has over animations in single player and in multiplayer far greater than Samus Aran s in the Metroid Prime games and Retro drew inspiration from Jungle Beat to develop Donkey Kong s movements To incorporate Super Guide the programmers rewrote the engine to remove possible randomness arising from button inputs Retro used Super Guide to playtest and find bugs br br br Music br Kenji Yamamoto who worked with Retro on the Metroid Prime series composed most of Donkey Kong Country Returns soundtrack alongside Minako Hamano Masaru Tajima Shinji Ushiroda and Daisuke Matsuoka The soundtrack mostly comprises rearrangements of tracks from the original Donkey Kong Country composed by David Wise and Eveline Novakovic This was at the request of Miyamoto and Iwata who did not want Retro to change the music Iwata considered the soundtrack a large part of Donkey Kong Country s appeal and told Tanabe to handle it with care during the first Returns meeting Alongside rearrangements Yamamoto composed new material to fit Returns atmosphere Due to the constant tweaking of the levels he sometimes had to recompose his tracks br Retro wanted Yamamoto to blend the classic Donkey Kong Country tracks with modern sound He did not use a full orchestra but focused on what Tanabe felt made Donkey Kong Country s music iconic such as piano arrangements and the bassline Because Rare was uninvolved Wise Donkey Kong Country s original composer was unable to contribute Wise left Rare in because he disagreed with the company s direction under Microsoft and got in contact with Kelbaugh In Wise said that it was too late for him to contribute to Returns by the time he connected with Kelbaugh but they stayed in contact in case Retro decided to develop a sequel Wise felt Yamamoto did a wonderful job rearranging his past work though he said he would have relied more on new compositions than past material br br br Completion br The development did not begin smoothly Tanabe described early development as floundering around and said that the team often disagreed as to what would be fun Retro struggled to make a game that reflected Nintendo s values and designing the bosses The amount of effort it took to create the level playable for a game demo at E made the team concerned that Returns would not be ready for its deadline and the team still had to complete around levels after E br E proved to be a turning point for the development Iwata observed that the game rapidly bloomed once Retro entered the final stretch with more ideas and elements introduced Pearson attributed the turnaround to correspondence between Nintendo and Retro We had come to share a certain philosophy with regards to how to make the game s levels and had achieved a common understanding of what makes a level fun We learned the tempo necessary for a fun level and the kinds of elements to put in Towards the end of development Tanabe had to take a week off due to lower back pain and Tabata filled in for him The team worked overnight during the final stages br br br Release br br br Context br Following Microsoft s acquisition of Rare the Donkey Kong franchise s prominence faded With no studio to develop major Donkey Kong platform games Donkey Kong became relegated to spin offs such as the Donkey Konga and Mario vs Donkey Kong series and guest appearances in other Nintendo franchises Donkey Kong Jungle Beat the only major DK game since Rare s Donkey Kong was a commercial disappointment despite positive reviews Hardcore Gaming wrote that Jungle Beat was seen as merely an aside to the Donkey Kong platforming saga Seething underneath the surface of every gamer who cut their teeth on bit platformers was a longing for a return to form for the wayward gorilla and his adventures Donkey Kong Country was a brand that had a growing sense of latent desire associated with it br Donkey Kong Country Returns was kept a secret for much of its development In August IGN reported that Retro was known to be working on a new Wii game but was going great lengths to conceal its identity including restricting access to parts of its headquarters When IGN interviewer Matt Casamassina visited Retro to discuss Metroid Prime Trilogy he was required to sign a non disclosure agreement stipulating that if he managed to learn what the new project was he would be unable to discuss it Reports that the project was Donkey Kong related surfaced shortly before Nintendo s E conference in June br br br Marketing br br Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aim announced Donkey Kong Country Returns during his keynote address at E in June when he introduced a trailer showcasing various levels and set pieces Video game journalists considered Nintendo s showing its strongest in years and singled out Returns as one of the most significant announcements They characterized the announcement as a surprise a new Country game had been considered unlikely following Microsoft s acquisition of Rare GameSpot said that the trailer sparked cheers from the crowd with Hardcore Gaming writing that Nintendo s use of the Country branding promised fans a return to form for the franchise br Alongside Kirby s Epic Yarn Metroid Other M and Wii Party Nintendo positioned Returns to rejuvenate Wii sales in response to rising PlayStation sales It promoted the game with a series of trailers which journalists said showcased a hardcore difficulty One advertisement featured British comedians Ant Dec searching for bananas in the jungle

Participants could win one of prizes including a Wii a copy of Returns and a trip to the Chichen Itza ruins in Canc n Customers who preordered Returns through GameStop received a banana shaped Wii Remote pouch br On December Nintendo Australia piled a five meter feet stash of around bananas weighing two tons at the Circular Quay in Sydney Visitors could play Returns on an inflatable movie screen and take bananas from the stash leftover bananas were donated to the food rescue charity OzHarvest In the UK Nintendo partnered with the video game retailer GAME for a promotion in which
