The GP X is a Linux based handheld video game console and portable media player developed by South Korean company GamePark Holdings It was released on November in South Korea only br The GP X is designed for homebrew developers as well as commercial developers It is commonly used to run emulators for game consoles such as Neo Geo Mega Drive Genesis Master System Game Gear Amstrad CPC Commodore NES TurboGrafx and MAME br br br Overview br The GP X was designed to play music and videos view photos and play games It had an open architecture Linux based allowing anybody to develop and run software Also there was the possibility for additional features such as support for new media formats to be added in the future due to the upgradeable firmware br A popular use of the GP X was to run emulators which allows one to use software from a video game of another system on the GP X br br br History br br Shortly after the release of the GP in its maker Game Park began to design their next handheld A disagreement within the company about the general direction of this system prompted many of the staff to leave and create their own company GamePark Holdings to produce a D based handheld system which they saw as the sequel to the GP br GamePark Holdings spoke to previous GP distributors and developers to determine the specifications for the new machine and how it should be promoted Meetings were held in Seoul Korea where the final design of the new console was agreed upon br The first name of this console was the GPX However it couldn t be used as a final name due to a possible trademark violation with the name of a Japanese printer the GPX A contest for a new name was announced on August Around names were submitted in total The winner of the competition was Matt Bakse who chose the title GP X For this he was awarded a free GP X console although delivery of his prize was rather delayed br The GP X has seen several minor hardware updates most notably the changes from the First Edition to Normal Edition and the Normal Edition to the MK Also a new version called the F was released earlier then expected on October and features a touchscreen among other changes br By August the GP X was available to buy through an online distributor in the United States of America br As of October the GP X had sold units On August the CEO of Gamepark Holdings told German GP X distributor Michael Mrozek aka EvilDragon that GP X units had been sold The Korea Times reported in that over GP X units had been sold br On August GamePark Holdings announced the successor to the GP X the Wiz br As of September a version of the GP X is still being sold in Korea by Vocamaster that is geared toward Koreans who wish to learn English In fact according to the official GP X distributor for the UK Craig Rothwell most GP X units sold to date have been sold through Vocamaster as English learning tools br br br Hardware br br br Specifications br Source br br

mm excl joystick approx mm deep br Weight g without battery br The ARM T was used by GPH s implementation of Linux to control video processing Using the T core in Linux for other tasks apart from video processing is difficult but possible Accessing the hardware directly makes it easier to use both CPUs br The F version of the GP X hardware replaced the joystick with a directional pad and added a touchscreen br br br Expandability br The GP X had an expansion EXT port on the base of the unit into which a range of special cables for USB host TV out etc or break out box could be plugged allowing four USB devices to be connected to and used with the GP X directly The only thing limiting what can be used through this interface is the availability of drivers br The connector used to expand the GP X is hard to come by on its own but it is used with a few other devices The Samsung e e and LG U mobile telephone data cables along with the official GP X TV Out adapter are suitable connectors br This connector isn t proprietary the specifications of this connector are fully open encouraging home cable construction br br br TV output br The GP X also supported TV out with a special cable that plugs into the EXT port This allows videos that are normally scaled down to fit the GP X s screen to be played at native resolution on a TV It also lets software be displayed on the higher resolution TV rather than the screen Not all software supports this natively but rd party software exists that enables TV out functionality in all applications This is done by launching a background process br br br Power br The GP X requires AA sized batteries if not running from an external power supply Due to the high current drain standard alkaline batteries will not function for very long in the GP X NiMH or lithium batteries are recommended br Battery life varies depending on the type of activity being performed and can last anywhere from minutes using alkaline batteries to over hours using high capacity NiMH batteries When listening to music power can be conserved by turning off the backlight and display br The GP X has a socket for an external power supply It must be rated V DC at A with a standard center grounded negative center connector The power supply should be regulated as voltage spikes can permanently damage the unit br br br Storage br The GP X s primary storage device is the Secure Digital card which can be placed into a socket at the top of the unit Older firmware only supported SD cards up to GB in capacity SD cards must be formatted as either FAT FAT is more reliable or ext The GP X also has MB of internal flash memory storage of which MB can be used for user data br From firmware release version the GP X F is capable of addressing the new SDHC standard and thus now works with SDHC cards up to GB in size br br br Overclocking br The two ARM processors in the GP X can be overclocked beyond their rated speed in software The maximum speed one can reach through overclocking varies from system to system with about in reaching over MHz and others barely reaching MHz many systems can be overclocked beyond MHz with no problems The highest they are advertised to overclock to is MHz br br br Multimedia support br br br Video br Video formats DivX Xvid MPEG br Audio formats MP and Vorbis br Container files AVI and OGM WMA and MPG via

tools required for development on the GP X are freely available there is a wealth of software available for the GP X much of which is free Types of software available includes emulators games PDA applications and multimedia players br br br Built in software br The GP X has several pieces of software built directly into the firmware There is a version of MPlayer which is used to play music and video an image viewer an e book reader which can display the contents of standard text documents on screen and a utility to adjust the LCD update frequency to eliminate any flickering br Other applications available though not accessible directly through the menu were a Samba server for transferring files to the machine using the default Windows network file sharing protocol an HTTP server for providing web pages an FTP server a different way of transferring files and telnet access allowing for direct command line access from outside the machine br These servers operate over the included USB networking functionality allowing one to connect the GP X to a wider network through a PC The new GP X F supports none of these network programs br Version of the firmware comes with games pre installed in the NAND memory The games are Payback demo Noiz sa Flobopuyo SuperTux and Vektar freeware version This firmware is currently shipped with new GP Xs br br br Emulators br There are many emulators available for the GP X which allow you to run software from other systems on the GP X Many emulators will run most software perfectly and at the intended speed but some others may have various issues often to do with speed or sound Popular emulators include GnGeo which emulates the Neo Geo GNUboy x Game Boy and Game Boy Color emulators MAME an emulator of various arcade machines DrMD which emulates the Master System Game Gear and Mega Drive Genesis SquidgeSNES and PocketSNES which emulate Super NES games and Picodrive which emulates Mega Drive and Sega CD games psx all which emulates PlayStation games Stella an emulator for the Atari has also been ported to the GP X br br br Games br br Since the GP X has a much smaller following than other handheld consoles such as the Sony PSP or the Nintendo DS there are very few commercial games available for it Vektar Payback Quartz retrovirus RTS Wind and Water Puzzle Battles and Blazar have been released as commercial games for the GP X and the games Odonata and Elsewhere were released in October for Korean distribution only br However there are many ports of games from other platforms mostly Linux to the GP X Popular ports include SuperTux and Frozen Bubble as well as the Duke Nukem D Quake and Doom engines which can run the original games if the user owns a copy with the correct data files There are also hundreds of original freeware games such as Tilematch and Beat X made by GP X programmers in their spare time br br br Multimedia players br There are several unofficial multimedia players available for the GP X intended to support more formats than the built in music and video players can handle One such program is a port of FFPlay that allows you to play several RealMedia and Windows Media formats Since the release of the MPlayer source code several unofficial builds have been released for various purposes One of these adds support for playing music in the AAC format br br br Music Creation Tools br The GP X natively runs the free homebrew application Little Game Park Tracker a music tracker program which was created by chip musician M n specifically for the GP X Little Game Park Tracker also known as LGPT or Little Piggy Tracker allows for sample based music production with a myriad of sample tweaking abilities LGPT borrows the interface of the popular Game Boy music tracker Little Sound DJ It has since been ported to the PSP Dingoo Windows OS X and other platforms br br br PDA Applications br Two popular PDA desktop environments have been ported to the GP X Qtopia and GPE Both contain a range of programs such as a web browser word processor etc and can be controlled with either the GP X controls or a USB mouse and keyboard connected through a USB cable attached to the EXT port br br br Open source development br SDKs software development kits are freely and easily available for the GP X allowing anybody with the required skills to write an application or game Most SDKs are based around a gcc cross compiler toolchain and SDL SDL is available for many systems allowing for cross compatibility of code with other platforms such as Microsoft Windows and GNU Linux br A port of the Allegro game programming library is also available for the GP X as are ports of the Fenix and BennuGD game toolkits br Other libraries under development include Minimal Library SDK which allows for direct hardware access inside the GP X Linux environment and sdk x a set of libraries and a program which allows you to leave Linux completely for total control of all the hardware with no operating system to interfere br Currently in development is gpu a soft D renderer that can do many rendering types including true perspective texture mapping lighting It utilizes the ARM T CPU of the GP X and allows for the GP X to run basic OpenGL functions In January the renderer s OpenGL functions allowed for the D roleplaying game Egoboo to be ported to the GP X at a playable speed and a month later updated with increased speed and added lighting effects br br br GP X executables br GP X executable files have one of two letters file extensions For games the gpe extension is used These are listed in the Games section of the menu Utilities have the extension gpu and appear in the Utilities section of the menu in firmware they appear along with the games br br br DRM controversy br There was debate before launch over the implied inclusion of DRM in the GP X However since release the GP X platform was shown to be clear of any form of DRM br br br See also
