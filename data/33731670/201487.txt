id: 201487
A rechargeable battery storage battery or secondary cell formally a type of energy accumulator is a type of electrical battery which can be charged discharged into a load and recharged many times as opposed to a disposable or primary battery which is supplied fully charged and discarded after use It is composed of one or more electrochemical cells The term accumulator is used as it accumulates and stores energy through a reversible electrochemical reaction Rechargeable batteries are produced in many different shapes and sizes ranging from button cells to megawatt systems connected to stabilize an electrical distribution network Several different combinations of electrode materials and electrolytes are used including lead acid zinc air nickel cadmium NiCd nickel metal hydride NiMH lithium ion Li ion lithium iron phosphate LiFePO and lithium ion polymer Li ion polymer br Rechargeable batteries typically initially cost more than disposable batteries but have a much lower total cost of ownership and environmental impact as they can be recharged inexpensively many times before they need replacing Some rechargeable battery types are available in the same sizes and voltages as disposable types and can be used interchangeably with them Billions of dollars in research are being invested around the world for improving batteries as industry focuses on building better batteries br br br Applications br br Devices which use rechargeable batteries include automobile starters portable consumer devices light vehicles such as motorized wheelchairs golf carts electric bicycles and electric forklifts road vehicles cars vans trucks motorbikes trains small airplanes tools uninterruptible power supplies and battery storage power stations Emerging applications in hybrid internal combustion battery and electric vehicles drive the technology to reduce cost weight and size and increase lifetime br Older rechargeable batteries self discharge relatively rapidly and require charging before first use some newer low self discharge NiMH batteries hold their charge for many months and are typically sold factory charged to about of their rated capacity br Battery storage power stations use rechargeable batteries for load leveling storing electric energy at times of low demand for use during peak periods and for renewable energy uses such as storing power generated from photovoltaic arrays during the day to be used at night Load leveling reduces the maximum power which a plant must be able to generate reducing capital cost and the need for peaking power plants br According to a report from Research and Markets the analysts forecast the global rechargeable battery market to grow at a CAGR of during the period br Small rechargeable batteries can power portable electronic devices power tools appliances and so on Heavy duty batteries power electric vehicles ranging from scooters to locomotives and ships They are used in distributed electricity generation and in stand alone power systems br br br Charging and discharging br br During charging the positive active material is oxidized releasing electrons and the negative material is reduced absorbing electrons These electrons constitute the current flow in the external circuit The electrolyte may serve as a simple buffer for internal ion flow between the electrodes as in lithium ion and nickel cadmium cells or it may be an active participant in the electrochemical reaction as in lead acid cells br The energy used to charge rechargeable batteries usually comes from a battery charger using AC mains electricity although some are equipped to use a vehicle s volt DC power outlet The voltage of the source must be higher than that of the battery to force current to flow into it but not too much higher or the battery may be damaged br Chargers take from a few minutes to several hours to charge a battery Slow dumb chargers without voltage or temperature sensing capabilities will charge at a low rate typically taking hours or more to reach a full charge Rapid chargers can typically charge cells in two to five hours depending on the model with the fastest taking as little as fifteen minutes Fast chargers must have multiple ways of detecting when a cell reaches full charge change in terminal voltage temperature etc to stop charging before harmful overcharging or overheating occurs The fastest chargers often incorporate cooling fans to keep the cells from overheating Battery packs intended for rapid charging may include a temperature sensor that the charger uses to protect the pack the sensor will have one or more additional electrical contacts br Different battery chemistries require different charging schemes For example some battery types can be safely recharged from a constant voltage source Other types need to be charged with a regulated current source that tapers as the battery reaches fully charged voltage Charging a battery incorrectly can damage a battery in extreme cases batteries can overheat catch fire or explosively vent their contents br br br Rate of discharge br br Battery charging and discharging rates are often discussed by referencing a C rate of current The C rate is that which would theoretically fully charge or discharge the battery in one hour For example trickle charging might be performed at C or a hour rate while typical charging and discharging may occur at C two hours for full capacity The available capacity of electrochemical cells varies depending on the discharge rate Some energy is lost in the internal resistance of cell components plates electrolyte interconnections and the rate of discharge is limited by the speed at which chemicals in the cell can move about For lead acid cells the relationship between time and discharge rate is described by Peukert s law a lead acid cell that can no longer sustain a usable terminal voltage at a high current may still have usable capacity if discharged at a much lower rate Data sheets for rechargeable cells often list the discharge capacity on hour or hour or other stated time cells for uninterruptible power supply systems may be rated at minute discharge br The terminal voltage of the battery is not constant during charging and discharging Some types have relatively constant voltage during discharge over much of their capacity Non rechargeable alkaline and zinc carbon cells output V when new but this voltage drops with use Most NiMH AA and AAA cells are rated at V but have a flatter discharge curve than alkalines and can usually be used in equipment designed to use alkaline batteries br Battery manufacturers technical notes often refer to voltage per cell VPC for the individual cells that make up the battery For example to charge a V lead acid battery containing cells of V each at VPC requires a voltage of V across the battery s terminals br br br Damage from cell reversal br Subjecting a discharged cell to a current in the direction which tends to discharge it further to the point the positive and negative terminals switch polarity causes a condition called cell reversal Generally pushing current through a discharged cell in this way causes undesirable and irreversible chemical reactions to occur resulting in permanent damage to the cell br Cell reversal can occur under a number of circumstances the two most common being br br When a battery or cell is connected to a charging circuit the wrong way around br When a battery made of several cells connected in series is deeply discharged br In the latter case the problem occurs due to the different cells in a battery having slightly different capacities When one cell reaches discharge level ahead of the rest the remaining cells will force the current through the discharged cell br Many battery operated devices have a low voltage cutoff that prevents deep discharges from occurring that might cause cell reversal A smart battery has voltage monitoring circuitry built inside br Cell reversal can occur to a weakly charged cell even before it is fully discharged If the battery drain current is high enough the cell s internal resistance can create a resistive voltage drop that is greater than the cell s forward emf This results in the reversal of the cell s polarity while the current is flowing The higher the required discharge rate of a battery the better matched the cells should be both in the type of cell and state of charge in order to reduce the chances of cell reversal br In some situations such as when correcting NiCd batteries that have been previously overcharged it may be desirable to fully discharge a battery To avoid damage from the cell reversal effect it is necessary to access each cell separately each cell is individually discharged by connecting a load clip across the terminals of each cell thereby avoiding cell reversal br br br Damage during storage in fully discharged state br br If a multi cell battery is fully discharged it will often be damaged due to the cell reversal effect mentioned above br It is possible however to fully discharge a battery without causing cell reversal either by discharging each cell separately or by allowing each cell s internal leakage to dissipate its charge over time br Even if a cell is brought to a fully discharged state without reversal however damage may occur over time simply due to remaining in the discharged state An example of this is the sulfation that occurs in lead acid batteries that are left sitting on a shelf for long periods br For this reason it is often recommended to charge a battery that is intended to remain in storage and to maintain its charge level by periodically recharging it br Since damage may also occur if the battery is overcharged the optimal level of charge during storage is typically around to br br br Depth of discharge br br Depth of discharge DOD is normally stated as a percentage of the nominal ampere hour capacity DOD means no discharge As the usable capacity of a battery system depends on the rate of discharge and the allowable voltage at the end of discharge the depth of discharge must be qualified to show the way it is to be measured Due to variations during manufacture and aging the DOD for complete discharge can change over time or number of charge cycles Generally a rechargeable battery system will tolerate more charge discharge cycles if the DOD is lower on each cycle Lithium batteries can discharge to about to of their nominal capacity Lead acid batteries can discharge to about While flow batteries can discharge br br br Lifespan and cycle stability br If batteries are used repeatedly even without mistreatment they lose capacity as the number of charge cycles increases until they are eventually considered to have reached the end of their useful life Different battery systems have differing mechanisms for wearing out For example in lead acid batteries not all the active material is restored to the plates on each charge discharge cycle eventually enough material is lost that the battery capacity is reduced In lithium ion types especially on deep discharge some reactive lithium metal can be formed on charging which is no longer available to participate in the next discharge cycle Sealed batteries may lose moisture from their liquid electrolyte especially if overcharged or operated at high temperature This reduces the cycling life br br br Recharging time br br Recharging time is an important parameter to the user of a product powered by rechargeable batteries Even if the charging power supply provides enough power to operate the device as well as recharge the battery the device is attached to an external power supply during the charging time For electric vehicles used industrially charging during off shifts may be acceptable For highway electric vehicles rapid charging is necessary for charging in a reasonable time br A rechargeable battery cannot be recharged at an arbitrarily high rate The internal resistance of the battery will produce heat and excessive temperature rise will damage or destroy a battery For some types the maximum charging rate will be limited by the speed at which active material can diffuse through a liquid electrolyte High charging rates may produce excess gas in a battery or may result in damaging side reactions that permanently lower the battery capacity Very roughly and with many exceptions and caveats restoring a battery s full capacity in one hour or less is considered fast charging A battery charger system will include more complex control circuit and charging strategies for fast charging than for a charger designed for slower recharging br br br Active components br The active components in a secondary cell are the chemicals that make up the positive and negative active materials and the electrolyte The positive and negative electrodes are made up of different materials with the positive exhibiting a reduction potential and the negative having an oxidation potential The sum of the potentials from these half reactions is the standard cell potential or voltage br In primary cells the positive and negative electrodes are known as the cathode and anode respectively Although this convention is sometimes carried through to rechargeable systems especially with lithium ion cells because of their origins in primary lithium cells this practice can lead to confusion In rechargeable cells the positive electrode is the cathode on discharge and the anode on charge and vice versa for the negative electrode br br br Types br br br Commercial types br The lead acid battery invented in by French physicist Gaston Plant is the oldest type of rechargeable battery Despite having a very low energy to weight ratio and a low energy to volume ratio its ability to supply high surge currents means that the cells have a relatively large power to weight ratio These features along with the low cost makes it attractive for use in motor vehicles to provide the high current required by automobile starter motors br The nickel cadmium battery NiCd was invented by Waldemar Jungner of Sweden in It uses nickel oxide hydroxide and metallic cadmium as electrodes Cadmium is a toxic element and was banned for most uses by the European Union in Nickel cadmium batteries have been almost completely superseded by nickel metal hydride NiMH batteries br The nickel iron battery NiFe was also developed by Waldemar Jungner in and commercialized by Thomas Edison in in the United States for electric vehicles and railway signalling It is composed of only non toxic elements unlike many kinds of batteries that contain toxic mercury cadmium or lead br The nickel metal hydride battery NiMH became available in These are now a common consumer and industrial type The battery has a hydrogen absorbing alloy for the negative electrode instead of cadmium br The lithium ion battery was introduced in the market in is the choice in most consumer electronics having the best energy density and a very slow loss of charge when not in use It does have drawbacks too particularly the risk of unexpected ignition from the heat generated by the battery Such incidents are rare and according to experts they can be minimized via appropriate design installation procedures and layers of safeguards so the risk is acceptable br Lithium ion polymer batteries LiPo are light in weight offer slightly higher energy density than Li ion at slightly higher cost and can be made in any shape They are available but have not displaced Li ion in the market A primary use is for LiPo batteries is in powering remote controlled cars boats and airplanes LiPo packs are readily available on the consumer market in various configurations up to V for powering certain R C vehicles and helicopters or drones Some test reports warn of the risk of fire when the batteries are not used in accordance with the instructions Independent reviews of the technology discuss the risk of fire and explosion from Lithium ion batteries under certain conditions because they use liquid electrolytes br br br

VRLA or recombinant includes gel batteries and absorbed glass mats br p Pilot production br Several types of lithium sulfur battery have been developed and numerous research groups and organizations have demonstrated that batteries based on lithium sulfur can achieve superior energy density to other lithium technologies Whereas lithium ion batteries offer energy density in the range of Wh kg batteries based on lithium sulfur are expected to achieve Wh kg and can eliminate cobalt nickel and manganese from the production process Furthermore while initially lithium sulfur batteries suffered from stability problems recent research has made advances in developing lithium sulfur batteries that cycle as long as or longer than batteries based on conventional lithium ion technologies br The thin film battery TFB is a refinement of lithium ion technology by Excellatron The developers claim a large increase in recharge cycles to around and higher charge and discharge rates at least C charge rate Sustained C discharge and C peak discharge rate and a significant increase in specific energy and energy density br lithium iron phosphate batteries are used in some applications br UltraBattery a hybrid lead acid battery and ultracapacitor invented by Australia s national science organisation CSIRO exhibits tens of thousands of partial state of charge cycles and has outperformed traditional lead acid lithium and NiMH based cells when compared in testing in this mode against variability management power profiles UltraBattery has kW and MW scale installations in place in Australia Japan and the U S A It has also been subjected to extensive testing in hybrid electric vehicles and has been shown to last more than vehicle miles in on road commercial testing in a courier vehicle The technology is claimed to have a lifetime of to times that of conventional lead acid batteries in high rate partial state of charge use with safety and environmental benefits claimed over competitors like lithium ion Its manufacturer suggests an almost recycling rate is already in place for the product br The potassium ion battery delivers around a million cycles due to the extraordinary electrochemical stability of potassium insertion extraction materials such as Prussian blue br The sodium ion battery is meant for stationary storage and competes with lead acid batteries It aims at a low total cost of ownership per kWh of storage This is achieved by a long and stable lifetime The effective number of cycles is above and the battery is not damaged by deep discharge The energy density is rather low somewhat lower than lead acid br br br Alternatives br A rechargeable battery is only one of several types of rechargeable energy storage systems Several alternatives to rechargeable batteries exist or are under development For uses such as portable radios rechargeable batteries may be replaced by clockwork mechanisms which are wound up by hand driving dynamos although this system may be used to charge a battery rather than to operate the radio directly Flashlights may be driven by a dynamo directly For transportation uninterruptible power supply systems and laboratories flywheel energy storage systems store energy in a spinning rotor for conversion to electric power when needed such systems may be used to provide large pulses of power that would otherwise be objectionable on a common electrical grid br Ultracapacitors capacitors of extremely high value are also used an electric screwdriver which charges in seconds and will drive about half as many screws as a device using a rechargeable battery was introduced in and similar flashlights have been produced In keeping with the concept of ultracapacitors betavoltaic batteries may be utilized as a method of providing a trickle charge to a secondary battery greatly extending the life and energy capacity of the battery system being employed this type of arrangement is often referred to as a hybrid betavoltaic power source by those in the industry br Ultracapacitors are being developed for transportation using a large capacitor to store energy instead of the rechargeable battery banks used in hybrid vehicles One drawback of capacitors compared to batteries is that the terminal voltage drops rapidly a capacitor that has of its initial energy left in it will have one half of its initial voltage By contrast battery systems tend to have a terminal voltage that does not decline rapidly until nearly exhausted This terminal voltage drop complicates the design of power electronics for use with ultracapacitors However there are potential benefits in cycle efficiency lifetime and weight compared with rechargeable systems China started using ultracapacitors on two commercial bus routes in one of them is route in Shanghai br Flow batteries used for specialized applications are recharged by replacing the electrolyte liquid A flow battery can be considered to be a type of rechargeable fuel cell br br br Research br Rechargeable battery research includes development of new electrochemical systems as well as improving the life span and capacity of current types
