The Nintendo e Reader commonly abbreviated as e Reader is an add on manufactured by Nintendo for its Game Boy Advance handheld video game console It was released in Japan in December with a North American release following in September It has an LED scanner that reads e Reader cards paper cards with specially encoded data printed on them br Depending on the card and associated game the e cards are typically used in a key like function to unlock secret items levels or play mini games when swiped through the reader The cards themselves contain data as opposed to unlocking data already on the device itself br br br Usage and versions br Two versions were released in Japan the original e Reader without a link cable port which could read cards to unlock game content etc and later the e Reader simply e Reader in Australia and North America which came with a link cable port to connect with GameCube games such as Animal Crossing and with other Game Boy Advance systems for games such as Pok mon Ruby and Sapphire The e Reader was only considered successful in Japan In Nintendo s head European PR confirmed that the e Reader would not be releasing in Europe following a year of confusion surrounding the subject She stated The market potential isn t great enough It was discontinued in North America in early due to a lack of popularity In Japan it sold much better and was produced up to the discontinuation of the Game Boy hardware line br In order to add items and scan levels in games such as Super Mario Advance Super Mario Bros a player required two Game Boy Advance systems and a link cable The gray end would go into the e Reader GBA and the purple end into the GBA that had the game After entering the needed point on the game players would swipe the cards in and the data would be transferred to the game cartridge This function does not work with the Nintendo DS due to the lack of link cable support br br br e Reader cards br br In the U S e Reader Card packs have been released that contain br br NES games br New levels and power ups for Super Mario Advance Super Mario Bros br Items and designs for Animal Crossing br New trainers to battle in Pok mon Ruby and Sapphire br Mini games including an exclusive version of Mario Party br Game Watch Cards originally there were plans to release more Game and Watch games as a series of E reader cards Only Manhole e was officially released br There have been numerous other games released with e Reader support in Japan br br br Dot code br Data is encoded on the cards using dot code a specialized barcode technology licensed from Olympus Corporation e Reader Cards may have one or two sets of dot code on them either a wide strip on the left side of the card a wide strip on both the left and right sides of the card a narrow strip on the bottom of the card or a short strip on the bottom of the card with a long strip on the left side of the card Smaller games may require scanning only one card two sets of dot code while the greater NES games can require as many as five cards nine to ten sets of dot code in order to start the application br The shorter sets of dot code were only used with the Pok mon Trading Card Game Cards released in regular sets published by both Nintendo and Wizards of the Coast had a dot code on the bottom side of the card When scanned the e Reader displayed a Pok dex data entry for the Pok mon shown on the card Many of the cards published by Wizards of the Coast included a left side dot code that would allow users to play mini games animations and use secret attacks in the Trading Card Game or play with various songs and graphics br br br Compatibility br br The e Reader plugs into the cartridge slot of the Game Boy Advance like a regular game would The end of the e Reader sticks out from the Game Boy Advance unit to provide a slot to scan the e Reader Cards Electronically the e Reader is compatible with any console that supports Game Boy Advance games however it may be mechanically incompatible with some systems it simply does not fit and the ability to link consoles may not be available br Once installed the link cable connector on the Game Boy Advance is obstructed but a pass through connection on the e Reader allows link up features to be used The Game Boy Advance SP is also fully compatible although the e Reader does not mount flush with the SP see picture As the link cable connector on the SP is unobstructed the pass through on the e Reader is not used An additional cover AGB can be added to the e reader in order to avoid damaging the pin connector when linked to a GBA SP br The Game Boy Player is also fully compatible and the e Reader connects as it would to a Game Boy Advance the e Reader pass through connector is used for connecting the link cable The GameCube hosting this system acts as a Game Boy Advance in order to link to a GameCube game a second GameCube or a Wii running the game in question must be used br The e Reader can fit into the DS Lite but not the original DS The e Reader can however be modified to fit into the original DS In either case there is no support for linking features as neither system has a link cable port br The e Reader fits into the Game Boy Micro and has a link cable port but not a standard connector A special Game Boy Micro Game Link Cable must be used for linking features The Game Boy Micro s non standard link cable port can not accept the GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable meaning it cannot link with GameCube games without modification to the cable br Because the first version of the Japanese e Reader did not have a link cable pass through connector it can fit into consoles which the later e Readers are incompatible with Even though the Game Boy Advance and the DS are region free Japanese e Reader cards work only on Japanese e Readers and North American e Reader cards will only work on North American e Readers The system will display region error on both systems if a user attempts to use another region s cards on their own device br br br Game list br br br Classic NES Series br Each game in this series comes in a pack of five cards each of which must be scanned twice
