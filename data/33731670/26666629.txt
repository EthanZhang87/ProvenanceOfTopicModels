reality capabilities using its D cameras and Virtual Console which provides a method for users to download and play video games originally released for older video game systems br The Nintendo DS was released in Japan on February and worldwide beginning in March Less than six months later on July Nintendo announced a significant price reduction from US to US amid disappointing launch sales The company offered ten free NES games and ten free Game Boy Advance games from the Nintendo eShop to consumers who bought the system at the original launch price This strategy was considered a major success and the console went on to become one of Nintendo s most successful handheld consoles in the first two years of its release As of September the Nintendo DS family of systems combined have sold

online service shut down on April with the exception of Pok mon Bank Pok Transporter and the ability to redownload previously purchased software br br br History br br br Background br Nintendo began experimenting with stereoscopic D video game technology in the s The Famicom D System an accessory consisting of liquid crystal shutter glasses was Nintendo s first product that enabled stereoscopic D effects Although very few titles were released Nintendo helped design one called Famicom Grand Prix II D Hot Rally which was co developed by Nintendo and HAL Laboratory and released in The Famicom D System failed to garner market interest and was never released outside Japan br Nintendo s second attempt with D development was the Virtual Boy designed by Gunpei Yokoi creator of the Game Boy handheld console and popular Metroid video game It was a portable table top system consisting of goggles and a controller that used a spinning disc to achieve full stereoscopic monochrome D Released in the Virtual Boy sold fewer than a million units with only compatible game titles released and was widely considered to be a commercial failure Shigeru Miyamoto known for his work on popular game franchises such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda commented in a interview that he felt conflicted about Yokoi s decision to use wire frame models for D and suggested that the product may not have been marketed correctly The failure of the Virtual Boy left many at Nintendo doubting the viability of D gaming br Despite this Nintendo continued to investigate the incorporation of D technology into later products The GameCube released in was also capable of displaying true stereoscopic D with an LCD attachment though only the launch title Luigi s Mansion was ever designed to utilize it While a working internal prototype was created the add on itself was never released due to its expensive cost leaving the feature unavailable outside of development Nintendo later experimented with a D LCD during the development of the Game Boy Advance SP but the idea was shelved after it failed to achieve satisfactory results Another attempt was made in preparation for a virtual navigation guide to be used on the Nintendo DS at Shigureden an interactive museum in Japan Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi encouraged additional D research in an effort to use the technology in the exhibition Although the project fell short Nintendo was able to collect valuable research on liquid crystal which would later aid in the development of the Nintendo DS br br br Development br Speculation on the development of a successor to the Nintendo DS began in late At the time Nintendo controlled as much as of the handheld gaming market In October tech tabloid Bright Side of News reported that Nvidia a graphics processing unit GPU developer that recently made headway with its Tegra System on Chip processors had been selected by Nintendo to develop hardware for their next generation portable game console Later that month speaking about the future for Nintendo s portable consoles company president Satoru Iwata mentioned that while mobile broadband connectivity via subscription doesn t fit Nintendo customers he was interested in exploring options like Amazon s Whispernet found on the Amazon Kindle which provides free wireless connectivity to its customers for the sole purpose of browsing and purchasing content from the Kindle Store br Nintendo had expressed interest in motion sensing capabilities since the development of the original Nintendo DS and an alleged comment by Satoru Iwata from a interview with Asahi Shimbun implied that the successor to the Nintendo DS would incorporate a motion sensor The claim led to a minor dispute between the publication and Nintendo over its accuracy In February video gaming website Computer and Video Games reported that a select handful of Japanese developers were in possession of software development kits for the Nintendo DS successor with The Pok mon Company given special priority According to their insider at an unspecified third party development studio the hardware features a tilt function that is similar to that of the iPhone but does a lot more br br br Announcement br br On March Nintendo officially announced the Nintendo DS handheld console According to industry analysts the timing of the announcement which had drawn attention away from the launch of the company s still new Nintendo DSi XL handheld was likely intended to preempt impending news leaks about the product by the Japanese press In April a picture of a possible development build of the internal components of the DS was released as part of a U S Federal Communications Commission FCC filing by Mitsumi An analysis of the image showed that it was likely genuine as it featured components known to be used in the Nintendo DS line along with features of the DS that had not been announced like a top screen and a control nub similar to those used in Sony s PlayStation Portable systems br In June video gaming website IGN reported that according to several developers who have experienced DS in its current form the system possesses

hand Destructoid said the D effect on the XL was more subtle than on its predecessor The Verge spoke positively of the build quality and design choices saying the console improved on the original A Destructoid reviewer said the DS XL was easier to use than the regular Nintendo DS mainly due to their large hands The Verge noted lowered sound quality from the original the result of smaller

concerns br Nintendo has publicly stated that the D mode of the Nintendo DS is not intended for use by children ages six and younger citing possible harm to their vision Nintendo suggests that younger

screening children before the age of who have depth related vision problems according to Dr Michael Duenas associate director for health sciences and policy for the American Optometric Association and Dr Joe Ellis the president of the optometrists association However Dr David Hunter a pediatric ophthalmologist affiliated with the American Academy of Ophthalmology believes that it is largely speculative whether a child who has problems perceiving depth in real life would react to a DS in any way that parents would recognize as indicating any problems with depth perception Duenas asserted that Nintendo s vague warning that there is a possibility that D images which send different images to the left and right eye could affect the development of vision in small children was not specifically backed up by any scientific evidence and that it was motivated by preventing possible liability rather than safeguarding against realistic harm br The system s parental controls safeguarded by a PIN allow parents to disable autostereoscopic effects on systems intended for use by young children Playing games in D has been suspected of causing headaches among some gamers br Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aim partially cited these concerns as one of the influences of the creation of the Nintendo DS an entry level version of the Nintendo DS systems lacking D

judge intrinsically excessive and unsupported by the evidence presented at trial On December it was decided by Judge Rakoff that Nintendo pay of the wholesale price of each unit sold to Tomita On March the United States Appeals Court determined Nintendo had not violated Tomita s patent br On July Nintendo won a patent suit filed against eight of its handheld consoles including the DS The suit
