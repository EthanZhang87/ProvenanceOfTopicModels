Chibi Robo Photo Finder br br Chibi Robo Photo Finder known as Chibi Robo Let s Go Photo in Europe and Australia is a video game for the Nintendo DS handheld game console via the Nintendo eShop It is the fourth installment in Chibi Robo game series developed by Skip Ltd and published by Nintendo br Unlike past entries in the series Photo Finder doesn t focus on cleaning or performing helpful tasks but rather a brand new mechanic that involves the DS s augmented reality capabilities The game revolves around collecting everyday objects known as NostalJunk and placing them on display in a museum The game still has cleaning functions as with Chibi Robo Plug Into Adventure and Chibi Robo Park Patrol but Photo Finder turns said cleaning sections into missions Chibi Robo can access at any time using the Chibi PC These missions are jobs that several of the supporting characters send via email and include cleaning out a garage or blasting wasabi into various sushi on a conveyor belt The player is awarded Happy Points based on performance which function once again as the game s currency Happy Points can then in turn be traded in for silhouette films that show outlines of household objects which can be purchased from the shop which can also be accessed from the Chibi PC br Once a film is purchased the player is then able to shoot a photo with the DS s built in camera The screen will show the silhouette of the household object and the player s goal is to find an object that matches the outline After lining the object up with the outline the player has ten tries to take a picture that most matches the outline The object s quality is measured by a percentage in the top right corner If an object is below it won t transfer If it s between and it has a chance of either being transferred or becoming a NostalDud However if the object has accuracy it will not only transfer no matter what but all following objects created with the film will be cutouts which means that an object won t have to match the outline of the film br The game also involves exploration stages that can be accessed after unlocking new jobs These areas allow the player to dabble in more traditional Chibi Robo gameplay Rather than unlocking or buying new items in order to better clean and traverse the area necessary tools are received upon entering the area Trash and dust piles litter the vicinity and Chibi Robo has the option to either clean it up or just explore the area In order to leave the area Chibi Robo must dispose of the collected refuse in a Recycling Machine located near the exit The compactor will then reward the player s efforts the more trash they pick up the more Happy Points are rewarded br Like before Chibi Robo relies heavily on battery power Due to his limited battery size he must constantly watch his Watts meter and conserve his energy by all means possible Once Chibi Robo loses all of his Watts he will power down and collapse on the spot If this happens during a job Chibi Robo will be returned to Mr Curator s desk and receive no Happy Points There are two ways to recharge by plugging into the outlet on Mr Curator s desk or by finding a battery hidden in one of the many explorable areas br br br Plot br In the beginning Chibi Robo appears in a ventilation system within a museum with a semi glowing red button in front of him After pressing it a trap door goes off in the floor and Chibi Robo falls through He lands in the Curator s office where he meets the Curator and a cell phone like robot Telly who is Chibi Robo s manager The Curator explains Chibi Robo s purpose to collect photos called NostalJunk using silhouette film to help increase the museum s popularity While performing this task Chibi Robo meets living toys and objects around the museum and helps them with their duties in exchange for silhouette film At one point the Curator is asked to speak in front of an audience which doesn t go well due to his stage fright and later decides to write a book about his museum In the end the museum becomes a thrilling success with the Curator giving Chibi Robo credit for his efforts br br br Chibi Robo Zip Lash br br Chibi Robo Zip Lash is a Nintendo DS game It was released in Japan and North America in October and in Europe and Australia in November Unlike past games Chibi Robo Zip Lash is a sidescrolling platformer with emphasis on combat and exploration In this game Chibi Robo uses his tail like cord as a whip to attack enemies and latch onto objects Certain collectibles can increase the length of Chibi Robo s cord A Chibi Robo amiibo was also produced to interact with the game Developers of Zip Lash believed that this game might be the last game in the Chibi Robo series if this game did not meet sales expectations and the game was not received well critically and commercially considered to be a commercial failure br br br Future br Due to Zip Lash being a critical and commercial failure it is theoretically considered the final game in the series with Skip Ltd having not made any games since In August it was widely speculated that the company had closed down with evidence such as an HTTP error when opening the company website the CEO of the company removing the website from his Twitter profile and new occupation of the company building potentially pointing towards this br Nintendo tweeted a picture of Fiery Chibi Robo in January which is of Chibi Robo using the fire ability This led to speculation that a Nintendo Direct was close and a new Chibi Robo game was going to be announced A Nintendo Direct Mini was released the next day without a new Chibi Robo game although the image of Fiery Chibi Robo has become a meme in the Nintendo community as representation for excitement for a Nintendo Direct br br br Notes br br br
