title: Famicom Disk System
id: 163805
The Family Computer Disk System commonly shortened to the Famicom Disk System or just Disk System is a peripheral for Nintendo s Family Computer home video game console released only in Japan on February It uses proprietary floppy disks called Disk Cards for cheaper data storage and it adds a new high fidelity sound channel for supporting Disk System games br Fundamentally the Disk System serves simply to enhance some aspects already inherent to the base Famicom system with better sound and cheaper games though with the disadvantages of high initial price slow speed and lower reliability However this boost to the market of affordable and writable mass storage temporarily served as an enabling technology for the creation of new types of video games This includes the vast open world progress saving adventures of the best selling The Legend of Zelda and Metroid games with a cost effective and swift release such as the best selling Super Mario Bros and nationwide leaderboards and contests via the in store Disk Fax kiosks which are considered to be forerunners of today s online achievement and distribution systems br By the Famicom Disk System was inevitably obsoleted by the improving semiconductor technology of game cartridges The Disk System s lifetime sales reached million units by making it the most successful console add on of all time despite not being sold outside of Japan Its final game was released in its software was discontinued in and Nintendo officially discontinued its technical support in br br br History br By Nintendo s Family Computer was dominating the Japanese home video game market selling over three million units within a year and a half Because of its success the company had difficulty with keeping up demand for new stock often getting flooded with calls from retailers asking for more systems Retailers also requested for cheaper games the cost of chips and semiconductors made cartridges expensive to make and often cost a lot of money for both stores and consumers to purchase Chip shortages also created supply issues To satisfy these requests Nintendo began thinking of ways to potentially lower the cost of games It turned towards the home computer market for inspiration Nintendo specifically looked to floppy disks which were quickly becoming the standard for storage media for personal computers Floppy disks were cheap to produce and rewritable allowing games to be easily produced during the manufacturing process Seeing its potential Nintendo began work on a disk based peripheral for the Famicom br For its proprietary diskette platform which they dubbed the Disk Card Nintendo chose to base it on Mitsumi s Quick Disk media format a cheaper alternative to floppy disks for Japanese home computers The Disk Card format presented a number of advantages over cartridges such as increased storage capacity that allowed for larger games additional sound channels and the ability to save player progress The add on itself was produced by Masayuki Uemura and Nintendo Research Development the same team that designed the Famicom itself Following several delays the Famicom Disk System was released on February at a retail price of US The same day Nintendo released The Legend of Zelda as a launch title alongside disk re releases of earlier Famicom games Marketing material for the Disk System featured a yellow mascot character named Diskun or Mr Disk The Famicom Disk System sold over units within three months jumping to over million by the end of the year Nintendo remained confident the Disk System would be a sure fire success and ensured that all future first party releases would be exclusive to the peripheral br br Coinciding with the Disk System s release Nintendo installed several Disk Writer kiosks in various toy and electronic stores across the country These kiosks allowed customers to bring in their disk games and have a new game rewritten onto them for a fee blank disks could also be purchased for Nintendo also introduced special high score tournaments for specific Disk System games where players could submit their scores directly to Nintendo via Disk Fax machines found in retail stores Winners would receive exclusive prizes including Famicom branded stationary sets and a gold colored Punch Out cartridge Nintendo of America announced plans to release the Disk System for the Famicom s international counterpart the Nintendo Entertainment System however these plans were eventually scrapped br Despite the Famicom Disk System s success and advantages over the Famicom itself it also imposed many problems of its own Most common was the quality of the Disk Cards Nintendo removed the shutters on most Disk System games to reduce costs instead placing them in a wax sleeve and clear plastic shell The disks themselves are fragile and the lack of a shutter made them collect dust and fingerprints eventually rendering them unplayable as a result Piracy was also rampant with disk copying devices and bootleg games becoming commonplace in stores and in magazine advertisements Third party developers for the Disk System were also angered towards Nintendo s strict licensing terms requiring that it receive copyright ownership of any and all software released this led to several major developers such as Namco and Hudson Soft refusing to produce games for it Four months after the Disk System was released Capcom released a Famicom conversion of Ghosts n Goblins on a k cartridge larger than the Disk Card s k capacity which as a result made consumers and developers less impressed with the Disk System s technological features Retailers disliked the Disk Writer kiosks for taking up too much space and for generally being unprofitable The Disk System s vague error messages long loading times and the poor quality of the rubber drive belt that spun the disks are also cited as attributing to its downfall br By advancements in technology made cartridge games much cheaper and easier to produce leaving the Famicom Disk System obsolete Retailers were critical of Nintendo simply abandoning the Disk Writers and leaving stores with large kiosks that took up vital space while companies began to release or move their games from the Disk System to a standard cartridge towards the end of development Squaresoft ported Final Fantasy over to the Famicom as a cartridge game with its own battery backup save feature Nintendo officially discontinued the Famicom Disk System in selling around million units total Disk writing services were still kept in operation until September while technical services were provided up until October br br br Hardware versions br br Sharp released the Twin Famicom a Famicom model that features a built in Disk System br br br Disk Writer and Disk Fax kiosks br Widespread copyright violation in Japan s predominantly personal computer based game rental market inspired corporations to petition the government to ban the rental of all video games in With games then being available only via full purchase demand rose for a new and less expensive way to access more games In as video gaming had increasingly expanded from computers into the video game console market Nintendo advertised a promise to install Famicom Disk Writer kiosks in toy and hobby stores across Japan within one year These jukebox style stations allowed users to copy from a rotating stock of the latest games to their disks and keep each one for an unlimited time To write an existing disk with a new game from the available roster was then about US and of the price of many new games Instruction sheets were given by the retailer or available by mail order for Some game releases such as Kaette Kita Mario Bros were exclusive to these kiosks br In Disk Writer kiosks in select locations were also provisioned as Disk Fax systems as Nintendo s first online concept Players could take advantage of the dynamic rewritability of blue floppy disk versions of Disk System games such as Famicom Grand Prix F Race and Golf Japan Course in order to save their high scores at their leisure at home and then bring the disk to a retailer s Disk Fax kiosk which collated and transmitted the players scores via fax to Nintendo Players participated in a nationwide leaderboard with unique prizes br The kiosk service was very popular and remained available until In subsequent console generations Nintendo would relaunch this online national leaderboard concept with the home satellite based Satellaview subscription service in Japan from to for the Super Famicom It would relaunch the model of games downloadable to rewritable portable media from store kiosks with the Nintendo Power service in Japan which is based on rewritable flash media cartridges for the Super Famicom and Game Boy from to br Calling the Disk Writer one of the coolest things Nintendo ever created Kotaku says modern digital distribution could learn from the Disk Writer and that the system s premise of game rental and achievements would still be innovative in today s retail and online stores NintendoLife said it was truly ground breaking for its time and could be considered a forerunner of more modern distribution methods such as Xbox Live Arcade PlayStation Network and Steam br br br Technology br The device is connected to the Famicom console by plugging its RAM Adapter cartridge into the system s cartridge port and attaching that cartridge s cable to the disk drive The RAM Adapter contains kilobytes KB of RAM for temporarily caching program data from disk KB of RAM for tile and sprite data storage and an ASIC named the C The ASIC acts as a disk controller plus single cycle wavetable lookup synthesizer sound hardware Finally embedded in the C is an KB BIOS ROM The Disk Cards used are double sided with a total capacity of KB per disk Many games span both sides of a disk and a few span multiple disks requiring the user to switch at some point during gameplay The Disk System is capable of running on six C cell batteries or the supplied AC adapter Batteries usually last five months with daily game play The inclusion of a battery option is due to the likelihood of a standard set of AC plugs already being occupied by a Famicom and a television br The Disk System s Disk Cards are somewhat proprietary mm mm in K per side double sided floppy They are a slight modification of Mitsumi s Quick Disk mm in square disk format which is used in a handful of Japanese computers and various synthesizer keyboards along with a few word processors QuickDisk drives are in a few devices in Europe and North America Mitsumi already had close relations with Nintendo as it manufactured the Famicom and NES consoles and possibly other Nintendo hardware br Modifications to the standard Quick Disk format include the NINTENDO moulding along the bottom of each Disk Card In addition to branding the disk this acts as a rudimentary form of copy protection a device inside the drive bay contains raised protrusions which fit into their recessed counterparts ostensibly ensuring that only official disks are used If a disk without these recessed areas is inserted the protrusions cannot raise and the system will not allow the game to be loaded This was combined with technical measures in the way data was stored on the disk to prevent users from physically swapping copied disk media into an official shell However both of these measures were defeated by pirate game distributors in particular special disks with cutouts alongside simple devices to modify standard Quick Disks were produced to defeat the physical hardware check enabling rampant piracy An advertisement containing a guide for a simple modification to a Quick Disk to allow its use with a Famicom Disk System was printed in at least one magazine br br br Games br br There are about games in the Famicom Disk System s library Some are FDS exclusives some are Disk Writer exclusives and many were re released years later on the cartridge format such as The Legend of Zelda for NES in and for Famicom in The most notable FDS originals include The Legend of Zelda Zelda II The Adventure of Link Kid Icarus Metroid and Akumaj Dracula Castlevania br Square Co Ltd had a branch called Disk Original Group a software label that published Disk System games from Japanese PC software companies The venture was largely a failure and almost pushed a pre Final Fantasy Square into bankruptcy Final Fantasy was to be released for the FDS but a disagreement over Nintendo s copyright policies caused Square to change its position and release the game as a cartridge br Nintendo released a disk version of Super Mario Bros in addition to the cartridge version The Western market Super Mario Bros originated from a disk only game called Yume K j Doki Doki Panic br Nintendo utilized the cheaper and more dynamic disk medium for a Disk Writer exclusive as an early advergame Kaettekita Mario Bros lit The Return of Mario Bros is a remastered version of Mario Bros with enhanced jump controls and high score saving plus a new slot machine minigame co branded for the Nagatanien food company br The final FDS game release was Janken Disk J in December a rock paper scissors game featuring the Disk System mascot Disk kun br br br Legacy br The Famicom Disk System briefly served as an enabling technology for the creation of a new wave of home console video games and a new type of video game experience mostly due to tripling the size of cheap game storage compared to affordable cartridge ROMs and by storing gamers progress within their vast new adventures These games include the open world design and enduring series launches of The Legend of Zelda and Metroid with its launch game Zelda becoming very popular and leading to sequels which are considered some of the greatest games of all time Almost one decade ahead of Nintendo s Satellaview service the FDS s writable and portable storage technology served as an enabling technology for the innovation of online leaderboards and contests via the in store Disk Fax kiosks which are now seen as the earliest forerunners of modern online gaming and distribution br Within its library of original games some are FDS exclusive and many were re released one or two years later on cartridges for Famicom and NES though without the FDS s additional sound channel br br br See also br Sega CD A similar peripheral for the Sega Genesis br Super NES CD ROM br Nintendo Disk Drive br br br Notes br br br
