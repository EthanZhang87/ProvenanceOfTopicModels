The Wii U WEE YOO is a home video game console developed by Nintendo as the successor to the Wii Released in late it is the first eighth generation video game console and competed with Microsoft s Xbox One and Sony s PlayStation br The Wii U is the first Nintendo console to support HD graphics The system s primary controller is the Wii U GamePad which features an embedded touchscreen a D pad analog sticks and action buttons The screen can be used either as a supplement to the main display or in supported games to play the game directly on the GamePad The Wii U Pro Controller can be used in its place as a more traditional alternative The Wii U is backward compatible with Wii software and accessories Games can support any combination of the GamePad Wii Remote Nunchuk Balance Board or Nintendo s Classic Controller or Wii U Pro Controller Online functionality centered around the Nintendo Network platform and Miiverse an integrated social networking service which allowed users to share content in game specific communities br Critical response to the Wii U was mixed It was praised for its innovative GamePad controller improvements to online functionality over the Wii backward compatibility with Wii software and peripherals and price However it was criticized for its user interface and functionality and the GamePad s short battery life It had low sales primarily credited to a weak lineup of launch games limited third party support and poor marketing including the lack of distinguishing the unique functionality of the GamePad from just being a tablet device for the Wii Production of the Wii U ended on January On March Nintendo released its successor the Nintendo Switch which retained and refined concepts introduced with the Wii U Most of the Wii U s exclusive games were later ported to the Switch br br br History br br br Development br The system was first conceived in after Nintendo recognized several limitations and challenges with the Wii such as the general public s perception that the system catered primarily to a casual audience With the Wii U Nintendo wished to bring back core gamers Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto admitted that the lack of HD and limited network infrastructure for Wii also contributed to the system being regarded in a separate class to the PlayStation and Xbox the Wii s competitors It was clear that a new console would have to be developed to accommodate significant structural changes but ideas on which direction to take for the new console led to a lot of debate within the company and the project started over from scratch on several occasions The concept of a touchscreen embedded within the controller was originally inspired by the blue light on the Wii disc slot that illuminates to indicate new messages Miyamoto and his team wanted to include a small screen to provide game feedback and status messages to players similar to the VMU for Sega s Dreamcast Much later in development this was expanded to a full screen that could display the game being played in its entirety a concept that was suggested but not financially viable earlier in the project br Public rumors surrounding the console began to appear in with speculation of an upcoming revision of the Wii scheduled for known as the Wii HD that would support high definition video and have a Blu ray drive However Nintendo president Satoru Iwata later stated that he saw no significant reason to include HD into the Wii and that such an addition would be better suited for a successor Miyamoto also expressed Nintendo s interest in working with HD graphics but clarified that the company is primarily focused on gameplay In October Miyamoto said that Nintendo had no concrete plans about its next console but thought that the new system would continue to feature motion controls and also expected its interface to be more compact and cheaper Iwata also mentioned that the Wii s successor might be D compatible but concluded that the adoption rates of D televisions should increase to at least first In Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aim commented that he felt confident the Wii home entertainment console has a very long life in front of it and declared that a successor would not be launched in the near future br After its E presentation Iwata revealed to the BBC that Nintendo would begin announcing a new console once it ran out of ideas with the current hardware and cannot give users any more meaningful surprises with the technology Later at an investor s meeting he disclosed that Nintendo was of course studying and developing the next console to Wii but it was simultaneously keeping its concepts secret because it was really important for Nintendo s business to positively surprise people Fils Aim also stated that Nintendo s next home console would likely not feature stereoscopic D based on the D technology Nintendo had experimented with br In April an uncredited source indicated that Nintendo was planning to unveil a successor to the Wii known as Project Caf at its E presentation Caf was claimed to be a high definition console and to also have backward compatibility with Wii software Conflicting reports also surrounded the console s new controller with reports suggesting a tablet like device with an embedded touchscreen and the ability to stream games from the console directly to the screen while others reported that the controller would be similar to the GameCube controller and feature dual analog sticks shoulder buttons and triggers br br br Announcement br br On April Nintendo released an official statement announcing a system to succeed the Wii to be released during and that playable console units would be present at E Speaking at an investor s conference Iwata stated the Wii successor would offer something new for home game systems He also confirmed that the device would not launch in fiscal year meaning that it would release after April In early June Nikkei issued a report confirming earlier rumors that the new console would feature a controller with a inch touchscreen that would give tablet like controls to games as well as a rechargeable battery and camera Project Caf was officially unveiled as the Wii U during Nintendo s press conference at E by Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aim he explained that the Wii U would be a system we will all enjoy together but also one that s tailor made for you The rumored tablet controller was also shown at this time No first party games for the Wii U were announced during the presentation but several major third party studios announced games for Wii U in a pre recorded video the possibility of a new Super Smash Bros game was teased and Electronic Arts then CEO John Riccitiello appeared on stage to discuss the company s prospective plans for products on the Wii U Prototype hardware and a series of tech demos were available to attendees showcasing gameplay concepts and the technological capabilities of the console including a The Legend of Zelda themed graphics demo and New Super Mario Bros Mii br In the two days following the unveiling of the Wii U Nintendo s stock fell nearly to levels not seen since Some analysts expressed skepticism in regards to the addition of a touch screen expressing concern that the controller would be less affordable and less innovative than the original Wii Remote When asked about whether or not the Wii U was going to support stereographic D via D televisions Iwata stated that it was not the area we are focusing on On January Iwata announced that the Wii U would be launched by the end of the shopping season in all major regions and that its final specifications would be revealed at E He also stated that the console would feature a unified online system known as Nintendo Network which would feature user account support as opposed to the use of friend codes Nintendo Network would also provide the framework for online multiplayer interactions add on content as well as online distribution of applications and video games Iwata mentioned that the Wii U GamePad would support NFC which would allow the system to wirelessly interact with figurines and cards It would also allow for microtransactions to take place wirelessly using credit cards with NFC support br On September Nintendo announced that the Wii U would launch in Japan on December Later that day Nintendo announced that the North American launch date would be November Nintendo of Europe and Nintendo Australia also announced that the Wii U would be released in both regions on November In an interview with GameSpot the next day Nintendo of America s Senior Product Marketing Manager Bill Trinen admitted that Nintendo s pre launch marketing and presentations of the Wii U had focused too much on the GamePad to the extent that some consumers mistook the device as an accessory for the existing Wii rather than a component of an entirely new platform Trinen ensured that future promotional material for the console including its packaging would emphasize both the Wii U console and GamePad br br br Release br The Wii U was originally released in two bundles the Basic bundle and the Deluxe

with Nintendo IRD and Nintendo Technology Development The MCM combines an Espresso central processing unit CPU and a Latte graphics chip GPU as well as a SEEPROM memory chip The Espresso CPU designed by IBM consists of a PowerPC based tri core processor with MB of shared L cache memory and clocked at approximately GHz Despite being based on the PowerPC the Espresso also shares some architectural concepts with the POWER architecture such as the use of eDRAM cache and being manufactured at a nm node The Latte graphics chip contains both a GX GPGPU which runs Wii U applications and a GX GPU which enables backward compatibility with Wii games The GX designed by AMD is based on the Radeon R R architecture and is clocked at approximately MHz It contains MB of eDRAM cache memory which can also act as L cache for the CPU The GX originally designed by ArtX contains a MB and a MB bank of eSRAM cache memory The Latte chip also includes a secondary custom ARM processor with KB of SRAM memory that handles system tasks in the background during gameplay or while the system is in sleep mode and dedicated hardware audio DSP module The console contains GB of DDR system memory consisting of four MB DRAM chips with a maximum bandwidth of GB s This is times the amount found in the Wii Of this GB is reserved for the operating system and is unavailable to games The memory architecture allows the CPU and GPU to access both the main DDR memory pool and the eDRAM cache memory pool on the GPU removing the need for separate dedicated memory pools The console includes either an GB Basic or GB Deluxe NA Premium WW internal eMMC flash memory expandable via SD memory cards up to GB and USB external hard disk drives up to TB The Nintendo Wii U can also use DVD RAM for extended storage

Miiverse where social interactions can also occur within the game or appear within their content such as in Splatoon where drawn posts can appear as graffiti on walls in its settings Miiverse was moderated through software filtering as well as a human resource team in order to ensure that the content shared by users is appropriate and that no spoilers are shared In order to facilitate this it was initially stated that comments posted could take up to minutes to appear on Miiverse br br br Multimedia integration br The Wii U supported online video services through apps such as Amazon Video

exclusively for use with Super Smash Bros for Wii U and does not support any other Wii or Wii U games br br br Development tools br The Nintendo Web Framework unveiled in is a toolset that uses modern web technology WebKit HTML and JavaScript to simplify the process of porting games to the Wii U s GamePad and TV It was designed to make web based games easier to port to the system than it would to code specifically for the Wii U Nintendo also released a custom Unity package to allow game developers to quickly make games on Unity for the Wii U These tools are no longer available on the Nintendo Developer Portal however users who have these tools downloaded are still able to use them br br br Reception br John Teti of The A V Club s Gameological Society considers the Wii U a compelling video game system which lacks focus citing Nintendo Land as ideas act ing in service of the technology Ben Gilbert of Engadget states that Nintendo delivers on its promise of releasing a modern HD gaming

achievements the ability to play non game disc based media and a game controller that lasts only hours and stated that he could not give a complete assessment of the console with online components such as Nintendo TVii missing at launch Similarly TechRadar praised the system s GamePad functionality and HD graphics but criticized the limited battery power on the GamePad and the insufficient number of top tier launch games Some industry figures do not consider the Wii U to be an eighth generation console with many citing the hardware s processing speed However Fils Aim has noted that similar comments were made in when the Wii first launched Following the launch of other eighth generation consoles the PlayStation and Xbox One in November some critics suggested that the Wii U would continue to struggle as it lacked the third party support of its rivals In a December article Chris Suellentrop of The New York Times argued that the Wii U was the only new console with a video game worth playing Super Mario D World which he described as being the best Mario game in years Despite the praise he noted that one great game won t save a console and although other games exist on the Wii U he admitted that its original lineup was still pretty thin Time writer Matt Peckham said that the Wii U was the system of choice to pick up during that Christmas season praising the console s game lineup affordable price Off TV Play the absence of subscription fees for its online services backward compatibility and media features However he noted that the system still needs a price cut and an improved first and third party software lineup CNET also noted that the Wii U had a better lineup of games and lower price in comparison to its competitors mainly due to its one year head start br br br Sales br br By December Nintendo reported life time sales of million Wii U console units and by September million software units worldwide br br br Launch br During its first week of release in

down from the three months prior During the second quarter of Nintendo reported that consoles and million software units were shipped worldwide br br br Loss of support br In May Electronic Arts

titles for the Nintendo console but not anywhere near as many as we are for PlayStation or Xbox At E Ubisoft revealed that it was not going to make any more exclusives for the Wii U until sales of the console improved though it stated shortly thereafter that it was still a big supporter of the Wii U and planned to release as many Wii U games in as it did in In July Bethesda Softworks announced that it had no games in development for the Wii U with Bethesda VP of PR and marketing Pete Hines explaining It depends on the games that we are making and how we think it aligns with that console and how the hardware aligns with the other stuff we are making This explanation was later refined to being largely due to the hardware Contrarily Activision has stated that it will do everything they can to support the system At the end of July Asda the second largest supermarket chain in the UK confirmed that it had no plans to stock the Wii U but would still stock games on a title by title merit basis Despite this many specialist retailers continued to emphasize their support with Game CEO Martyn Gibbs saying We fully support all Nintendo products including Wii U br br br Price cut and first party

launches br br br Legacy br The future of the Wii U was left unclear with Nintendo s announcement of a new console platform codenamed NX which was scheduled to be launched worldwide in March Nintendo stated that NX would have a brand new concept and not be a direct successor to the Wii U or DS product lines in an interview with the Asahi Shimbun company president Tatsumi Kimishima reiterated this position and stated that while he thinks that the Wii U business would slow after the release of NX he felt that the console would have a larger impact than the Wii U The announcement that The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild was in development for both Wii U and NX further supported Nintendo s view of the console as being a new product line rather than a replacement for its existing hardware In a shareholders report in July Kimishima and Miyamoto stated that they had expected the Wii U to sell one hundred million units comparable to the success of the Wii but with only thirteen million units sold worldwide they would now need to rely on NX to make up for losses on Wii U sales br The new platform now known as the Nintendo Switch was officially announced on October it is a tablet like hybrid video game console with detachable controllers and the ability to be placed in a docking station with an output to allow games to be played on a television Although it is a hybrid device

already been sent out br In an interview with Time Magazine in January Reggie Fils Aim commented that the system was a necessary step in order to get to Nintendo Switch Fils Aim also compared the system to the GameCube claiming that the Wii U will be remembered fondly despite its relatively poor sales Fils Aim stated that the commercial failure of the Wii U specifically the lack of clarity of the Wii U GamePad s function and the lack of support from third party publishers to build out its software library led to how they changed the marketing and promotion for the Switch He said the Switch s promotion was developed to make it crystal clear what the proposition is for the systems and that they had strong support from large and small software developers and publishers to support the new console br In mid January Fils Aim told Polygon that Breath of the Wild which would ship at launch with the Switch in March would be Nintendo s final first party game for the Wii U Nintendo formally announced that production of the Wii U had ended worldwide on January Despite this the console had third party releases until Most of the Wii U s popular exclusive games have been re released on the
