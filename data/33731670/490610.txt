title: Sixth generation of video game consoles
id: 490610
In the history of video games the sixth generation era in rare occasions called the bit era see bits and system power below is the era of computer and video games video game consoles and handheld gaming devices available at the turn of the st century starting on November Platforms in the sixth generation include consoles from four companies the Sega Dreamcast DC Sony PlayStation PS Nintendo GameCube GC and Microsoft Xbox This era began on November with the Japanese release of the Dreamcast which was joined by the PlayStation on March the GameCube on September and the Xbox on November respectively On March the Dreamcast was among the first to be discontinued Xbox in GameCube in and PlayStation was the last in January Meanwhile the seventh generation of consoles started on November with the launch of the Xbox br The major innovation of this generation was of full utilization of the internet to allow a fully online gaming experience While the prior generation had some systems with internet connectivity such as the Apple Pippin these had little market penetration and thus had limited success in the area Services such as Microsoft s Xbox Live became industry standard in this and future generations Other innovations of the Xbox was its being the first system with an internal ethernet port and the first to utilize an internal hard disk drive to store game data This led to many improvements to the gaming experience including the ability to store program data rather than just save game data that allowed for faster load times as well as the ability to download games directly from the internet rather than to purchase physical media such as a disk or cartridge Soon after its release other systems like the Sony PlayStation produced peripheral storage devices to allow similar capabilities and by the next generation internal storage became industry standard br Bit ratings i e bit or bit for the previous generation for most consoles largely fell by the wayside during this era with the notable exceptions being promotions for the Dreamcast and PS that advertised bit graphics at the start of the generation The number of bits cited in this way in console names refers to the CPU word size and had been used by hardware marketing departments as a show of power for many years However there is little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond or bits because once this level is reached performance depends on more varied factors such as processor clock speed bandwidth and memory size br The sixth generation of handhelds began with the release of the Bandai s WonderSwan launched in Japan in Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in of the Game Boy Advance which featured many upgrades and new features over the Game Boy The Game Boy Advance was discontinued in early The next generation of handheld consoles began in November with the North American introduction of the Nintendo DS br The last official Dreamcast games were released in North America and Europe and Japan The last GameCube games were released in Japan and North America and Europe The last Xbox games were released in Japan and Europe and North America Pro Evolution Soccer was the last game for the PlayStation in Europe which was released in November The last PS game Final Fantasy XI Rhapsodies of Vana diel was released in May marking the end of this generation br br br Home systems br br The Sony PlayStation br achieved sales dominance in this generation becoming the best selling console in history with over million units sold as of February The Microsoft Xbox had sold over million units as of May and the GameCube had sold million units as of September The Sega Dreamcast which arrived prior to all of the others and was discontinued in came in fourth with million sold br The sixth generation began to end when the Xbox was succeeded by the Xbox in late GameCube hardware was still being produced when the Wii was released in late but as of June had also been ceased PlayStation sales continued to be strong through to the end of due to the system s large software library continuing software support and affordable price br In February the PlayStation outsold both the PlayStation and Xbox in the United States Games were still being produced for the PlayStation Xbox and GameCube as of while Dreamcast games were officially discontinued in There were still a few games being produced for the Dreamcast in but they are essentially NAOMI arcade ports released only in Japan with small print runs The PlayStation was still being produced after the launch of the Wii U in making the sixth generation the second longest generation of all time br br br Dreamcast br br Sega s Dreamcast is the first console of the generation and had several features to show an advantage from the competition including Internet gaming as an optional feature through its built in modem and a web browser br The console is credited with restoring Sega s reputation which had been damaged by the earlier failures of the Sega Saturn Sega X Genesis Nomad and Sega CD Despite this the Dreamcast was discontinued prematurely due to numerous factors The impending and much hyped PlayStation slowed Dreamcast sales mostly due to the fact that the PlayStation had a built in DVD player and a huge number of PS owners looking to upgrade to the new backward compatible console In addition Sega s short lived support success of its post Mega Drive products the Mega CD X and Saturn had left developers and customers skeptical with some holding out to see whether the Dreamcast or PlayStation would come out on top br Sega s decision to implement a GD ROM though publicly advertised as a CD ROM for storage medium did save costs but it did not compare well against the PS s much touted DVD capabilities Sega was either unable or unwilling to spend the advertising money necessary to compete with Sony who themselves took massive losses on the PlayStation to gain market share With the announcements of the Xbox and GameCube in late Sega s console was considered by some to be outdated only two years after its release The previous losses from the Saturn X and Sega Mega CD stagnation of sales due to the PlayStation and impending competition from Microsoft and Nintendo caused Sega s revenue to shrink and announce their intention on killing the system in early dropping the system entirely and leaving the console market in early in Japan and much earlier in other countries Sega also announced it would shut down SegaNet an online gaming community that supported online capable Dreamcast titles Due to user outcry over the decision Sega delayed the service s closure by an additional months Since the Dreamcast s discontinuation Sega transitioned to software developing making games as a third party company br br br PlayStation br br The brand Sony had established with the original PlayStation was a major factor in the PlayStation s dominance both in terms of securing a consumer base and attracting third party developers with the gradual increase in one reinforcing the other The PlayStation was also able to play DVDs and was backward compatible with PlayStation games which many say helped the former s sales Sony Computer Entertainment secured licensing for key games such as Final Fantasy X Grand Theft Auto III and Metal Gear Solid Sons of Liberty enabling the PS to outperform its competitors launches The console ended up becoming the top selling console of this generation while its competing consoles the Xbox and the GameCube went on to be modestly successful consoles br br br GameCube br br Nintendo struggled with conflicting brand images particularly the family friendly one developed during the s Its arsenal of franchises and history in the industry though earning it a loyal fan base failed to give it an advantage against the Xbox and PlayStation which captured audiences seeking Mature titles of which Nintendo had fewer Nintendo also made little headway into online gaming releasing a small handful of online capable games the most popular of which was Phantasy Star Online Episode I and II which was an enhanced port of the Dreamcast game with various new features and content instead emphasizing Game Boy Advance connectivity As a result the GameCube failed to match the sales of its predecessor the Nintendo but the console wasn t a financial failure Nintendo did however rejuvenate its relationship with many developers often working in close collaboration with them to produce games based upon its franchises in contrast to the past where it was frequently seen as bullying developers in the late s back when the Nintendo Entertainment System was out on the market As a result the GameCube had more first and second party releases than its competitors whose most successful titles were mainly products of third party developers br br br Xbox br br Although the Xbox had the formidable financial backing of Microsoft it was unable to significantly threaten the dominance of the PlayStation as market leader However the Xbox attracted a large fanbase and strong third party support in the United States and Europe and became a recognizable brand amongst the mainstream The Xbox Live online service with its centralized model proved particularly successful prompting Sony to boost the online capabilities of the PlayStation Xbox Live also gave the Xbox an edge over the GameCube which had a near total lack of online games The flagship of Xbox Live was the game Halo which was the best selling Xbox game with over million copies sold worldwide However the Xbox failed to gain a following in Japan with reasons cited including lack of brand recognition lack of commitment to the console from Japanese publishers and developers failure of Microsoft staff to fully understand important cultural differences and ethnocentric preferences of the Japanese public for native products br br br Comparison br br br Worldwide sales standings br br br Other consoles br These consoles were created for the mass market like the consoles listed above However they are less often noted never saw a worldwide release and or have sold fewer units overall and are therefore listed as Other br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Bits and system power br Bit ratings for consoles largely fell by the wayside after the fifth generation bit era The number of bits cited in console names referred to the CPU word size but there was little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond bits performance depended on other factors such as central processing unit speed graphics processing unit speed channel capacity data storage size and memory speed latency and size br The importance of the number of bits in the modern console gaming market has thus decreased due to the use of components that process data in varying word sizes Previously console manufacturers advertised the n bit talk to overemphasize the hardware capabilities of their system The Dreamcast and the PlayStation were the last systems to use the term bit in their marketing to describe their capability br It is not easy to compare the relative power of the different systems Having a larger CPU word size does not necessarily make one console more powerful than another Likewise the operating frequency clock rate measured in terms of Hertz of a system s CPU is not an accurate measure of performance either except between systems of the same or similar architecture br The Microsoft Xbox uses a bit general purpose CISC x architecture CPU with an instruction set equal to that of the Coppermine core Mobile Celeron though it has less cache kB than the PC equivalent It has MB RAM shared and runs at MHz Because the Pentium introduced SSE the Xbox also had bit SIMD capabilities Its NV A GPU which is very similar to the GeForce series of desktop GPUs makes it the only console in its time with traditional vertex and pixel shaders br The GameCube s CPU is a PowerPC CPU codenamed Gekko that runs at MHz and was built by IBM Its graphics processor codenamed Flipper is comparable to the original ATI Radeon The console has MB of non unified memory MB of T SRAM MB embedded T SRAM and MB DRAM br The PlayStation s CPU known as the bit Emotion Engine has a bit core with a bit FPU Coupled to two bit Vector Units this hybrid R CPU is based on MIPS architecture The PS also has an internal Channel DMA Bus which is fully bits wide Paths between the Emotion Engine RAM and the Graphics Synthesizer GS are also bits wide The PS s unique hardware arrangement with no less than processing units were difficult to come to grips with Many developers struggled initially with programming the hardware The PS s Graphics Synthesizer GS has fast dedicated video memory though it is limited in the amount of data it can hold The Channel bit wide DMA bus could pump data to GS Memory as fast as the screen could update Consequently with the main memory being limited to MB many of the PS s games have reduced textures compared with versions for other consoles It also does not have a hardware dedicated transform and lighting unit like the ones found in the Xbox and GameCube GPUs br However the PS s design allows a remarkable degree of flexibility and choice For example program control and general arithmetic could be handled by the CPU while the Vector Units and could provide parallel processing of physics clipping and transform and lighting to the scene The Vector units were noted to be so versatile that Shadow of The Colossus used one of the vector units to do full Pixel shading for the fur of the Collossi br The Dreamcast has a bit double precision superscalar SuperH RISC Central processing unit core with a bit integer unit using bit fixed length instructions a bit data bus allowing a variable width of either or bits and a bit floating point bus The PowerVR DC CLX chipset uses a unique method of rendering a D scene called Tile Based Deferred Rendering TBDR while storing polygons in triangle strip format in memory the display is split into tiles associated with a list of visibly overlapping triangles onto which using a process similar to ray tracing rays are cast and a pixel is rendered from the triangle closest to the camera After calculating the depths associated with each polygon for one tile row in cycle the whole tile is flushed to video memory before passing on to render the next tile Once all information has been collated for the current frame the tiles are rendered in turn to produce the final image br br br Handheld systems br br During the sixth generation era the handheld game console market expanded with the introduction of new devices from many different manufacturers Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in of the Game Boy Advance which featured many upgrades and new features over the Game Boy Two redesigns of this system followed the Game Boy Advance SP in and the Game Boy Micro in Also introduced was the Bandai s WonderSwan launched in Japan in South Korean company Game Park introduced its GP handheld in and with it came the dawn of open source handheld consoles The Game Boy Advance line of handhelds has sold million units worldwide as of September br A major new addition to the market was the trend for corporations to include a large number of non gaming features into their handheld consoles including cell phones MP players portable movie players and PDA like features The handheld that started this trend was Nokia s N Gage which was released in and doubled primarily as a mobile phone It went through a redesign in and was renamed the N Gage QD A second handheld the Zodiac from Tapwave was released in based on the Palm OS it offered specialized gaming oriented video and sound capabilities but it had an unwieldy development kit due to the underlying Palm OS foundation br A fairly uncommon handheld of the th generation was the vtech V SMILE Pocket A handheld version of their V SMILE home console br With more and more PDAs arriving during the previous generation the difference between consumer electronics and traditional computing began to blur and cheap console technology grew as a result It was said of PDAs that they were the computers of handheld gaming because of their multi purpose capabilities and the increasingly powerful computer hardware that resided within them This capability existed to move gaming beyond the last generation s bit limitations however PDAs were still geared towards the typical businessman and lacked new affordable software franchises to compete with dedicated handheld gaming consoles br br br Handheld comparison br br Note First year of release is the first year of the system s worldwide availability br br br Other handhelds br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Sales br br br Trends br br br Market convergence br Major publishers such as Activision Electronic Arts and Ubisoft adopted a cross platform strategy releasing versions of their games for PC all major consoles and in some cases handhelds as well The sixth generation was the first to help console and computer software grow closer together as well as outperform the arcade market in features graphics and business The Dreamcast which had an official Windows CE Development Kit to help porting games from PCs to Dreamcast and the Xbox which was made from off the shelf PC parts and hosted many PC ports factored into this also br br br Controversial games br br While the sixth generation was not the first to have its share of controversial games this generation was noted to have extensive criticism by public figures of objectionable content in gaming such as sex crime violence profanity drug use and social propaganda as well as topics of debate such as religion politics and economics br The sixth generation was also notable because it saw the continuation of lawmakers taking actions against the video game industry The most famous were Rockstar Games Manhunt and Grand Theft Auto games Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto Vice City facing lawsuits over alleged racial slurs and influencing minors to commit crimes while Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was briefly given an adult rating and removed from most stores over the availability of an abandoned sex mini game using the Hot Coffee mod br The sixth generation also coincided with the September attacks in New York City and the Pentagon which had a huge impact on the entertainment industry including the video game industry in the subsequent market climate multiple games were edited in response to the sensitivity surrounding the event Prior to its release Metal Gear Solid Sons of Liberty depicted a submersible mobile fortress hijacked by terrorists destroying a good portion of Manhattan in view of the twin towers this can be found in the Document of Metal Gear Solid making of feature Similarly several undisclosed modifications were made in Grand Theft Auto III such as a change to the police cars color scheme the old scheme resembled that of NYPD s older blue and white design and altered cover art the European release featured the original artwork Rockstar Games estimates that the changes amounted to in changed content The Dreamcast game Propeller Arena was never officially released possibly due to a certain level which was visually very similar to the September attacks br br br Emulation and retro gaming br br Because of the increased computing power of video game consoles and the widespread usage of emulators the sixth generation saw the rise of console emulation and retro gaming on a vast scale Many games for older systems were updated with superior graphics or sound and re released for current consoles Commonly emulated games included those released for the Nintendo Entertainment System the Super Nintendo Entertainment System the Mega Drive Genesis the PlayStation the PS can play PS games natively and the Nintendo br Also during this generation the computing power of handheld consoles became capable of supporting games made for some of the earliest gaming consoles and several companies released remakes of classic games for the handhelds Nintendo introduced a line of NES and SNES games for its Game Boy Advance handheld including remakes such as Final Fantasy I II Dawn of Souls and Nintendo s Metroid Zero Mission Also an increasing number of third party developers including Midway Games Capcom Namco Atari Tecmo and Sega released anthology collections of some of their old games Additionally many video games and video game series that were originally confined to Japan were released in North America and Europe for the first time br br br Rise of online gaming br br Online gaming which in previous generations had been almost an exclusive domain of PC games became more prominent in video game consoles during this generation The Dreamcast initiated this change with its built in modem internet browsing software and ability to play certain games online The PlayStation Xbox and GameCube also offered online gaming though their approaches and commitment to it varied greatly The Xbox offered an integrated service called Xbox Live that cost per year and was only compatible with a broadband internet connection Its ability to connect gamers for online multi player matches and its ideal experience was a considerable factor in allowing the Xbox to gain a foothold in the western market especially in the first person shooter genre The PlayStation left its online gaming service up to each individual game publisher and though it was free to use it was not always an ideal experience especially with games published by small developers The SOCOM series was one of the most popular online competitive games for the PS The GameCube did not offer online play for any of its first party titles with only Sega s Phantasy Star Online series and Homeland making official use of the console s online capabilities In addition online capability was not out of the box an adapter was needed to hook the GameCube to the internet br br br Mergers br Many game publishing companies with a long established history merged with their competitors Microsoft bought second party developer Rare in Square merged with Enix to form Square Enix in and then later bought Taito Sega merged with Sammy to form Sega Sammy Holdings in Konami bought a majority share of Hudson Soft Namco merged with Bandai to form Bandai Namco Holdings in br br br Software br br br Milestone titles br Burnout Takedown
