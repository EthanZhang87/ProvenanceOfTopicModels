be merged into other game styles such as having Boos in Super Mario Bros br In addition to traditional Mario elements such as Goombas warp pipes and power ups players can uniquely manipulate the behavior of elements For example enemies can be stacked hazards can emerge from question blocks and warp pipes shells can be worn as protective helmets and cannons can emit chosen objects These new combinations are enabled by editing tools working in tandem Players can enlarge an enemy with a Super Mushroom give an enemy a pair of flying wings combine different attributes and more The Soundfrog adds audiovisual effects though microphone recorded sounds are removed from uploaded courses New editing elements are unlocked gradually across nine days of course creation The Mystery Mushroom exclusive to the Super Mario Bros theme has the power up of a Super Mushroom and dresses Mario in one of costumes Each of these costumes can be unlocked by playing through the Mario Challenge by

Before developing Super Mario Maker Nintendo had previously explored the concept of a video game editor in the s The company filed a patent in for console hardware allowing players to pause a game edit parts of the game resume gameplay and to save and share the changes Super Mario Maker was conceived as a tool for Nintendo s internal development team to make Mario levels The team however quickly realized the tool s potential as a standalone game and pitched the idea to senior game designer Takashi Tezuka Meanwhile Tezuka had been wanting to make a Wii U follow up to Mario Paint that used the Wii U GamePad Upon seeing the Super Mario Maker tool Tezuka realized that a course making tool was more marketable than a mere art program He noted to Polygon that building courses is not as difficult or out of reach as drawing is but that he was inspired to bring the fun of Mario Paint into this course editor This game is the directorial debut of Yosuke Oshino who previously worked as a programmer on Pikmin Pikmin and New Super Mario Bros Wii The game s soundtrack was composed and arranged by Koji Kondo Naoto Kubo and Asuka Hayazaki br The game was announced at E with the title Mario

Reception br br br Critical Reception br Super Mario Maker received generally favorable reviews IGN s Jose Otero praised the game s social elements including its online features and the Mario Challenge stating that players would see a genuine reverence for Mario s history in the online modes He praised the course editor and its user interface writing that n o matter which style you choose creating levels is an intimidating task but the well designed interface makes learning easy and intuitive and that it gives us a fun flexible toolbox to build and play Mario courses like never before br GameSpot s Justin Haywald praised the course editor stating that the mix and match nature of gameplay elements allows for exciting and anachronistic additions to familiar scenarios He was disappointed in particular limitations such as the absence of checkpoints originating Super Mario World and the vertical and horizontal limits of stages He ultimately concluded that the game won t necessarily turn you into the next Shigeru Miyamoto but you can almost feel a little bit of that magic rubbing off every time you upload a new creation br Polygon s Griffin McElroy praised the game saying he had a tremendous amount of fun playing but the way it developed that newfound appreciation for something I ve known my whole life was the game s biggest accomplishment br br br Community br The increasingly rich online library of user generated content has been individually showcased and praised by reviewers and has been praised by Mario series co creator Takashi Tezuka He described Nintendo s overall restraint in the gameplay difficulty of its own content in the interest of mass appeal He expressed both appreciation and caution for the fact that the users do not necessarily share the same restraint in their creations br br I expected that the users who wanted to play more of the hard courses would be attracted to Super Mario Maker It was quite a surprise how much fun it was to watch the videos without even playing myself There are so many intriguing and inventive courses like one which you couldn t beat if you picked up a mushroom It s been a huge motivation for us developers to do better br The game would contribute to a resurgence in the Kaizo level designing community which creates extremely difficult levels to test patience and skill br Many players criticized Nintendo for removing their online courses without warning or explanation Patrick Klepek of Kotaku wrote that Nintendo should have made sure anyone creating levels for the game was aware of the company s strict policies regarding level creation so they would know what Nintendo would not find acceptable br br In May Nintendo announced that more than million courses had been created
