title: Romanization of Japanese
id: 26263954
The romanization of Japanese is the use of Latin script to write the Japanese language This method of writing is sometimes referred to in Japanese as r maji lit Roman letters o ma d i or o ma d i br Japanese is normally written in a combination of logographic characters borrowed from Chinese kanji and syllabic scripts kana that also ultimately derive from Chinese characters br There are several different romanization systems The three main ones are Hepburn romanization Kunrei shiki romanization ISO and Nihon shiki romanization ISO Strict Variants of the Hepburn system are the most widely used br Romanized Japanese may be used in any context where Japanese text is targeted at non Japanese speakers who cannot read kanji or kana such as for names on street signs and passports and in dictionaries and textbooks for foreign learners of the language It is also used to transliterate Japanese terms in text written in English or other languages that use the Latin script on topics related to Japan such as linguistics literature history and culture br All Japanese who have attended elementary school since World War II have been taught to read and write romanized Japanese Therefore almost all Japanese can read and write Japanese by using r maji However it is extremely rare in Japan to use it to write Japanese except as an input tool on a computer or for special purposes like in some logo design and most Japanese are more comfortable in reading kanji and kana br br br History br The earliest Japanese romanization system was based on Portuguese orthography It was developed around by a Japanese Catholic named Anjir Jesuit priests used the system in a series of printed Catholic books so that missionaries could preach and teach their converts without learning to read Japanese orthography The most useful of these books for the study of early modern Japanese pronunciation and early attempts at romanization was the Nippo jisho a Japanese Portuguese dictionary written in In general the early Portuguese system was similar to Nihon shiki in its treatment of vowels Some consonants were transliterated differently for instance the k consonant was rendered depending on context as either c or q and the consonant now pronounced h except before u as f and so Nihon no kotoba The language of Japan was spelled Nifon no cotoba The Jesuits also printed some secular books in romanized Japanese including the first printed edition of the Japanese classic The Tale of the Heike romanized as Feiqe no monogatari and a collection of Aesop s Fables romanized as Esopo no fabulas The latter continued to be printed and read after the suppression of Christianity in Japan Chibbett br From the mid th century onward several systems were developed culminating in the Hepburn system named after James Curtis Hepburn who used it in the third edition of his Japanese English dictionary published in The Hepburn system included representation of some sounds that have since changed For example Lafcadio Hearn s book Kwaidan shows the older kw pronunciation in modern Hepburn romanization this would be written Kaidan lit ghost tales br br br As a replacement for the Japanese writing system br In the Meiji era some Japanese scholars advocated abolishing the Japanese writing system entirely and using r maji instead The Nihon shiki romanization was an outgrowth of that movement Several Japanese texts were published entirely in r maji during this period but it failed to catch on Later in the early th century some scholars devised syllabary systems with characters derived from Latin rather like the Cherokee syllabary that were even less popular since they were not based on any historical use of the Latin script br Today the use of Nihon shiki for writing Japanese is advocated by the Oomoto sect and some independent organizations During the Allied occupation of Japan the government of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers SCAP made it official policy to romanize Japanese However that policy failed and a more moderate attempt at Japanese script reform followed br br br Modern systems br br br Hepburn br br Hepburn romanization generally follows English phonology with Romance vowels It is an intuitive method of showing Anglophones the pronunciation of a word in Japanese It was standardized in the United States as American National Standard System for the Romanization of Japanese Modified Hepburn but that status was abolished on October Hepburn is the most common romanization system in use today especially in the English speaking world br The Revised Hepburn system of romanization uses a macron to indicate some long vowels and an apostrophe to note the separation of easily confused phonemes usually syllabic n from a following naked vowel or semivowel For example the name is written with the kana characters ju n i chi ro u and romanized as Jun ichir in Revised Hepburn Without the apostrophe it would not be possible to distinguish this correct reading from the incorrect ju ni chi ro u This system is widely used in Japan and among foreign students and academics br br br Nihon shiki br br Nihon shiki romanization was originally invented as a method for Japanese to write their own language in Latin characters rather than to transcribe it for Westerners as Hepburn was It follows the Japanese syllabary very strictly with no adjustments for changes in pronunciation It has also been standardized as ISO Strict Also known as Nippon shiki rendered in the Nihon shiki style of romanization the name is either Nihon siki or Nippon siki br br br Kunrei shiki br br Kunrei shiki romanization is a slightly modified version of Nihon shiki which eliminates differences between the kana syllabary and modern pronunciation For example the characters and are pronounced identically in modern Japanese and thus Kunrei shiki and Hepburn ignore the difference in kana and represent the sound in the same way zu Nihon shiki on the other hand will romanize as du but as zu Similarly for the pair and they are both zi in Kunrei shiki and ji in Hepburn but are zi and di respectively in Nihon shiki See the table below for full details br Kunrei shiki has been standardized by the Japanese Government and the International Organization for Standardization as ISO Kunrei shiki is taught to Japanese elementary school students in their fourth year of education br Written in Kunrei shiki the name of the system would be rendered Kunreisiki br br br Other variants br It is possible to elaborate these romanizations to enable non native speakers to pronounce Japanese words more correctly Typical additions include tone marks to note the Japanese pitch accent and diacritic marks to distinguish phonological changes such as the assimilation of the moraic nasal see Japanese phonology br br br JSL br br JSL is a romanization system based on Japanese phonology designed using the linguistic principles used by linguists in designing writing systems for languages that do not have any It is a purely phonemic system using exactly one symbol for each phoneme and marking the pitch accent using diacritics It was created for Eleanor Harz Jorden s system of Japanese language teaching Its principle is that such a system enables students to internalize the phonology of Japanese better Since it does not have any of the other systems advantages for non native speakers and the Japanese already have a writing system for their language JSL is not widely used outside the educational environment br br br Non standard romanization br In addition to the standardized systems above there are many variations in romanization used either for simplification in error or confusion between different systems or for deliberate stylistic reasons br Notably the various mappings that Japanese input methods use to convert keystrokes on a Roman keyboard to kana often combine features of all of the systems when used as plain text rather than being converted these are usually known as w puro r maji W puro is a blend of w do purosess word processor Unlike the standard systems w puro r maji requires no characters from outside the ASCII character set br While there may be arguments in favour of some of these variant romanizations in specific contexts their use especially if mixed leads to confusion when romanized Japanese words are indexed This confusion never occurs when inputting Japanese characters with a word processor because input Latin letters are transliterated into Japanese kana as soon as the IME processes what character is input br br br Long vowels br In addition the following three non Hepburn r maji hi Hebon shiki r maji methods of representing long vowels are authorized by the Japanese Foreign Ministry for use in passports br br oh for or Hepburn br oo for or This is valid JSL romanization For Hepburn romanization it is not a valid romanization if the long vowel belongs within a single word br ou for This is also an example of w puro r maji br br br Example words written in each romanization system br br br Differences among romanizations br This chart shows in full the three main systems for the romanization of Japanese Hepburn Nihon shiki and Kunrei shiki br br This chart shows the significant differences among them Despite the International Phonetic Alphabet the j sound in and are never romanized with the letter J br br br Spacing br Japanese is written without spaces between words and in some cases such as compounds it may not be completely clear where word boundaries should lie resulting in varying romanization styles For example meaning to marry and composed of the noun kekkon marriage combined with suru to do is romanized as one word kekkonsuru by some authors but two words kekkon suru by others br br br Kana without standardized forms of romanization br There is no universally accepted style of romanization for the smaller versions of the vowels and y row kana when used outside the normal combinations etc nor for the sokuon or small tsu kana when it is not directly followed by a consonant Although these are usually regarded as merely phonetic marks or diacritics they do sometimes appear on their own such as at the end of sentences in exclamations or in some names The detached sokuon representing a final glottal stop in exclamations is sometimes represented as an apostrophe or as t for example might be written as a or at br br br Historical romanizations br Vocabvlario da Lingoa de Iapam br Arte da
