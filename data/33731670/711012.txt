When the editors later sought to dissolve their commitments with the original publisher Images Interculturelles represented by Alix Laurent they bought out the publisher and changed the magazine s name to Vice in br Richard Szalwinski a Canadian software millionaire acquired the magazine and relocated the operation to New York City in the late s Following the relocation the magazine quickly developed a reputation for provocative and politically incorrect content Under Szalwinski s ownership a few retail stores were opened in New York City and customers could purchase fashion items that were advertised in the magazine However due to the end of the dot com bubble the three founders eventually regained ownership of the Vice brand followed by closure of the stores br The British edition

cuts br br br Staff br Shane Smith co founder br Suroosh Alvi co founder br Ellis Jones editor in chief br br br Content br br br Scope br Vice magazine includes the work of journalists columnists fiction writers graphic artists and cartoonists and photographers Both Vice s online and magazine content has shifted from dealing mostly with independent arts and pop cultural matters to covering more serious news topics Due to the large array of contributors and the fact that often writers will only submit a small number of articles with the publication Vice s content varies dramatically and its political and cultural stance is often unclear or contradictory Articles on the site feature a range of subjects often things not covered as by mainstream media The magazine s editors have championed the immersionist school of journalism which has been passed to other properties of Vice Media such as the documentary television show Balls Deep on the Viceland Channel This style of journalism is regarded as something of a DIY antithesis to the methods practiced by mainstream news outlets and has published an entire issue of articles written in accordance with this ethos Entire issues of the magazine have also been dedicated to the concerns of Iraqi people Native Americans Russian people people with mental disorders and people with mental disabilities Vice also publishes an annual guide for students in the United Kingdom br br In a Vice announcement was published on the Internet After umpteen years of putting out what amounted to a reference book every month we started

putting in them br br br Politics br In a March interview with The Guardian Smith was asked about the magazine s political allegiances and he stated We re not trying to say anything politically in a

From its beginnings as Voice of Montreal Vice had a reputation for provocation In Vice was described as gonzo journalism for the YouTube generation As the magazine grew into a broader media brand it

face controversy In the magazine retracted parts of a fashion spread entitled Last Words which depicted female writers killing themselves Also in Vice again gained unwelcome attention when the then
