br North America br In a registration program titled My Nintendo not to be confused with the loyalty program of the same name My Nintendo began in North America It allowed consumers to register their games and consoles online using a printed code included with the products with no direct physical rewards or benefits for doing so Questions began being raised over Club Nintendo s conspicuous absence in the region by In then vice president of Marketing and Corporate Affairs for Nintendo of America Inc NOA Perrin Kaplan stated that the inclusion area of the United States is much larger than all the other Club Nintendo countries and that the program was considered prohibitively expensive to set up Kaplan also said that the company considered the pre order bonuses and game registration promos it offered were an alternative to Club Nintendo Nintendo of America ultimately relented due to customer demand and announced a Club Nintendo program for North America in October br The program was launched on December retiring the My Nintendo registration program The site experienced high traffic at its initial launch resulting in login problems and slow load times for users It was taken offline on December reopening almost a week later on December with noticeable infrastructure improvements The North America catalog was developed in conjunction with Nintendo Australia and uses Coins instead of Stars br Program participants who meet Coin Gold or Coin Platinum benchmarks within the Club Nintendo year July June also receive exclusive items Platinum Rewards are usually premium items such as plush hats or posters However in there were no physical rewards for either Platinum or Gold instead a selection of Wii DS games which were already released on the eShop were offered In the past some of the most notable Platinum Member rewards were a special standalone WiiWare version of Punch Out titled Doc Louis s Punch Out and a plastic statuette featuring the main characters from the Mario games An advertisement for this was made in Punch Out on the Wii where if the player was losing Doc Louis would say Join The Nintendo Fun uh I mean Club Nintendo today Mac This has been made a popular internet joke br In Nintendo of America started offering download codes for downloadable games as rewards available for the Nintendo DS and the Wii U consoles as well as the Wii or the Wii U

website catalogue and product registration going live on March using the same system offered by Nintendo of Europe Nintendo Australia asserted that the Australian Club Nintendo reward catalogue would be unique from that of Club Nintendo Europe and Club Nintendo Japan and was developed in conjunction with Nintendo of America However unlike its North American counterpart the Australian service used Stars instead of Coins the same as its European counterpart br Most games either distributed or published by Nintendo Australia after Mario Kart Wii contained a card that allows buyers to register their games for Club Nintendo points br Club Nintendo Australia was available for both Australians and New Zealanders as Nintendo Australia manages Nintendo s operations in New Zealand as well br br br South Africa br Club Nintendo launched in South Africa in June br br br Other br Club Nintendo was also the name given to a customer service program operating in Spain in the s Players buying a

their name an associate number the image of Mario and Nintendo s logo The main purpose of this was to receive telephone support about clues and tricks on how to progress through the games and being able to receive the Club Nintendo magazine for free during a year br br br Criticism br Some criticism came from the fact that the Nintendo of Europe Stars Catalogue was only available to members in the United Kingdom and Ireland the Netherlands Germany Belgium France Spain Italy and later Portugal and Russia Bergsala which was responsible for all Nintendo related distribution in Scandinavia closed down Club Nintendo in the region at the end of the year because it was not economically viable to keep it going br In the American Club Nintendo came under fire for offering only digital games for its Platinum and Gold members who need to spend much money to get to that position and were offered games they had already purchased During the same timeframe news sites repeatedly pointed out that Nintendo of America s offerings were much smaller than those of Europe and Japan Digital Downloads were only available on the European UK Club Nintendo from the middle of March compared to the American Club Nintendo that had them for two additional months br br br Discontinuation br On January Nintendo announced that it would be discontinuing Club Nintendo in all regions during the year and succeeding it with a new loyalty program that the company has named My Nintendo Prior to this announcement in September the company had major changes done to the Japanese edition of Club Nintendo including abolishing member rank and making hardware ineligible for registration including the then upcoming New Nintendo DS This was later partially reflected on the Australian Club Nintendo as members could not register the New Nintendo DS either which was available in the region since November Throughout the North American Club Nintendo was experiencing a great lack of physical rewards compared to other regions br In North America on February Nintendo released a final batch of games with titles with the Club Nintendo exclusive title Grill Off with Ultra Hand which was previously
