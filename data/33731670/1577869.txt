Super Smash Bros is a crossover platform fighting game series published by Nintendo The series was created by Masahiro Sakurai who has directed every game in the series The series is known for its unique gameplay objective which differs from that of traditional fighters in that the aim is to increase damage counters and knock opponents off the stage instead of depleting life bars br The original Super Smash Bros was released in for the Nintendo The series achieved even greater success with the release of Super Smash Bros Melee which was released in for the GameCube and became the best selling game on that system A third installment Super Smash Bros Brawl was released in for the Wii Although HAL Laboratory had been the developer for the first two games the third game was developed through the collaboration of several companies The fourth installment Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U was released in for the Nintendo DS and Wii U respectively The DS installment was the first for a handheld platform A fifth installment Super Smash Bros Ultimate was released in for the Nintendo Switch br The series primarily features characters from various Nintendo franchises including Super Mario Donkey Kong The Legend of Zelda Metroid Yoshi Kirby Star Fox and Pok mon as well as third party franchises like Sonic the Hedgehog Street Fighter and Final Fantasy The original Super Smash Bros had only playable characters with the roster count rising for each successive game and later including third party characters with Ultimate containing every character playable in the previous games In Melee Brawl and Ultimate some characters are able to transform into different forms that have different styles of play and sets of moves Every game in the series has been well received by critics with multiple installments being listed among the greatest video games of all time Much praise has been given to their multiplayer features spawning a large competitive community that has been featured in several gaming tournaments br br br Gameplay br br Gameplay in the Super Smash Bros series differs from many fighting games Instead of winning by depleting an opponent s life bar players seek to launch their opponents off the stage and out of bounds Characters have a damage total which rises as they take damage represented by a percentage value that measures up to As a character s percentage rises they suffer stronger knockback from enemy attacks To knock out an opponent the player must knock that character outside the stage s boundaries in any direction When a character is launched off the stage the character can attempt to recover by using jumping moves and abilities to return to the stage Some characters have an easier time recovering onto the stage than others due to their moves and abilities Additionally some characters vary in weight with lighter characters being easier to launch than heavy characters br Controls are greatly simplified in comparison to other fighting games with one button used for standard attacks and another used for special attacks Players can perform different types of moves by holding the directional controls up down to the side or in a neutral position while pressing the attack or special button As such each character has four types of ground attacks mid air attacks and special attacks that can be performed Quickly pressing or tapping a directional input and the attack button together while on the ground allows players to perform a chargeable Smash Attack which is generally more powerful than other attacks When characters are hit by attacks they receive a hitstun that temporarily disallows any attacks to be made This allows combos to be performed A shield button allows players to put up a defensive shield which weakens with repeated use and will leave the player unable to move if broken Combining the shield button with directional inputs and attack buttons allows the player to also perform dodges rolls grabs and throws The three basic actions in Super Smash Bros attacking grabbing and shielding are often described using a rock paper scissors analogy attacking beats grabbing grabbing beats shielding and shielding beats attacking When a player knocks another player off of the main platform they may perform an action called edge guarding At the same time the player that has been knocked off will try to recover by jumping back onto the stage and avoiding the other players edge guarding br Another element in the Super Smash Bros series is battle items the abundance of which players can adjust before matches There are conventional battering items with which a player may hit an opponent such as a home run bat or a beam sword throwing items including Bob ombs and Koopa shells and shooting items either single shot guns or rapid fire blasters Recovery items allow the user to reduce their damage percentage by varying amounts Pok Balls are special items that release a random Pok mon onto the battlefield to temporarily assist the user Brawl introduced the Assist Trophy item which serves a similar purpose instead of releasing Pok mon it summons a character from another series Brawl also introduces the Smash Ball which when broken allows the fighter to perform a character specific super attack known as a Final Smash br The rules that can be used in a match vary depending on the game but the two most commonly used settings across all games are Time and Stock Time mode uses a point based system in which fighters earn points for knocking out their opponents and lose points for being knocked out or self destructing i e falling out of the stage by themselves The player with the highest score at the end of the set time limit wins the match Stock mode also known as Survival uses a life based system in which players are given a set number of lives known as stock with each fighter losing a life whenever they are knocked out becoming eliminated if they run out of lives The winner is the last fighter standing once all other fighters are eliminated or if a time limit is applied to the match the fighter with the most lives remaining once time runs out In the event of a tie a Sudden Death match takes place Here each of the tied fighters are given a starting damage percentage of making them easier to launch off the stage and the last fighter standing will be declared as the winner In some games this process is repeated if the match ends in another tie br Gameplay using competitive Super Smash Bros rules is usually played in Stock mode with a timer Items are turned off and the only tournament legal stages are those that do not feature hazards and other disruptive elements br br br Characters br br Each game in the series has a number of playable characters referred in the games as fighters taken from various gaming franchises with over in total across the series Starting with Super Smash Bros Brawl characters from non Nintendo franchises began to make playable appearances In Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U players were able to customize existing fighters with altered movesets and abilities as well as making their own Mii fighters that can be given three different fighting styles There are also other non playable characters that take the form of enemies bosses and summonable power up items br br br Music br Super Smash Bros features music from some of Nintendo s popular gaming franchises While many are newly arranged for the game some songs are taken directly from their sources The music for the Nintendo game was composed by Hirokazu Ando who later returned as sound and music director in Melee Melee also features tracks composed by Tadashi Ikegami Shougo Sakai and Takuto Kitsuta Brawl featured the collaboration of contracted composers including Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu who composed the main theme Like in Brawl Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U featured many original and re arranged tracks from various different gaming franchises from a variety of different composers and arrangers Both versions have multiple musical tracks that can be selected and listened to using the returning My Music feature including pieces taken directly from earlier Super Smash Bros games The DS and Switch games allow players to listen to their music from the sound menu while the system is in sleep handheld mode Ultimate continued the trend of multiple composers and arrangers working on remixed tracks having over in total br Three soundtrack albums for the series have been released An album with the original music for Super Smash Bros was released in Japan by Teichiku Records in In Nintendo released Smashing Live a live orchestrated performance of various pieces featured in Melee by the New Japan Philharmonic A two disc promotional soundtrack titled A Smashing Soundtrack was available for Club Nintendo members who registered both the DS and Wii U games between November and January br br br Development br br br Super Smash Bros br Super Smash Bros was developed by HAL Laboratory an independent affiliate company during It began as a prototype created by Masahiro Sakurai and Satoru Iwata in their spare time Dragon King The Fighting Game and featured no Nintendo characters However Sakurai hit on the idea of including fighters from different Nintendo franchises in order to provide atmosphere which he felt was necessary for a home console fighting game and his idea was approved Although never acknowledged by Nintendo or any developers behind Super Smash Bros third party sources have identified Namco s fighting game The Outfoxies as a possible inspiration The game had a small budget and little promotion and was originally a Japan only release but its huge success saw the game released worldwide On October Sakurai who still had the prototype of Dragon King The Fighting Game demonstrated its gameplay and its differences from the final product of Super Smash Bros br Super Smash Bros was introduced in for the Nintendo It was released worldwide after selling over a million copies in Japan It featured eight characters from the start Mario Donkey Kong Link Samus Yoshi Kirby Fox and Pikachu with four unlockable characters Luigi Captain Falcon Ness and Jigglypuff all of them created by Nintendo or one of its second party developers br In Super Smash Bros up to four players can play in multiplayer Versus mode with the specific rules of each match being predetermined by the players There are two match types that can be chosen Time where the person with the most KOs at the end of the set time wins and stock where each player has a set number of lives and are eliminated from play when their lives are depleted br This game s primary single player mode named Classic Mode in later series entries features a series of predetermined opponents the player must defeat Other single player modes exist such as Training and several minigames including Break the Targets and Board the Platforms All of these were included in the sequel with the exception of Board the Platforms br There are nine playable stages in Versus mode eight based on each of the starting characters such as Princess Peach s Castle for Mario Zebes for Samus and Sector Z for Fox and the unlockable Mushroom Kingdom based around motifs from the original Super Mario Bros even containing original sprites and the original version of the Overworld theme from that game br br br Super Smash Bros Melee br br A followup for the GameCube Super Smash Bros Melee released in Japan and North America in late and in Europe and Australia in May It had a larger budget and development team than Super Smash Bros did and was released to much greater praise and acclaim among critics and consumers Since its release Super Smash Bros Melee has sold more than million copies and was the best selling game on the GameCube Super Smash Bros Melee features characters of which are available initially more than doubling the number of characters in its predecessor There are also stages br It introduced two new single player modes alongside the Classic mode Adventure mode and All Star mode Adventure mode has platforming segments similar to the original s Race to the Finish mini game and All Star is a fight against every playable character in the game allows the player only one life in which damage is accumulated over each battle and a limited number of healing items in between battles Also in Melee is the Home Run Contest minigame which replaced Board the Platforms in the original game Here fighters will have to send Sandbag out of the stage to get the best distance with a baseball bat while damaging it for ten seconds br There are also significantly more multiplayer modes and a tournament mode allowing for different competitors whom can all be controlled by human players although only up to four players can participate at the same time Additionally the game featured alternative battle modes called Special Melee which allows players to make many different alterations to the battle along with alternative ways to judge a victory such as through collecting coins throughout the match br In place of Super Smash Bros character profiles Melee introduced trophies called figures in the Japanese version The trophies include three different profiles for each playable character one unlocked in each single player mode In addition unlike its predecessor Melee contains profiles for many Nintendo characters who are either non playable or do not appear in the game as well as Nintendo items stages enemies and elements br HAL Laboratory developed Super Smash Bros Melee with Masahiro Sakurai as the head of production The game was one of the first games released on the GameCube and highlighted the advancement in graphics from the Nintendo The developers wanted to pay homage to the debut of the GameCube by making an opening full motion video sequence that would attract people s attention to the graphics HAL worked with three separate graphic houses in Tokyo to make the opening sequence On their official website the developers posted screenshots and information highlighting and explaining the attention to physics and detail in the game with references to changes from its predecessor The Super Smash Bros logo consisting of two lines of different weight crossing within a circle represented the idea of a franchise crossover according to Sakurai naturally dividing the circle into four sections to represent the four player fighting mode br br br Super Smash Bros Brawl br br At a pre E press conference president of Nintendo at the time Satoru Iwata announced the next installment of Super Smash Bros was not only already in development for their next gaming console but hoped it would be a launch game with Wi Fi compatibility for online play The announcement was unexpected to the creator of the Super Smash Bros series Masahiro Sakurai Back in he had left HAL Laboratory the company that was in charge with the franchises development and was never informed of this announcement despite the fact shortly after resigning from the company Iwata said if a new game was to be made he would be in charge It was not until after the conference Sakurai was called to Satoru Iwata s room on the top floor of a Los Angeles hotel where he was told by Iwata We d like you to be involved in the production of the new Smash Bros if possible near the level of director Although Iwata had said he was hoping for it to be a launch game Sakurai stated I decided to become director And as of May I was the only member of the new Smash Bros development team Development of the game never actually started until October when Nintendo opened a new office in Tokyo just for its production Nintendo also enlisted outside help from various developer studios mainly Game Arts Sakurai also stated that these people had spent excessive amounts of time playing Super Smash Bros Melee This team was given access to all the original material and tools from the development of Melee courtesy of HAL Laboratory Also several Smash Bros staff members that reside around the area of the new office joined the project s development br On the game s official Japanese website the developers explain reasons for making particular characters playable and explain why some characters were not available as playable characters upon release Initially the development team wanted to replace Ness with Lucas the main character of Mother for the Game Boy Advance but they retained Ness in consideration of delays The game s creators have included Lucas in the game s sequel Super Smash Bros Brawl Video game developer Hideo Kojima originally requested Solid Snake the protagonist of the Metal Gear series to be a playable character in Super Smash Bros Melee but the game was too far in development for him to be included As with Lucas development time allowed for his inclusion in Brawl Roy and Marth were initially intended to be playable exclusively in the Japanese version of Super Smash Bros Melee However they received favorable attention during the game s North American localization leading to the decision for the developers to include them in the Western version Comparisons have been formed by the developers between characters which have very similar moves to each other on the website Such characters were referred to as clones in the media br At the Nintendo Media Conference at E it was announced by Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aim that Super Smash Bros Brawl would be released on December in the Americas However just months before its anticipated December release the development team asked for more time to work on the game During the Nintendo Conference on October Nintendo Co Ltd president Iwata announced the delay br On October George Harrison of Nintendo of America announced that Super Smash Bros Brawl would be released on February in North America On January the game s release was pushed back one week in Japan to January and nearly a month in the Americas to March On April it was confirmed by Nintendo of Europe that Brawl will be released in Europe on June br Although a third Super Smash Bros game had been announced long before E Nintendo unveiled its first information in the form of a trailer in and the game was named Super Smash Bros Brawl and released worldwide in The game featured a set of third party characters Solid Snake of Konami s Metal Gear series and longtime Mario rival Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega s series of the same name Brawl was also the first game in the franchise to support online play via the Nintendo Wi Fi Connection and to offer the ability for players to construct their own original stages The game features a total of playable characters and stages br Brawl also features compatibility with four kinds of controllers the Wii Remote on its side the Wii Remote and Nunchuk combination the Classic Controller and the GameCube controller while its predecessors only used the one controller designed for that system The player also has the ability to change the configuration of controls and the controller type br Super Smash Bros Brawl features a single player mode known as The Subspace Emissary This mode features unique character storylines along with numerous side scrolling levels and multiple bosses to fight as well as CG cut scenes explaining the storyline The Subspace Emissary features a new group of antagonists called the Subspace Army who are led by the Ancient Minister Some of these enemy characters appeared in previous Nintendo video games such as Petey Piranha from the Super Mario series and a squadron of R O B s based on classic Nintendo hardware The Subspace Emissary also boasts a number of original enemies such as the Roader a robotic unicycle the Bytan a one eyed ball like creature which can replicate itself if left alone and the Primid enemies that come in many variations Though primarily a single player mode The Subspace Emissary allows for cooperative multiplayer There are five difficulty levels for each stage and there is a method of increasing characters powers during the game This is done by placing collected stickers onto the bottom of a character s trophy between stages to improve various aspects of a fighter br br br Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U br br Director Masahiro Sakurai first announced that a new Super Smash Bros game was planned for Nintendo DS and Wii U at E in June but development only officially began following the completion of Sakurai s other project Kid Icarus Uprising in March The game was later revealed to be a joint project between Sora Ltd and Bandai Namco Games with various staff members from Bandai Namco s Soulcalibur and Tekken series assisting Sakurai in development Sakurai who was previously the sole person responsible for balance in the series multiple fighters has involved more staff to further improve the game s competitive balance The game was officially revealed at E on June during a Nintendo Direct presentation Along with screenshots being posted each weekday on the game s official website and Miiverse community various cinematic trailers were released introducing each of the brand new fighters Sakurai chose to use these trailers which benefit from Internet sharing as opposed to including a story campaign similar to the Subspace Emissary mode featured in Brawl as he believed the impact of seeing the mode s cinematic cutscenes for the first time was ruined by people uploading said scenes to video sharing websites br At E Sakurai stated that the tripping mechanic introduced in Brawl was removed with him also stating that the gameplay was between the fast paced and competitive style of Melee and the slower and more casual style of Brawl While the games didn t feature cross platform play between the Wii U and DS due to each version featuring certain exclusive stages and gamemodes there is an option to transfer customized characters and items between the two versions The game builds upon the previous game s third party involvement with the addition of third party characters such as Capcom s Mega Man and Bandai Namco s Pac Man as well as the return of Sega s Sonic the Hedgehog This involvement expands beyond playable characters as other third party characters such as Ubisoft s Rayman are also included in the game as trophies The addition of Mii characters was made in response to the growing number of requests from fans to have their dream characters included in the game To prevent potential bullying as well as to maintain game balance online Mii Fighters cannot be used in online matches against strangers The decision to release the Wii U version at a later date from the DS version was made to allow each version to receive a dedicated debugging period Hardware limitations on the Nintendo DS led to various design choices such as the removal of mid match transformations the absence of the Ice Climbers and the lack of Circle Pad Pro support br At E it was confirmed that a fourth Super Smash Bros game would be coming to the Nintendo DS and Wii U with the two games being cross compatible with each other Sakurai stated that the announcement was made public in order to attract developers needed for the games as development for the games did not start until May due to production on Kid Icarus Uprising On June Nintendo announced that the creation of the games would be a co production between Sakurai s Sora Ltd and Bandai Namco Entertainment The games were officially revealed at E with new information being released via trailers Nintendo Direct presentations and developer posts on Miiverse

recruitment advertisement on a Japanese career job opportunity website The recruitment page consisted of a listing for programmers for Smash Bros which was expected to be released in for both the Wii U and Nintendo DS The page noted there were game developers working on the project at the time and that Bandai Namco expected that number to increase to However shortly after its publication the page was taken down In a January column in Weekly Famitsu Sakurai alluded to the possibility of retirement expressing doubt that he would be able to continue making games if his career continued to be as stressful as it was In December Sakurai once again stated that he was not sure if there would be another game in the Smash Bros series br On March a teaser for the game was shown during a Nintendo Direct Sakurai later confirmed that he had worked on the game in silence day after day On March Nintendo announced that they would host another Super Smash Bros Invitational tournament in which a selected group of players would get to play the game for the first time and compete in a series of matches before a winner is chosen The tournament took place alongside the Splatoon World Championship
