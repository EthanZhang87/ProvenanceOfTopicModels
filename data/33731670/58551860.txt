The Palmtex Portable Videogame System PVS later renamed and released as the Super Micro and distributed under the Home Computer Software name is a handheld game console developed and manufactured by Palmtex released in br The system was also referred to as the Palmtex Super Micro because when the console was re branded the Palmtex logo was alongside Super Micro However Palmtex dropped its name from the packaging and promotional materials in favor of its business partner making its retail name the Home Computer Software Super Micro br It had a number of quality and design issues Only three games are known to have been released it is possible that only one or more factory runs were made and the existing units were liquidated and later sold through mail order with little to no advertising As a result it is now a rare collectible system although working units are still extremely prone to breaking with normal use br br br History br Two different companies were involved with the console Palmtex who developed manufactured and distributed it and Home Computer Software who developed its games br br Palmtex Inc was registered on November in San Francisco California br Home Computer Software Inc was registered on January in Sunnyvale California It recorded and distributed software on floppy diskettes br br br Early operations br The company started with Esmail Amid Hozour a businessman that came to the United States in the early s When looking for new business opportunities he found electronic games which were becoming popular in Japan most notably the Game Watch handhelds manufactured by Nintendo He later managed to make a deal with Nintendo who helped him import handhelds to the US for a test market The response was positive and the units were sold without much trouble Seeing this Amid Hozour founded Palmtex on March which became the first company to distribute Nintendo consoles in the US The handhelds distributed by the company were Fire Attack Parachute and Turtle Bridge with a later release adding Octopus Donkey Kong and Snoopy Tennis br Seeing the success of the Nintendo handhelds the company began importing other handhelds like the Tri Screen Time Fun series by VTech to the United States While the Game Watch handhelds had normal Nintendo branding and packaging the ones from VTech were re branded to exclude the company s name from the console and packaging in favor of Palmtex br At the end of the demand and sales of electronic handhelds was at its peak so Palmtex decided to create their own video game system br br br Development br On January Palmtex announced the PVS meaning Palmsized Videogame System making mention of its interchangeable cartridges D effects due to several layers of glass providing depth color graphics sound control and the inclusion of a pause button The unit retailed for while additional games were It was described as a dramatic design breakthrough for handheld games br br In May more details about the console were revealed showing an illustration of an early prototype along with five game cartridges announced for the system and a brief description of each Crystals of Morga Star Trooper Mayday Spell Bound and Mine Field The company hoped to have at least different games including the five launch titles by the end of and to release the system by March or April However by July the release date was pushed back to May br and Palmtex advertised that those who bought the system would receive the game Spell Bound for free br br Originally the game cartridges slid into the unit compared to the final product where they clipped into the back of the screen The name PVS was changed to mean Portable Videogame System br Palmtex also expected to release two new games each month for the system br Palmtex signed a contract with Home Computer Software led by Dan Shafer to create the games for the console They had developed other games for the Commodore and Atari ST and helped distribute the rare Atari game The Music Machine which is a clone of Kaboom and the Family Bible Fun series of games by Sparrow Records HCS hired Chuck Blanchard who programmed React Attack and Aladdin s Adventures while an outside consultant created Outflank This partnership helped the development of the console and its games progress smoothly br In the Berlin Internationale Funkausstellung at the time the biggest consumer electronics fair took place from September to September and Palmtex wanted to showcase their system The first prototype didn t fit inside of the unit and to be functional the handheld had to be connected by an external cable to the breadboard hidden under the booth table It had a transparent plastic casing emphasizing the internals of the device br By the end of the design was finalized and was sent to National Electronics Watch Co Ltd in Hong Kong for manufacturing with the first batch of units being ready just in time for their next public appearance br In Palmtex attended the Winter Consumer Electronics Show CES which took place from January to January Home Computer Software also attended the event br Palmtex showcased the redesigned system now with a white and black plastic case alongside three launch games Outflank React Attack and Aladdin s Adventures br Home Computer Software showcased three games they were publishing Kids Say The Darnest Things To Computers Plaqueman and Pro Golf br br br Crash liquidation and bankruptcy br Even though development progressed and a final product was ready and available the video game crash that had started the previous year was in full swing leaving many disinterested in the market The PVS became a victim of circumstance and had a hard time presenting itself to distributors at the show br That wasn t the only problem plaguing the system A major design flaw presented itself during the demonstrations in that the transparent screen was too dark and needed a substantial natural light source behind it to be able to see and play the games even during the day This problem could be fixed but in its current state and with the market in a dire situation no distributor was willing to carry the product resulting in no orders being placed at CES br Although it had been slated for release around May the system was reported to have been released to the public for with each additional game costing sometime before January according to the January issue of Popular Computing Weekly However this doesn t seem to have happened br Palmtex searched for venture capital to continue funding for the project but with the video game crash in full effect the response was negative This left the company without funding to improve the design of the console and to many employees leaving the company br Left with many existing units left from its production run Esmail tried to sell existing stock through many means including wholesaling and even retailers from Asian countries who could liquidate its stock After failing to secure a deal Palmtex decided to liquidate the stock themselves br In order to do so they needed to make two changes One was to fix the screen brightness issue creating a simple light box to provide a back light if one was needed the LightPak The other was a name change choosing to go with Super Micro in order to appeal to the microcomputer market which was booming in Complementing the new name Palmtex was removed from all marketing and box art in favor of Home Computer Software to position it more closely to a computer The information sticker on the bottom of the console still retained the Palmtex name This meant that existing consoles and cartridges with the PVS branding had a Super Micro sticker applied over the old logo while the new LightPak component had the Super Micro branding from the start br The console was finally made available through mail order costing for the Super Micro for each game and for the LightPak A Deluxe Pack cost including the console with the light box and a game br Even after this blunder Home Computer Software was still developing more games for the system but because Palmtex failed to pay a lump sum they owed after the delivery of the first three games HCS stopped any further development on the new games meaning the plan to release two new games each month didn t materialize br Home Computer Software kept selling their games and advertising them in magazines from December after filing trademark for their logo and January to at least September but they never really recovered financially from the missed payment leading the company to declare bankruptcy before the end of br In the end both companies were suspended by the Franchise Tax Board at an unknown date br The CEO of Palmtex Esmail Amid Hozour went on to create Et n Corporation in br br br Hardware br br The console has three different components the PVS itself the game cartridge and the LightPak br The PVS Model Number R uses a clam shell design that opens and closes using a plastic clip on the front The two halves of the system are connected by hinges and a flexible flat cable The top half contains the cartridge port and a polarizing layer for the LCD which is located in each cartridge The bottom half contains the battery compartment for four AA batteries and speaker br The front of the console contains a power switch two player controllers which are D pads with eight directions and six buttons R reset M mute which turns the sound on or off from the internal speaker P pause to pause the game and three action buttons A B and C On the back there is a contrast dial for the LCD br The game cartridges contain the main processor and RAM similar to the Microvision as well as the monochrome x LCD with a color overlay with fixed sprites for the game graphics They clip on the back of the display and connect via pins with two pin connectors on each side and are necessary for turning on the console The back of the cartridge contains a decal with the name of the console PVS or Super Micro and the name of the game br The LightPak uses two AA batteries to power six light bulbs behind a textured diffuser to provide a back light to the screen and clips on top of the cartridge enclosing it on its plastic shell This is considered optional as it doesn t connect to the main circuit of the console like the cartridges do and a room with adequate lighting makes it unnecessary for play but the manual advises against direct sunlight br The LightPak works by using the LCD to cover up the entire overlay of sprites with black squares pixels except the sprites being used at that moment The light shines through the back of the translucent overlay and screen for visibility with either the light pack or ambient light br br br Retail configurations br Each component of the console could be ordered separately or a Deluxe Pack that included one Super Micro one game cartridge and one LightPak br The packaging for both the Deluxe Pack and the games follows a unique code format A x x B br br A represents the first letter of the game included in the packaging br x x could be either x meaning it is included with the console or x meaning it is just the cartridge The last number is the number of the game br B could either be P indicating the console was inside possibly meaning PVS or Palmtex or C indicating it was only the cartridge br br br Hardware problems br The console is infamous for being of poor quality construction The plastic is described as light and brittle Due to the use of plastic clips during assembly of the cartridge and LightPak as well as opening closing the clam shell design of the console every time it is used it seems at risk of breaking The power switches also suffer from this problem It is unknown if this problem existed since the launch of the console or if age shrunk the plastic turning it fragile br The cartridges are also prone to breaking The LCD can easily rot and the connections can break improperly covering up the sprites during game play hindering the visuals of the game partially or completely In other cases the game just stops working at all br The LightPak is also easily broken the light bulbs inside often come loose making it lose some of its functionality The battery compartment of the LightPak functions normally but the one on the PVS has a problem where the cover needs to be inserted for the batteries to stay inside and if the cover is closed all the way it will be sealed shut and require significant force to open possibly scuffing or breaking the plastic br br br Games br Although five games had been announced with intentions to make more none of the five were released Instead only the three new games showcased at CES are known to have been released React Attack Aladdin s Adventures and Outflank br br br React Attack br React Attack is a strategy game where the player needs to find the reactor in different rooms before confronting a terrorist to stop a nuclear meltdown There s a time limit of minutes before the player loses the game br br br Aladdin s Adventures br In Aladdin s Adventures the player controls Aladdin against an evil genie who is trying to steal his magic carpets br br br Outflank br Outflank is a game of Reversi on an x grid with three difficulty levels The player can undo a wrong move and swap places with an AI during gameplay br br br
