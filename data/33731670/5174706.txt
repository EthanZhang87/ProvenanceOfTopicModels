The Ricoh A or RP A NTSC version Ricoh A or RP A PAL version is an bit microprocessor manufactured by Ricoh for the Nintendo Entertainment System video game console It was also used as a sound chip and secondary CPU by Nintendo s arcade games Punch Out and Donkey Kong br br br Technical details br The Ricoh A contains an unlicensed derivative of the MOS Technology core modified to disable the s binary coded decimal mode possibly to avoid a MOS Technology patent It also integrates a programmable sound generator also known as APU featuring twenty two memory mapped I O registers rudimentary DMA and game controller polling br br br Sound hardware br The Ricoh A s sound hardware has channels separated into two APUs Audio Processing Units The first APU contains two general purpose pulse channels with duty cycles and the second APU contains a triangle wave generator an LFSR based Noise generator and a bit Delta modulation encoded PCM DPCM channel While a majority of the NES library uses only channels later games use the th DPCM channel due to cartridge memory expansions becoming cheaper For example Super Mario Bros uses the DPCM channel for simple drum sounds while Journey to Silius uses it for sampled basslines An interesting quirk of the DPCM channel is that the bit order is reversed compared to what is normally expected for bit PCM Many developers were unaware of this detail causing samples to be distorted during playback br The output of each channel is mixed non linearly in their respective APU before being combined On Famicom and Dendy systems expansion sound chips may add their own sound to the output via a pin on the game cartridge Expansion audio capabilities were removed from international NES systems but can be restored by modifying the expansion port located on the bottom of the system br br br Regional variations br PAL versions of the NES sold in Europe Asia and Australia use the Ricoh A or RP A processor which is a A with modifications to better suit the Hz vertical refresh rate used in the PAL television standard However most developers lacked the resources to properly adjust their games music from NTSC to PAL leading to many PAL games sounding slower slightly lower pitched and in some cases out of tune compared to their original NTSC releases br br br See also br Nintendo Entertainment System technical specifications br br br
