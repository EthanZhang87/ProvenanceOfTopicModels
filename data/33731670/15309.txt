The Intellivision is a home video game console released by Mattel Electronics in Development began in the same year as the launch of its main competitor the Atari In Mattel sold its video game assets to a former Mattel Electronics executive and investors eventually becoming INTV Corporation Game development ran from to when the Intellivision was discontinued From to more than million consoles were sold As per Intellivision Entertainment the current holders of the Intellivision brand the final tally through is somewhere between and million consoles sold br In IGN ranked the Intellivision No on their list of the greatest video game consoles of all time br br br History br The Intellivision was developed at Mattel in Hawthorne California along with the Mattel Electronics line of handheld electronic games Mattel s Design and Development group began investigating a home video game system in It was to have rich graphics and long lasting gameplay to distinguish itself from its competitors Mattel identified a new but expensive chipset from National Semiconductor and negotiated better pricing for a simpler design Its consultant APh Technological Consulting suggested a General Instrument chipset listed as the Gimini programmable set in the GI catalog The GI chipset lacked reprogrammable graphics and Mattel worked with GI to implement changes GI published an updated chipset in its catalog After having chosen National in August Mattel waited for two months before ultimately choosing the proposed GI chipset in late A team at Mattel headed by David Chandler began engineering the hardware including the hand controllers In David Rolfe of APh developed the onboard executive control software named Exec and with a group of Caltech summer student employees programmed the first games Graphics were designed by a group of artists at Mattel led by Dave James br The Intellivision was introduced at the Las Vegas CES in January as a modular home computer with the Master Component priced at US and a soon to follow Keyboard Component also at equivalent to in At Chicago CES in June prices were revised to for each component A shortage of key chips from manufacturer General Instrument resulted in a limited number of Intellivision Master Components produced that year In Fall Sylvania marketed its own branded Intellivision at in its GTE stores at Philadelphia Baltimore and Washington D C On December Mattel delivered consoles to the Gottschalks department store chain headquartered in Fresno California with a suggested list price of The Intellivision was also listed in the nationally distributed JCPenney Christmas catalog along with seven cartridges It was in stores nationwide by mid with the pack in game Las Vegas Poker Blackjack and a library of ten cartridges Mattel Electronics became a subsidiary in br Though the Intellivision was not the first system to have challenged Warner Communications s Atari it was the first to have posed a serious threat to the market leader A series of advertisements starring George Plimpton used side by side game comparisons to demonstrate the superior graphics and sound of Intellivision over the Atari One slogan called Intellivision the closest thing to the real thing One such example compared golf games where the s games had a blip sound and cruder graphics the Intellivision featured a realistic swing sound and striking of the ball and a more D look In Mattel sold out its stock of Intellivision Master Components along with one million cartridges In more than one million Intellivision consoles were sold more than five times the amount of the previous year br br The Intellivision Master Component was branded and distributed by various companies Before Mattel shifted manufacturing to Hong Kong Mattel Intellivision consoles were manufactured by GTE Sylvania GTE Sylvania Intellivision consoles were produced along with Mattel s differing only by the brand name The Sears Super Video Arcade manufactured by Mattel in Hong Kong has a restyled beige top cover and detachable controllers Its default title screen lacks the Mattel Electronics captioning In Radio Shack marketed the Tandyvision One similar to the original console but with the gold plates replaced with more wood trim In Japan Intellivision consoles were branded for Bandai in and in Brazil there were Digimed and Digiplay consoles manufactured by Sharp in br br br Software br Inside every Intellivision console is K of ROM containing the Exec software It provides two benefits reusable code that can effectively make a K cartridge an K game and a software framework for new programmers to develop games more easily and quickly It also allows other programmers to more easily review and continue another s project Under the supervision of David Rolfe at APh and with graphics from Mattel artist Dave James APh was able to quickly create the Intellivision launch game library using mostly summer students The drawback is that to be flexible and handle many different types of games the Exec runs less efficiently than a dedicated program Intellivision games that leverage the Exec run at a Hz frame rate instead of the Hz frame rate for which the Intellivision was designed Using the Exec framework is optional but almost all Intellivision games released by Mattel Electronics use it and thus run at Hz The limited ROM space in the early years of Intellivision game releases also means there is no space for a computer player so many early multiplayer games require two human players br Initially all Intellivision games were programmed by an outside firm APh Technological Consulting with cartridges produced before Christmas Once the Intellivision project became successful software development was brought in house Mattel formed its own software development group and began hiring programmers The original five members of that Intellivision team were Mike Minkoff Rick Levine John Sohl Don Daglow and manager Gabriel Baum Levine and Minkoff a long time Mattel Toys veteran both transferred from the hand held Mattel game engineering team During Mattel hired programmers as fast as possible Early in Mattel Electronics relocated from Mattel headquarters to an unused industrial building Offices were renovated as new staff moved in To keep these programmers from being hired away by rival Atari their identities and work location was kept a closely guarded secret In public the programmers were referred to collectively as the Blue Sky Rangers br Most of the early games are based on traditional real world concepts such as sports with an emphasis on realism and depth of play within the technology of the time The Intellivision was not marketed as a toy as such games such as Sea Battle and B Bomber are not made in the pick up and play format like arcade games Reading the instructions is often a prerequisite Every cartridge produced by Mattel Electronics includes two plastic controller overlays to help navigate the button keypad although not every game uses it Game series or networks are Major League Sports Action Strategy Gaming Children s Learning and later Space Action and Arcade The network concept was dropped in as was the convenient gatefold style box for storing the cartridge instructions and overlays br Starting in programmers looking for credit and royalties on sales began leaving both APh and Mattel Electronics to create Intellivision cartridges for third party publishers They helped form Imagic in and in others joined Activision and Atari Cheshire Engineering was formed by a few senior APh programmers including David Rolfe author of the Exec and Tom Loughry creator of one of the most popular Intellivision games Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Cheshire created Intellivision games for Activision Third party developers Activision Imagic and Coleco started producing Intellivision cartridges in and Atari Parker Brothers Sega and Interphase followed in The third party developers not having legal access to Exec knowledge often bypassed the Exec framework to create smooth Hz and Hz Intellivision games such as The Dreadnaught Factor Cheaper ROM prices also allowed for progressively larger games as K K and K cartridges became common The first Mattel Electronics Intellivision game to run at Hz was Masters of the Universe in Marketing dubbed the term Super Graphics on the game s packaging and marketing br Mattel Electronics had a competitive advantage in its team of experienced and talented programmers As competitors often depended on licensing well known trademarks to sell video games Mattel focused on original ideas Don Daglow was a key early programmer at Mattel and became director of Intellivision game development Daglow created Utopia a precursor to the sim genre and with Eddie Dombrower the ground breaking sports simulation World Series Major League Baseball Daglow was also involved with the popular Intellivision games Tron Deadly Discs and Shark Shark After Mattel Electronics closed in its programmers continued to make significant contributions to the videogame industry Don Daglow and Eddie Dombrower went on to Electronic Arts to create Earl Weaver Baseball and Don Daglow founded Stormfront Studios Bill Fisher Steve Roney and Mike Breen founded Quicksilver Software and David Warhol founded Realtime Associates br br br Keyboard Component br br The Intellivision was designed as a modular home computer so from the beginning its packaging promotional materials and television commercials promised the addition of a forthcoming accessory called the Keyboard Component The Master Component was packaged as a stand alone video game system to which the Keyboard Component could be added providing the computer keyboard and tape drive Not meant to be a hobbyist or business computer the Intellivision home computer was meant to run pre programmed software and bring data flow Videotex into the home br The Keyboard Component adds an bit processor making the Intellivision a dual processor computer It has K bit shared RAM that can load and execute both Intellivision CP and program code from tape which is a large amount as typical contemporary cartridges are K The cassettes have two tracks of digital data and two tracks of analog audio completely controlled by the computer Two tracks are read only for the software and two tracks are for user data The tape drive is block addressed with high speed indexing A high resolution monochrome text display can overlay regular Intellivision graphics There is a microphone port and two expansion ports for peripherals and RAM The Microsoft BASIC programming cartridge uses one of these ports Expanded memory cartridges support pages of KB each A third pass through cartridge port is for regular Intellivision cartridges It uses the Intellivision s power supply A column thermal printer was available and a telephone modem was planned along with voice synthesis and voice recognition br David Rolfe of APh wrote a control program for the Keyboard Component called PicSe Picture Sequencer specifically for the development of multimedia applications PicSe synchronizes the graphics and analog audio while concurrently saving or loading tape data Productivity software for home finances personal improvement and self education were planned Subject experts were consulted and their voices recorded and used in the software br Three applications using the PicSe system were released on cassette tape Conversational French Jack Lalanne s Physical Conditioning and Spelling Challenge br Programs written in BASIC do not have access to Intellivision graphics and were sold at a lower price Five BASIC applications were released on tape Family Budgeting Geography Challenge and Crosswords I II and III br The Keyboard Component was an ambitious piece of engineering for its time and it was repeatedly delayed as engineers tried to reduce manufacturing costs In August a breadboard form of the Component was successfully entered into the Sears Market Research Program In December Mattel had production design working units but decided on a significant internal design change to consolidate circuit boards In September it was test marketed in Fresno California but without software except for the BASIC programming cartridge In late design changes were finally implemented and the Keyboard Component was released at equivalent to in in Seattle and New Orleans only Customers who complained in writing could buy a Keyboard Component directly from Mattel The printer a rebadged Alphacom Sprinter was only available by mail order br The keyboard component s repeated delays became so notorious around Mattel headquarters that comedian Jay Leno when performing at Mattel s Christmas party got his biggest response of the evening with the line You know what the three big lies are don t you The check is in the mail I ll still respect you in the morning and The keyboard will be out in spring br Complaints from consumers who had chosen to buy the Intellivision specifically on the promise of a coming soon personal computer upgrade eventually caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission FTC who started investigating Mattel Electronics for fraud and false advertising In mid the FTC ordered Mattel to pay a monthly fine said to be until the promised computer upgrade was in full retail distribution To end the ongoing fines the Keyboard Component was officially canceled in August and the Entertainment Computer System ECS module offered in its place Part of Mattel s settlement with the FTC involved offering to buy back all of the existing Keyboard Components from customers Mattel provided a full refund but customers without a receipt received for the Keyboard Component for the BASIC cartridge and for each cassette software Any customer who opted to keep the products was required to sign a waiver with the understanding that no more software would be written for the system and absolving Mattel of any future responsibility for technical support They were also compensated with worth of Mattel Electronics products br Though approximately Keyboard Components were manufactured it is not clear how many of them were sold and they are rare Many of the units were dismantled for parts Others were used by Mattel Electronics programmers as part of their development system A Keyboard Component could be interfaced with an Intellivision development system in place of the hand built Magus board RAM cartridge Data transfer to the Keyboard Component RAM is done serially and is slower than the Magus board parallel interface br The keyboard component debacle was ranked as No on GameSpy s dumbest moments in gaming br br br Entertainment Computer System ECS br br In mid Mattel s upper management was becoming concerned that the keyboard component division would never be able to produce a sellable product As a result Mattel Electronics set up a competing internal engineering team whose stated mission was to produce an inexpensive add on called the Basic Development System or BDS to be sold as an educational device to introduce kids to the concepts of computer programming br The rival BDS engineering group who had to keep the project s real purpose a secret among themselves fearing that if David Chandler the head of the keyboard component team found out about it he would use his influence to end the project eventually came up with a much less expensive alternative Originally dubbed the Lucky from LUCKI Low User Cost Keyboard Interface it lacked many of the sophisticated features envisioned for the original keyboard component Gone for example was the K MB max of RAM the secondary CPU and high resolution text instead the ECS offered a mere KB RAM expansion a built in BASIC that was marginally functional plus a much simplified cassette and printer interface br Ultimately this fulfilled the original promises of turning the Intellivision into a computer making it possible to write programs and store them to tape as well as interfacing with a printer well enough to allow Mattel to claim that they had delivered the promised computer upgrade and stop the FTC s mounting fines It even offered via an additional sound chip AY inside the ECS module and an optional key music synthesizer keyboard the possibility of turning the Intellivision into a multi voice synthesizer which could be used to play or learn music br In the fall of the LUCKI now renamed the Entertainment Computer System ECS was presented at the annual sales meeting officially ending the ill fated keyboard component project A new advertising campaign was aired in time for the Christmas season and the ECS itself was shown to the public at the January Consumer Electronics Show CES in Las Vegas A few months later the ECS hit the market and the FTC agreed to drop the K per month fines br By the time the ECS made its retail debut as the Intellivision Computer Module an internal shake up at the top levels of Mattel Electronics management had caused the company s focus to shift away from hardware add ons in favor of software and the ECS received very little in terms of furthering the marketing push Further hardware developments including a planned Program Expander that would have added another K of RAM and a more intricate fully featured Extended BASIC to the system were halted In the end six games were released for the ECS a few more were completed but not released br The ECS also offered four player game play with the optional addition of two extra hand controllers Four player games were in development when Mattel Electronics closed in World Cup Soccer was later completed and released in by Dextel in Europe and then INTV Corporation in North America The documentation does not mention it but when the ECS Computer Adapter is used World Cup Soccer can be played with one to four players or two players cooperatively against the computer br br br Intellivoice br br In Mattel introduced the Intellivoice Voice Synthesis Module a speech synthesizer for compatible cartridges The Intellivoice was novel in two respects human sounding male and female voices with distinct accents and speech supporting games designed with speech as an integral part of the gameplay br Like the Intellivision chipset the Intellivoice chipset was developed by General Instrument The SP orator chip has KB ROM inside and is used to store the speech for numerical digits some common words and the phrase Mattel Electronics presents Speech can also be processed from the Intellivoice s SP buffer chip stored and loaded from cartridge memory That buffer chip has its own I O and the Intellivoice has a pin expansion port under a removable top plate Mattel Electronics planned to use that connector for wireless hand controllers br Mattel Electronics built a state of the art voice processing lab to produce the phrases used in Intellivoice games However the amount of speech that could be compressed into an K or K cartridge and still leave room for a game was limited Intellivoice cartridges Space Spartans and B Bomber did sell about copies each priced a few dollars more than regular Intellivision cartridges However at the Intellivoice did not sell as well as Mattel expected Intellivoices were later offered free with the purchase of a Master Component In August the Intellivoice system was quietly phased out A children s title called Magic Carousel and foreign language versions of Space Spartans were completed but shelved Additional games Woody Woodpecker and Space Shuttle went unfinished with the voice recordings unused br Four Intellivoice games were released Space Spartans B Bomber Bomb Squad and Tron Solar Sailer br A fifth game Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball developed as part of the Entertainment Computer System series also supports the Intellivoice if both the ECS and Intellivoice are connected concurrently Unlike the Intellivoice specific games however World Series Major League Baseball is also playable without the Intellivoice module but not without the ECS br br br Intellivision II br br In the spring of Mattel introduced the Intellivision II a cheaper more compact redesign of the original that was designed to be less expensive to manufacture and service with updated styling It also had longer controller cords The Intellivision II was initially released without a pack in game but was later packaged with BurgerTime in the United States and Lock N Chase in Canada In the Digiplay Intellivision II was introduced in Brazil Brazil was the only country outside North America to have the redesigned Intellivision II br Using an external AC Adapter V AC consolidating some ICs and taking advantage of relaxed FCC emission standards the Intellivision II has a significantly smaller footprint than the original The controllers now detachable have a different feel with plastic rather than rubber side buttons and a flat membrane keypad Users of the original Intellivision missed the ability to find keypad buttons by the tactile feel of the original controller bubble keypad br One functional difference was the addition of a video input to the cartridge port added specifically to support the System Changer an accessory also released in by Mattel that played Atari cartridges through the Intellivision The Intellivision hand controllers could be used to play Atari games The System Changer also had two controller ports compatible with Atari joysticks The original Intellivision required a hardware modification a service provided by Mattel to work with the System Changer Otherwise the Intellivision II was promoted to be compatible with the original br It was discovered that a few Coleco Intellivision games did not work on the Intellivision II Mattel secretly changed the Exec internal ROM program in an attempt to lock out third party games A few of Coleco s early games were affected but the rd party developers quickly figured out how to get around it Mattel s own Electric Company Word Fun however will not run on the Intellivision II due to this change In an unrelated issue but also due to Exec changes Super Pro Football experiences a minor glitch where the quarterback does not appear until after the ball is hiked There were also some minor changes to the sound chip AY A AY affecting sound effects in some games Programmers at Mattel discovered the audio differences and avoided the problem in future games br br br Decade br As early as Dave Chandler s group began designing what would have been Mattel s next generation console codenamed Decade and now referred to as the Intellivision IV It would have been based on the bit MC processor and a bit custom designed advanced graphic interface chip Specifications called for dual display support bitmap resolution programmable bit colors colors antialiasing tiled graphics modes four colors per tile with shading text layer and independent scrolling multicolored sprites per scan line level hardware sprite scaling Line interrupts for reprogramming sprite and color registers would allow for many more sprites and colors on screen at the same time It was intended as a machine that could lead Mattel Electronics into the s however on August most hardware people at Mattel Electronics were laid off br br br Intellivision III br In with new machines introduced by competitors Mattel marketing wanted to bring an upgraded system to market sooner The Intellivision III was to be an upgraded but backward compatible system based on a similar CP processor and with an improved graphics STIC chip producing double the resolution with more sprites and colors The Intellivision III never proceeded past the prototype stage a new EXEC was written for it but no games It was cancelled in mid A Mattel document titled Target Specification

According to the company s Form K Mattel had almost of the domestic video game market Mattel Electronics provided of revenue and of operating income in fiscal Although the Atari had more third party development Creative Computing Video Arcade Games reported after visiting the summer Consumer Electronics Show that the momentum is tremendous Activision and Imagic began releasing games for the Intellivision as did hardware rival Coleco Mattel created M Network branded games for Atari s system The company s advertisement budget increased to over million for the year In its October stockholders report Mattel announced that Electronics had so far that year posted a nearly million profit on nearly million sales a threefold increase over October br However the same report predicted a loss for the upcoming quarter Hiring still continued as did the company s optimism that the investment in software and hardware development would pay off The M Network brand expanded to personal computers An office in Taiwan was opened to handle Apple II programming The original five person Mattel game development team had grown to people under new vice president Baum while Daglow led Intellivision development and top engineer Minkoff directed all work on all other platforms In February Mattel Electronics opened an office in the south of France to provide European input to Intellivision games and develop games for the ColecoVision At its peak Mattel Electronics employed people br Amid the flurry of new hardware and software development there was trouble for the Intellivision New game systems ColecoVision and Atari introduced in took advantage of falling RAM prices to offer graphics closer to arcade quality In the price of home computers particularly the Commodore came down drastically to compete with video game system sales The market became flooded with hardware and software and retailers were ill equipped to cope In spring hiring at Mattel Electronics came to a halt br At the June Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago Mattel Electronics had the opportunity to show off all their new products The response was underwhelming Several people in top management positions were replaced due to massive losses On July Mattel Electronics President Josh Denham was replaced with outsider Mack Morris Morris brought in former Mattel Electronics president and marketing director Jeff Rochlis as a consultant and all projects were under review The Intellivision III was cancelled and then all new hardware development was stopped when jobs were cut on August The price of the Intellivision II which launched at earlier that year was lowered to and Mattel Electronics was to be a software company However by October Electronics losses were over million for the year and one third of the programming staff were laid off Another third were gone by November and on January the remaining programming staff were laid off The Taiwan and French offices continued a little while longer due to contract and legal obligations On February Mattel sold the Intellivision business for million In Intellivision Master Components were sold compared to million in br br br INTV Corporation br br Former Mattel Electronics Senior Vice President of Marketing Terrence Valeski understood that although losses were huge the demand for video games increased in Valeski found investors and purchased the rights to Intellivision the games and inventory from Mattel A new company Intellivision Inc was formed and by the end of Valeski bought out the other investors and changed the name to INTV Corporation They continued to supply the large toy stores and sold games through direct mail order At first they sold the existing inventory of games and Intellivision II systems When the inventory of games sold out they produced more but without the Mattel name or unnecessary licenses on the printed materials To lower costs the boxes instructions and overlays were produced at lower quality compared to Mattel br In France the Mattel Electronics office found investors and became Nice Ideas in April They continued to work on Intellivision Colecovision and other computer games They produced Intellivision World Cup Soccer and Championship Tennis both released in by European publisher Dextel br In INTV Corporation introduced the INTV System III also branded as the Intellivision Super Pro System using the same design as the original Intellivision model but in black and silver That same year INTV Corp introduced two new games that were completed at Mattel but not released Thunder Castle and World Championship Baseball With their early success INTV Corp decided to produce new games and in introduced Super Pro Football an update of Mattel NFL Football INTV Corp continued a relationship that Mattel had with Data East and produced all new cartridges such as Commando in and Body Slam Wrestling in Also in INTV Corp released Dig Dug purchased from Atari where the game was completed but not released in They also got into producing next generation games with the production of Monster Truck Rally for Nintendo Entertainment System NES in also released as Stadium Mud Buggies for Intellivision in br Licensing agreements with Nintendo and Sega required INTV Corporation to discontinue the Intellivision in INTV Corporation did publish new Intellivision cartridges bringing the Intellivision library to a total of cartridges plus one compilation cartridge br br br Tutorvision br br In INTV Corp and World Book Encyclopedia entered into an agreement to manufacture an educational video game system called Tutorvision It is a modified Intellivision the case molded in light beige with gold and blue trim The Exec ROM expanded system RAM increased to K and graphics RAM increased to KB That is enough graphics RAM to define unique graphic tiles for the entire screen br Games were designed by World Book J Hakansson Associates and programmed by Realtime Associates Sixteen games were in production plus one Canadian variation However the cartridges and the Tutorvision were never released instead World Book and INTV Corporation sued each other In INTV

far to players of electronic video games Those used to joysticks will have to endure a short period of adjustment but even finicky players will be forced to agree that the company has developed a truly elegant solution to the controller problem br Ken Uston published Ken Uston s Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games in as a guide to potential buyers of console systems cartridges as well as a brief strategy guide to numerous cartridge games then in existence He described Intellivision as the most mechanically reliable of the systems The controller used during many hours of experimentation worked with perfect consistency The unit never had overheating problems nor were loose wires or other connections encountered However Uston rated the controls and control system as below average and the worst of the consoles he tested including Atari Magnavox Odyssey Astrovision and Fairchild Channel F br Jeff Rovin lists Intellivision as one of the seven major suppliers of videogames in and mentions it as the unchallenged king of graphics but says the controllers can be difficult to operate mentions the fact that if a controller breaks the entire unit must be shipped off for repairs since they did not detach at first and explains that the overlays are sometimes so stubborn as to tempt one s patience br A article in Next Generation said the Intellivision had greater graphics power than the dominant Atari It was slower than the and had less software available but it was known for its superior sports titles A year later Electronic Gaming Monthly assessed the Intellivision in an overview of older gaming consoles remarking that the controllers were as comfortable as they were practical The unique disk shaped directional pad provided unprecedented control for the time and the numeric keypad opened up new options previously unavailable in console gaming They praised the breadth of the software library but said there was a lack of genuinely stand out games br br br Legacy br br br Intellivision Lives br br Intellivision games became readily available again when Keith Robinson and Stephen Roney both former Intellivision programmers at Mattel Electronics obtained exclusive rights to the Intellivision and games in That year they formed a new company Intellivision Productions and made Intellivision for PC Volume available as a free download Intellivision games could be played on a modern computer for the first time That download includes three Intellivision games and an MS DOS Intellivision emulator that plays original game code It was followed by Volume and another three games including Deep Pockets Super Pro Pool Billiards a game completed in but never released until this download in In the Intellipack download was available with another four Intellivision games and emulators for Windows or Macintosh br Intellivision Productions released Intellivision Lives and Intellivision Rocks on compact disc in and These compilation CDs play the original game code through emulators for MS DOS Windows and Macintosh computers Together they have over Intellivision games including never before released King of the Mountain Takeover Robot Rubble League of Light and others Intellivision Rocks includes Intellivision games made by Activision and Imagic Some games could not be included due to licensing others simply used different titles to avoid trademarked names The CDs are also a resource for development history box art hidden features programmer biographies video interviews and original commercials br Also in Intellivision Productions announced they would sell development tools allowing customers to program their own Intellivision games They were to provide documentation PC compatible cross assemblers and the Magus II PC Intellivision cartridge interface Unfortunately the project was cancelled but they did provide copies of Your Friend the EXEC the programmers guide to the Intellivision Executive control software By Intellivision hobbyists ultimately created their own development tools including Intellivision memory cartridges br In Intellivision Productions announced that new Intellivision cartridges were to be produced Deep Pockets and Illusions will be the first two releases in a series of new cartridges for the Intellivision The printed circuit boards the cartridge casings the boxes are all being custom manufactured for this special series Illusions was completed at Mattel Electronics French office in but never released Deep Pockets Super Pro Pool Billiards was programmed for INTV Corporation in and only released as a ROM file in However no cartridges were produced Previously in Intellivision Productions did release new cartridges for the Atari and Colecovision Sea Battle and Swordfight were Atari games created by Mattel Electronics in the early s but not previously released Steamroller Colecovision was developed for Activision in and not previously released br br br Licensing Intellivision Games br Also in Activision released A Collection of Intellivision Classic Games for PlayStation Also known as Intellivision Classics it has emulated Intellivision games as well as video interviews of some of the original programmers All of the games were licensed from Intellivision Productions and none of the Activision or Imagic Intellivision games were included In Crave Entertainment released a PlayStation version of Intellivision Lives and then Xbox and GameCube version in In Virtual Play Games released Intellivision Lives for the Nintendo DS including one never before released game Blow Out In Microsoft made Intellivision Lives an available download on the Xbox Live Marketplace as an Xbox Original and playable on the Xbox br In the Intellivision and Intellivision direct to TV systems were released by Techno Source Ltd These are an all in one single controller design that plugs directly into a television One includes games the other ten These Intellivision games were not emulated but rewritten for the native processor NES based hardware and adapted to a contemporary controller As such they look and play differently than Intellivision In they were updated for two player play as the Intellivision X with games They were commercially very successful altogether selling about million units by end of br Several licensed Intellivision games became available to Windows computers through the GameTap subscription gaming service in including Astrosmash Buzz Bombers Hover Force Night Stalker Pinball Shark Shark Skiing and Snafu Installation of the GameTap Player software was required to access the emulator and games The VH Online Arcade made nine Intellivision games available in Using a Shockwave emulator these Intellivision games could be played directly through a web browser with Shockwave Player In VH Classic and MTV Networks released Intellivision games to iOS Intellivision games were first adapted to mobile phones and published by THQ Wireless in On March Microsoft launched the Game Room service for Xbox Live and Games for Windows Live This service includes support for Intellivision games and allows players to compete for high scores via online leaderboards At the Consumer Electronics Show Microsoft announced a version of Game Room for Windows Phone promising a catalog of Intellivision games AtGames and its Direct
