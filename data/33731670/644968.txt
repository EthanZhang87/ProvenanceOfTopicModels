the Game Boy Camera was not well received within Nintendo However Masato Kuwahara approached Creatures Inc President Hirokazu Tanaka regarding the development of the software for the device which solidified the project The camera s built in software was co developed by Nintendo Research Development and the Japanese company Jupiter with Tanaka directing the project The Game Boy Camera was launched with an initial MSRP of US br br br Legacy br The Camera sold close to units in its first three weeks of availability in Japan br As one of the earliest consumer digital cameras the GBC has been legitimized for user generated content especially photography Modern computer connectivity has required experimentation for image retrieval br br The cover art of Neil Young s album Silver Gold was taken using a Game Boy Camera br In a professional photographer created a color workflow similar to the world s earliest color photography to process GBC s grayscale photos through red green and blue filters to produce a color photograph An artist using a Game Boy Camera and three colour process has developed a series of works since focussing on how the interplay between what the abstracted images reveal and conceal about the photographed environment As well as using the Game Boy printer within his practice A PhD student performed astrophotography of scenes including Jupiter through academic telescopes using GBC In a research engineer developed a neural network application to automatically convert GBC monochrome images into color images Several modern smartphone apps have modes to simulate GBC image quality In an Instagram artist included the vintage GBC hardware in his repertoire of high technology stylized filters creating a new gallery dedicated only to GBC photography
