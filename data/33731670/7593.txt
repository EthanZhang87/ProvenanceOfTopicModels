An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics br The first solid state electronic calculator was created in the early s Pocket sized devices became available in the s especially after the Intel the first microprocessor was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom br Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap give away credit card sized models to sturdy desktop models with built in printers They became popular in the mid s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost By the end of that decade prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools br Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc and interactive BASIC could be used to do calculations on most s and s home computers Calculator functions are included in most smartphones tablets and personal digital assistant PDA type devices br In addition to general purpose calculators there are those designed for specific markets For example there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations Some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line or higher dimensional Euclidean space As of basic calculators cost little but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more br With the very wide availability of smartphones and the like dedicated hardware calculators while still widely used are less common than they once were In calculators still represented an estimated of the world s general purpose hardware capacity to compute information By this had diminished to less than br br br Design br br br Input br Electronic calculators contain a keyboard with buttons for digits and arithmetical operations some even contain and buttons to make larger or smaller numbers easier to enter Most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button however in more specific calculators a button can perform multi function working with key combinations br br br Display output br Calculators usually have liquid crystal displays LCD as output in place of historical light emitting diode LED displays and vacuum fluorescent displays VFD details are provided in the section Technical improvements br Large sized figures are often used to improve readability while using decimal separator usually a point rather than a comma instead of or in addition to vulgar fractions Various symbols for function commands may also be shown on the display Fractions such as are displayed as decimal approximations for example rounded to Also some fractions such as which is to significant figures can be difficult to recognize in decimal form as a result many scientific calculators are able to work in vulgar fractions or mixed numbers br br br Memory br Calculators also have the ability to save numbers into computer memory Basic calculators usually store only one number at a time more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in variables Usually these variables are named ans or ans The variables can also be used for constructing formulas Some models have the ability to extend memory capacity to store more numbers the extended memory address is termed an array index br br br Power source br Power sources of calculators are batteries solar cells or mains electricity for old models turning on with a switch or button Some models even have no turn off button but they provide some way to put off for example leaving no operation for a moment covering solar cell exposure or closing their lid Crank powered calculators were also common in the early computer era br br br Key layout br The following keys are common to most pocket calculators While the arrangement of the digits is standard the positions of other keys vary from model to model the illustration is an example br br The arrangement of digits on calculator and other numeric keypads with the keys two rows above the keys is derived from calculators and cash registers It is notably different from the layout of telephone Touch Tone keypads which have the keys on top and keys on the third row br br br Internal workings br In general a basic electronic calculator consists of the following components br br Power source mains electricity battery and or solar cell br Keypad input device consists of keys used to input numbers and function commands addition multiplication square root etc br Display panel output device displays input numbers commands and results Liquid crystal displays LCDs vacuum fluorescent displays VFDs and light emitting diode LED displays use seven segments to represent each digit in a basic calculator Advanced calculators may use dot matrix displays br A printing calculator in addition to a display panel has a printing unit that prints results in ink onto a roll of paper using a printing mechanism br Processor chip microprocessor or central processing unit br br Clock rate of a processor chip refers to the frequency at which the central processing unit CPU is running It is used as an indicator of the processor s speed and is measured in clock cycles per second or hertz Hz For basic calculators the speed can vary from a few hundred hertz to the kilohertz range br br br Example br br A basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple four function calculator br To perform the calculation one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators br br When is entered it is picked up by the scanning unit the number is encoded and sent to the X register br Next when the key is pressed the addition instruction is also encoded and sent to the flag or the status register br The second number is encoded and sent to the X register This pushes shifts the first number out into the Y register br When the key is pressed a message signal from the flag or status register tells the permanent or non volatile memory that the operation to be done is addition br The numbers in the X and Y registers are then loaded into the ALU and the calculation is carried out following instructions from the permanent or non volatile memory br The answer is sent shifted back to the X register From there it is converted by the binary decoder unit into a decimal number usually binary coded decimal and then shown on the display panel br Other functions are usually performed using repeated additions or subtractions br br br Numeric representation br br Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in binary coded decimal BCD rather than binary BCD is common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic and not containing a microprocessor By employing BCD the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub circuit This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical seven segment displays to build a metering circuit for example If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry Therefore in cases where the calculations are relatively simple working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary For example CDs keep the track number in BCD limiting them to tracks br The same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor Often smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors For these applications some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities br Where calculators have added functions such as square root or trigonometric functions software algorithms are required to produce high precision results Sometimes significant design effort is needed to fit all the desired functions in the limited memory space available in the calculator chip with acceptable calculation time br br br History br br br Precursors to the electronic calculator br br The first known tools used to aid arithmetic calculations were bones used to tally items pebbles and counting boards and the abacus known to have been used by Sumerians and Egyptians before BC Except for the Antikythera mechanism an out of the time astronomical device development of computing tools arrived near the start of the th century the geometric military compass by Galileo logarithms and Napier bones by Napier and the slide rule by Edmund Gunter br br The Renaissance saw the invention of the mechanical calculator by Wilhelm Schickard in and later by Blaise Pascal in A device that was at times somewhat over promoted as being able to perform all four arithmetic operations with minimal human intervention Pascal s calculator could add and subtract two numbers directly and thus if the tedium could be borne multiply and divide by repetition Schickard s machine constructed several decades earlier used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation There is a debate about whether Pascal or Shickard should be credited as the known inventor of a calculating machine due to the differences like the different aims of both inventions Schickard and Pascal were followed by Gottfried Leibniz who spent forty years designing a four operation mechanical calculator the stepped reckoner inventing in the process his leibniz wheel but who couldn t design a fully operational machine There were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the th century br br The th century saw the arrival of some notable improvements first by Poleni with the first fully functional calculating clock and four operation machine but these machines were almost always one of a kind Luigi Torchi invented the first direct multiplication machine in this was also the second key driven machine in the world following that of James White It was not until the th century and the Industrial Revolution that real developments began to occur Although machines capable of performing all four arithmetic functions existed prior to the th century the refinement of manufacturing and fabrication processes during the eve of the industrial revolution made large scale production of more compact and modern units possible The Arithmometer invented in as a four operation mechanical calculator was released to production in as an adding machine and became the first commercially successful unit forty years later by about arithmometers had been sold plus a few hundreds more from two arithmometer clone makers Burkhardt Germany and Layton UK and Felt and Tarrant the only other competitor in true commercial production had sold comptometers br br It wasn t until that the familiar push button user interface was developed with the introduction of the Dalton Adding Machine developed by James L Dalton in the United States br In Edith Clarke invented the Clarke calculator a simple graph based calculator for solving line equations involving hyperbolic functions This allowed electrical engineers to simplify calculations for inductance and capacitance in power transmission lines br The Curta calculator was developed in and although costly became popular for its portability This purely mechanical hand held device could do addition subtraction multiplication and division By the early s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators although the Curta remains a popular collectable item br br br Development of electronic calculators br The first mainframe computers initially using vacuum tubes and later transistors in the logic circuits appeared in the s and s Electronic circuits developed for computers also had application to electronic calculators br The Casio Computer Company in Japan released the Model A calculator in which was the world s first all electric relatively compact calculator It did not use electronic logic but was based on relay technology and was built into a desk The IBM plugboard programmable calculator was IBM s first all transistor product released in this was a console type system with input and output on punched cards and replaced the earlier larger vacuum tube IBM br br In October the world s first all electronic desktop calculator the British Bell Punch Sumlock Comptometer ANITA A New Inspiration To Arithmetic Accounting was announced This machine used vacuum tubes cold cathode tubes and Dekatrons in its circuits with cold cathode Nixie tubes for its display Two models were displayed the Mk VII for continental Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain and the rest of the world both for delivery from early The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII The ANITA had a full keyboard similar to mechanical comptometers of the time a feature that was unique to it and the later Sharp CS A among electronic calculators The ANITA weighed roughly pounds kg due to its large tube system Bell Punch had been producing key driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names Plus and Sumlock and had realised in the mid s that the future of calculators lay in electronics They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz who had worked on the early British Pilot ACE computer project to lead the development The ANITA sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available and was silent and quick br The tube technology of the ANITA was superseded in June by the U S manufactured Friden EC which had an all transistor design a stack of four digit numbers displayed on a inch cm cathode ray tube CRT and introduced Reverse Polish Notation RPN to the calculator market for a price of which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time Like Bell Punch Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics In more all transistor electronic calculators were introduced Sharp introduced the CS A which weighed kilograms lb and cost yen and Industria Macchine Elettroniche of Italy introduced the IME to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it but apparently not at the same time The Victor was the first to use integrated circuits in place of individual transistors but production problems delayed sales until br br There followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers including Canon Mathatronics Olivetti SCM Smith Corona Marchant Sony Toshiba and Wang The early calculators used hundreds of germanium transistors which were cheaper than silicon transistors on multiple circuit boards Display types used were CRT cold cathode Nixie tubes and filament lamps Memory technology was usually based on the delay line memory or the magnetic core memory though the Toshiba Toscal BC appears to have used an early form of dynamic RAM built from discrete components Already there was a desire for smaller and less power hungry machines br Bulgaria s ELKA introduced in was developed by the Central Institute for Calculation Technologies and built at the Elektronika factory in Sofia The name derives from ELektronen KAlkulator and it weighed around kg lb It is the first calculator in the world which includes the square root function Later that same year were released the ELKA with a luminescent display and the ELKA with an built in printer Several other models were developed until the first pocket model the ELKA was released in The writing on it was in Roman script and it was exported to western countries br br br Programmable calculators br br The first desktop programmable calculators were produced in the mid s They included the Mathatronics Mathatron and the Olivetti Programma late which were solid state desktop printing floating point algebraic entry programmable stored program electronic calculators Both could be programmed by the end user and print out their results The Programma saw much wider distribution and had the added feature of offline storage of programs via magnetic cards br Another early programmable desktop calculator and maybe the first Japanese one was the Casio AL produced in It featured a nixie tubes display and had transistor electronics and ferrite core memory br The Monroe Epic programmable calculator came on the market in A large printing desk top unit with an attached floor standing logic tower it could be programmed to perform many computer like functions However the only branch instruction was an implied unconditional branch GOTO at the end of the operation stack returning the program to its starting instruction Thus it was not possible to include any conditional branch IF THEN ELSE logic During this era the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer br The first Soviet programmable desktop calculator ISKRA powered by the power grid was released at the start of the s br br br s to mid s br The electronic calculators of the mid s were large and heavy desktop machines due to their use of hundreds of transistors on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an AC power supply There were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer integrated circuits chips and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of semiconductor development U S semiconductor manufacturers led the world in large scale integration LSI semiconductor development squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits This led to alliances between Japanese calculator manufacturers and U S semiconductor companies Canon Inc with Texas Instruments Hayakawa Electric later renamed Sharp Corporation with North American Rockwell Microelectronics later renamed Rockwell International Busicom with Mostek and Intel and General Instrument with Sanyo br br br Pocket calculators br br By a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries The first handheld calculator was a prototype called Cal Tech whose development was led by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in a research project to produce a portable calculator It could add multiply subtract and divide and its output device was a paper tape As a result of the Cal Tech project Texas Instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators br The first commercially produced portable calculators appeared in Japan in and were soon marketed around the world These included the Sanyo ICC Mini Calculator the Canon Pocketronic and the Sharp QT B micro Compet The Canon Pocketronic was a development from the Cal Tech project It had no traditional display numerical output was on thermal paper tape br Sharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in January the Sharp EL also marketed as the Facit which was close to being a pocket calculator It weighed pounds grams had a vacuum fluorescent display rechargeable NiCad batteries and initially sold for US br However integrated circuit development efforts culminated in early with the introduction of the first calculator on a chip the MK by Mostek followed by Texas Instruments later in the year Although these early hand held calculators were very costly these advances in electronics together with developments in display technology such as the vacuum fluorescent display LED and LCD led within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all br In Pico Electronics and General Instrument also introduced their first collaboration in ICs a full single chip calculator IC for the Monroe Royal Digital III calculator Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs Pico and GI went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market br The first truly pocket sized electronic calculator was the Busicom LE A HANDY which was marketed early in Made in Japan this was also the first calculator to use an LED display the first hand held calculator to use a single integrated circuit then proclaimed as a calculator on a chip the Mostek MK and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries Using four AA size cells the LE A measures by by inches mm mm mm br The first European made pocket sized calculator DB was made in May by Digitron in Buje Croatia former Yugoslavia with four functions and an eight digit display and special characters for a negative number and a warning that the calculation has too many digits to display br The first American made pocket sized calculator the Bowmar B popularly termed The Bowmar Brain measuring by by inches mm mm mm came out in the Autumn of with four functions and an eight digit red LED display for US while in August the four function Sinclair Executive became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring by by inches mm mm mm and weighing ounces g It retailed for around US at the time By the end of the decade similar calculators were priced less than Following protracted development over the course of two years including a botched partnership with Texas Instruments Eldorado Electrodata released five pocket calculators in One called the Touch Magic was no bigger than a pack of cigarettes according to Administrative Management br The first Soviet Union made pocket sized calculator the Elektronika B was developed by the end of and sold at the start of br One of the first low cost calculators was the Sinclair Cambridge launched in August It retailed for or less in kit form and later models included some scientific functions The Sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition however their design led to slow and less accurate computations of transcendental functions maximum three decimal places of accuracy br br br Scientific pocket calculators br br Meanwhile Hewlett Packard HP had been developing a pocket calculator Launched in early it was unlike the other basic four function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with scientific functions that could replace a slide rule The HP along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators uses reverse Polish notation RPN also called postfix notation A calculation like plus is using RPN performed by pressing Enter and instead of the algebraic infix notation It had buttons and was based on Mostek Mk chip br The first Soviet scientific pocket sized calculator the B was completed by the end of br In Texas Instruments TI introduced the SR SR signifying slide rule an algebraic entry pocket calculator using scientific notation for Shortly after the SR featured an added key for entering pi It was followed the next year by the SR which added log and trig functions to compete with the HP and in the mass marketed TI line which is still produced br In a new company Calculated Industries arose which focused on specialized markets Their first calculator the Loan Arranger was a pocket calculator marketed to the Real Estate industry with preprogrammed functions to simplify the process of calculating payments and future values In CI launched a calculator for the construction industry called the Construction Master which came preprogrammed with common construction calculations such as angles stairs roofing math pitch rise run and feet inch fraction conversions This would be the first in a line of construction related calculators br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Programmable pocket calculators br The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP in it had a capacity of instructions and could store and retrieve programs with a built in magnetic card reader Two years later the HP C introduced continuous memory i e programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power off In HP released the first alphanumeric programmable expandable calculator the HP C It could be expanded with random access memory RAM for memory and read only memory ROM for software modules and peripherals like bar code readers microcassette and floppy disk drives paper roll thermal printers and miscellaneous communication interfaces RS HP IL HP IB br br The first Soviet pocket battery powered programmable calculator Elektronika B was developed by the end of and released at the start of The successor of B the Elektronika B wasn t backward compatible with B even if it kept the reverse Polish notation RPN Thus B defined a new command set which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators Despite very limited abilities bytes of instruction memory and about stack and addressable registers people managed to write all kinds of programs for them including adventure games and libraries of calculus related functions for engineers Hundreds perhaps thousands of programs were written for these machines from practical scientific and business software which were used in real life offices and labs to fun games for children The Elektronika MK calculator using the extended B command set and featuring internal EEPROM memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery was used in Soviet spacecraft program for Soyuz TM flight as a backup of the board computer br This series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter intuitive mysterious undocumented features somewhat similar to synthetic programming of the American HP which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages jumping to nonexistent addresses and other methods A number of respected monthly publications including the popular science magazine Nauka i Zhizn Science and Life featured special columns dedicated to optimization methods for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches named yeggogology The error messages on those calculators appear as a Russian word YEGGOG which unsurprisingly is translated to Error br A similar hacker culture in the US revolved around the HP which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than B br br br Technical improvements br br Through the s the hand held electronic calculator underwent rapid development The red LED and blue green vacuum fluorescent displays consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life often measured in hours so rechargeable nickel cadmium batteries were common or were large so that they could take larger higher capacity batteries In the early s liquid crystal displays LCDs were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime Busicom introduced the Busicom LE A HANDY calculator the first pocket sized calculator and the first with an LED display and announced the Busicom LC with LCD However there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by Rockwell International and sold from by other companies under such names as Dataking LC Harden DT Ibico Lloyds Lloyds Prismatic a k a P Rapid Data Rapidman LC The LCDs were an early form using the Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background To present a high contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide which negated the low power consumption of the display These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two br A more successful series of calculators using a reflective DSM LCD was launched in by Sharp Inc with the Sharp EL which was a slim pocket calculator This and another few similar models used Sharp s Calculator On Substrate COS technology An extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display was used as a substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology The COS technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards br br In the mid s the first calculators appeared with field effect twisted nematic TN LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging ultraviolet rays The advantage of LCDs is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light which require much less power than light emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs This led the way to the first credit card sized calculators such as the Casio Mini Card LC of which could run for months of normal use on button cells br There were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators All of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first calculator on a chip integrated circuits ICs in but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high Many calculators continued to use two or more ICs especially the scientific and the programmable ones into the late s br The power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced especially with the introduction of CMOS technology Appearing in the Sharp EL in the transistors in the logic cells of CMOS ICs only used any appreciable power when they changed state The LED and VFD displays often required added driver transistors or ICs whereas the LCDs were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator IC itself br With this low power consumption came the possibility of using solar cells as the power source realised around by calculators such as the Royal Solar Sharp EL and Teal Photon br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Mass market phase br At the start of the s hand held electronic calculators were very costly at two or three weeks wages and so were a luxury item The high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were costly to produce and production runs that were too small to exploit economies of scale Many firms saw that there were good profits to be made in the calculator business with the margin on such high prices However the cost of calculators fell as components and their production methods improved and the effect of economies of scale was felt br By the cost of the cheapest four function pocket calculator had dropped to a few dollars about of the cost five years before The results of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit from calculators leading to many firms dropping out of the business or closing The firms that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators or producing high specification scientific and programmable calculators br br br Mid s to present br br The first calculator capable of symbolic computing was the HP C released in It could for example solve quadratic equations symbolically The first graphing calculator was the Casio fx G released in br The two leading manufacturers HP and TI released increasingly feature laden calculators during the s and s At the turn of the millennium the line between a graphing calculator and a handheld computer was not always clear as some very advanced calculators such as the TI the Voyage and HP G could differentiate and integrate functions solve differential equations run word processing and PIM software and connect by wire or IR to other calculators computers br The HP c financial calculator is still produced It was introduced in and is still being made with few changes The HP c featured the reverse Polish notation mode of data entry In several new models were released including an improved version of the HP c the HP c platinum edition which added more memory more built in functions and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry br Calculated Industries competed with the HP c in the mortgage and real estate markets by differentiating the key labeling changing the I PV FV to easier labeling terms such as Int Term Pmt and not using the reverse Polish notation However CI s more successful calculators involved a line of construction calculators which evolved and expanded in the s to present According to Mark Bollman a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at Albion College the Construction Master is the first in a long and profitable line of CI construction calculators which carried them through the s s and to the present br br br Use in education br br In most countries students use calculators for schoolwork There was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic or elementary arithmetic skills would suffer There remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations in the head with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained while others concentrate more on teaching estimation methods and problem solving Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in Others have argued that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic concepts In December the UK s Minister of State for Schools Nick Gibb voiced concern that children can become too dependent on the use of calculators As a result the use of calculators is to be included as part of a review of the Curriculum In the United States many math educators and boards of education have enthusiastically endorsed the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics NCTM standards and actively promoted the use of classroom calculators from kindergarten through high school br br br Personal computers br br Personal computers often come with a calculator utility program that emulates the appearance and functions of a calculator using the graphical user interface to portray a calculator Examples include the Windows Calculator Apple s Calculator and KDE s KCalc Most personal data assistants PDAs and smartphones also have such a feature br br br Calculators compared to computers br br The fundamental difference between a calculator and computer is that a computer can be programmed in a way that allows the program to take different branches according to intermediate results while calculators are pre designed with specific functions such as addition multiplication and logarithms built in The distinction is not clear cut some devices classed as programmable calculators have programming functions sometimes with support for programming languages such as RPL or TI BASIC br For instance instead of a hardware multiplier a calculator might implement floating point mathematics with code in read only memory ROM and compute trigonometric functions with the CORDIC algorithm because CORDIC does not require much multiplication Bit serial logic designs are more common in calculators whereas bit parallel designs dominate general purpose computers because a bit serial design minimizes chip complexity but takes many more clock cycles This distinction blurs with high end calculators which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design more so the Z MC and ARM architectures and some custom designs specialized for the calculator market br br br
