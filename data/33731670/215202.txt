The DD is a magnetic floppy disk drive peripheral for the Nintendo game console developed by Nintendo It was announced in prior to the Nintendo s launch and after numerous delays was released in Japan on December The references both the Nintendo console and the MB storage capacity of the disks and DD is short for disk drive or dynamic drive br Plugging into the extension port on the underside of the console the DD allows the Nintendo to use proprietary MB magnetic disks for expanded and rewritable data storage a real time clock for persistent game world design and a standard font and audio library for further storage efficiency Its games and hardware accessories let the user create movies characters and animations to use within various other games and shared online The system could connect to the Internet through a dedicated online service Randnet for e commerce online gaming and media sharing Describing it as the first writable bulk data storage device for a modern video game console Nintendo designed the DD as an enabling technology platform for the development of new genres of games and applications several of which were in development for several years br Only ten disks had been released and Randnet had subscribers when the DD was discontinued in February It was a commercial failure with at least total units sold and was never released outside Japan Most games once planned for DD were released as standard Nintendo games ported to other consoles such as the GameCube or canceled br IGN lamented the broken promises and vaporware summarizing the DD as an appealing creativity package for a certain type of user that delivered a well designed user driven experience and as a limited online experiment at the same time which partially fulfilled Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi s longtime dream of a network that connects Nintendo consoles all across the nation br br br History br br br Development br With the announcement of its new Project Reality console Nintendo explored options for data storage A Nintendo spokesperson said in that it could be a cartridge system a CD system or both or something not ever used before In Howard Lincoln chairman of Nintendo of America said Right now cartridges offer faster access time and more speed of movement and characters than CDs So we ll introduce our new hardware with cartridges But eventually these problems with CDs will be overcome When that happens you ll see Nintendo using CD as the software storage medium for our bit system br In consideration of the DD s actual launch price equivalent of about US Nintendo software engineering manager Jim Merrick warned We re very sensitive to the cost of the console We could get an eight speed CD ROM mechanism in the unit but in the under console market it would be hard to pull that off Describing the final choice of proprietary floppy disks instead of CD ROM Nintendo game designer Shigesato Itoi explained CD holds a lot of data DD holds a moderate amount of data and backs the data up and cartridge ROMs hold the least data and process the fastest By attaching a DD to the game console we can drastically increase the number of possible genres br br The company also explored the forging of an early online strategy with Netscape whose founding management had recently come directly from SGI the company which had designed the core Nintendo hardware Within its budding online strategy Nintendo reportedly considered multiplayer online gaming to be of the highest priority even above that of web browsing Several third party game developers were developing prominent online gaming features based on DD including Ocean s Mission Impossible deathmatches and Seta s competitive four player Ultimate War and online racing game Nintendo would ultimately retain the core impetus of these ideas but would drastically alter both plans over the following years in favor of a floppy based storage technology and the Randnet online software and service partner although with no online multiplayer gaming support whatsoever br br br Announcement br br Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchi announced the dual storage strategy of the bulky drive at Nintendo s Shoshinkai trade show He intended the product to be revealed at Shoshinkai and launched sometime in although giving virtually no technical specifications Computer and Video Games reported unconfirmed specifications far above what would be actually launched disk caddy MB floppy disks MBps speed ms access MB RAM upgrade and costing about US br The DD was fully revealed at Nintendo s Shoshinkai show of November where IGN reported that it was one of the biggest items of the show There Nintendo of America Chairman Howard Lincoln stated that the hardware specifications had been finalized and had its own show booth Nintendo s Director of Corporate Communications Perrin Kaplan made the company s first official launch window announcement for the peripheral scheduled for late in Japan Core Magazine said Nintendo representatives insisted the system would be aggressively supported by third parties and Nintendo s internal development teams with sequels for Super Mario and Zelda and DD originals Cabbage and Emperor of the Jungle Nintendo s list of DD developers included Konami Capcom Enix and Rare Rare officially discounted any rumors of the peripheral s impending pre release cancellation br Reportedly several developers attended the show to learn DD development some having traveled from the US for the DD presentation and some having received DD development kits A DD prototype was in a glass case not visibly operational but with a makeshift demonstration of Zelda which was said to be running from disk An improvised disk conversion of the familiar Super Mario game demonstrated the drive s operation and performance and a graphics application mapping the audience s photographical portraits onto live D animated avatars a feature which was ultimately incorporated and released in as Mario Artist Talent Studio and the Capture Cassette br The event featured Creator a music and animation game by Software Creations the same UK company that had made Sound Tool for the Nintendo Ultra development kit They touted the game s ability to be integrated into other games allowing a player to replace any such game s textures and possibly create new levels and characters There was no playable version of Creator available there but the project was later absorbed into Mario Artist Paint Studio Nintendo announced DD would be bundled with a RAM expansion cartridge br Much of the gaming press said the DD reveal at Shoshinkai was not as significant as Nintendo had promised leaving the public still unaware of the system s software lineup practical capabilities and release date Zelda eventually released as the cartridge game The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time was seen as the DD s potential killer app in the months following the system s unveiling br On April Nintendo of America hosted a Developer s Conference in Seattle Washington where a surprise overview was delivered by Nintendo Developer Support staff Mark DeLoura about the DD br br br Delays br The DD is notable in part for two years of many launch delays which created an interdependent cascade of delays and complications of many other business processes and product launches for Nintendo and its partners and the cancellation of Space World due to lack of completed DD software IGN reported in June that many called it the most elusive piece of vaporware to date br On May Nintendo issued a press conference announcing the first DD launch delay rescheduled to March with no comment on an American release schedule This was reportedly attributed to the protracted development of both the disks and the drive technologies On June Nintendo and Alps Electric announced their manufacturing partnership for the still tentatively titled DD br br On June at the E pre show press conference the company lacked even a prototype unit to display while Howard Lincoln stated that the company wouldn t release the device until sufficient numbers of software releases support it Reportedly featuring at least twenty games in development including Donkey Kong and the sequel to Super Mario the device retained its projected Japanese launch window of at least March and received its first American launch window of early Also at the show Nintendo confirmed that the DD would have Internet capability and Nintendo s main game designer Shigeru Miyamoto speculated that its launch games could be SimCity Mario Artist Pocket Monsters and Mother br At Space World from November the DD was shown prominently but its delay was extended from March to June with no mention of an international launch Next Generation magazine observed the attendees and the demonstrations finding no appeal to the US market from any current DD software which was mainly Mario Artist and Pocket Monsters The magazine said DD s future does not look good And whether or not it was ever a serious mainstream contender is now open for debate and wondered if DD would become just an interesting footnote to the Nintendo story The magazine and Argonaut Software founder Jez San found Nintendo s third party relations and the third parties products to be poor with no sign of improving San said Rumors have been circulating for a while that recently within Nintendo the main priority has been taking development staff off other games and projects at the expense of Nintendo and DD to make sure that Pocket Monsters was done on time Nintendo s presentation focused mainly on first party Nintendo cartridges and the top selling game of Pocket Monsters for Game Boy Zelda had always been a killer app for the DD but was now announced as lost to cartridge Nintendo s largest ever at megabits or megabytes because Nintendo said the DD userbase probably couldn t support a blockbuster even if launched in June and because DD floppy disk speed cannot continuously stream motion captured character animations throughout gameplay as only a cartridge can br George Harrison vice president of Nintendo of America described the logistics of the DD launch delays br br Certainly DD hasn t been sidelined it s still in the starting gate Nintendo can t guarantee that the DD will launch in the US in but what we can say is that it will launch when it is ready and when we have a compelling piece of software for it But it s an accessory and we all know the history of selling add ons in this marketplace and to be successful we d have to get a to penetration of this DD into the installed base of N to be considered a success We can t just have or of people buy it otherwise it wouldn t make any sense to continue software support for it br In a December interview with Shigeru Miyamoto and Shigesato Itoi Miyamoto confessed the difficulty of repeatedly attempting to describe and justify the long promised potential of the mysterious peripheral to a curious public He said that it would have been easier to understand if the DD was already included when the N first came out It s getting harder to explain after the fact laughs To illustrate the fundamental significance of the DD to all game development at Nintendo Itoi said I came up with a lot of ideas because of the DD All things start with the DD There are so many ideas I wouldn t have been allowed to come up with if we didn t have the DD Miyamoto concluded Almost every new project for the N is based on the DD we ll make the game on a cartridge first then add the technology we ve cultivated to finish it up as a full out DD game By IGN optimistically expected all major Nintendo cartridge games to have software support for an impending expansion disk Known third party DD developers included Konami Culture Brain Seta Japan System Supply Titus Infogrames Rare Paradigm Entertainment Ocean and Factor br br More delays were subsequently announced The American launch was delayed to late The Japanese launch was delayed to June later adjusted by the apologetic announcement on April that it would launch within the year The DD was conspicuously absent from E having been briefly described the prior day as definitely not launching in and questionable in which Next Generation magazine interpreted as being as close to dead as we can imagine IGN pessimistically explained that the peripheral s launch delays were so significant and Nintendo s software library was so dependent upon the DD that this lack of launchable software also caused Nintendo to entirely cancel Space World for br On April IGN announced Nintendo s latest delayed launch date of DD and the nearly complete Mario Artist as June Demonstrated at the May E as what IGN called an almost forgotten visitor there was no longer a plan for release outside Japan and its launch in Japan was still withheld by the lack of completed launch games In June IGN reported that month s completion of Randnet and the modem as having breathed new life into what many have called the most elusive piece of vaporware to date IGN said Nintendo is surprisingly confident about the DD and is predicting to sell the full initial shipment of before year s end br As of Space World in August Nintendo had set Randnet s launch date at December but reportedly had not yet set a launch date for the DD The DD pre order program had been recently announced for mid September and was now delayed to November or December Earthbound which IGN cynically called in development for nearly years had been heavily anticipated inside the company and globally as a crucial DD launch game but the sudden announcement of its release being retargeted from disk to megabyte cartridge plus expansion disk was interpreted by IGN as unsurprising and as a sign of possible further delay or cancellation of the DD Nintendo s DD booth demonstrated eight launch games including DT Bloodmasters with a data transfer DT cable from Game Boy Color to DD Nintendo listed many more DD games in development Randnet had recently been announced and was being tested in Japan br br br Launch br The DD was launched on December exclusively in Japan as a package called the Randnet Starter Kit including six games bimonthly through the mail and one year of Internet service Core Magazine and IGN reported Nintendo s stated initial retail shipment of units br Anticipating that its long planned peripheral would become a commercial failure Nintendo initially sold the Randnet Starter Kit via mail order Later very limited quantities of the individual DD and games were released to stores br br br Discontinuation br On August Space World was signified by the launches of the GameCube and Game Boy Advance and by what IGN considered to be the unofficial discontinuation of the DD jokingly calling it DeaDD According to IGN Nintendo did not speak about DD during its opening speech nor did the hardware itself have any booth presence In fact the unofficial No DD policy seemed to be enforced by Nintendo so brutally that had we even muttered the name of the hardware we would have probably been tossed out of the show br In October Nintendo announced the impending discontinuation of the DD and Randnet with active subscribers They were discontinued in February Only ten DD disks were ever released including three third party games and one Internet application suite Most planned DD games were either released on increasingly larger Nintendo Game Pak ported to other consoles like the PlayStation or GameCube or canceled entirely br br br Hardware br br Nintendo designed the DD as an enabling technology for the development of new genres of games which was principally accomplished by its three main design features its dual storage strategy of cartridges and disks its new real time clock RTC and its Internet connectivity The dual storage strategy of the Nintendo plus the DD combines the traditional high speed cartridges which are low capacity non writable and expensive but very fast along with the introduction of proprietary mass storage disks which are large capacity rewritable and cheap but only moderately fast br Though incompatible in every way with any other consumer electronics product the DD s magnetic storage format is a proprietary floppy disk resembling the large and sturdy shell of the proprietary Zip disk for personal computers Though various prominent sources have mistakenly referred to the medium as being magneto optical technology Nintendo s own developer documentation refers to it in detail as being magnetic Complementing its proprietary and copy protected cartridge strategy the proprietary MB disk format was Nintendo s faster more flexible and copy protected answer to the commodity Compact Disc format which is cheaper to produce but is much slower read only and easier to copy on personal computers The most advanced CD technology delivered by the contemporaneous Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation game consoles can hold at least megabytes MB of information with a peak kB s throughput and more than ms seek speed This compares to the Nintendo s cartridge s to MB size and to MB s of low latency and instantaneous load times and the DD s MB disk size and MB s peak throughput with ms average seek latency The high seek latency and low maximum throughput of a x CD ROM drive contribute to stuttering and to very long loading times throughout a gameplay session in many games in addition to a much higher production cost testing cycle and potential development time for all the potential extra content br As an example of variable storage strategies Nintendo determined that the development of The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time would be retargeted from DD disk format alone to the much faster cartridge format plus expansions on the cheaper floppy disk to optimize performance and cost br Similar in proportion of the historical comparison of Famicom Disk System floppy disks to early Famicom cartridges this disk format s initial design specifications had been set during a time frame when the initial Nintendo cartridge size was MB as with Super Mario and a MB size eventually became popular over the years Nonetheless the DD disk format would serve as significant storage size expansion upon its launch when MB cartridges were the norm and on into future years when only three MB cartridges would ever be released for Nintendo The writability of up to MB per disk would yield enduring benefits to emerging game genres and social gaming like that of the Famicom Disk System br Many Game Paks retain vestigial detection of DD and optional expansion disk most of which were never released and proceed as a standalone game Expansions can provide sequels extra levels minigames or store user generated content Other storage options include a few kilobytes on the Controller Pak or on a battery backed Game Pak for storing basic game status br In addition to writable storage the DD s real time clock RTC enables persistent worlds according to a battery backed clock and calendar Shigeru Miyamoto said this of the canceled four year development of the pet breeding game Cabbage We re doing it on the DD because I wanted to make a clock function such that even if the power is cut can still raise the creature br The system includes a modem cartridge for Randnet which connected to the Internet and to members only portal sites br The DD has an enhanced font and audio library potentially saving space of cartridges and disks A bit coprocessor operates disks and transfers data to the console where the RCP and CPU process data Like nearly all disc based consoles the DD has a boot menu to operate without a cartridge The DD is packaged with the MB RAM Expansion Pak totaling MB The DD software development kit works with the Nintendo development kit br br br Accessories br br The DD Randnet bundle includes a modem for connecting to the Randnet network and the MB RAM Expansion Pak Other accessories include a keyboard a mouse and an audio video capture port female RCA jack and line in called the Capture Cassette or cartridge br The CPU powered kbps software modem cartridge was developed in partnership between Nexus Telocation Systems Ltd and Surf Communications It is housed on a special cartridge with a port for the included modular cable which then connects to the network It is the Nintendo s only officially licensed Internet connectivity product and the early discussions between Surf and Nintendo to have built a modem directly into the console did not materialize br Coincidentally an unlicensed third party alternative was produced for America by InterAct in the form of the SharkWire Online system br br br Randnet br br In April Nintendo ended the partnership with St GIGA which had created the Super Famicom s proprietary Satellaview online service in Japan broadcasting from April to June The company then partnered with Japanese media company Recruit to develop the DD s completely new proprietary online service called Randnet a portmanteau of Recruit and Nintendo network The resulting equity owned joint Japanese corporation was announced on June as RandnetDD Co Ltd Operating only in Japan from December to February the Randnet service allowed gamers to surf the Internet including a members only portal and to share user generated data including artwork The subscription fee included the dialup Internet account DD system hardware and a delivery schedule of game disks by mail Reportedly Nintendo and several third party game developers had originally planned multiplayer online gaming as being more important than even a web browser br br The Randnet Starter Kit comes packaged with the DD peripheral and everything needed to have accessed the service br br DD The writable MB disk drive system br Nintendo Modem br Expansion Pak This MB RAM expansion upgrades the Nintendo s system RAM to a total of MB br Randnet Browser Disk This let users of the former online service access the members only information exchange page as well as the Internet Once logged on to

Mario Artist was intended to allow the design and printing of postcards to be sent via postal mail br E commerce The GET Mall service sold CDs books DD games and peripherals br Digital Magazine The ability to check online sports scores weather and news was planned but only features related to horse racing were released br Nintendo had originally promised these canceled features br br NES games The emulator was completed for downloadable NES games br Battle Mode Play against other gamers and swap scores Mah jongg was announced with online multiplayer mode DT Bloodmasters with online card trading Ultimate War with online multiplayer mode and Wall Street with daily online stock price updates br Observation Mode Watch other players game sessions like ghost data br Beta Test Download sample levels from upcoming games br Music Distribution Listen to music some of which was yet to be released in stores br From November to January the first round of membership registration for Randnet s Internet service opened to a maximum of subscribers on a first come first served basis The Randnet service was accessible only via a Nintendo and DD setup and the DD hardware and games were only purchasable by mail order along with a Randnet subscription the peripheral was not stocked in any retail stores It was all purchased at one time by filling out a mail order request form at select retail stores throughout Japan convenience stores toy stores and video game retailers The hardware was delivered soon and the games delivered as monthly nationwide releases across the following year br The plan was available in two tiers a purchase plan for users who want to buy only the DD to add to their existing Nintendo system or a lease to own plan for those who want both the DD and a special edition translucent black Nintendo console Randnet was launched with monthly payment plans for the service and hardware bundle approximately US per month for the purchase plan and US per month for rent to own for the first year and US per month for Randnet service thereafter The service was accessed at an additional dialup fee of up to per minute initially local only to Tokyo The service later eliminated the monthly payment model in favor of an annual prepaid model at US for one year for outright purchase and US for the first year of lease to own The DD and some later games eventually became available for purchase directly at retail br As part of the subscription the game disks were delivered not in the initial package but by mail on a schedule December had Doshin the Giant and Mario Artist Paint Studio February had Randnet Disk SimCity and Mario Artist Talent Studio and April had F Zero X Expansion Kit and Mario Artist Polygon Studio The final Starter Kit subscription title Polygon Studio was suddenly delayed and then released on August br br One of the most substantial series of games to include Randnet support is the Mario Artist series which allowed online users to swap their artwork creations with others Contests and other special events occurred periodically Papercraft was implemented by way of modelling the characters in Mario Artist Polygon Studio and utilizing Mario Artist Communication Kit to upload the model data to Randnet s online printing service The user can then cut fold and adhere the resulting colored paper into a full bodied D papercraft figure br Because the DD hardware package was primarily sold with a mandatory subscription to Randnet the service was fairly popular among the limited DD user base Overall the service didn t garner enough subscribers to justify its continued existence and in October the service s impending closure was announced The Dream magazine relayed a Nintendo public relations statement that there had been approximately Randnet subscribers at the time of this announcement indicating that there had been at least that many hardware units sold to customers Nintendo offered to buy back all the Randnet purchased consumer hardware and to give free service to all users from the announcement of closure until the day it actually went offline The Randnet service closed on February and Nintendo s equity partnership with RandnetDD Co Ltd was liquidated from June to January br br br Games br br br Released br A total of ten disks were released for DD which comprise nine games and one dialup utility disk br br br Proposed br More than games were announced for the DD that ended up being released on Nintendo cartridge format only being totally canceled due to the system s delays or commercial failure or being ported to another console such as Nintendo GameCube Sony PlayStation Sega Dreamcast Sony PlayStation or Microsoft Xbox br br br Reception br Rating the overall system at out of IGN s Peer Schneider finds the industrial design language of the DD and its accessories to perfectly match and integrate with that of the Nintendo with no user accessible moving parts a single mechanical eject button sharing the N s power button and child friendly usability Installation is said to be quick and painless operation is even simpler and the whole system couldn t be easier to use Software load times are described as minimal where the most complex possible point of the system s library reaches about five seconds The site says that the DD popularity was inherently limited due in part to its limited release in Japan a country which had a limited adoption of the Nintendo and of dialup Internet connectivity br Schneider found the combination of the Randnet s web browser and the mouse to provide a passable surfing experience He described the portal s private content as much too limited where a nyone who has used the Internet would snicker at the lack of up to date contents or tools offered on Randnet He was disappointed in the companies failure to have ever delivered certain promised online features such as game beta testing and music distribution But it provides new users with a simple network which functions as first baby steps into the vast world of the Internet br Schneider liked the overall product value provided by the Randnet Starter Kit including hardware games accessories and Internet subscription However the platform s abrupt discontinuation proved to limit the appeal to a per item basis rather than as a whole Because these items were sold only as a soon discontinued bundle all with such ultimately limited application he found the disks cheaper prices to be aggregated back up to the level of cartridges br He found the Mario Artist series especially the DD s killer app Talent Studio to be uniquely compelling in creative ways that couldn t be done on any other gaming console on the market utilizing the disks writability and leaving CD systems behind As a flagship DD game IGN found Paint Studio s well made art creation functionality to be both a low cost paint program and edutainment akin to an Adobe Photoshop for kids Knowing Nintendo s stated plans he supposed that if the platform hadn t been abruptly canceled Nintendo would have utilized Paint Studio as a source of user generated art content for a substantial library of customizable games IGN also called Wall Street a DD killer app though canceled br Schneider acknowledges Nintendo s vision attributing the system s downfall generally upon the drastically changing marketplace during the several years of delays He summarized the DD as an appealing creativity package targeted at a certain type of user that delivered a well designed user driven experience and a limited online experiment at the same time which partially fulfilled Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi s longtime dream of a network that connects Nintendo consoles all across the nation br Core Magazine honored the DD In Japanese culture there is a concept known as mono no aware While this term completely defies English translation one of its connotations is that there is nobility in things that soon perish br Nintendo reported active Randnet subscribers as of the October announcement of the service s impending closure implying the sale of at least as many requisite DD units br br br Legacy br br New genres of games were developed due to the advent of DD s rewritable mass storage real time clock RTC and Internet appliance functionality However the system s commercial failure required many DD games to be released on traditional Nintendo cartridges alone ported to other consoles or canceled br Some of these standalone Nintendo cartridge releases include the equivalent of the DD s RTC chip directly on board the cartridge as with Japan s Animal Forest The MB RAM Expansion Pak became a sometimes mandatory staple of Nintendo game development being packaged along with a few cartridge games All subsequent Nintendo consoles would directly include RTC functionality br The concept of the popular multiplatform Animal Crossing series originated with the DD s rewritable storage and RTC The eventual initial release of the series was adapted to utilize only the Nintendo cartridge format with an embedded RTC in the form of Japan s Animal Forest That game was cosmetically adapted for GameCube with the console s built in RTC and its removable and rewritable memory cards with the new name of Animal Crossing All games in the series are played in real time persistent game world with the passage of time being recorded on writable media The realtime effect reflects real seasons real holidays virtual plant growth development of virtual relationships and other events Interactivity between real human players on different subsequent console generations has been enabled through the swapping of various Nintendo consoles writable mass storage cards or through online communications br The legacy of what is now the Nintendogs series originated because of DD in the form of a pet creature breeding prototype called Cabbage Never released it had been codeveloped by Shigesato Itoi designer of EarthBound Tsunekazu Ishihara designer of Pok mon and Shigeru Miyamoto Its publicized four year development was fundamentally enabled by the real time clock and mass writability where Miyamoto explained We re doing it on the DD because I wanted to make a clock function such that even if the power is cut the game can still raise the creature and with optionally purchasable enhancement data A subset of creature maintenance functionality is made portable on the Game Boy via the Transfer Pak to be synchronized back to the DD disk In Miyamoto concluded that the conversations and design techniques that popped up when we were making Cabbage are of course connected to Nintendogs and other things that we re doing now br The concept of a personal avatar creator app which had begun with prototypes for the Famicom was solidified in Mario Artist Talent Studio and then has been seen on all subsequent Nintendo consoles Those Talent Studio avatars can be imported into select DD games including the SimCity game Nintendo designer Yamashita Takayuki credits his work on Talent Studio as having been foundational to his conception and development of the entire Mii component of the Wii platform a decade later The game s concepts were reportedly specifically foundational to the characters in Wii Tennis br The concept of graphical stamps that are seen in various Miiverse supported games is found in Mario Artist Paint Studio and Mario Paint br The user creation of graphics animations levels and minigames which are in the Mario Artist series and F Zero X Expansion Kit are revisited in later console generations The idea of minigames was popularized generally during the Nintendo s fifth generation of video game consoles Some early minigames can actually be created in Mario Artist Polygon Studio in the style that would later be used in the WarioWare series of games Certain minigames directly originated there as explained by Goro Abe of Nintendo R D s so called Wario Ware All Star Team In Polygon Studio you could create D models and animate them in the game but there was also a side game included inside In this game you would have to play short games that came one after another This is where the idea for Wario Ware came from br In historian Chris Kohler said that as one of Nintendo s oddest products the DD is now a sought after collectible and a unique piece of the company s long long history of bold experimentation br br br See also br br Famicom Modem br Famicom Disk System br Sega CD a similar peripheral
