GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create store manage and share their code It uses Git software providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control bug tracking software feature requests task management continuous integration and wikis for every project Headquartered in California it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since br It is commonly used to host open source software development projects As of January GitHub reported having over million developers and more than million repositories including at least million public repositories It is the world s largest source code host as of June br br br About br br br Founding br The development of the GitHub platform began on October The site was launched in April by Tom Preston Werner Chris Wanstrath P J Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as a beta release Its name was chosen as a compound of Git and hub br br br Structure of the organization br GitHub Inc was originally a flat organization with no middle managers instead relying on self management Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them open allocation but the chief executive set salaries br In the company added a layer of middle management in response to serious harassment allegations against its senior leadership As a result of the scandal Tom Preston Werner resigned from his position as CEO br br br Finance br GitHub was a bootstrapped start up business which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees br In July four years after the company was founded Andreessen Horowitz invested million in venture capital with a million valuation br In July GitHub raised another million million in of venture capital in a series B round The lead investor was Sequoia Capital and other investors were Andreessen Horowitz Thrive Capital IVP Institutional Venture Partners and other venture capital funds The round valued the company at approximately billion br As of GitHub was estimated to generate billion in revenue br br br History br The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath P J Hyett Tom Preston Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails and started in February The company GitHub Inc has existed as of and is located in San Francisco br br On February GitHub announced that within the first year of being online GitHub had accumulated over public repositories of which were formed in the previous month At that time about repositories had been forked at least once and had been merged br That same year the site was used by over users according to GitHub and had grown to host unique public repositories having been forked at least once for a total of repositories br In GitHub was hosting million repositories A year later this number doubled ReadWriteWeb reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of January to May On January GitHub passed the million users mark and was then hosting more than million repositories By the end of the year the number of repositories was twice as great reaching million repositories br In GitHub opened an office in Japan its first outside of the U S In GitHub was ranked No on the Forbes Cloud list It was not featured on and lists br On February GitHub fell victim to the third largest distributed denial of service DDoS attack in history with incoming traffic reaching a peak of about terabits per second br On June GitHub expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all schools br br br Acquisition by Microsoft br br From Microsoft became a significant user of GitHub using it to host open source projects and development tools such as NET Core Chakra Core MSBuild PowerShell PowerToys Visual Studio Code Windows Calculator Windows Terminal and the bulk of its product documentation now to be found on Microsoft Docs br On June Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US billion billion in The deal closed on October GitHub continued to operate independently as a community platform and business Under Microsoft the service was led by Xamarin s Nat Friedman reporting to Scott Guthrie executive vice president of Microsoft Cloud and AI Nat Friedman resigned November he was replaced by Thomas Dohmke br There have been concerns from developers Kyle Simpson JavaScript trainer and author and Rafael Laguna CEO at Open Xchange over Microsoft s purchase citing uneasiness over Microsoft s handling of previous acquisitions such as Nokia s mobile business and Skype br This acquisition was in line with Microsoft s business strategy under CEO Satya Nadella which has seen a larger focus on cloud computing services alongside the development of and contributions to open source software Harvard Business Review argued that Microsoft was intending to acquire GitHub to get access to its user base so it can be used as a loss leader to encourage the use of its other development products and services br Concerns over the sale bolstered interest in competitors Bitbucket owned by Atlassian GitLab and SourceForge owned by BIZX LLC reported that they had seen spikes in new users intending to migrate projects from GitHub to their respective services br In September GitHub acquired Semmle a code analysis tool In February GitHub launched in India under the name GitHub India Private Limited In March GitHub announced that they were acquiring npm a JavaScript packaging vendor for an undisclosed sum of money The deal was closed on April br In early July the GitHub Archive Program was established to archive its open source code in perpetuity br br br Mascot br GitHub s mascot is an anthropomorphized octocat with five octopus like arms The character was created by graphic designer Simon Oxley as clip art to sell on iStock a website that enables designers to market royalty free digital images The illustration GitHub chose was a character that Oxley had named Octopuss Since GitHub wanted Octopuss for their logo a use that the iStock license disallows they negotiated with Oxley to buy exclusive rights to the image br GitHub renamed Octopuss to Octocat and trademarked the character along with the new name Later GitHub hired illustrator Cameron McEfee to adapt Octocat for different purposes on the website and promotional materials McEfee and various GitHub users have since created hundreds of variations of the character which are available on The Octodex br br br Services br Projects on GitHub can be accessed and managed using the standard Git command line interface all standard Git commands work with it GitHub also allows users to browse public repositories on the site Multiple desktop clients and Git plugins are also available In addition the site provides social networking like functions such as feeds followers wikis using wiki software called Gollum and a social network graph to display how developers work on their versions forks of a repository and what fork and branch within that fork is newest br Anyone can browse and download public repositories but only registered users can contribute content to repositories With a registered user account users can have discussions manage repositories submit contributions to others repositories and review changes to code GitHub began offering limited private repositories at no cost in January limited to three contributors per project Previously only public repositories were free On April GitHub made all of the core GitHub features free for everyone including private repositories with unlimited collaborators br The fundamental software that underpins GitHub is Git itself written by Linus Torvalds creator of Linux The additional software that provides the GitHub user interface was written using Ruby on Rails and Erlang by GitHub Inc developers Wanstrath Hyett and Preston Werner br br br Scope br The primary purpose of GitHub is to facilitate the version control and issue tracking aspects of software development Labels milestones responsibility assignment and a search engine are available for issue tracking For version control Git and by extension GitHub allows pull requests to propose changes to the source code Users who can review the proposed changes can see a diff between the requested changes and approve them In Git terminology this action is called committing and one instance of it is a commit A history of all commits is kept and can be viewed at a later time br In addition GitHub supports the following formats and features br br Documentation including automatically rendered README files in a variety of Markdown like file formats see README On GitHub br Wikis with some repositories consisting solely of wiki content These include curated lists of recommended software which have become known as awesome lists br GitHub Actions which allows building continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for testing releasing and deploying software without the use of third party websites platforms br GitHub Codespaces an online IDE providing users with a virtual machine intended to be a work environment to build and test code br Graphs pulse contributors commits code frequency punch card network members br Integrations Directory br Email notifications br Discussions br Option to subscribe someone to notifications by mentioning them br Emojis br Nested task lists within files br Visualization of geospatial data br D render files can be previewed using an integrated STL file viewer that displays the files on a D canvas The viewer is powered by WebGL and Three js br Support for previewing many common image formats including Photoshop s PSD files br PDF document viewer br Security Alerts of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures in different packages br GitHub s Terms of Service do not require public software projects hosted on GitHub to meet the Open Source Definition The terms of service state By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly you agree to allow others to view and fork your repositories br br br GitHub Enterprise br GitHub Enterprise is a self managed version of GitHub with similar functionality It can be run on an organization s hardware or a cloud provider and has been available as of November In November source code for GitHub Enterprise Server was leaked online in an apparent protest against DMCA takedown of youtube dl According to GitHub the source code came from GitHub accidentally sharing the code with Enterprise customers themselves not from an attack on GitHub servers br br br GitHub Pages br In GitHub introduced GitHub Pages a static web hosting service for blogs project documentation and books All GitHub Pages content is stored in a Git repository as files served to visitors verbatim or in Markdown format GitHub is integrated with Jekyll static website and blog generator and GitHub continuous integration pipelines Each time the content source is updated Jekyll regenerates the website and automatically serves it via GitHub Pages infrastructure br Like the rest of GitHub it includes free and paid service tiers Websites generated through this service are hosted either as subdomains of the github io domain or can be connected to custom domains bought through a third party domain name registrar GitHub Pages supports HTTPS encryption br br br Gist br GitHub also operates a pastebin style site called Gist which is for code snippets as opposed to GitHub proper which is usually used for larger projects Tom Preston Werner d buted the feature at a Ruby conference in br Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a pastebin by adding version control for code snippets easy forking and TLS encryption for private pastes Because each gist is its own Git repository multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page and they can be pushed and pulled using Git br Unregistered users could upload Gists until March when uploading Gists was restricted to logged in users reportedly to mitigate spamming on the page of recent Gists br Gists URLs use hexadecimal IDs and edits to Gists are recorded in a revision history which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page with an option between a split and unified view Like repositories Gists can be forked starred i e publicly bookmarked and commented on The count of revisions stars and forks is indicated on the gist page br br br Education program br GitHub launched a new program called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students free access to more than a dozen popular development tools and services GitHub partnered with Bitnami Crowdflower DigitalOcean DNSimple HackHands Namecheap Orchestrate Screenhero SendGrid Stripe Travis CI and Unreal Engine to launch the program br In GitHub announced the launch of the GitHub Campus Experts program to train and encourage students to grow technology communities at their universities The Campus Experts program is open to university students years and older worldwide GitHub Campus Experts are one of the primary ways that GitHub funds student oriented events and communities Campus Experts are given access to training funding and additional resources to run events and grow their communities To become a Campus Expert applicants must complete an online training course with multiple modules to develop community leadership skills br br br GitHub Marketplace service br GitHub also provides some software as a service SaaS integrations for adding extra features to projects Those services include br br Waffle io project management for software teams which allows users to automatically see pull requests automated builds reviews and deployments across repositories br Rollbar provides real time debugging tools and full stack exception reporting br Codebeat automated code analysis for web and mobile developers br Travis CI continuous integration service br GitLocalize provides utilities to manage project translation and internationalisation br br br GitHub Sponsors br GitHub Sponsors allows users to make monthly money donations to projects hosted on GitHub The public beta was announced on May and the project accepts waitlist registrations The Verge said that GitHub Sponsors works exactly like Patreon because developers can offer various funding tiers that come with different perks and they ll receive recurring payments from supporters who want to access them and encourage their work except with zero fees to use the program Furthermore GitHub offers incentives for early adopters during the first year it pledges to cover payment processing costs and match sponsorship payments up to per developer Furthermore users can still use similar services like Patreon and Open Collective and link to their websites br br br GitHub Archive Program br In July GitHub stored a February archive of the site in an abandoned mountain mine in Svalbard Norway part of the Arctic World Archive and not far from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault The archive contained the code of all active public repositories as well as that of dormant but significant public repositories The TB of data was stored on piqlFilm archival film reels as matrix D barcode Boxing barcode and is expected to last years br The GitHub Archive Program is also working with partners on Project Silica in an attempt to store all public repositories for years It aims to write archives into the molecular structure of quartz glass platters using a high precision petahertz pulse laser i e one that pulses a quadrillion times per second br br br Controversies br br br Harassment allegations br In March GitHub programmer Julie Ann Horvath alleged that founder and CEO Tom Preston Werner and his wife Theresa engaged in a pattern of harassment against her that led to her leaving the company In April GitHub released a statement denying Horvath s allegations However following an internal investigation GitHub confirmed the claims GitHub s CEO Chris Wanstrath wrote on the company blog The investigation found Tom Preston Werner in his capacity as GitHub s CEO acted inappropriately including confrontational conduct disregard of workplace complaints insensitivity to the impact of his spouse s presence in the workplace and failure to enforce an agreement that his spouse should not work in the office Preston Werner subsequently resigned from the company The firm then announced it would implement new initiatives and trainings to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately br br br Sanctions br On July a developer based in Iran wrote on Medium that GitHub had blocked his private repositories and prohibited access to GitHub pages Soon after GitHub confirmed that it was now blocking developers in Iran Crimea Cuba North Korea and Syria from accessing private repositories However GitHub reopened access to GitHub Pages days later for public repositories regardless of location It was also revealed that using GitHub while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar actions occurring on a user s account GitHub responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson saying br br GitHub is subject to US trade control laws and is committed to full compliance with applicable law At the same time GitHub s vision is to be the global platform for developer collaboration no matter where developers reside As a result we take seriously our responsibility to examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required by law This includes keeping public repositories services including those for open source projects available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions br Developers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions including those who only travel to and do not reside in those countries GitHub has forbidden the use of VPNs and IP proxies to access the site from sanctioned countries as purchase history and IP addresses are how they flag users among other sources br br br Censorship br On December Russia blacklisted GitHub com because GitHub initially refused to take down user posted suicide manuals After a day Russia withdrew its block and GitHub began blocking specific content and pages in Russia On December India blocked GitHub com along with other websites over pro ISIS content posted by users the block was lifted three days later On October Turkey blocked GitHub to prevent email leakage of a hacked account belonging to the country s energy minister br On March a large scale DDoS attack was launched against GitHub com that lasted for just under five days The attack which appeared to originate from China primarily targeted GitHub hosted user content describing methods of circumventing Internet censorship br On April Chinese police detained Chen Mei and Cai Wei volunteers for Terminus a project hosted on GitHub and accused them of picking quarrels and provoking trouble Cai and Chen archived news articles interviews and other materials published on Chinese media outlets and social media platforms that have been removed by censors in China br br br ICE contract br br GitHub has a contract with U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE for the use of their on site product GitHub Enterprise Server This contract was renewed in despite internal opposition from many GitHub employees In an email sent to employees later posted to the GitHub blog on October CEO Nat Friedman stated The revenue from the purchase is less than and not financially material for our company He announced that GitHub had pledged to donate to nonprofit groups supporting immigrant communities targeted by the current administration In response at least GitHub employees signed an open letter re stating their opposition to the contract and denouncing alleged human rights abuses by ICE As of November five workers had resigned over the contract br The ICE contract dispute came into focus again in June due to the company s decision to abandon master slave branch terminology spurred by the George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter movement Detractors of GitHub describe the branch renaming to be a form of performative activism and have urged GitHub to cancel their ICE contract instead An open letter from members of the open source community was shared on GitHub in December demanding that the company drop its contract with ICE and provide more transparency into how they conduct business and partnerships The letter has been signed by more than people br br br Capitol riot comments and employee firing br In January GitHub fired one of its employees after he expressed concern for colleagues following the January United States Capitol attack calling some of the rioters Nazis After an investigation GitHub s COO said there were significant errors of judgment and procedure with the company s decision to fire the employee As a result of the investigation GitHub reached out to the employee and the company s head of human resources resigned br br br Twitter source code leak br In parts of the social media platform Twitter were uploaded onto GitHub The leak was first reported by the New York Times and was part of a legal filing Twitter submitted to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California Twitter claimed that the postings infringed on copyright property owned by them and asked the court for information to identify the user who posted the source code to GitHub under the username FreeSpeechEnthusiast br br br Reception br Linus Torvalds the original developer of the Git software has highly praised GitHub by stating The hosting of github sic is excellent They ve done a good job on that I think GitHub should be commended enormously for making open source project hosting so easy However he also sharply criticized the implementation of GitHub s merging interface stating that Git comes with a nice pull request generation module but GitHub instead decided to replace it with their own totally inferior version As a result I consider GitHub useless for these kinds of things It s fine for hosting but the pull requests and the online commit editing are just pure garbage br br br Developed projects br Atom a free and open source text and source code editor discontinued in br Electron an open source framework to use JavaScript based websites as desktop applications br br br See also br br Collaborative innovation network br Collaborative intelligence br Commons based peer production br Comparison
