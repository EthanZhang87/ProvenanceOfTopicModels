The Nintendo DS is a handheld game console produced by Nintendo Announced in August the device was released in North America Europe and Australia on October The Nintendo DS is an entry level version of the Nintendo DS which maintains otherwise identical hardware similar functionality and compatibility with software designed for the Nintendo DS and DS However the DS is differentiated by a new slate form factor rather than the clamshell design used by its precursors and by lacking the Nintendo DS s signature autostereoscopic D display The DS was sold concurrently with existing DS models as an incentive to expand the market for Nintendo DS games former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aim stated that the DS was primarily targeted towards younger players such as those younger than age whom Nintendo had previously advised not to use the D functionality on the DS due to potential eye health concerns The Nintendo DS s successor the New Nintendo DS XL was launched in br Reception to the Nintendo DS was mixed while Nintendo was praised for how it priced and positioned the DS alongside its higher end counterparts much of its criticism was directed towards its regressions in comparison to the DS such as a design that some considered less appealing than that of the DS its lower sound quality and its battery life However the DS s design was praised by some critics for being more robust and comfortable to hold than the DS especially for its target market Some critics also felt that the lack of D support was an admission by Nintendo that the concept was a gimmick however Nintendo has since stated that autostereoscopic D would remain a part of their future plans The Nintendo DS was discontinued in Japan in and in the rest of the world in along with the other systems in the Nintendo DS family br br br History br Nintendo officially unveiled the DS on August via a press release members of the press were given a chance to demo the device in private prior to the announcement According to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aim the Nintendo DS is primarily aimed at a younger demographic than the Nintendo DS particularly those younger than years old whom Nintendo had advised not to use the D features on the DS due to potential eye health concerns The validity of Nintendo s claims were questioned by vision experts however who believed that the DS could actually help detect certain eye problems and felt the warnings were for liability reasons rather than any realistic harm br With the DS the company aimed to produce a device that would be new unique different and bring more people into this category that we love Part of this goal was achieved by positioning the device at a lower price point than the DS in the United States the system retailed at US on launch in comparison to the US price of the standard DS By May the U S price had been lowered further to br As part of a promotional effort for Nintendo s late releases the

future shipments of the Black Blue White Orange and Purple Silver models would come with a pre installed copy of Mario Kart br As of September the New DS XL and all other remaining models in the DS family have been discontinued by Nintendo br br br Hardware br br The Nintendo DS s hardware specifications are almost identical to those of the Nintendo DS retaining features such as its GPU CPU and memory along with compatibility with games designed for the Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS However its hardware still contains some slight differences Unlike the Nintendo DS which uses two display panels with a lower touchscreen panel and a top dual layered screen panel capable of displaying autostereoscopic D the Nintendo DS uses a single non stereoscopic LCD touchscreen which is overlaid with a frame mimicking the screen dimensions of the DS Despite its inability to display D content the DS retains the DS s dual cameras for taking photographs in a D format The Nintendo DS only has an internal mono speaker as opposed to the internal stereo speakers of the DS although stereo sound can still be output through the headphone jack br The Nintendo DS s design is a significant departure from that of its precursors while it is roughly the same size as its counterpart the DS uses a slate like form factor instead of the clamshell form used by the DS and DS Its buttons are positioned towards the center of the device instead of near the lower screen and its shoulder buttons are concave in shape and relatively thicker than those of the DS The DS uses a switch for entering sleep mode in lieu of closing the shell and the hardware wireless switch was replaced by a software toggle br The Nintendo DS contains the same mAh battery present on regular Nintendo DS systems Despite not supporting the DS s automatic brightness setting Power Save Mode the DS was rated by Nintendo as having slightly longer battery life than the DS Nintendo rated the DS as being able to play from to hours of DS games or to hours of DS games on a single charge br br br New Nintendo DS XL br br Like the DS the New DS XL lacks D functionality but otherwise has similar hardware to the New Nintendo DS This includes a more powerful processor than the DS an analog pointing stick additional shoulder buttons and built in support for Amiibo use Unlike the New DS the New DS XL has its microphone and camera on the hinge with its speakers located on the lower half of the device It is able to play video games that only it and the New DS model and its variants are able to play including Xenoblade Chronicles D Fire Emblem Warriors and Super Nintendo Entertainment System digital re releases br br br Software and services br br Aside from minor adjustments to reflect its hardware design differences the system software of the Nintendo DS is otherwise identical to that of the DS remaining compatible with all games released for the DS in two dimensional mode only and DS excluding those requiring the Game Boy Advance cartridge slot and offering online features such as Nintendo Network for multiplayer and online gaming Nintendo eShop for downloading and purchasing games and SpotPass and StreetPass br br br Reception br br br Pre release br The Nintendo DS received mixed reception upon its announcement Kotaku felt that the Nintendo DS might appeal to a certain niche of people who otherwise would not purchase a Nintendo DS and that the lack of D support could indicate a cooling interest in stereoscopic graphics USA Today noted that some games that were designed with D in mind might not be as easily playable without the stereoscopic feature CNET meanwhile called the console an acknowledgement by Nintendo that D was an unnecessary feature and even a tactical mistake NBC News called the DS a peculiar choice to gamers satisfied with the Nintendo DS line and feared that it might take resources away from the less successful Nintendo console the Wii U br Some technology writers have expressed concern with the physical appearance of the DS CNET considered the console to be significantly less aesthetically pleasing than its other models though some reviewers have generally found it to be comfortable in the hand USA Today referred to it as surprisingly comfortable Kotaku noted that while it may look bulky it was pleasant to hold even with one hand It also noted that buttons on the unit were easily accessible and that their placement on the upper half of the console directs the eye toward the upper screen Overall the publication felt that the build quality was good GamesIndustry also described the controls as considerably more comfortable than that of its predecessors It also noted that the console had thick shell rather than the thin Nintendo DS and that the lack of a hinge added durability The publication felt that the design resembled an unholy union of a Game Boy the Wii U GamePad and a DS USA Today and CNET both had some concern over how to protect the screens since there is no clamshell to close br In response to the DS using one physical display divided to emulate two Kyle Orland of Ars Technica believed that Nintendo had missed an opportunity to produce a full screen gaming tablet using the DS s form factor which would have enabled future games and apps to use the entire screen area which he estimated to be around the inch range used by phablets still allow backward compatibility with games designed for the folding DS and DS and enhance the ability to port existing smartphone games to the platform However Orland also noted that introducing such a product could fragment Nintendo s portable gaming ecosystem for existing DS users and that it was too early in the DS s life for Nintendo to introduce a successor Nearly years after the release of the DS Nintendo would ultimately announce the Nintendo Switch a hybrid gaming tablet with detachable wireless controllers and support of a docking station for use with a television br Calling it a smart move to redesign the Nintendo DS so as to lower costs Wired felt that the DS might enable Nintendo to sell the console at a significantly lower price with a significantly higher profit margin br br br Post release br The Nintendo DS has received mixed reviews While pricing and form factor were generally considered ideal the console s aesthetics and battery life were widely criticized The Telegraph noted that the lack of hinges in the console improved its robustness and that rounding out the footprint makes it an ideal handheld for children However the publication criticized the console s mono speaker which offered a lower sound quality than its predecessors It also criticized the battery life which it described as being the same as the original DS model On the other hand it praised the screens brighter display and wider viewing angle despite their not being as large as those of the DS XL Eurogamer reinforced the idea that the Nintendo DS isn t aimed at seasoned players or current Nintendo DS owners and felt that the system wasn t produced with aesthetics in mind The publication also criticized the resistive touchscreen which felt outdated the mono speaker and battery life However Eurogamer felt that the system is much more comfortable to hold than the Nintendo DS and DS XL Analyst Piers Harding Rolls felt that the Nintendo DS would help Nintendo broaden its market and believes that third party publishers will have more commitment to the platform moving forward br Following the system s launch Nintendo stated that the release of Sonic Lost World would boost Nintendo DS sales labeling it as a must play title On October Nintendo president Satoru Iwata admitted that the Nintendo DS lacked awareness among prospective purchasers Additionally he went on to say that some potential consumers believed that the product was too large and heavy to carry However Iwata stated that the system was well received among those who had purchased it Despite the DS s lack of D support Satoru Iwata insisted during Nintendo s third quarter investors Q A that the company will not abandon D or cease to make new propositions in D as it will continue to sell the existing Nintendo DS and DS XL platforms However The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds producer Eiji Aonuma revealed in an interview that the game had minor changes in development due to the lack of D on the DS br br br New Nintendo DS XL br IGN considered the New DS XL to be an improvement over the ugly doorstop like DS praising its incorporation of features from the New DS XL into a device with a thinner and more comfortable form factor Other changes were noted such as using flaps to protect the game and SD card slots the latter also removing the need to use tools to access it and better feeling shoulder buttons than the New DS XL Regressions were also noted however such as its screens having a washed out appearance and lacking contrast the top screen having a mirror like coat that diminished viewing angles the speakers sounding muffled and the short length of the included stylus The New DS XL was recommended for users who did not need D but still wanted to play the platform s exclusive titles TechRadar was similarly positive but also noting that the hinge now protruded from the back of the device thus making it look less streamlined when closed its battery life was underwhelming and the timing of its launch was at odds with the release of Nintendo Switch br br br Sales br Sales of the Nintendo DS surged three weeks after launching in the United Kingdom after retailers cut on its price due to poor sales The system was available for around but major retailers including Argos Amazon and Tesco cut the system s price to under to coincide with the school half term As a result sales of the Nintendo DS increased by week on week making it the UK s best selling console of the month without combining the sales of the Nintendo DS and its larger counterpart During the third quarter of video game retailer GameStop reported that worldwide hardware sales grew by mainly due to strong Nintendo DS and DS
