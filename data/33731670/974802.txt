found displayed across the walls of numerous habitation sites all over the world such as depictions of mimi s in Australia or the Indalo in Spain br Tens of thousands of years later writing systems

what would become the international system of typographic picture education or isotype a system of conveying warnings statistics and general information through standardized and easily understandable pictographs Neurath made significant use of the versatile stick figure design to represent individuals and statistics in a variety of ways Graphic designer Rudolf Modley founded Pictorial Statistics Inc in and brought the isotype system to the United States in br br The first international use of stick figures dates back to the Summer Olympics in Tokyo Pictograms created by Japanese designers Masaru Katsumi and Yoshiro Yamashita formed the basis of future pictograms In Otto Otl Aicher developed the round ended geometric grid based stick figures used on the signage printed materials and television for the Summer Olympics in Munich Drawing on those and many other similar symbol sets in use at the time the American Institute of Graphic Arts AIGA commissioned by the U S Department of
