advantages upon its release the TurboExpress was not widely recognized or adopted by consumers In addition to NEC s marketing issues the handheld was initially released for significantly higher than popular competitors Because of this price tag it was labeled as the Rolls Royce of handheld systems On the other hand the ability to run the same software as its console counterpart meant that additional portable system specific software did not have to be purchased if already owning the console resulting in a oftentimes substantial cost savings br br br Hardware br br The screen is sized

the art when it was released The LCD technology used was still fairly new and the rate of pixel failure was very high Brand new TurboExpress systems often had several bad pixels Text is also difficult or impossible to read in certain circumstances as many times fonts were written to be seen on a television screen not on a small LCD screen As a result certain RPGs and adventure games can be difficult to play on the unit br The TurboExpress plays the same game cartridges as the TurboGrafx home console Some TurboGrafx HuCards save game data to the internal memory of the TurboGrafx CD unit TurboDuo or TurboBooster Plus a peripheral for the core TG console The TurboExpress lacks this internal memory and as a result is not capable of saving in this manner Most games provide a password

back to playing games with the flip of a switch in other words one may use the TurboExpress as a video monitor It includes an RCA audio video input for external composite video signals Due to the widespread adoption of digital television and the HDTV standard however the adapter will no longer function as a television in most places due to the lack of any HDTV digital processing circuitry the tuner can only process an analog signal for television Due to this limitation the TV tuner adapter is now relegated to a collectible for most people although its RCA audio video input function will still be operational albeit limited with its low screen resolution br br br Reception br Computer Gaming World favorably compared TurboExpress to the Game Boy but stated that the NEC handheld gobbles power like crazy almost forcing players to immediately purchase an AC adapter The magazine nonetheless praised its compatibility with TurboGrafx games and concluded to see this machine in action is to fall in love with it br Entertainment Weekly praised the new bit computer architecture of the system and the graphics of the games but warned that the small screen is a downgrade for those used to playing the games on a big screen br br br See also br TurboGrafx br TurboGrafx Mini a home video game console with a TurboExpress display option br br br br br br Other sources br The Electronic
