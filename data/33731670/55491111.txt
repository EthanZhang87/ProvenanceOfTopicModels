and The Thousand Year Door br br br Intelligent Systems was founded after Tohru Narihiro was hired as an employee by Nintendo to port games on the Famicom Disk System to cartridges in the s Narihiro went on to develop successful games in the Wars and Fire Emblem series which allowed him to expand his company with additional artists and developers br Super Mario RPG which was released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES was the first Mario role playing game and was developed by Square Square used experimental gameplay mechanics such as timed button presses to deal more damage in combat to try to ease fans into finding interest in the genre Although Nintendo wanted Square to create another RPG game Square later signed a deal with Sony Interactive Entertainment to create Final Fantasy VII on the original PlayStation Instead Nintendo hired Intelligent Systems to create an RPG for their newest console the Nintendo Game development began shortly after the console s release in Japan in The game produced by Shigeru Miyamoto was originally planned to be a sequel to Super Mario RPG Super Mario RPG used a similar graphics style to its predecessor and was to be released on the DD a disk drive add on for the Nintendo Naohiko Aoyama the game s art designer later switched the graphics to a paper like style because he believed players might prefer a game with cute D character designs instead of one with low polygon D graphics Development took four years and was released in August towards the end of the console s lifecycle with the GameCube nearing announcement The game was titled Mario Story in Japan and Paper Mario in North America br At the Game Developers Conference Nintendo announced a direct sequel to the previous game The Thousand Year Door The game had a playable demo at E and was released worldwide later that year as The Thousand Year Door internationally and Paper Mario RPG in Japan By the time the game was released another series of Mario RPGs Mario Luigi was created for Nintendo s handheld consoles The first game in the series Superstar Saga was developed by AlphaDream and released for the Game Boy Advance in Kensuke Tanabe the supervisor of The Thousand Year Door and assistant producer Risa Tabata drew inspiration from Miyamoto to introduce different gameplay concepts to make the series more entertaining In a interview Tanabe acknowledged the difficulty of maintaining motivation when every game in the series is the same leading them to explore bigger changes in each game s gameplay and design team br br br present Change in genre concepts and philosophy br br The series underwent changes in an attempt to reach new and various audiences For Super Paper Mario game director Ryota Kawade wanted to surprise fans of the series with new concepts that did not appear in the previous games When the idea of being able to alternatively switch from D to D was conceptualized he presented the idea to the new producer Tanabe When Tanabe approved they both agreed that the idea would work well as an action adventure video game rather than an RPG and real time combat was also introduced to fit the idea Despite the changes Tanabe asked the writers to keep the plot similar to a role playing game s Super Paper Mario was announced for the GameCube at E but it was ported to the Wii in mid before being released in April Since the game was intended to be played on a GameCube controller it did not take full advantage of Wii s new motion controls br Trailers for Sticker Star were shown at E E and Nintendo World but its title was not announced until E and the game was released later in the year As Miyamoto was no longer the series producer he asked the developers to not create any new characters and instead use established pre existing ones in the Mario franchise Nintendo s intellectual property team enforced this statement into future games in the series He also asked to change the combat system from The Thousand Year Door and to remove most of the story elements due to early feedback from fans br br br br Paper Jam s development was mainly inspired by Sticker Star AlphaDream wanted to use a third button to control a third character in their newest game and felt Paper Mario would fit the role Every game in the series from Color Splash onward has a white paper outline around Mario the developers of Paper Jam needed to differentiate the characters from the separate series br As the Wii U has more graphical power than previous Nintendo consoles development for Color Splash emphasized the console s graphics and controls The artists made the graphics look like paper and craft materials and the Wii U GamePad heavily influenced player combat as the developers found the motion controls fun to use Producer Kensuke Tenabe limited the variety of character designs and continued to exempt original characters out of respect to series creator Shigeru Miyamoto The game was announced via a Nintendo Direct presentation in early The game received negative reception afterwards as fans were frustrated the series was following an action adventure genre format like Sticker Star Tanabe mentioned that Mario Luigi would replace Paper Mario as the RPG series and Tabata noted that the Paper Mario series would focus more on non RPG elements such as puzzle solving and humor to differentiate the two The game released worldwide in early October and became the lowest selling game in the series possibly due to the low sales of the Wii U and the announcement of the Nintendo Switch prior to its release Paper Jam was the last game in the Mario Luigi series created by AlphaDream before the company filed for bankruptcy in br br Paper Mario The Origami King was planned to be announced for the th anniversary of Super Mario Bros in early September but was instead announced in mid May the same year Soon after the game s ROM was leaked the game released worldwide in mid July The Origami King is the first game in the series that Miyamoto was not actively involved with Despite the appearance some iconic characters from the mainline Mario series and the return of allies critics were still disappointed in their lack of role in the plot and other gameplay aspects The game features large overworlds instead of linear based levels in the previous games br In a interview with Video Games Chronicle Tanabe reaffirmed from previous interviews that while he makes note of general criticisms he makes sure not to ignore casual players and new fans of the series With this in mind The Origami King greatly focused on puzzle solving Tanabe said that he could not satisfy every fan amidst the core veterans and casual players and instead attempted to gravitate towards new concepts which is why The Origami King used origami as a new paper like theme Tanabe explained how the game s writing was kept broad in its context and format so it could be understood by other ages and cultures He has since kept away from a complicated plot due to how it led the game away from the Mario universe and instead created a story where different locales would be tied to specific memorable events Tanabe also noted that it was no longer possible to bring back original characters since Sticker Star br As the final announcement of a Nintendo Direct on September Nintendo announced a remake of The Thousand Year Door set to release on the Nintendo Switch in It features remastered HD graphics and retains the arts and crafts visual style that was established in Color Splash and The Origami King br br br Reception and

stickers were not well received While some critics enjoyed the additional layer of strategy like Philip Kollar of Polygon considering it engaging multiple functions of the stickers were criticized Thing Stickers were considered one of the game s biggest weaknesses and stickers in general were disliked for having only one solution to each puzzle and frequently requiring players to backtrack Sticker Star was overall disdained by fans for the loss of a strategic combat system br Upon its reveal fans criticized Color Splash for continuing the trend of action adventure installments and a Change org petition calling for its cancellation was created The game was initially disparaged further when it was announced but received generally positive reviews upon release Most reviewers praised the redefined graphics and soundtrack but combat was considered too simplistic and some reviewers noted its lack of overall necessity to the game Giant Bomb reviewer Dan Ryckert observed that the primary function of coins was to buy cards for combat which awarded coins in return he considered the overall system pointless Ryckert also criticized the depiction of characters such as the abundance of Toads for lacking in original designs that past entries had br br The Origami King re added favored RPG elements and removed unwanted features though it was still criticized for continuing the action adventure format It was praised for its interactive elements writing characters and worldbuilding Of these elements were hidden Toads which reviewers commonly called fun and enjoyable

Fables The Everlasting Sapling the Paper Mario series was a major inspiration for the game s development Bug Fables is similar to the first two games in the Paper Mario series which Gracia considers to be the reason for the game s success He said that creating a combat system similar to Paper Mario was simple but not as much as maintaining a similar style of humor Nicolas Lamarche who is
