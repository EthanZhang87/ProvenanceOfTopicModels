The GP GamePark is a handheld game console developed by the South Korean company Game Park It was released on November in South Korea and distributed in some parts of Europe br br br History br The GP was shown at E in and At one point GamePark produced an unreleased unit with mobile phone functionality br br br Features br The overall design is not unlike the original version of the Game Boy Advance The GP is based on a MHz ARM CPU and MB of SDRAM Unlike other handheld gaming systems which tend to be proprietary cartridge based the GP uses SmartMedia cards SMC for storing programs and data making it accessible for amateur developers as no further development hardware is required br The console has an eight way microswitch based mini joystick controller two main buttons A and B two shoulder buttons on each side of the SMC slot L and R and two other menu buttons on each side of the screen SELECT and START made from a softer translucent rubber The console also has a USB port for connection with a host computer a serial expansion port a V power adapter input a headphone connector and a rear compartment that holds two AA sized batteries br br br Variants br There are three main commercial versions of the unit characterized by different display types Commercial units are white in color with either grey or white buttons and trim There are also a number of differently colored promotional units and several prototype units with different designs br br br GP NLU br The original GP was the no light unit NLU which relied on an external light source to view the screen br br br GP FLU br In late Game Park introduced the frontlight unit FLU as a factory modified by Hahotech version of the NLU It provides its own illumination via a transparent panel between the LCD display and the plastic screen cover The extra hardware resulted in a slightly raised display frame when compared to the NLU and BLU variants The front light could be turned off with a switch mounted on the back of the GP case to save battery br The GP FLU s name was derived from a sticker added to the front of the GP packaging differentiating it from the standard non light versions br br br GP BLU br In mid Game Park introduced the backlight unit BLU The new BLU LCD was compatible with the NLU and FLU and provided a superior screen display in poor lighting conditions At the end of Game Park also released a second version of the BLU which had a different LCD from the first version of BLU units The new BLU LCD was not compatible with the original LCD screen and so software required special handling to support both LCD versions br The backlight could be disabled by holding the SELECT button for seconds The BLU models also had a slightly different USB port connector and better quality micro switches for the controller br br br Software br br br Built In br The original Game Park firmware had three main functions to launch applications provide a means of linking to a host computer and play music in MP format br Later versions of the Game Park firmware removed the MP music capability br br br Homebrew br Game Park planned their system to be powerful and useful but they also wanted users to be able to create homebrew software GP users could register the unit on the official website and get a free suite of development tools to create their own programs Game Park also allowed under certain restrictions the publishing of such homebrew games on their website br The GP s original firmware only supported running encrypted games and tools Users had to register and use an encrypted Free Launcher to run unsigned software Alternative firmware removed the necessity of using the Free Launcher software and provided many extra functions that were lacking in the original firmware br Through this strategy the GP was the host of multiple homebrew applications and games The various applications made for it ranged from alternative firmware file managers games emulators game generators such as RPG Maker a DivX player and image slideshows br br br Commercial br Commercial games could be acquired via internet download encrypted to the GP s ID or in a retail box The retail boxes contained SmartMedia Cards with the games which were encrypted to run only from these cards SMC ID They could alternatively be downloaded from a Korean portal after submitting the GP s ID they were then encrypted to run only on that GP Downloading the games effectively reduced the cost to the consumer who was no longer paying for the manufacture of the cartridge Downloading a game online could range from US to US br br br Games br br Five games in a variety of genres were released at the system s launch on November About commercial games were eventually released The last commercial game to be released was the platformer RPG Blue Angelo which was released on December Most commercial GP games could be bought in two ways boxed or downloaded through the internet through Gamepark s online JoyGP store typically for a much lower price JoyGP was the international version of the MegaGP store which existed earlier and was limited to South Korea Although most games were sold in both formats there were a few exceptions for example Blue Angelo was and is only sold as a boxed copy made in France and Gloop Deluxe was only sold online but not through JoyGP br Although the number of official games available for the GP system is limited many open source free software developers worked on various emulators and ported PC games In addition to this a wide range of free public domain games were created by amateur developers Game Park did not ask any royalties to release games for its device which made it easier for small editors or independent developers to release software for the GP br br The modification of Ericsson Chatboard micro keyboards to work with the system has seen a new flourish of software development including countless attempts at ports of Linux and keyboard support being added to many emulators br br br Emulators br The GP s relatively powerful ARM T CPU and freely available C based SDK have allowed many emulators to be specifically developed or ported from other platforms Emulated systems that run on the GP include bit era and earlier console and computer platforms These emulators allow users to experience a large variety of games on their GP system largely compensating for the relatively small library of commercially available games br There is also a Windows based GP emulator which allows users to run GP software on a Windows based PC br br br Commercial availability br Commercially the system can be found mostly in Korea and some other parts of Asia Although an initial European release was abandoned the GP BLU model was released in three European markets including Portugal Spain and Italy being distributed by Virgin Play on June with a price point of There were official distributors in the United Kingdom and Sweden as well Game Park however did not release the console in America Since the GP is no longer in production the console can commonly be found on eBay forums or other used video game vendors or websites br Despite the GP not being released worldwide it has a large international community of users and developers About or units were sold by the end of br br br Hardware br br br Successors br GP X dual CPU unit produced
