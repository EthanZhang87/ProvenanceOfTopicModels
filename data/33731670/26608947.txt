Nelsonic Industries is an American electronics manufacturing and development company that operated from Long Island City Queens New York City in the early s and throughout the s when it was acquired by the watch manufacturer M Z Berger Nelsonic produced numerous toy themed wristwatches often targeting younger audiences with likenesses of characters from popular franchises such as Barbie the Ghostbusters and Mario Nelsonic became notable during the early mid s for being the first electronics company in the United States to produce game watches multi purpose electronic devices capable of functioning as both a time piece and as a typically electronic game For a period subsequent to its purchase by M Z Berger Nelsonic operated as a subsidiary division of its parent company and game watches were produced that bore the Nelsonic mark This practice ended as M Z Berger shifted focus to more traditional and higher end timepieces Today the original Nelsonic Game Watch line has entered the secondary market and individual Game Watches have become highly sought after collectibles that often fetch high prices on eBay and other online auction websites br br br History br Throughout its existence Nelsonic produced pop culture themed wrist watches for children and young adults The chronograph digital watches typically made of molded plastic invariably featured an alarm and utilized LCD screens to display the time for their wearers In time the company began manufacturing multi purpose units that used the LCD screen to combine time display functions with simple video game functions These simple video games were variations on the theme of the calculator watch and the patent covering the Game Watch line is in fact classified as an electronic calculator watch structure The company s first game watch was called Space Attacker Becoming the first electronics manufacturer in the United States to produce game watches Nelsonic earned a large share in this specialized market and was able to earn the attention of large video game companies at events such as the Consumer Electronics Show Having caught the popular attention and with goodwill at a high point Nelsonic was able to obtain licensing from several big name video game companies such as Sega Nintendo Midway Games and Mylstar Electronics With roots in the toy market Nelsonic was also able to obtain similar licenses to produce LCD versions of popular electronic toys like Milton Bradley s Simon as well as to produce original LCD games for non game toy franchises like Barbie G I Joe and Power Rangers and even for film and TV franchises such as Ghostbusters So well known became the Nelsonic brand that it was even able to license its own original games such as the Nelsonic version of the public domain blackjack which was licensed to Caesars Palace br As time progressed Nelsonic experimented with higher end products such as metal watches and increasingly complex game watch designs In the watch making giant M Z Berger made a large bid and was able to successfully purchase the company For a period of nearly a decade after this acquisition M Z Berger continued to use Nelsonic as a subsidiary branch and to employ the Nelsonic mark in the release of game watches and the production of new re releases of popular models from the s and early s By the end of the s however public interest had waned quite possibly due to the rise in popularity of more advanced handheld video game consoles and eventually of other portable computing devices such as PDAs and smartphones and this practice came to an end as M Z Berger shifted markets to target higher end consumers more exclusively br Today the Nelsonic mark is still in use for traditional watches and is not used in connection with game watches It is still a subsidiary of M Z Berger and as recently as it was listed by the AAFES as garnering over million in sales br br br Game watches br Below is a list of units sold by Nelsonic as
