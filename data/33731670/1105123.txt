The Super FX is a coprocessor on the Graphics Support Unit GSU added to select Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES video game cartridges primarily to facilitate advanced D and D graphics The Super FX chip was designed by Argonaut Games who also co developed the D space rail shooter video game Star Fox with Nintendo to demonstrate the additional polygon rendering capabilities that the chip had introduced to the SNES br br br History br The Super FX chip design team included engineers Ben Cheese Rob Macaulay and James Hakewill While in development the Super FX chip was codenamed Super Mario FX and MARIO MARIO a backronym for Mathematical Argonaut Rotation Input Output is printed on the face of the final production chip The chip s name would lead to an urban legend that Super Mario FX was a video game in development for the SNES br Because of high manufacturing costs and increased development time few Super FX based games were made compared to the rest of the SNES library Due to these increased costs Super FX games often retailed at a higher MSRP compared to other SNES games br According to Argonaut Games founder Jez San Argonaut had initially intended to develop the Super FX chip for the Nintendo Entertainment System The team programmed an NES version of the first person combat flight simulator Starglider which Argonaut had developed for the Atari ST and other home computers a few years earlier and showed it to Nintendo in The prototype impressed the company but they suggested that they develop games for the then unreleased Super Famicom due to the NES s hardware becoming outdated in light of newer systems such as the Sega Genesis Mega Drive and the TurboGrafx PC Engine Shortly after the Consumer Electronics Show held in Chicago Illinois Argonaut ported the NES version of Starglider to the Super Famicom a process which took roughly one week according to San br br br Function br The Super FX chip is used to render D polygons and to assist the SNES in rendering advanced D effects This custom made RISC processor is typically programmed to act like a graphics accelerator chip that draws polygons to a frame buffer in the RAM that sits adjacent to it The data in this frame buffer is periodically transferred to the main video memory inside of the console using DMA in order to show up on the television display br The first version of the chip commonly referred to as simply Super FX is clocked with a MHz signal but an internal clock speed divider halves it to MHz Later on the design was revised to become the Super FX GSU Graphics Support Unit this unlike the first Super FX chip revision is able to reach MHz br All versions of the Super FX chip are functionally compatible in terms of their instruction set The differences arise in how they are packaged their pinout and their internal clock speed As a result of changing the package when creating the GSU more external pins were available and assigned for addressing As a result a larger amount of external ROM or RAM can be accessed br br br Usage br Star Fox uses the chip for the rendering of hundreds of simultaneous D polygons It uses scaled D bitmaps for lasers asteroids and other obstacles but other objects such as ships are rendered with D polygons Super Mario World Yoshi s Island uses the chip for D graphics effects like sprite scaling and stretching br Game cartridges that contain a Super FX chip have additional contacts at the bottom of the cartridge that connect to the extra slots in the cartridge port that are not otherwise typically used Therefore Super FX games cannot be plugged into cartridge adapters which predate the release of Super FX games This includes cheat devices such as the Game Genie br br br List of games br br br Unreleased games br Comanche br FX Fighter br Powerslide developed at the same time as Dirt Racer br Star Fox eventually released with the Super NES Classic Edition in br Transformers Generation abandoned during development br Yoshi Racing prototype that later evolved into Croc Legend of the Gobbos br br br Gallery br Variants of the Super FX chip sorted chronologically br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br See also br List of Super NES enhancement chips br ARC processor br Sega Genesis Sega Virtua Processor br Synopsys ARC International continued development Super FX technology br br br br br br External links br br Nintendo Land Tech Page Archived from the original on April Retrieved May
