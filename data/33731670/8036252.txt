The Hollywood graphics chip is the graphics processing unit GPU used in Nintendo s Wii video game console It was designed by ATI now AMD and was manufactured using the same nm or nm depending on the hardware revision CMOS process as Broadway the Wii s central processing unit Very few official details about Hollywood were released to the public by Nintendo ATI or any other company involved in the Wii s development The Hollywood GPU is reportedly based on the GameCube s Flipper GPU and is clocked higher at MHz though these clock rates have never been officially confirmed br Hollywood is a multi chip module MCM package containing three dies under the cover in the Hollywood A revision The first of these three dies codenamed Vegas controls the I O functions RAM access the Audio DSP and the actual GPU with its embedded DRAM and measures mm The other codenamed Napa holds MB of internal T SRAM and measures mm A third tiny die contains EEPROM The Hollywood revision codenamed Bollywood was fabricated on a nm node and merges Napa and Vegas into a single die resulting in a two die MCM br br br Hardware capabilities br MHz graphics chip br MB embedded GPU memory eDRAM br MB dedicated to Z buffer and framebuffer br MB texture cache br MB T SRAM MHz GB s directly accessible for textures and other video data br Fixed function pipeline no support for programmable vertex or pixel shaders in hardware br Texture Environment Unit TEV capable of combining up to textures in up to stages or passes br GB s internal bandwidth br million polygons second br Mpixels sec peak pixel fillrate br Note denotes speculation using confirmed AMD GameCube data x a crude but likely accurate way of calculating the Wii s results based on clock speeds and identical architecture br br br Texture Environment Unit br The Texture Environment Unit TEV is a unique piece of hardware exclusive to the GameCube and Wii The Wii inherited the TEV from Flipper and the TEV is to use an analogy from Factor director Julian Eggebrecht like an elaborate switchboard that makes the wildest combinations of textures and materials possible br The TEV pipeline combines up to textures in up to stages at once Each stage can apply a multitude of functions to the texture This was frequently used to simulate pixel shader effects such as bump mapping or to perform effects such as cel shading On the GameCube Factor s Star Wars Rogue Squadron II used the TEV for the targeting computer effect and the simulated volumetric fog In another scenario Wave Race Blue Storm used the TEV notably for water distortion such as refraction and other water effects The Wii s TEV unit and TEV capabilities are no different from the GameCube s excluding indirect performance advantages from the faster clock speeds br br br Starlet br Hollywood contains an ARM EJ S core which has been unofficially nicknamed Starlet This embedded microprocessor runs an undocumented operating system called IOS and performs many of the Wii s I O functions including controlling the wireless functionality USB the SD card interface the optical disc drive the internal NAND flash storage WiiConnect when the console is in standby mode and other miscellaneous functions The Starlet acts as the security controller of the console performing various cryptography functions Starlet is designed to remain secure even if the Broadway is compromised Hollywood includes hardware implementations of AES and SHA to speed up Starlet s security functionality Communication between the Starlet and the Broadway is accomplished via an IPC mechanism Starlet has complete control over Broadway the former can reboot the latter and supply it with code to execute at any time br br br
