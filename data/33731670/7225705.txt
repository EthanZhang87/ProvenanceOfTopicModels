id: 7225705
The history of Nintendo is from to the present starting as a playing card company to eventually becoming a multinational video game conglomerate It has always remained headquartered in Kyoto Japan br Nintendo was founded in by Fusajiro Yamauchi to produce handmade hanafuda playing cards br br br Hanafuda cards br br Nintendo was founded as Yamauchi Nintendo by Fusajiro Yamauchi on September Based in Kyoto Japan the business produced and marketed hanafuda The name Nintendo is commonly assumed to mean leave luck to heaven but there are no historical records to validate this The handmade cards soon gained popularity so Yamauchi hired assistants to mass produce cards br Fusajiro Yamauchi did not have a son to take over the family business Following the common Japanese tradition of mukoy shi he adopted his son in law Sekiryo Kaneda who then legally took his wife s last name of Yamauchi In Fusajiro Yamauchi retired and allowed Kaneda to take over as president In Sekiryo Kaneda established a joint venture with another company and renamed it Yamauchi Nintendo Co br br In Sekiryo established a distribution company Marufuku Co Ltd to distribute the hanafuda and several other types of cards produced by Nintendo Sekiryo Kaneda also had only daughters so again his son in law Shikanojo Inaba renamed Shikanojo Yamauchi was adopted into the family Yamauchi later abandoned his family and did not become company president Subsequently his son Hiroshi Yamauchi was brought up by his grandparents and he later took over the company instead of his father br br br Disney tie in and public listing br br In Hiroshi Yamauchi attended Waseda University in Tokyo However after his grandfather suffered a debilitating stroke he left to take office as the president of Nintendo In he renamed Marufuku Co Ltd to Nintendo Karuta and in to Nintendo Karuta writing karuta as rather than In Nintendo became the first company in Japan to produce playing cards from plastic br In Yamauchi visited the U S to engage in talks with the United States Playing Card Company USPCC the dominant playing card manufacturer in the United States based in Cincinnati He was shocked to find that the world s biggest company in his business was relegated to using a small office This was a turning point for Yamauchi who then realized the limitations of the playing card business br In Nintendo made a deal with Disney to allow the use of Disney s characters on Nintendo s playing cards Previously Western playing cards were regarded as something similar to hanafuda and mahjong a device for gambling By tying playing cards to Disney and selling books explaining the different games playable with the cards Nintendo could sell the product to Japanese households The tie in was a success and the company sold at least card packs in one year Due to this success in Yamauchi took Nintendo public listing the company in Osaka Stock Exchange Second division br In Nintendo Playing Card Co Ltd was renamed to Nintendo by Yamauchi Nintendo now began to experiment in other areas of business using the newly injected capital This included establishing a food company in partnership with two other firms with a product line featuring instant rice similar to instant noodles a vacuum cleaner and Chiritory which later appeared in a two player minigame in WarioWare Inc Mega Microgame in All these ventures eventually failed except toymaking based on some earlier experience from selling playing cards In while Japan was experiencing an economic boom due to the Tokyo Olympics the playing card business reached saturation Japanese households stopped buying playing cards and the price of Nintendo stock fell from yen to yen br In Nintendo hired Gunpei Yokoi as a maintenance engineer for the assembly line However Yokoi soon became famous for much more than his ability to repair conveyor belts br br br Toy company and new ventures br br During the s Nintendo struggled to survive in the Japanese toy industry which was still small at this point and already dominated by already well established companies such as Bandai and Tomy Because of the generally short product life cycle of toys the company took the approach of introducing new products at a quicker rate marking the start of a major new era for Nintendo br In Yamauchi upon visiting one of the company s hanafuda factories noticed an extending arm shaped toy which had been made by one of its maintenance engineers Gunpei Yokoi for fun Yamauchi ordered Yokoi to develop it as a proper product for the Christmas rush Released as the Ultra Hand it became one of Nintendo s earliest toy blockbusters selling over hundreds of thousands units Seeing that Yokoi had potential Yamauchi pulled him off assembly line work Yokoi was soon moved from maintenance duty to product development br Due to his electrical engineering background it soon became apparent that Yokoi was quite adept at developing electronic toys These devices had a much higher novelty value than traditional toys allowing Nintendo to charge a higher price margin for each product Yokoi went on to develop many other toys including the Ten Billion Barrel puzzle a baseball throwing machine called the Ultra Machine and a Love Tester br Nintendo released the first solar powered light gun the Nintendo Beam Gun in this was the first commercially available light gun for home use produced in partnership with Sharp br In Nintendo released the Ele Conga one of the first programmable drum machines It plays pre programmed rhythms from disc shaped punch cards which can be altered or programmed by the user to play different patterns br br br Arcade games Color TV Game and the Game Watch br br Released in the first commercially available video game console the Magnavox Odyssey has a light gun accessory the Shooting Gallery This was the first involvement of Nintendo in video games According to Martin Picard in the International Journal of Computer Game Research in Nintendo had even before the marketing of the first home console in the United States an alliance with the American pioneer Magnavox to develop and produce optoelectronic guns for the Odyssey released in since it was similar to what Nintendo was able to offer in the Japanese toy market in s br In its focus shifted to family friendly arcades with the Laser Clay Shooting System using the same light gun technology used in Nintendo s Kousenjuu series of toys and set up in abandoned bowling alleys Gaining some success Nintendo developed several more light gun machines for the emerging arcade scene While the Laser Clay Shooting System ranges had to be shut down following excessive costs Nintendo had founded a new market br Nintendo also entered the video game market Its first steps were to acquire the rights to distribute the Magnavox Odyssey in Japan in and to release its first video arcade game EVR Race in In Nintendo released the Color TV Game and Color TV Game two consoles jointly developed with Mitsubishi Electric The numbers in the console names indicate the number of games included in each br br In the early s Nintendo s video game division was led by Yokoi to create some of its most famous arcade games The massively popular Donkey Kong was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and released in arcades in Home releases soon followed made by Coleco for the Atari Intellivision and ColecoVision video game systems Some of Nintendo s other arcade games were ported to home consoles by third parties including Donkey Kong Jr Sky Skipper Mario Bros and Donkey Kong Nintendo started to focus on the home game market It stopped manufacturing and releasing arcade games in Japan in late and withdrew its membership from the Japan Amusement Machinery Manufacturers Association JAMMA on February On July Nintendo of America announced it would no longer manufacture arcade equipment br br In addition to the arcade game activity Nintendo was testing the consumer handheld video game market with the Game Watch It is a line of handheld electronic games produced by Nintendo from to Created by game designer Gunpei Yokoi each Game Watch features a single game to be played on an LCD screen in addition to a clock or an alarm It is the earliest Nintendo product to garner major success with million units sold worldwide br br br Nintendo Entertainment System era br br In Nintendo developed a prototype system called the Advanced Video System AVS Its accessories include controllers a tape drive a joystick and a lightgun The system can be used as a simple home computer It was never released and is on display at the Nintendo World Store in New York In July Nintendo released the Family Computer console in Japan as its first attempt at a cartridge based video game console More than units were sold within two months at around each After a few months of favorable sales Nintendo received complaints that some Famicom consoles would freeze on certain games The fault was found in a malfunctioning chip and Nintendo decided to recall all Famicom units that were currently on store shelves at a cost of approximately br During this period Nintendo redesigned the Famicom as the Nintendo Entertainment System for launch in the US Since the company had very little experience with the US market it had previously attempted to contract with Atari for the system s distribution in However a controversy involving Coleco and Donkey Kong soured the relationship between the two during the negotiations and Atari refused to back Nintendo s console br In a large scale recession in video game sales hit the market which amounted to a decrease primarily in the North American area The recession known as the video game crash of was caused by a few main factors including the flooding of the console market competition of home computers inflation and loss of publishing control The video game crash of soon took out not only Atari but the vast majority of the American market itself Over time dominance in the market shifted from America to Japan Nintendo began exporting to America and had virtually only one major competitor in the market Sega which was another Japanese company br Nintendo was determined not to make the same mistakes in the US that Atari had Because of massive influxes of games that were regarded as some of the worst ever created gaming had almost completely died out in America Nintendo decided that to avoid facing the same problems they would only allow games that received their Seal of Quality to be sold for the Famicom br In Nintendo announced the release of the Famicom Family Computer worldwide with a different design under the name the Nintendo Entertainment System NES It used a creative tactic to counter the bad press on video games and released the NES with R O B units that connect to the games To ensure the localization of the highest quality games by third party developers Nintendo of America limited third party developers to five game releases in a single year Konami the first third party company allowed to make Famicom games later circumvented this rule by creating a spinoff company Ultra Games to release additional games per year Other manufacturers soon employed the same tactic Also in Super Mario Bros was released for the Famicom in Japan and became a large success br Nintendo test marketed the Nintendo Entertainment System in the New York area on October They expanded the test to Los Angeles in February followed by tests in Chicago and San Francisco They would go national by the end of along with games sold separately In the US and Canada it widely outsold its competitors Also in Metroid and The Legend of Zelda were released to much critical acclaim br In Nintendo of America unveiled Nintendo Power a monthly news and strategy magazine from Nintendo that served to advertise new games The first issue is July August which spotlights the NES game Super Mario Bros Super Mario USA in Japan Nintendo Power has since ceased publication with its December edition br br br Game Boy Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Virtual Boy era br br In Nintendo which had much success from the Game Watch released the Game Boy both created by Gunpei Yokoi along with the accompanying game Tetris Due to the price the game and its durability unlike the static and screen rot of the prior Microvision from Milton Bradley Company the Game Boy line eventually amassed sales of million units Super Mario Land was released with the system and million copies were sold worldwide Also in Nintendo announced a successor to the Famicom the Super Famicom br The last major first party game for the NES Super Mario Bros was released in early in North America with more than million units sold It was followed by a licensed television adaption named The Super Mario Bros Super Show which was released by DIC Entertainment and Viacom Enterprises in that year to capitalize on the game s immense popularity br The Super Famicom was released in Japan on November The launch was widely successful and the Super Famicom was sold out across Japan within three days with million units sold by June In August the Super Famicom was launched in the US under the name Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES followed by Europe in br Like the NES the Super Nintendo Entertainment System has high technical specifications for its era The SNES controller had also improved over that of the NES as it now had rounded edges and four new buttons a standard which is evident on many modern controllers today The controller was called the dog bone br Nintendo had begun development on a CD ROM attachment for the SNES Super Famicom Its first partner in this project was Sony which had provided the SNES with its SPC sound chip Development on the Nintendo PlayStation CD ROM add on and SNES SFC standalone hybrid console began However at the last minute Nintendo decided to pull out of the partnership and instead go with Philips and while no CD ROM add on was produced several Nintendo properties namely The Legend of Zelda appeared on the Philips CD i media console Upon learning this Sony decided to continue developing the technology they had into the PlayStation The exact reason Nintendo left its partnership with Sony has been the subject of speculation over the years but the most common theory is that Sony either wanted too much of the profits for the machine or the rights to the CD ROM attachment itself br In Japan the Super Famicom easily took control of the gaming market In the US due to a late start and an aggressive marketing campaign by Sega Headed by the Sega Company s new mascot Sonic The Hedgehog their answer to Nintendo s Super Mario Nintendo s market share plunged from to with the NES to a low of approximately against the Sega Genesis Across several years the SNES in North America eventually overtook the Genesis due to franchise games such as Super Mario World The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past Street Fighter II and the Final Fantasy series Total worldwide sales of the SNES reached million units eclipsing the estimated million unit sales of the Genesis br As the SNES battled the Sega Genesis Nintendo had problems caused by its own aggressive marketing behavior In Nintendo agreed to a settlement regarding price fixing allegations brought by the Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general in New York and Maryland Nintendo had been accused of threatening to cut off shipments of the NES to retailers who discounted the price of the system The estimated cost of the settlement was just under million br br In Gunpei Yokoi and the rest of R D began planning on a new stereoscopic D console which became the Virtual Boy Hiroshi Yamauchi also bought majority shares of the Seattle Mariners in By May Nintendo had reportedly become one of the top ten leading companies in the world br In Nintendo announced plans to develop a new bit console codenamed Project Reality capable of rendering fully D environments and characters In Nintendo also claimed that Project Reality would be renamed Ultra in the US The Ultra moniker was unveiled in arcades on the Nintendo branded fighting game Killer Instinct and the racing game Cruis n USA Killer Instinct was later released on the SNES Soon after Nintendo realized Konami owned the rights to the Ultra name Specifically only Konami had rights to release games for the new system with names like Ultra Football or Ultra Tennis Therefore in Nintendo changed the final name of the system to Nintendo and announced that it would be released in The system and several games were previewed including Super Mario to the media and public Also in Nintendo purchased part of Rare br In after many years of Nintendo s products being distributed in Australia by Mattel since the NES in Nintendo opened its Australian headquarters and its first managing directors were Graham Kerry who moved along from Mattel Australia as managing director and Susumu Tanaka of Nintendo UK Ltd br In Nintendo released the Virtual Boy in Japan The console sold poorly but Nintendo still said they had hope for it and continued to release several other games and attempted a release in the US which was another disaster br Also in Nintendo found themselves in a competitive situation Competitor Sega introduced their bit Saturn while newcomer Sony introduced the bit PlayStation Sony s fierce marketing campaigns ensued and it started to cut into Nintendo and Sega s market share br br br Nintendo and Game Boy Color eras br br On June the Nintendo N was released in Japan with more than units sold on the first day On September the Nintendo was released in North America selling out the initial shipment of Many said that the advertising onslaught by Sony at this time did not truly begin to take effect until many of the consumers who held out for the Nintendo became frustrated at the lack of software following the first few months after the system s release Nintendo s extremely competitive climate was pushed by many third party companies immediately developing and releasing many of their leading games for Nintendo s competitors Many of those third party companies cited cheaper development and manufacturing costs for the CD format versus the cartridge format On December Nintendo released the DD add on peripheral to the Nintendo in Japan although it was never released elsewhere br Nintendo followed with the release of the Game Boy Pocket a smaller version of the original Game Boy designed by Gunpei Yokoi as a final product A week after the release of the Game Boy Pocket he resigned from his position at Nintendo He then helped in the creation of the competing handheld WonderSwan br In Pocket Monsters known internationally as Pok mon was released in Japan to a huge following The Pok mon franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri was proving so popular in America Europe and Japan that for a brief time Nintendo took back their place as the supreme power in the games industry br In Gunpei Yokoi died in a car accident at the age of That year the European Economic Community forced Nintendo to drastically rework its third party licensing contracts ruling that Nintendo could no longer limit the number of games a license could release require games to undergo prior approval or require third party games to be exclusively manufactured by Nintendo br On October the Game Boy Color was released in Japan with releases in North America and Europe a month later br In December Nintendo sued the owner of the zelda com domain which linked to pornographic images In December magician Uri Geller sued Nintendo for million over his likeness represented in the Pok mon Alakazam The lawsuit was dropped in and Geller sued multiple times after in he apologized for the legal battle In March Nintendo made an million USD settlement with the New York Attorney General over hand injuries sustained by children while rotating the N joystick in five different mini games within Mario Party The company issued game gloves to prevent future injuries In June Nintendo announced that they shut down a major Hong Kongese company pirating their games Apollo Ltd br br br Game Boy Advance and GameCube era br Nintendo released the Game Boy Advance GBA in Japan on March followed by North America and Europe in June The system played games with a much larger screen and more colors than the Game Boy Color was capable of and had backwards compatibility with every Game Boy game In North America the system was highly successful at launch becoming Nintendo s fast selling system at the time with models sold in around a month br Nintendo s next home video game console the GameCube was originally code named Dolphin It was announced at E when Nintendo of America president Howard Lincoln declared the console would equal or exceed anything our friends at Sony can come up with for PlayStation Sony was Nintendo s main competition after the financial failure of the Dreamcast forced Sega out of console manufacturing More details on the Dolphin then renamed GameCube were revealed at the SpaceWorld event in August The first Sonic the Hedgehog game for a Nintendo system was Sonic Advance for the Game Boy Advance in At one point Nintendo built a device separate from the console itself which included an LCD screen and could display stereoscopic D They were able to run the game Luigi s Mansion on the device but mass producing it would have been too expensive The Game Boy Advance was instead used as a second screen for certain games using the Game Boy Advance link cable br br The GameCube was released on September in Japan North America on November and Europe in May The system had a more ergonomic controller and included a handle for easy carriage It used mini discs to play games as to prevent piracy and not pay fees to the DVD Forum consortium who made DVD technologies The lack of a DVD player hurt sales as the PlayStation included one The Panasonic Q GameCube that did play DVDs was only released in Japan The mini disc format meant a GameCube disc could only store gigabytes of data but the system still had enough power to attract third party developers back to the system after the comparative weakness of the N to the first PlayStation The system had a strong launch Nintendo claimed it had stronger launches than the PlayStation and Microsoft s Xbox but its success was unsustainable partially because Luigi s Mansion was seen as an underwhelming launch title br br In January Minoru Arakawa resigned as president of Nintendo of America and Nintendo named Tatsumi Kimishima as his successor In May Hiroshi Yamauchi stepped down as the president of Nintendo naming Satoru Iwata as his successor In September Nintendo was removed of Rare a valuable asset when Nintendo sold its share in the studio to Microsoft who used Rare to develop games for their new Xbox console This was likely a part of Nintendo s strategy to not rely on second party development Instead they would better utilize its subsidaries like HAL Labs and Yamauchi was building a war chest to fund third party development Meanwhile Nintendo and Chinese American scientist Dr Wei Yen co founded iQue to manufacture and distribute official Nintendo consoles and games for the mainland Chinese market under the iQue brand br Despite the GameCube s technological improvements third parties generally still kept away from the system Nintendo was late in giving development kits to third party developers in the run up to the system s launch Nintendo was still targeting its core family friendly demographic while Sony expertly co opted anxious teenagers desperate to distance themselves from childish things The handle on the console and the cartoon like cel shaded art style of The Legend of Zelda Wind Waker contributed to the idea that the system was for children This was another reason third parties avoided the console br The system did not feature any major distinguishing features from to its competitors except for Nintendo s high quality first party titles like Super Mario Sunshine Metroid Prime and Super Smash Bros Melee Third party developer Capcom s Resident Evil was also exclusive to the GameCube one of the five games that were promised by Capcom in December to be GameCube exclusives One month later the promise was revealed to be some type of PR miscommuniation when it was announced the four titles besides Resident Evil were planned to be multi platform Resident Evil was eventually released for the PlayStation br br Nintendo s aggressive business tactics in Europe caught up to them in October when the European Commission determined that they had engaged in anti competitive price fixing business practices dating at least as far back as the early s This resulted in a heavy fine being laid against the company million one of the largest antitrust fines applied in the history of the commission The company was kept afloat in this era by its sales from the handheld market which they had essentially cornered In January an updated version of the GBA the Game Boy Advance SP was announced It released in Japan in February and the U S in March Starting in October Nokia s N Gage tried to compete with the GBA but it was unsuccessful br Production of the GameCube was temporarily stopped for the summer of as Nintendo needed to sell models that were filling up warehouses Iwata announced simultaneously that the company would stop developing increasingly sophisticated and time consuming games as a response to the industry wide decline in game sales for the year of Nintendo had also started experiencing competition from the Xbox Nintendo of America allocated million to the GameCube for the holiday season dropping the console s recommended price to way below the Xbox and PlayStation which were selling for Despite this change the system was still Nintendo s lowest selling console at the time being far outpaced by the PlayStation which sold million more units than the GameCube at million br br br Nintendo DS and Wii era br br In May Nintendo announced plans to release a new brand of handheld unrelated to the Game Boy featuring two screens one of which was touch sensitive The Nintendo DS released on November received over three million pre orders In addition to the touch screen the DS can also create three dimensional graphics similar to those of the Nintendo although its lack of hardware support for texture filtering results in more pixelated graphics than on the Nintendo br Satoru Iwata reassigned all of Nintendo s software designers under new managers and different division most of the resources were allocated to Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka and the Nintendo EAD division br On May Nintendo opened its first retail store accessible to the general public Nintendo World Store at the Rockefeller Center in New York City It consists of two stories and contains many kiosks of GameCube Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS games There are also display cases filled with things from Nintendo s past including Hanafuda Nintendo s first product They

the country s capital Seoul replacing Daewon Media as the official distributor of Nintendo products in South Korea br In early August it was revealed that Nintendo along with Microsoft was made the target of a patent infringement lawsuit Leveled by the Anascape Ltd the suit claimed that Nintendo s use of analog technology in their game controllers constituted a violation of their patents The lawsuit sought to recover damages from both corporations and possibly force them to stop selling controllers with the violating technology Microsoft settled with Anasacape while Nintendo went to trial initially losing and being ordered to pay US million in damages Nintendo appealed and on April the Federal Circuit reversed the ruling In November Anascape s appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied br In September Nintendo announced launch details for its Wii console and demonstrated features of the Wii Menu GUI br The system was first released in November in the US followed by Japan Australia and Europe launches in December The console sold fast and was a big breakthrough for Nintendo picking up the pace lost from the GameCube Its success has been attributed to the intended market of the product while at the time most competitors were focusing on more adult and fan based games Nintendo decided to release a console for a larger demographic one including casual gamers children and those who wouldn t ordinarily play video games br Since no other major gaming console was marketing for this image these other companies were caught mostly unprepared by the success of the Wii system and it wasn t until that Sony and Microsoft released consoles targeting the same demographic as the Wii br In Nintendo stopped making first party games for the GameCube br On September Nintendo of America closed its official forums the NSider Forums indefinitely due to a major overhaul of their site For months prior cutbacks in Nintendo of America s online department led to the trimming back of NSider s chat hours and the replacement of their annual Camp Hyrule event held during August with a sweepstakes In the meantime Nintendo encouraged fans to run their own forums Nintendo Europe s forum section of their site was also officially closed down a week later due to a site revamp however it had been offline citing security issues since June of that year On December

same year Nintendo released the DS the first Nintendo handheld with autostereoscopic D graphics Nintendo enjoyed continued success in the handheld market with the DS selling million units during its

Kimishima as his replacement br During the Nintendo DS and Wii U era Nintendo s profits fell to lows not seen during their history as a video game manufacturer reporting their first net loss as a video game company in Though initially claiming that mobile gaming was incompatible with Nintendo s identity Iwata established a partnership with mobile developer DeNA to create mobile games based on Nintendo properties prior to his death br br br present Nintendo Switch era br br After beginning the conceptual phase of development in Nintendo announced in a March press conference that they were developing a dedicated video game system codenamed NX According to Fils Aim the system was a make or break console for the company s success as it was apparent that the Wii U s lifespan would be considerably shorter than average In April they revealed that the NX was set for a March release The NX was formally unveiled as the Nintendo Switch in October a hybrid console able to switch between
