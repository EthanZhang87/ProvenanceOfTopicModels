The Nintendo N is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo It was released in Japan on June in North America on September and in Europe and Australia on March The successor to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System it was the last major home console to use cartridges as its primary storage format until the Nintendo Switch in As a fifth generation console the Nintendo primarily competed with the Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn br Development began in in partnership with Silicon Graphics using the codename Project Reality then a test model and arcade platform called Ultra The final design was named after its bit CPU which aided in the console s D capabilities Its design was mostly complete by mid and launch was delayed until for the completion of the launch games Super Mario Pilotwings and the Japanese exclusive Saiky Habu Sh gi br The charcoal gray console was followed by a series of color variants Some games require the Expansion Pak accessory to increase system RAM from MB to MB for improved graphics and functionality The console mainly supports saved game storage either onboard cartridges or on the Controller Pak accessory The DD peripheral drive hosts both exclusive games and expansion content for cartridges with many further accessories plus the defunct Internet service Randnet but it was a commercial failure and was released only in Japan br Time named it Machine of the Year in and in IGN named it the ninth greatest video game console of all time br The Nintendo was discontinued in following the launch of its successor the GameCube The Nintendo was critically acclaimed and remains one of the most recognized video game consoles br br br History br br br Background br br Following the video game crash of Nintendo led the industry with its first home game console the Famicom originally released in Japan in and later released internationally as the Nintendo Entertainment System NES beginning in Though the NES and its successor the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES were commercially successful sales for the SNES decreased as a result of the Japanese recession Competition from emerging rival Sega s bit Saturn console over Nintendo s bit SNES emphasized Nintendo s need to develop improved SNES hardware or risk losing market dominance to its competitors The Atari Lynx and Jaguar also competed with Nintendo during this time br Nintendo sought to enhance the SNES with a proposed CD ROM peripheral to be developed in partnership with other companies Contracts with CD ROM technology pioneers Philips and Sony failed after some hardware prototypes and no games from Nintendo or other interested third parties were developed Philips used the software portion of its license by releasing original Mario and Zelda games on its competing CD i console and Sony salvaged its internal progress to develop the PlayStation Nintendo s third party developers protested its strict licensing policies br br br Development br Silicon Graphics Inc SGI a long time leader in graphics computing was exploring expansion by adapting its supercomputing technology into the higher volume consumer market starting with the video game market SGI reduced its MIPS R family of enterprise CPUs to consume only watts of power instead of to watts with an estimated target price of US instead of US The company created a design proposal for a video game chipset seeking an established partner in that market Jim Clark founder of SGI offered the proposal to Tom Kalinske who was the CEO of Sega of America The next candidate would be Nintendo br Kalinske said that he and Joe Miller of Sega of America were quite impressed with SGI s prototype and invited their hardware team to travel from Japan to meet with SGI The engineers from Sega Enterprises said that their evaluation of the early prototype had revealed several hardware problems Those were subsequently resolved but Sega had already decided against SGI s design Nintendo disputed this account arguing that SGI chose Nintendo because Nintendo was the more appealing partner Sega demanded exclusive rights to the chip but Nintendo offered a non exclusive license Michael Slater publisher of Microprocessor Report said The mere fact of a business relationship there is significant because of Nintendo s phenomenal ability to drive volume If it works at all it could bring MIPS to levels of volume SGI never dreamed of br Jim Clark met with the CEO of Nintendo at the time Hiroshi Yamauchi in early initiating Project Reality On August the companies announced a global joint development and licensing agreement surrounding Project Reality projecting that the yet unnamed product would be developed specifically for Nintendo would be unveiled in arcades in and would be available for home use by late below This announcement coincided with Nintendo s August Shoshinkai trade show br SGI had named the core components Reality Immersion Technology which would be first used in Project Reality the MIPS R i CPU the MIPS Reality Coprocessor and the embedded software Some chip technology and manufacturing was provided by NEC Toshiba and Sharp SGI had recently acquired MIPS Computer Systems renamed to MIPS Technologies and the two worked together to be ultimately responsible for the design of the Reality Immersion Technology chips under engineering director Jim Foran and chief hardware architect Tim Van Hook br br The initial Project Reality game development platform was developed and sold by SGI in the form of its Onyx supercomputer costing US US equivalent to in and loaded with the namesake US RealityEngine graphics boards and four MHz R CPUs Its software includes early Project Reality application and emulation APIs based on Performer and OpenGL This graphics supercomputing platform had served as the source design which SGI had reduced down to become the Reality Immersion Technology for Project Reality br The Project Reality team prototyped a game controller for the development system by modifying a Super NES controller to have a primitive analog joystick and Z trigger Under maximal secrecy even from the rest of the company a LucasArts developer said his team would furtively hide the prototype controller in a cardboard box while we used it In answer to the inevitable questions about what we were doing we replied jokingly that it was a new type of controller a bowl of liquid that absorbed your thoughts through your fingertips Of course you had to think in Japanese br On June Nintendo announced the official name of the still unfinished console as Ultra The first group of elite developers selected by Nintendo was nicknamed the Dream Team Silicon Graphics Inc Alias Research Inc Software Creations Rambus Inc MultiGen Inc Rare Ltd and Rare Coin It Toys Games Inc WMS Industries Inc Acclaim Entertainment Inc Williams Entertainment Inc Paradigm Simulation Inc Spectrum Holobyte DMA Design Ltd Angel Studios Ocean Time Warner Interactive and Mindscape br By purchasing and developing upon Project Reality s graphics supercomputing platform Nintendo and its Dream Team could begin prototyping their games according to SGI s estimated console performance profile prior to the finalization of the console hardware specifications When the Ultra hardware was finalized that supercomputer based prototyping platform was later supplanted by a much cheaper and fully accurate console simulation board to be hosted within a low end SGI Indy workstation in July SGI s early performance estimates based upon its supercomputing platform were ultimately reported to have been fairly accurate to the final Ultra product allowing LucasArts developers to port their Star Wars game prototype to console reference hardware in only three days br The console s design was publicly revealed for the first time in late Q Images of the console displayed the Nintendo Ultra logo and a ROM cartridge but no controller This prototype console s form factor would be retained by the product when it eventually launched Having initially indicated the possibility of utilising the increasingly popular CD ROM if the medium s endemic performance problems were solved the company now announced a much faster but space limited cartridge based system which prompted open analysis by the gaming press The system was frequently marketed as the world s first bit gaming system often stating the console was more powerful than the first Moon landing computers Atari had already claimed to have made the first bit game console with their Atari Jaguar but the Jaguar only uses a general bit architecture in conjunction with two bit RISC processors and a bit Motorola br Later in Q Nintendo signed a licensing agreement with Midway s parent company which enabled Midway to develop and market arcade games with the Ultra brand and formed a joint venture company called Williams Nintendo to market Nintendo exclusive home conversions of these games The result is two Ultra branded arcade games Killer Instinct and Cruis n USA Not derived from Project Reality s console based branch of Ultra the arcade branch uses a different MIPS CPU has no Reality Coprocessor and uses onboard ROM chips and a hard drive instead of a cartridge Killer Instinct features D character artwork pre rendered into D form and computer generated movie backgrounds that are streamed off the hard drive and animated as the characters move horizontally br Previously the plan had been to release the console with the name Ultra Famicom in Japan and Nintendo Ultra in other markets Rumors circulated attributing the name change to the possibility of legal action by Konami s ownership of the Ultra Games trademark Nintendo said that trademark issues were not a factor and the sole reason for any name change was to establish a single worldwide brand and logo for the console The new global name Nintendo was proposed by Earthbound series developer Shigesato Itoi The prefix for the model numbering scheme for hardware and software across the Nintendo platform is NUS a reference to the console s original name of Nintendo Ultra Sixty four br br br Announcement br The newly renamed Nintendo console was unveiled to the public in playable form on November at Nintendo s th Annual Shoshinkai trade show Eager for a preview hordes of Japanese schoolkids huddled in the cold outside the electricity of anticipation clearly rippling through their ranks Game Zero magazine disseminated photos of the event two days later Official coverage by Nintendo followed later via the Nintendo Power website and print magazine br The console was originally slated for release by Christmas of In May Nintendo delayed the release to April Consumers anticipating a Nintendo release the following year at a lower price than the competition reportedly reduced the sales of competing Sega and Sony consoles during the important Christmas shopping season Electronic Gaming Monthly editor Ed Semrad even suggested that Nintendo may have announced the April release date with this end in mind knowing in advance that the system would not be ready by that date br In its explanation of the delay Nintendo claimed it needed more time for Nintendo software to mature and for third party developers to produce games Adrian Sfarti a former engineer for SGI attributed the delay to hardware problems he claimed that the chips underperformed in testing and were being redesigned In the Nintendo s software development kit was completely redesigned as the Windows based Partner N system by Kyoto Microcomputer Co Ltd of Japan br The Nintendo s release date was later delayed again to June Nintendo said the reason for this delay and in particular the cancellation of plans to release the console in all markets worldwide simultaneously was that the company s marketing studies now indicated that they would not be able to manufacture enough units to meet demand by April potentially angering retailers in the same way Sega had done with its surprise early launch of the Saturn in North America and Europe br To counteract the possibility that gamers would grow impatient with the wait for the Nintendo and purchase one of the several competing consoles already on the market Nintendo ran ads for the system well in advance of its announced release dates with slogans like Wait for it and Is it worth the wait Only if you want the best br br br Release br Popular Electronics called the launch a much hyped long anticipated moment Several months before the launch GamePro reported that many gamers including a large percentage of their own editorial staff were already saying they favored the Nintendo over the Saturn and PlayStation br The console was first released in Japan on June Though the initial shipment of units sold out on the first day Nintendo successfully avoided a repeat of the Super Famicom launch day pandemonium in part by using a wider retail network which included convenience stores The remaining units of the first production run shipped on June and with almost all of them reserved ahead of time In the months between the Japanese and North American launches the Nintendo saw brisk sales on the American gray market with import stores charging as much as plus shipping for the system The Nintendo was first sold in North America on September though having been advertised for the th It was launched with just two games in the United States Pilotwings and Super Mario Cruis n USA was pulled from the line up less than a month before launch because it did not meet Nintendo s quality standards In prior to the launch Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln emphasized the quality of first party games saying we re convinced that a few great games at launch are more important than great games mixed in with a lot of dogs The PAL version of the console was released in Europe on March except for France where it was released on September of the same year According to Nintendo of America representatives Nintendo had been planning a simultaneous launch in Japan North America and Europe but market studies indicated that worldwide demand for the system far exceeded the number of units they could have ready by launch potentially leading to consumer and retailer frustration br Originally intended to be priced at US the console was ultimately launched at US to make it competitive with Sony and Sega offerings as both the Saturn and PlayStation had been lowered to earlier that summer Nintendo priced the console as an impulse purchase a strategy from the toy industry The price of the console in the United States was further reduced in August br br br Promotion br The Nintendo s North American launch was backed with a million marketing campaign by Leo Burnett Worldwide meaning over in marketing per North American unit that had been manufactured up to this point While the competing Saturn and PlayStation both set teenagers and adults as their target audience the Nintendo s target audience was pre teens br To boost sales during the slow post Christmas season Nintendo and General Mills worked together on a promotional campaign that appeared in early The advertisement by Saatchi and Saatchi New York began on January and encouraged children to buy Fruit by the Foot snacks for tips to help them with their Nintendo games Ninety different tips were available with three variations of thirty tips each br Nintendo advertised its Funtastic Series of peripherals with a million print and television campaign from February to April Leo Burnett Worldwide was in charge again br br br Hardware br br br Technical specifications br br The console s main microprocessor is a bit NEC VR CPU with a clock rate of MHz and a performance of MIPS Popular Electronics said it had power similar to the Pentium processors found in desktop computers Except for its narrower bit system bus the VR retained the computational abilities of the more powerful bit MIPS R i though software rarely took advantage of bit data precision operations Nintendo games generally used faster and more compact bit data operations as these were sufficient to generate D scene data for the console s RSP Reality Signal Processor unit In addition bit code executes faster and requires less storage space which is at a premium on the Nintendo s cartridges br In terms of its random access memory RAM the Nintendo was one of the first consoles to implement a unified memory subsystem instead of having separate banks of memory for CPU audio and video operations The memory itself consists of megabytes of Rambus RDRAM expandable to MB with the Expansion Pak Rambus was quite new at the time and offered Nintendo a way to provide a large amount of bandwidth for a relatively low cost br Audio may be processed by the Reality Coprocessor or the CPU and is output to a DAC with up to kHz sample rate br The system allows for video output in two formats composite video and S Video The composite and S Video cables are the same as those used with the preceding Super NES and succeeding GameCube platforms br The Nintendo supports million colors The system can display resolutions from up to pixels Most games that make use of the system s higher resolution mode require use of the Expansion Pak RAM upgrade though several do not such as Acclaim s NFL Quarterback Club series and EA Sports s second generation Madden FIFA Supercross and NHL games The majority of games use the system s low resolution mode Many games support a video display ratio of up to using either anamorphic widescreen or letterboxing br br br Controller br br The Nintendo controller has an M shape with buttons one analog control stick and a directional pad br The Nintendo is one of the first with four controller ports According to Shigeru Miyamoto Nintendo opted to have four controller ports for its first console powerful enough to handle a four player split screen without significant slowdown br br br Game Paks br br After Nintendo s multiple plans for compact disc based games for Super NES the industry expected its next console to like PlayStation use that medium The first Nintendo prototypes in November surprised observers by again using ROM cartridge Cartridge size varies from to MB Many cartridges include the ability to save games internally br Nintendo s controversial selection of the cartridge medium for the Nintendo has been cited as a key factor in the company losing its dominant position in the gaming market Some of the cartridge s advantages are difficult for developers to manifest prominently requiring innovative solutions which only came late in the console s life cycle br br br Advantages br Nintendo cited several advantages for making the Nintendo cartridge based primarily cartridges very fast load times in comparison to compact disc based games Being able to play a cartridge game almost immediately had helped Nintendo defeat the Commodore and other US home computers in the s While loading screens appear in many PlayStation games they are rare in Nintendo games Although vulnerable to long term environmental damage the cartridges are far more resistant to physical damage than compact discs Nintendo also cited the fact that cartridges are more difficult to pirate than CDs thus resisting copyright infringement albeit at the expense of lowered profit margin for Nintendo While unauthorized N interface devices for the PC were later developed these devices are rare when compared to a regular CD drive used on the PlayStation which suffered widespread copyright infringement br br br Disadvantages br On the downside cartridges took longer to manufacture than CDs with each production run from order to delivery taking two weeks or more This meant that publishers of Nintendo games had to predict demand for a game ahead of its release They risked being left with a surplus of expensive cartridges for a failed game or a weeks long shortage of product if they underestimated a game s popularity The cost of producing a Nintendo cartridge was also far higher than for a CD Publishers passed these expenses onto the consumer Nintendo games cost an average of more when compared to games produced for rival consoles The higher cost also created the potential for much greater losses to the game s publisher in the case of a flop making the less risky CD medium tempting for third party companies Some third party companies also complained that they were at an unfair disadvantage against Nintendo first party developers when publishing games for the Nintendo since Nintendo owned the manufacturing plant where cartridges for their consoles are made and therefore could sell their first party games at a lower price and prioritize their production over those of other companies br Perhaps the most important reason for cartridge observers thought was what a later writer described as Nintendo s congenital need to be different and to assert its idiosyncratic hegemony by making everyone else dance to its tune while it was at it br As fifth generation games became more complex in content sound and graphics games began to exceed the limits of cartridge storage capacity Nintendo cartridges had a maximum of MB of data whereas CDs held MB The Los Angeles Times initially defended the quality control incentives associated with working with limited storage on cartridges citing Nintendo s position that cartridge game developers tend to place a premium on substance over flash and noted that the N launch games are free of poorly acted live action sequences or half baked musical overtures which it says tend to be found on CD ROM games However the cartridge s limitations became apparent with software ported from other consoles so Nintendo versions of cross platform games were truncated or redesigned with the storage limits of a cartridge in mind For instance this meant fewer textures and or shorter music tracks while full motion video was not usually feasible for use in cutscenes unless heavily compressed and of very brief length Another of its technical drawbacks is a limited size texture cache which force textures of limited dimensions and reduced color depth appearing stretched when covering in game surfaces br The era s competing systems from Sony and Sega the PlayStation and Saturn respectively used CD ROM discs to store their games As a result game developers who had traditionally supported Nintendo game consoles were now developing games for the competition Some third party developers such as Square and Enix whose Final Fantasy VII and Dragon Warrior VII were initially planned for the Nintendo switched to the PlayStation citing the insufficient storage capacity of the N cartridges Some who remained released fewer games to the Nintendo Konami released fifty PlayStation games but only twenty nine for the Nintendo New Nintendo game releases were infrequent while new games were coming out rapidly for the PlayStation br Through the difficulties with third parties the Nintendo supported popular games such as GoldenEye giving it a long market life Additionally Nintendo s strong first party franchises such as Mario had strong name brand appeal Second parties of Nintendo such as Rare helped br br br Color variants br br The Nintendo comes in several colors The standard Nintendo is dark gray nearly black and the controller is light gray later releases in the U S Canada and Australia included a bonus second controller in Atomic Purple Various colorations and special editions were released br Most Nintendo game cartridges are gray in color but some games have a colored cartridge Fourteen games have black cartridges and other colors such as yellow blue red gold and green were each used for six or fewer games Several games such as The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time were released both in standard gray and in colored limited edition versions br br br Programming characteristics br The programming characteristics of the Nintendo present unique challenges with distinct potential advantages The Economist described effective programming for the Nintendo as being horrendously complex As with many other game consoles and other types of embedded systems the Nintendo s architectural optimizations are uniquely acute due to a combination of oversight on the part of the hardware designers limitations on D technology of the time and manufacturing capabilities br As the Nintendo reached the end of its lifecycle hardware development chief Genyo Takeda repeatedly referred to the programming challenges using the word hansei reflective regret Looking back Takeda said When we made Nintendo we thought it was logical that if you want to make advanced games it becomes technically more difficult We were wrong We now understand it s the cruising speed that matters not the momentary flash of peak power br br br Regional lock out br In contrast to the NES and the Super NES in which the name of the platform and the hardware designs varied br by region Nintendo developed the same brand and hardware design for the Nintendo in every region worldwide The company initially announced that regional lock out chips would be used to region lock games but this method was never actually implemented with region locking instead being enforced by the cartridge cases having different notches on the back side depending on the market br br br Games br br A total of Nintendo games were officially released with just exclusively sold in Japan For comparison the PlayStation received games the Saturn got over the SNES got games and the NES got Western releases plus over in Japan The considerably smaller Nintendo game library has been attributed by some to the controversial decision not to adopt the CD ROM and programming difficulties for its complex architecture This trend is also seen as a result of Hiroshi Yamauchi s strategy announced during his speech at the Nintendo s November unveiling that Nintendo would be restricting the number of games produced for the Nintendo so that developers would focus on higher quality instead of quantity The Los Angeles Times also observed that this was part of Nintendo s penchant for perfection while other platforms offer quite a bit of junk Nintendo routinely orders game developers back to the boards to fix less than perfect titles br Although having much less third party support than rival consoles Nintendo s strong first party franchises such as Mario enjoyed wide brand appeal Second parties of Nintendo such as Rare released groundbreaking titles Consequently the Nintendo game library included a high number of critically acclaimed and widely sold games According to TRSTS reports three of the top five best selling games in the U S for December were Nintendo games both of the remaining two were Super NES games Super Mario is the best selling console game of the generation with million units sold beating Gran Turismo for the PlayStation at million and Final Fantasy VII at million in sales The game also received much praise from critics and helped to pioneer three dimensional control schemes GoldenEye was important in the evolution of the first person shooter and has been named one of the greatest in the genre The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time set the standard for future D action adventure games and is considered by many to be one of the greatest games ever made br br br Graphics br The most graphically demanding Nintendo games on larger or MB cartridges are among the most advanced and detailed of and bit platforms To maximize the hardware developers created custom microcode Nintendo games running on custom microcode benefit from much higher polygon counts and more advanced lighting animation physics and AI routines than its competition Conker s Bad Fur Day is arguably the pinnacle of its generation combining multicolored real time lighting that illuminates each area to real time shadowing and detailed texturing replete with a full in game facial animation system The Nintendo is capable of executing many more advanced and complex rendering techniques than its competitors It is the first home console to feature trilinear filtering to smooth textures This contrasts with the Saturn and PlayStation which use nearest neighbor interpolation and produce more pixelated textures Overall however the results of the Nintendo cartridge system were mixed br The smaller storage size of ROM cartridges can limit the number of available textures As a result many games with much smaller or MB cartridges are forced to stretch textures over larger surfaces Compounded by a limit of bytes of on chip texture memory the result is often a distorted out of proportion appearance Many games with larger or MB cartridges avoid this issue entirely including Resident Evil Sin and Punishment Successor of the Earth and Conker s Bad Fur Day allowing for more detailed graphics with multiple multi layered textures across all surfaces br br br Emulation br br Several Nintendo games have been released for the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console VC services and are playable with the Classic Controller GameCube controller Wii U Pro Controller or Wii U GamePad Differences include a higher resolution and a more consistent framerate than the Nintendo originals Some features such as Rumble Pak functionality are not available in the Wii versions Some features are also changed on the Virtual Console releases For example the VC version of Pok mon Snap allows players to send photos through the Wii s message service and Wave Race s in game content was altered due to the expiration of the Kawasaki license Several games developed by Rare were released on Microsoft s Xbox Live Arcade service including Banjo Kazooie Banjo Tooie and Perfect Dark following Microsoft s acquisition of Rareware in One exception is Donkey Kong released in April on the Wii U Virtual Console as Nintendo retained the rights to the game Several Nintendo games via Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack as the expanded tier of the Nintendo Switch Online were released on October in North America and October in Overseas br Several unofficial third party emulators can play Nintendo games on other platforms such as Windows Macintosh and smartphones br br br Accessories br br Nintendo accessories include the Rumble Pak and the Transfer Pak br The controller is shaped like an M employing a joystick in the center Popular Electronics called its shape evocative of some alien space ship While noting that the three handles could be confusing the magazine said the separate grips allow different hand positions for various game types br br br DD br br Nintendo released a peripheral platform called DD where DD stands for Disk Drive Connecting to the expansion slot at the bottom of the system the DD turns the Nintendo console into an Internet appliance a multimedia workstation and an expanded gaming platform This large peripheral allows players to play Nintendo disk based games capture images from an external video source and it allowed players to connect to the now defunct Japanese Randnet online service Not long after its limited mail order release the peripheral was discontinued Only nine games were released including the four Mario Artist games Paint Studio Talent Studio Communication Kit and Polygon Studio Many planned games were eventually released in cartridge format or on other game consoles The DD and the accompanying Randnet online service were released only in Japan br To illustrate the fundamental significance of the DD to all game development at Nintendo lead designer Shigesato Itoi said I came up with a lot of ideas because of the DD All things start with the DD There are so many ideas I wouldn t have been allowed to come up with if we didn t have the DD Shigeru Miyamoto concluded Almost every new project for the N is based on the DD we ll make the game on a cartridge first then add the technology we ve cultivated to finish it up as a full out DD game br br br iQue Player br br The iQue Player was a handheld TV game Nintendo system that released only in China on November after China banned video game consoles The games that were released in the iQue Player s lifetime from to are Super Mario The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Mario Kart Wave Race Star Fox Yoshi s Story Paper Mario Super Smash Bros F Zero X Dr Mario Excitebike Sin and Punishment Custom Robo and Animal Crossing br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br The Nintendo received acclaim from critics Reviewers praised the console s advanced D graphics and gameplay while criticizing the lack of games On G techTV s Filter the Nintendo was voted up to No by registered users br In February Next Generation magazine called the Nintendo Ultra the best kept secret in videogames and the world s most powerful game machine It called the system s November unveiling at Shoshinkai the most anticipated videogaming event of the s possibly of all time Previewing the Nintendo shortly prior to its launch Time magazine praised the realistic movement and gameplay provided by the combination of fast graphics processing pressure sensitive controller and the Super Mario game The review praised the fastest smoothest game action yet attainable via joystick at the service of equally virtuoso motion where f or once the movement on the screen feels real Asked if consumers should buy a Nintendo at launch buy it later or buy a competing system a panel of six GamePro editors voted almost unanimously to buy at launch one editor said consumers who already own a PlayStation and are on a limited budget should buy it later and all others should buy it at launch br At launch the Los Angeles Times called the system quite simply the fastest most graceful game machine on the market Its form factor was described as small light and built for heavy play by kids unlike the relatively fragile Sega Saturn Showing concern for a major console product launch during a sharp several year long decline in the game console market the review said that the long delayed Nintendo was worth the wait in the company s pursuit of quality Although the Times expressed concerns about having only two launch games at retail and twelve expected by Christmas this was suggested to be part of Nintendo s penchant for perfection as while other platforms offer quite a bit of junk Nintendo routinely orders game developers back to the boards to fix less than perfect titles Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge based development the Times cited Nintendo s position that cartridge game developers tend to place a premium on substance over flash and noted that the launch games lack the poorly acted live action sequences or half baked musical overtures which it says tend to be found on CD ROM games Praising Nintendo s controversial choice of the cartridge medium with its nonexistent load times and continuous fast paced action CD ROMs simply cannot deliver the review concluded that the cartridge based Nintendo delivers blistering speed and tack sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing bit disc based consoles from Sega and Sony seem downright sluggish br Time named it the Machine of the Year saying the machine had done to video gaming what the did to air travel The magazine said the console achieved the most realistic and compelling three dimensional experience ever presented by a computer Time credited the Nintendo with revitalizing the video game market rescuing this industry from the dustbin of entertainment history The magazine suggested that the Nintendo would play a major role in introducing children to digital technology in the final years of the th century The article concluded by saying the console had already provided the first glimpse of a future where immensely powerful computing will be as common and easy to use as our televisions The console also won the Spotlight Award for Best New Technology br Popular Electronics complimented the system s hardware calling its specifications quite impressive It found the controller comfortable to hold and the controls to be accurate and responsive br In a year end review a team of five Electronic Gaming Monthly editors gave the Nintendo scores of and They highly praised the power of the hardware and the quality of the first party games especially those developed by Rare s and Nintendo s internal studios but also commented that the third party output to date had been mediocre and the first party output was not enough by itself to provide Nintendo owners with a steady stream of good games or a full breadth of genres Next Generation s end of review expressed similar concern about third party support while also noting signs that the third party output was improving and speculated that the Nintendo s arrival late in its generation could lead to an early obsolescence when Sony and Sega s successor consoles launched However they said that for some Nintendo s reliably high quality software would outweigh those drawbacks and gave the system out of stars br Developer Factor which created some of the system s most technologically advanced games along with the system s audio development tools for Nintendo said T he N is really sexy because it combines the performance of an SGI machine with a cartridge We re big arcade fans and cartridges are still the best for arcade games or perhaps a really fast CD ROM But there s no such thing for consoles yet as of br br br Sales br The Nintendo was in heavy demand upon its release David Cole industry analyst said You have people fighting to get it from stores Time called the purchasing interest that rare and glorious middle class Cabbage Patch doll frenzy The magazine said celebrities Matthew Perry Steven Spielberg and Chicago Bulls players called Nintendo to ask for special treatment to get their hands on the console The console had only two launch games with Super Mario as its killer app br During the system s first three days on the market retailers sold of available console units During its first four months the console yielded unit sales in North America Nintendo successfully outsold Sony and Sega early in in the United States and by the end of its first full year million units were sold in the United States BusinessWire reported that the Nintendo was responsible for Nintendo s sales having increased by by Five different Nintendo games exceeded million in sales during br After a strong launch year the decision to use the cartridge format is said to have contributed to the diminished release pace and higher price of games compared to the competition and thus Nintendo was unable to maintain its lead in the United States The console would continue to outsell the Sega Saturn throughout the generation but would trail behind the PlayStation br Nintendo s efforts to attain dominance in the key holiday shopping season were also hurt by game delays Five high profile Nintendo games slated for release by Christmas The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Banjo Kazooie Conker s Quest Yoshi s Story and Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr were delayed until and Diddy Kong Racing was announced at the last minute in an effort to somewhat fill the gaps In an effort to take the edge off of the console s software pricing disadvantage Nintendo worked to lower manufacturing costs for Nintendo cartridges and leading into the holiday shopping season announced a new pricing structure which amounted to a roughly price cut on both first party and third party games Response from third party publishers was positive with key third party publisher Capcom saying the move led them to reconsider their decision not to publish games for the console br In Japan the console was not as successful failing to outsell the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn Benimaru It a developer for Mother and friend of Shigeru Miyamoto speculated in that the Nintendo s lower popularity in Japan was due to the lack of role playing video games Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi also said the console s lower popularity in Japan was most likely due to lack of role playing games and the small number of games being released in general br Nintendo reported that the system s vintage hardware and software sales had ceased by three years after the GameCube s launch as of December the Nintendo had yielded a lifetime total of million system units sold in Japan million in the Americas and million in other regions for a total
