A two dimensional space is a mathematical space with two dimensions meaning points have two degrees of freedom their locations can be locally described with two coordinates or they can move in two independent directions Common two dimensional spaces are often called planes or more generally surfaces br br The most basic example is the flat Euclidean plane an idealization of a flat surface in physical space such as a sheet of paper or a chalkboard On the Euclidean plane any two points can be joined by a unique straight line along which the distance can be measured The space is flat because any two lines transversed by a third line perpendicular to both of them are parallel meaning they never intersect and stay at uniform distance from each other br Two dimensional spaces can also be curved for example the sphere and hyperbolic plane sufficiently small portions of which appear like the flat plane but on which straight lines which are locally parallel do not stay equidistant from each other but eventually converge or diverge respectively Two dimensional spaces with a locally Euclidean concept of distance but which can have non uniform curvature are called Riemannian surfaces Some surfaces are embedded in three dimensional Euclidean space or some other ambient space and inherit their structure from it for example ruled surfaces such as the cylinder and cone contain a straight line through each point and minimal surfaces locally minimize their area as is done physically by soap films br Lorentzian surfaces look locally like a two dimensional slice of relativistic spacetime with one spatial and one time dimension constant curvature examples are the flat Lorentzian plane a two dimensional subspace of Minkowski space and the curved de Sitter and anti de Sitter planes br Other types of mathematical planes and surfaces modify or do away with the structures defining the Euclidean plane For example the affine plane has a notion of parallel lines but no notion of distance however signed areas can be meaningfully compared as they can in a more general symplectic surface The projective plane does away with both distance and parallelism A two dimensional metric space has some concept of distance but it need not match the Euclidean version A topological surface can be stretched twisted or bent without changing its essential properties An algebraic surface is a two dimensional set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations br Some mathematical spaces have additional arithmetical structure associated with their points A vector plane is an affine plane whose points called vectors include a special designated origin or zero vector Vectors can be added together or scaled by a number and optionally have a Euclidean Lorentzian or Galilean concept of distance The complex plane hyperbolic number plane and dual number plane each have points which are considered numbers themselves and can be added and multiplied A Riemann surface or Lorentz surface appear locally like the complex plane or hyperbolic number plane respectively br Mathematical spaces are often defined or represented using numbers rather than geometric axioms One of the most fundamental two dimensional spaces is the real coordinate space denoted br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br consisting of pairs of real number coordinates Sometimes the space represents arbitrary quantities rather than geometric positions as in the parameter space of a mathematical model or the configuration space of a physical system br More generally other types of numbers can be used as coordinates The complex plane is two dimensional when considered to be formed from real number coordinates but one dimensional in terms of complex number coordinates A two dimensional complex space such as the two dimensional complex coordinate space the complex projective plane or a complex surface has two complex dimensions which can alternately be represented using four real dimensions A two dimensional lattice is an infinite grid of points which can be represented using integer coordinates Some two dimensional spaces such as finite planes have only a finite set of elements br br br Notes br br br Further reading br Hartshorne Robin Geometry Euclid and Beyond Springer doi ISBN br Kinsey Laura Christine Topology of Surfaces Springer doi ISBN br Needham Tristan Visual Differential Geometry and Forms Princeton ISBN br Stillwell John Geometry of Surfaces Springer doi ISBN br Yaglom Isaak Moiseevich Complex Numbers in Geometry Translated by Primrose Eric J F Academic Press LCCN
