id: 437385
In the history of video games the fourth generation of video game consoles more commonly referred to as the bit era began on October with the Japanese release of NEC Home Electronics PC Engine known as the TurboGrafx in North America Though NEC released the first console of this era sales were mostly dominated by the rivalry between Sega and Nintendo across most markets the Sega Mega Drive known as the Sega Genesis in North America and the Super Nintendo known as the Super Famicom in Japan Cartridge based handheld game consoles became prominent during this time such as the Nintendo Game Boy Atari Lynx Sega Game Gear and TurboExpress br Nintendo was able to capitalize on its success in the third generation and managed to win the largest worldwide market share in the fourth generation as well Sega however was extremely successful in this generation and launched its popular Sonic the Hedgehog franchise to compete with Nintendo s Super Mario series Several other companies released consoles in this generation but none of them were widely successful Nevertheless there were other companies that started to take notice of the maturing video game industry and begin making plans to release consoles of their own in the future As with prior generations game media still continued to be distributed primarily on ROM cartridges though the first optical disk systems such as the Philips CD i were released to limited success As games became more complex concerns over video game violence namely in titles such as Mortal Kombat and Night Trap led to the eventual creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board br The emergence of fifth generation video game consoles beginning around did not significantly diminish the popularity of fourth generation consoles for a few years In however there was a major drop in sales of hardware from this generation and a dwindling number of software publishers supporting fourth generation systems which together led to a drop in software sales in subsequent years This generation ended with the discontinuation of the Neo Geo in br br br Differences from third generation consoles br Features that distinguish some fourth generation consoles from third generation consoles include br br bit microprocessors br Multi button game controllers with many buttons to br Parallax scrolling of multi layer tilemap backgrounds br Large sprites up to or pixels sprites on screen sprites per scan line br Elaborate color to colors on screen from palettes of bit to bit colors br Stereo audio with multiple channels and digital audio playback PCM ADPCM streaming CD DA audio br Advanced music synthesis FM synthesis and or wavetable sample based synthesis br Additionally in specific cases fourth generation hardware featured br br Backgrounds with pseudo D scaling and rotation br Sprites that can individually be scaled and rotated br Flat shaded D polygon graphics br Surround sound support br CD ROM support via add ons allowing larger storage space and full motion video playback br br br Home systems br br br TurboGrafx br br The PC Engine was the result of a collaboration between Hudson Soft and NEC and launched in Japan on October It launched under the name TurboGrafx in North America on August br Initially the PC Engine was quite successful in Japan partly due to titles available on the then new CD ROM format NEC released a CD add on in and by had released a combination TurboGrafx and CD ROM system known as the TurboDuo br In the United States NEC used Bonk a head banging caveman as their mascot and featured him in most of the TurboGrafx advertising from to The platform was well received initially especially in larger markets but failed to make inroads into the smaller metropolitan areas where NEC did not have as many store representatives or as focused in store promotion br The TurboGrafx failed to maintain its sales momentum or to make a strong impact in North America The TurboGrafx and its CD combination system the Turbo Duo ceased manufacturing in North America by though a small amount of software continued to trickle out for the platform br br br Mega Drive Genesis br br The Mega Drive was released in Japan on October The console was released in New York City and Los Angeles on August under the name Sega Genesis and in the rest of North America later that year It was launched in Europe and Australia on November under its original name br Sega built their marketing campaign around their new mascot Sonic the Hedgehog pushing the Genesis as the cooler alternative to Nintendo s console and inventing the term Blast Processing to suggest that the Genesis was capable of handling games with faster motion than the SNES Their advertising was often directly adversarial leading to commercials such as Genesis does what Nintendon t and no scream at all br When the arcade game Mortal Kombat was ported for home release on the Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo decided to censor the game s gore but Sega kept the content in the game via a code entered at the start screen Sega s version of Mortal Kombat received generally more favorable reviews in the gaming press and outsold the SNES version three to one This also led to Congressional hearings to investigate the marketing of violent video games to children and to the creation of the Interactive Digital Software Association and the Entertainment Software Rating Board Sega concluded that the superior sales of their version of Mortal Kombat were outweighed by the resulting loss in consumer trust and cancelled the game s release in Spain to avoid further controversy With the new ESRB rating system in place Nintendo reconsidered its position for the release of Mortal Kombat II and this time became the preferred version among reviewers The Toy Retail Sales Tracking Service reported that during the key shopping month of November of all bit video game consoles sold were Sega systems br The console was never popular in Japan being regularly outsold by the PC Engine but still managed to sell million units worldwide By late Sega was supporting five different consoles and two add ons and Sega Enterprises chose to discontinue the Mega Drive in Japan to concentrate on the new Sega Saturn While this made perfect sense for the Japanese market it was disastrous in North America the market for Genesis games was much larger than for the Saturn but Sega was left without the inventory or software to meet demand br br br Super NES br br Nintendo executives were initially reluctant to design a new system but as the market transitioned to the newer hardware Nintendo saw the erosion of the commanding market share it had built up with the Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo s fourth generation console the Super Famicom was released in Japan on November Nintendo s initial shipment of units sold out within hours The machine reached North America as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on August and Europe and Australia in April br Despite stiff competition from the Mega Drive Genesis console the Super NES eventually took the top selling position selling million units worldwide and would remain popular well into the fifth generation of consoles Nintendo s market position was defined by their machine s increased video and sound capabilities including exclusive first party franchise titles such as F Zero Super Mario World Star Fox Super Mario Kart Donkey Kong Country The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past and Super Metroid br br br Compact Disc Interactive CD i br br The CD i format was announced in the late s with the first machines compatible with the format being released in The Philips CD i s main selling point was that it was more than a game machine and could be used for multimedia needs Due to an agreement between Nintendo and Philips about an abortive CD add on for the SNES which eventually evolved into Sony s PlayStation Philips also had rights to use some of Nintendo s franchises The CD i was a commercial failure and was discontinued in selling only million units worldwide despite several partnerships and multiple versions of the device some made by other manufacturers br br br Neo Geo br br Released by SNK in the Neo Geo was a home console version of the major arcade platform Compared to its console competition the Neo Geo had much better graphics and sound however the prohibitively expensive launch price of US and games often retailing at over made the console only accessible to a niche market A less expensive version retailing for did not include a memory card pack in game or extra joystick br br br Add ons br Nintendo NEC and Sega also competed with hardware peripherals for their consoles in this generation NEC was the first with the release of the TurboGrafx CD system in Retailing for at release the CD add on was not a popular purchase but was largely responsible for the platform s success in Japan The Sega CD was released with an unusually high price tag at its release and a limited library of games A unique add on for the Sega console was Sega Channel a subscription based service a form of online gaming delivery hosted by local television providers It required hardware that plugged into a cable line and the Genesis br Nintendo also made two attempts with the Satellaview and the Super Game Boy The Satellaview was a satellite service released only in Japan and the Super Game Boy was an adapter for the SNES that allowed Game Boy games to be displayed on a TV in color Nintendo working along with Sony also had plans to create a CD ROM drive for the SNES plans that resulted in a prototype version of the Sony PlayStation but eventually decided not to go through with that project opting to team up with Philips in the development of the add on instead contrary to popular belief the CD i was largely unrelated to the project br br br European importing br br The fourth generation was also the era when the act of buying imported US games became more established in Europe and regular stores began to carry them The PAL region has a refresh rate of Hz compared with Hz for NTSC and a vertical resolution of interlaced lines effective compared with for NTSC Because the simulation speed of contemporary game systems was directly linked to the output frame rate which was in turn synchronized with the TV s refresh rate this meant that the game would run more slowly on a PAL television The smaller number of vertical lines in the NTSC signal would also lead to black bars appearing on the top and bottom of a PAL television Developers often had a hard time converting games designed for the American and Japanese NTSC standard to the European and Australian PAL standard Companies such as Konami with large budgets and a healthy following in Europe and Australia readily optimized several games such as the International Superstar Soccer series for this audience while most smaller developers did not br Also few RPGs were released in Europe because the market for the genre was not as large as in Japan or North America and the increasing amount of time and money required for translation as RPGs became more text heavy in addition to the usual need to convert the games to the PAL standard often made localizing the games to Europe a high cost venture with little potential payoff As a result RPG releases in Europe were largely limited to games which had previously been localized for North America thus reducing the amount of translation required br Popular US games imported at this time included Final Fantasy IV known in the US as Final Fantasy II Final Fantasy VI known in the US as Final Fantasy III Secret of Mana Street Fighter II Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG Secret of Mana and Street Fighter II would eventually receive official release in Europe whilst Final Fantasy IV Final Fantasy VI Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG would be released in Europe years later on other consoles or formats outside of this generation br br br Comparison br br br CD supported consoles br br br Other consoles br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

dominate handheld sales by an extremely large margin despite featuring an bit microprocessor and a low contrast unlit monochrome screen while all three of its leading competitors had color Three major franchises made their debut on the Game Boy Tetris the Game Boy s killer application Pok mon and Kirby With some design Game Boy Pocket Game Boy Light and hardware Game Boy Color changes it continued in production in some form until enjoying a better than year run br The Atari Lynx included hardware accelerated color graphics a backlight and the ability to link up to sixteen units together in an early example of network play when its competitors could only link or consoles or none at all but its comparatively short battery life approximately hours on a set of alkaline cells versus hours for the Game Boy high price and weak games library made it one of the worst selling handheld game systems of all time with less than units sold br The third major handheld of the fourth generation was the Game Gear It featured graphics capabilities roughly comparable to the Master System better colours but lower resolution a ready made games library by using the Master Gear adaptor to play cartridges from the older console and the opportunity to be converted into a portable TV using a cheap tuner adaptor but it also suffered some of the same shortcomings as the Lynx While it sold more than twenty times as many units as the Lynx its bulky design slightly larger than even the original Game Boy relatively poor battery life only a little better than the Lynx and later arrival in the marketplace competing for sales amongst the remaining buyers who did not already have a Game Boy hampered its overall popularity despite being more closely competitive to the Nintendo in terms of price and breadth of software library Sega eventually retired the Game Gear in a year before Nintendo released the first examples of the Game Boy Color to focus on the Nomad and non portable console products br Other handheld consoles released during the fourth generation included the TurboExpress a handheld version of the TurboGrafx released by NEC in and the Game Boy Pocket an improved model of the Game Boy released about two years before the debut of the Game Boy Color While the TurboExpress was another early pioneer of color handheld gaming technology and had the added benefit of using the same game cartridges or HuCards as the TurboGrafx it had even worse battery life than the Lynx and Game Gear about three hours on six contemporary AA batteries selling only million units br br br List of
