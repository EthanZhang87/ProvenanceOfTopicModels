The Atari SuperSystem or simply Atari is a home video game console introduced in by Atari Inc as a higher end complement for the popular Atari Video Computer System The VCS was renamed to the Atari at the time of the s launch Created to compete with Mattel s Intellivision the wound up a direct competitor of ColecoVision shortly after its release While the Coleco system shipped with the first home version of Nintendo s Donkey Kong the included the arcade game Super Breakout which had already appeared on the Atari bit computers and Atari VCS in and respectively br The CPU and the graphics and sound hardware are almost identical to that of the Atari bit computers although software is not directly compatible between the two systems The s controllers have an analog joystick and a numeric keypad along with start pause and reset buttons The degree non centering joystick was touted as offering more control than the eight way Atari CX joystick of the but was a focal point for criticism br On May during a press conference at which the Atari was introduced company executives revealed that the had been discontinued after less than two years on the market Total sales of the were reportedly in excess of million units far short of its predecessor s sales of over million br br br Hardware br br Following the release of the Video Computer System in Atari began developing hardware for a next generation game console Instead it was used as the basis for the Atari and home computers br Atari later decided to re enter the console market using the same technology Prototypes were called the Atari Video System X Advanced Video Computer System Actual working Atari Video System X machines whose hardware is identical to the Atari do exist but are extremely rare br The initial release of the system had four controller ports compared to two in most other consoles The controllers have an analog joystick numeric keypad two fire buttons on each side of the controller and game function keys for Start Pause and Reset The also featured the innovation of the first automatic TV switchbox allowing it to automatically switch from regular TV viewing to the game system signal when the system was activated Previous RF adapters required the user to slide a switch on the adapter by hand The RF box was also where the power supply connected in a unique dual power television signal setup similar to the RCA Studio II s A single cable coming out of the plugged into the switch box and carried both electricity and the television signal br The revision of the Atari has two controller ports instead of four and a change back to the more conventional separate power supply and standard non autoswitching RF switch It also has changes in the cartridge port address lines to allow for the Atari adapter released that year While the adapter was only made to work on the two port version modifications can be made to the four port to make it line compatible In fact towards the end of the four port model s production run there were a limited number of consoles produced which included these modifications These consoles can be identified by an asterisk in their serial numbers br At one point following the s release Atari planned a smaller cost reduced version of the Atari which removed the controller storage bin Code named the Atari a k a Atari Jr only a few fully working prototype s were made before the project was canceled br br br Controllers br br The controller prototypes used in the electrical development lab employed a yoke and gimbal mechanism that came from an RC airplane controller kit The design of the analog joystick which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to provide centering proved to be ungainly and unreliable They quickly became the Achilles heel of the system due to the combination of an overly complex mechanical design and a very low cost internal flex circuit system Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not translate into a linear acceleration from the center through the arc of the stick travel The controllers did however include a pause button a unique feature at the time Various third party replacement joysticks were also released including those made by Wico br Atari Inc released the Pro Line Trak Ball controller which is used for games such as Centipede and Missile Command A paddle controller and an updated self centering version of the original controller were also in development but never made it to market br Games were shipped with plastic card overlays that snapped in over the keypad The card would indicate which game functions such as changing the view or vehicle speed were assigned to each key br The primary controller was ranked the th worst video game controller by IGN editor Craig Harris An editor for Next Generation said that their non centering joysticks rendered many games nearly unplayable br br br Internal differences from bit computers br David H Ahl in described the Atari as a computer in disguise Its internal design is similar to that of Atari bit computers using the ANTIC POKEY and GTIA coprocessors Software designed for one does not run on the other but source code can be mechanically converted unless it uses computer specific features Antic magazine reported in that the similarities grossly outweigh the differences so that a program can be developed and almost entirely debugged on an Atari bit computer before testing on a John J Anderson of Creative Computing alluded to the incompatibility being intentional caused by Atari s console division removing bit compatibility to not lose control to the rival computer division br Besides the s lack of a keyboard the differences are br br The Atari computer KB operating system is replaced with a simpler KB version of which KB is the built in character set br Some hardware registers such as those of the GTIA and POKEY chips are at different memory locations br The purpose of some registers is slightly different on the br The s analog joysticks appear as pairs of paddles to the hardware which requires different input handling from the digital joystick input on the Atari computers br In Atari Corporation released the XE Game System console which is a repackaged XE from with a detachable keyboard that can run home computer titles directly unlike the Anderson wrote in that Atari could have released a console compatible with computer software in br br br Reception br The Atari did not fare well commercially compared to its predecessor the Atari While it touted superior graphics to the and Mattel s Intellivision the system was initially incompatible with the s expansive library of games and some market analysts have speculated that this hurt its sales especially since an Atari cartridge adapter had been released for the Intellivision II A revised two port model was released in along with a game adapter that allowed gamers to play all games This lack of new games was due in part to a lack of funding with Atari continuing to develop most of its games for the saturated market br Many of the s games appeared simply as updated versions of titles which failed to excite consumers Its pack in game Super Breakout was criticized for not doing enough to demonstrate the system s capabilities This gave the ColecoVision a significant advantage as its pack in Donkey Kong delivered a more authentic arcade experience than any previous game cartridge In its list of the top game consoles of all time IGN claimed that the main reason for the s market failure was the technological superiority of its competitor while other sources maintain that the two consoles are roughly equivalent in power br The received much criticism for the sloppy design of its non centering analog controllers Anderson described the controllers as absolutely atrocious br David H Ahl of Creative Computing Video Arcade Games said in that the Atari is dare I say it Atari s answer to Intellivision Colecovision and the Astrocade describing the console as a true mass market version of the Atari bit computers despite the software incompatibility He criticized the joystick s imprecise control but said that it is at least as good as many other controllers and wondered why Super Breakout was the pack in game when it did not use the s improved graphics br br br Technical

Critical to the plot of the film Cloak Dagger is an Atari game cartridge called Cloak Dagger The arcade version appears in the movie in actuality the Atari version was started but never completed The game was under development with the title Agent X when the movie producers and Atari learned of each other s projects and decided to cooperate This collaboration was part of a larger phenomenon of films featuring video games as critical plot elements as with Tron and The Last Starfighter and of video game tie ins to the same films as with the Tron games for the Intellivision and other platforms
