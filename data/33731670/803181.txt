The Watara Supervision also known as the QuickShot Supervision in the UK is a monochrome handheld game console originating from Asia and introduced in as a cut price competitor for Nintendo s Game Boy It came packaged with a game called Crystball which is similar to Breakout One unique feature of the Supervision was that it could be linked up to a television via an official accessory Games played in this way would display in four colors much like Nintendo s Super Game Boy add on for the SNES A full color TV link was also in the works but because of the Supervision s failure to make a major impression among gamers it was cancelled along with the games which were in development for it br Though the machine garnered some attention at launch mainly due to the low price for the machine and its games which many felt might enable it to make inroads into Nintendo s market share it was ultimately unsuccessful in unseating the Game Boy from its position as the world s most popular handheld Reasons commonly cited are the poor quality screen which was prone to blurring and made following the action difficult a general lack of games and the simplistic nature of those that were released br Yet another problem was that most of the games that were available were developed in Taiwan or Hong Kong meaning that fans of big name Western and Japanese developers were underwhelmed by the apparent lack of support from these companies Only a tiny handful of games were developed by third parties including Sachen and the British developer B I T S Up against Nintendo s list of popular franchises Zelda Mario Metroid and those of its third parties Castlevania Mega Man all of which eventually surfaced on the Game Boy the Supervision s games were of little interest to most br br br Marketing br The Watara Supervision s main marketing point was its low price the Supervision was US in while the Game Boy was US Games for the Supervision were also much cheaper than Game Boy games and advertisements emphasized this price difference with one British ad for the Supervision calling it the affordable hand held games machine It was also bundled with headphones batteries and a Breakout clone titled Crystball br To keep their costs down Watara farmed out the international marketing and distribution to third parties leading to various versions including the QuickShot Supervision Travell Mate Hartung SV and Electrolab in Argentina under two different models the Supervision in a form factor resembling Nintendo s Game Boy and the Hipervision In Taiwan and Hong Kong it was released as the BOY Tiger Boy The QuickShot version differed from the original Watara format by having the console body split into two parts enabling the screen to be tilted in relation to the control section This version was also the initial release in North America although without the QuickShot branding br In the mid s the Supervision was once offered as a final prize on the television game show Legends of the Hidden Temple as well as Masters of the Maze It was also offered as a prize on the premiere of the similarly short lived The New Price is Right in br br Quickshot s UK version of the Supervision was heavily featured for a time on ITV s gaming show Bad Influence Presenter Violet Berlin could be seen playing a Supervision in many of the show s publicity photos br br br History br A prototype of the Supervision was exhibited at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in The Supervision was released before Christmas with eighteen launch titles and it was advertised that fifty games were released by November The Supervision s game library was criticized for being too simplistic compared to that of other consoles which outweighed the value of their budget price which ranged from US to US per game One critic from Electronic Games said in respect to the Supervision that it is still possible to be disappointed in a game that costs under fifteen dollars Soon after the Supervision s release the Game Boy Basic packaging option was announced which made the Game Boy more affordable costing only ten dollars more than the Supervision this undermined the Supervision s budget marketing strategy br Similar to the functionality of the Super Game Boy the Supervision can be connected to a television to allow for a larger screen to play on A peripheral that would add color support to games was planned for release in the latter half of but was never released The Supervision was distributed in the US by Goldnation and in France by AudioSonic More third party games were planned for release for the system in but never materialized including movie licences such as Rambo and Terminator br br br Technical specifications br CPU bit C processor running at MHz br Screen mm
