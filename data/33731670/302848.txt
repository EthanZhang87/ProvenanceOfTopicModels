Fire Emblem is a Japanese fantasy tactical role playing game franchise developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo First produced and published for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the series currently consists of seventeen core entries and five spinoffs br The core gameplay revolves around discrete battles between the player s team of characters and enemy non player characters across grid based maps The player and enemy each take turns moving their characters across the map and having them perform combat based actions The games also feature a story and characters similar to traditional role playing video games and occasionally social simulation aspects as well A notable aspect of gameplay is the permanent death of characters in battle rendering them unusable upon being defeated although this aspect of the game can be turned off starting from Fire Emblem New Mystery of the Emblem onwards br The series title refers to the Fire Emblem a recurring element usually portrayed as a royal weapon or shield representing the power of war and dragons The development of the first game began as a d jin project by Shouzou Kaga and three other developers and its success prompted the development of further games in the series Kaga headed the development of each entry until the release of Thracia when he left Intelligent Systems He went on to found his own game studio Tirnanog who developed Tear Ring Saga br The series debuted in the West with the seventh game The Blazing Blade in under the title Fire Emblem According to the game s director this was because of the international success of the similarly turn based Advance Wars The inclusion of Marth and Roy in the fighting game Super Smash Bros Melee as playable characters is also cited as a reason with Roy s inclusion in Melee meaning he was in Smash before his own Fire Emblem game Many games in the series sold well although sales suffered a decline during the late s This resulted in the series near cancellation until the unprecedented critical and commercial success of Fire Emblem Awakening This success was built on by Fire Emblem Three Houses the series best selling entry br The series has been lauded for its gameplay and is frequently cited as the seminal series in the tactical role playing genre codifying various gameplay elements that would come to define the genre Characters from across the series have been included in crossovers with other video game franchises including the Super Smash Bros series br br br Common elements br br br Gameplay br Fire Emblem s developers have described it as an RPG simulation that combines tactical simulation gameplay with the plot and character development of a role playing game creating a sense of connection with characters not present in previous tactical games Battles in the Fire Emblem series take place on a grid based map with the player controlling a set number of characters across maps tied to the game s story and optional side stories Each character has a specific character class which gives them set abilities and affects how far they can move across the field some classes have innate skills unique to them Depending on the installment a character s class can be changed or upgraded sometimes by using special items During a battle a character gains experience points by performing actions such as attacking an enemy healing an ally or slaying a foe which typically offers the most experience points Each character has their own stats and once a certain level is reached they level up and new skill points are awarded randomly to their attributes such as health agility or strength A character gains more experience the more they are used in battle br A key element present in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle a system governing the strengths and weaknesses that certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a rock paper scissors fashion For weapons lances have an advantage against swords swords have an advantage against axes and axes have an advantage against lances In the magic system fire is stronger than wind wind is stronger than thunder and thunder is stronger than fire From The Binding Blade through Radiant Dawn these three elements are collectively known as anima magic Anima is stronger than light light is stronger than darkness and darkness is stronger than anima In Fates the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons swords and tomes are stronger than axes and bows axes and bows are stronger than lances and shurikens and lances and shurikens are stronger than swords and tomes Most games use a Weapon Durability system after being used a certain number of times a character s weapon will break Different installments have various systems related to weapons in Genealogy of the Holy War weapons can be repaired at special shops in Path of Radiance and future games weapons can be bought and upgraded Fates replaces the durability system with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of their wielder s stats br Character relationships can be developed through support affinity both inside and outside of battle which increases certain battle abilities A feature introduced in Genealogy of the Holy War and used in later installments is that characters who fall in love can have a child who inherits certain skills and stats from them One of the recurring features in the series is permanent death in which units defeated in battle are permanently removed from the party with very few exceptions one being the main character whose death results in a Game Over instead Fire Emblem New Mystery of the Emblem introduced Casual Mode in which dead characters are revived at the end of a battle Fates added Phoenix Mode in which defeated characters are revived on the player s next turn Another inclusion from Fates is My Castle a customizable castle serving as the player s base of operations throughout the game br br br Story and themes br The Fire Emblem games take place across unrelated settings within a medieval or Renaissance themed time period The main protagonist who is usually either royalty or a mercenary is caught in the conflict of two or more countries across a continent and fighting for their cause The continents of Archanea and Valentia are the settings of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light Gaiden Mystery of the Emblem and Awakening and were the planned setting for Fire Emblem Genealogy of the Holy War and Thracia are set in Jugdral which is distantly connected with Archanea and Valentia while The Blazing Blade and The Binding Blade take place in Elibe The Sacred Stones is set in Magvel and Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn are set on the continent Tellius Fates is set on an unnamed continent with the story instead focusing on the two powers fighting over its territory Three Houses takes place on the continent of F dlan Engage is set in the continent of Elyos br A recurring element in the series is the titular artifact known as the Fire Emblem In Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and other games set in Archanea it is a shield inset with five magical gems named after its connection to dragons and weapons of war being the emblem of flame It also appears as a family crest in Genealogy of the Holy War a family seal in The Binding Blade a magic gemstone in The Sacred Stones a bronze medallion holding a goddess of chaos in Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn a sword in Fates and hereditary magical sigils in Three Houses Other magical elements including feuding gods and mystical species such as dragons and shapeshifters are also recurring elements in the series br br br Development and history br The first Fire Emblem game Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light was originally never intended as a commercial game defined by creator Shouzou Kaga as a d jin project with three other job holding students However the game s unexpected commercial success prompted the development of more games in the series The game was developed at Intelligent Systems whose previous notable game was the strategy game Famicom Wars Kaga worked on the Fire Emblem series until Thracia when he left Nintendo and began development on Tear Ring Saga for the PlayStation After Thracia the Fire Emblem series had several releases on portable devices In Marth and Roy from Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and The Binding Blade respectively appeared as playable characters in Super Smash Bros Melee This alongside the international success of Advance Wars is cited as what led to Nintendo localizing The Blazing Blade for Western regions under the title Fire Emblem Due to its success overseas it was decided to return the series to home consoles for Path of Radiance for the GameCube Despite it arriving late in the GameCube s life cycle it provided a late boost to sales reaffirming Nintendo s faith in the series By the series was suffering from declining sales and Nintendo told Intelligent Systems that if their next Fire Emblem failed to sell above units the series would be canceled This prompted Intelligent Systems to include many features new to the series with the intention of making it the culmination of the entire series up to that point The game s reception and sales ended up saving the series from cancellation convincing Nintendo to continue production br The series original music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko As the only music composer at Intelligent Systems when Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light was in production she acted as both composer and sound director up until Thracia when she left the company to become a freelancer after completing the score for Paper Mario She has worked on later Fire Emblem games alongside other
