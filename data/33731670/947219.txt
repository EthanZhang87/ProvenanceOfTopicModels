Donkey Kong is a arcade video game developed and published by Nintendo As Mario the player runs and jumps on platforms and climbs ladders to ascend a construction site and rescue Pauline from a giant gorilla Donkey Kong It is the first game in the Donkey Kong series and Mario s first appearance in a video game br Donkey Kong was created to salvage unsold arcade cabinets following the failure of Nintendo s Radar Scope and was designed for Nintendo of America s audience Hiroshi Yamauchi Nintendo s president at the time assigned the project to first time video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto Drawing inspiration from Beauty and the Beast and s American media such as Popeye and King Kong Miyamoto developed the characters and scenario and designed the game alongside chief engineer Gunpei Yokoi It was the most complex arcade game at that point using graphics for characterization including it and cutscenes to illustrate a plot and integrating multiple unique stages into the gameplay Donkey Kong pioneered the platform game genre before the term existed is the first to feature jumping and is the first video game with a damsel in distress narrative It had a limited release in Japan on July before receiving a wide release some weeks later br Although Nintendo of America s staff was initially apprehensive Donkey Kong succeeded commercially and critically becoming the highest grossing game of and It was ported to the Game Watch selling eight million units while Nintendo licensed the game to Coleco a developer of arcade conversions for home consoles selling six million cartridges It was later ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System NES designed to replicate its technological capabilities both the game and NES were integral in spreading Japanese video games to Western audiences Donkey Kong s various ports sold more than million units worldwide Other companies cloned the game and avoided royalties altogether Universal City Studios unsuccessfully sued Nintendo alleging that Donkey Kong violated its trademark of the King Kong franchise br Donkey Kong s success positioned Nintendo for market dominance for the s and s The game debuts Mario who became Nintendo s mascot and one of the world s most recognizable characters It was mass marketed in multitudes of products including breakfast cereal toys and television cartoons Donkey Kong is one of the most important games from the golden age of arcade video games and one of the greatest and most popular arcade games of all time It has been frequently referenced in pop culture and subsequent video games and has an active high score competition br br br Gameplay br br Following s Space Panic Donkey Kong is one of the earliest examples of the platform game genre even prior to the term being coined the U S gaming press used climbing game for games with platforms and ladders As the first platform game to feature jumping Donkey Kong requires the player to jump between gaps and over obstacles or approaching enemies setting the template for the future of the genre With four unique stages Donkey Kong was the most complex arcade game of the time and one of the first arcade games with multiple stages following games such as s Phoenix and s Gorf and Scramble br In addition to the goal of saving Pauline the player has a score Points are awarded for the following leaping over obstacles destroying objects with a hammer power up collecting items such as hats parasols and purses removing rivets from platforms and completing each stage according to a steadily decreasing bonus counter The player starts with three lives with a bonus life awarded at points A life is lost when Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object falls too far or lets the bonus counter reach zero The game ends when all lives are lost br Each of the four single screen stages represents meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed and meters Stage one involves Mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong Stage two involves climbing a five story structure of conveyor belts each of which transport cement pans The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs The final stage requires Mario to remove eight rivets from the platforms supporting Donkey Kong this causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero to be reunited with Pauline These four stages combine to form one level br After each level the stages repeat with increased difficulty For example Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally and fireballs speed up The victory music alternates between levels and The fourth level consists of five stages with the final stage at meters Level is colloquially known as the kill screen due to a programming error that kills Mario after a few seconds effectively ending the game br br br Competition br br The documentary The King of Kong A Fistful of Quarters portrays Steve Wiebe s attempts to break the Donkey Kong world record then considered to have been held by Billy Mitchell In the early s Hank Chien set a record of points This was broken four years later by Robbie Lakeman Lakeman s record was then broken by John McCurdy on January with a score of Lakeman reclaimed the world record only five months later on June scoring more points than McCurdy br In Mitchell was stripped of his records by Twin Galaxies and banned from submitting new scores after Twin Galaxies concluded that Mitchell had illicitly used emulators to achieve his scores Twin Galaxies prohibits the use of emulators for high scores they publish because they allow undetectable cheating In Guinness World Records reversed its decision and reinstated Billy Mitchell s previous world records based on new evidence including eyewitness reports and expert testimonials br There are other world record categories for Donkey Kong besides highest score One of the most popular is the No Hammer Challenge where competitors try to get the highest score without using the hammer The current world record in this category was set by Jeff Wolfe on July with a score of Some other categories include most points for different levels and fewest points br br br Plot br br Donkey Kong is considered to be the earliest video game with a storyline that visually unfolds on screen Set on a construction site in New York City the eponymous Donkey Kong character is the game s de facto villain The hero is a carpenter originally unnamed in the Japanese arcade release later named Jumpman and then Mario Donkey Kong kidnaps Mario s girlfriend originally known as Lady and later renamed Pauline The player must take the role of Mario and rescue her This is the first occurrence of the damsel in distress scenario that provided the template for countless video games released after br The game uses graphics and animation for characterization Donkey Kong smirks upon Mario s demise Pauline has a pink dress and long hair and a speech balloon crying HELP Mario depicted in red overalls and a red cap is an everyman character a type common in Japan Graphical limitations and the low pixel resolution of the small sprites prompted his design A mustache implies a mouth a cap obviates the animation of hair and colored overalls distinguish his arm movements The artwork of the cabinets and promotional materials make these cartoon like character designs even more explicit Pauline for example is depicted as disheveled like the s King Kong s Fay Wray in a torn dress and stiletto heels br Like Pac Man Donkey Kong has cutscenes but innovates by advancing a complete plot The game opens with the gorilla climbing a pair of ladders to the top of a construction site accompanied by a variation on the musical theme from Dragnet He drops Pauline and stomps his feet warping the steel beams He moves to his final perch and sneers A melody plays and the level starts This brief animation sets the scene and adds background to the gameplay a first for video games At the stage a heart appears between Mario and Pauline but Donkey Kong grabs her and climbs higher causing the heart to break The narrative concludes when Mario reaches the end of the rivet stage He and Pauline are reunited and a short intermission plays br br br Development br br Nintendo of America was founded in with minor success at importing its parent s arcade cabinets from Japan In early its president Minoru Arakawa bet the small startup company on a major order of Radar Scope Its poor reception in America filled a warehouse with unsold Radar Scope machines so Arakawa requested that the parent company president Hiroshi Yamauchi send a conversion kit of new game software Yamauchi polled the company s entire talent pool for fresh game design concepts to save the distressed startup This yielded Shigeru Miyamoto s debut as lead game designer of his Donkey Kong concept and Yamauchi appointed head engineer Gunpei Yokoi as project supervisor with a budget of equivalent to in according to Miyamoto br Ikegami Tsushinki was subcontracted for some of the development with no role in the game s creation or concept but to provide mechanical programming assistance to fix the software created by Nintendo Nintendo instructed Ikegami to produce a program according to its instructions and put it onto read only memory ROM chips on printed circuit boards PC boards This later led to mutual lawsuits in as Ikegami asserted ownership over Donkey Kong which Nintendo denied as Ikegami was a subcontractor who had already been paid Game Machine called it simply a nuisance tactic on the part of Ikegami br At the time Nintendo was also pursuing a license to make a game based on the Popeye comic strip When they experienced technical issues Nintendo took the opportunity to create new characters that could be marketed and used in later games Miyamoto came up with many characters and plot concepts but he settled on a love triangle between a gorilla a plumber with a large hammer and a girlfriend mirroring the rivalry between Bluto and Popeye for Olive Oyl Bluto became an ape which Miyamoto said was nothing too evil or repulsive He would be the pet of the main character a funny hang loose kind of guy Miyamoto has named Beauty and the Beast and the film King Kong as influences Although its origin as a comic strip license played a major part Donkey Kong marked the first time that the storyline for a video game preceded the game s programming rather than simply being appended as an afterthought An unrelated Popeye game was released by Nintendo for the Game Watch the following month as well as a game called Popeye for arcades in br Yamauchi wanted primarily to target the North American market so he mandated that the game be given an English title as with many previous Nintendo games Miyamoto decided to name the game for the ape who he said was the strongest character The story of how Miyamoto came up with the name Donkey Kong varies A false urban myth says that the name was originally meant to be Monkey Kong but was misspelled or misinterpreted due to a blurred fax or bad telephone connection Another more credible story claims Miyamoto looked in a Japanese English dictionary for something that would mean stubborn gorilla or that Donkey was meant to convey silly or stubborn Kong was common Japanese slang for gorilla A rival claim is that he worked with Nintendo s export manager to come up with the title and that Donkey was meant to represent stupid and goofy In Miyamoto stated that he thought the name would convey the thought of a stupid ape br Miyamoto had high hopes for his new project He was not a programmer so instead consulted technicians for concept feasibility He wanted to make the characters different sizes and have different movements and reactions Yokoi thought Miyamoto s original design was too complex though he had some difficult suggestions such as using see saws to catapult the hero across the screen which was eventually found too hard to program though a similar concept came later in the Popeye arcade game Miyamoto then thought of using sloped platforms barrels and ladders When he specified that the game would have multiple stages the four man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to implement the game repeatedly Nevertheless they followed Miyamoto s design creating a total of approximately kilobytes of content Yukio Kaneoka composed a soundtrack to serve as background music for the levels and story events br The circuit board of Radar Scope was restructured for Donkey Kong The Radar Scope hardware originally inspired by the Namco Galaxian hardware was designed for a large number of enemies moving around at high speeds which Donkey Kong does not require so the development team removed unnecessary functions and reduced the scale of the circuit board The gameplay and graphics were reworked for updated ROM chips and the existing CPU sound hardware and monitor were left intact The character set scoreboard upper HUD display and font are almost identical to Radar Scope with palette differences The Donkey Kong hardware has the memory capacity for displaying foreground sprites at x pixels each and background tiles at x pixels each Mario and all moving objects use single sprites the taller Pauline uses two sprites and the larger Donkey Kong uses six sprites br Hiroshi Yamauchi thought the game was going to sell well and phoned to inform Arakawa Nintendo of America s distributors Ron Judy and Al Stone brought Arakawa to the lawyer Howard Lincoln to secure a trademark br The game was sent to Nintendo of America for testing The sales manager disliked it for being too different from the maze and shooter games common at the time and Judy and Lincoln expressed reservations over the strange title Still Arakawa adamantly believed that it would be a hit American staff began translating the storyline for the cabinet art and naming the characters They chose Pauline for the Lady after Polly James wife of Nintendo s warehouse manager Don James Arakawa suggested that the name of Jumpman a name originally chosen for its similarity to the popular brands Walkman and Pac Man be changed to Mario in likeness of Mario Segale the landlord of the original office space of Nintendo of America These character names were used in promotional materials although Mario was called Jumpman in the operations manual and instructions Donkey Kong was ready for release br Stone and Judy convinced the managers of two bars in Seattle Washington to set up Donkey Kong machines The managers initially showed reluctance but when they saw sales of a day or plays for a solid week they requested more units In their Redmond headquarters a skeleton crew composed of Arakawa his wife Yoko James Judy Phillips and Stone gutted surplus Radar Scope machines and applied the Donkey Kong conversion kits imported from Japan consisting of motherboards power supplies and marquee graphics The game officially went on sale in July br br br Ports br br br Coleco br Makers of video game consoles were interested Taito offered a considerable fee for all rights to Donkey Kong but Nintendo declined after three days of internal discussion Rivals Coleco and Atari Inc approached Nintendo in Japan and the United States respectively In the end Yamauchi granted Coleco exclusive console and tabletop rights to Donkey Kong because he believed that it was the hungriest company In addition Arakawa believed that as a more established company in the U S Coleco could better handle marketing In return Nintendo received an undisclosed lump sum plus per game cartridge sold and per tabletop unit On December Howard Lincoln drafted the contract He included language that Coleco would be held liable for anything on the game cartridge an unusual clause for a licensing agreement Arakawa signed the document the next day and on February Yamauchi persuaded the Coleco representative in Japan to sign without review by the company s lawyers br Coleco bundled the game with the ColecoVision console which went on sale in August though the individual cartridge was also available in stores Coleco offered Atari and Intellivision versions as well Coleco s Atari port was programmed by Garry Kitchen Kitchen was contracted to port the game through his brother Steve who had connections to an executive at Coleco He was given only three or four months to develop the port and worked without sleep for the last hours before shipping Kitchen received no assistance from Nintendo and minimal aid from Coleco who only provided him with an arcade machine for temporary use These factors combined with the limited memory of Atari cartridges forced him to omit two of the original game s four levels Coleco s sales subsequently doubled to million and its earnings quadrupled to million Coleco also released stand alone Mini Arcade tabletop versions of Donkey Kong along with Pac Man Galaxian and Frogger in Coleco also bundled a copy of Donkey Kong with its Atari VCS clone the Coleco Gemini in br br br Atari br Atari obtained the license for home computer versions of Donkey Kong and released it for the Atari bit computers When Coleco unveiled the Adam Computer running a port of Donkey Kong at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago Illinois Atari protested that it was in violation of the licensing agreement Yamauchi demanded that Arnold Greenberg Coleco s president withdraw his Adam port Greenberg complied and the game was not published br The Atari bit conversion of Donkey Kong contains one of the longest undiscovered Easter eggs in a video game Programmer Landon Dyer s initials appear if the player dies under certain conditions and returns to the title screen This remained undiscovered for years until Dyer revealed it on his blog stating that there s an Easter egg but it s totally not worth it and I don t remember how to bring it up anyway The steps required to trigger it were later discovered by Don Hodges who used an emulator and a debugger to trace through the game s code br br br Famicom NES br br The game was ported by Nintendo Research Development to Nintendo s Family Computer Famicom console and released in Japan on July as one of the system s three launch games Masayuki Uemura the Famicom s lead architect designed the console specifically to faithfully recreate Donkey Kong It is an early Nintendo Entertainment System NES game in the Arcade Classics Series released on June in North America and October in Europe Omitted are the cement factory stage and most of the cutscenes because early ROM cartridges do not have enough memory It includes a new song composed by Yukio Kaneoka for the title screen Both Donkey Kong and its sequel Donkey Kong Jr are included in the NES compilation Donkey Kong Classics br br br Game Boy br br A complete remake of the original arcade game on the Game Boy titled Donkey Kong referred to as Donkey Kong during development contains levels from both the original Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr arcades It starts with the same gameplay and four locations as the arcade game and then progresses to additional puzzle based levels It is the first game to have built in enhancement for the Super Game Boy system br br br Reception br br Upon release in arcades Computer and Video Games compared it favorably with King Kong and predicted that it would likely become a success In his book Video Invaders Steve Bloom described Donkey Kong as another bizarre cartoon game courtesy of Japan and said it was one of the most exciting variations on Pac Man s maze theme along with Sega s Frogger due to how players need to scale from the bottom of the screen to the top which make them more like obstacle courses than mazes since you always know where you re going up In January the Arcade Awards gave it the award for the best single player video game and the Certificate of Merit as runner up for Coin Op Game of the Year br In September Arcade Express reviewed the ColecoVision port and scored it out of Creative Computing Video Arcade Games in stated that Coleco did a fabulous job with Donkey Kong the best of the console s first five games and the most faithful adaptation of the original video game I have seen The magazine s Danny Goodman stated that of Coleco s three console versions the one for the ColecoVision was the best followed by Atari and Intellivision Computer and Video Games reviewed the ColecoVision port in its September issue and scored it out of in all four categories of Action Graphics Addiction and Theme Ed Driscoll reviewed the Atari VCS version of Donkey Kong in The Space Gamer No Edwards commented that the game is near perfect and that anyone can be caught in Donkey Kong fever br br br Commercial performance br Donkey Kong was popular worldwide garnering a positive reaction from consumers and was a significant commercial success for Nintendo pulling them out of financial troubles After the game s initial arcade cabinets sold out more orders were made Arakawa began manufacturing the electronic components in Redmond because waiting for shipments from Japan was taking too long The game s success led to Arakawa expanding Nintendo of America By October Donkey Kong was selling units a month and by June Nintendo had sold Donkey Kong machines in the United States earning million Judy and Stone who worked on straight commission became millionaires Arakawa used Nintendo s profits to buy acres ha of land in Redmond in July Nintendo earned another million on the game in its second year of release in America totaling million in US cabinet sales by equivalent to in br In Japan the annual Game Machine charts listed Donkey Kong as the highest grossing arcade game of and then the sixth highest grossing arcade game of with Game Machine later listing

original Donkey Kong are estimated to have grossed billion in revenue br br br Legal issues br br In April Sid Sheinberg a lawyer and the president of MCA and Universal City Studios learned of the game s success and suspected it might be a trademark infringement of Universal s own King Kong On April he met with Arnold Greenberg of Coleco and threatened to sue over Coleco s home version of Donkey Kong Coleco agreed on May to pay royalties to Universal of of their Donkey Kong s net sale price worth about million Meanwhile Sheinberg revoked Tiger s license to make its King Kong game but O R Rissman refused to acknowledge Universal s claim to the trademark When Universal threatened Nintendo Howard Lincoln and Nintendo refused to cave In preparation for the court battle Universal agreed to allow Tiger to continue producing its King Kong game as long as they distinguished it from Donkey Kong br Universal sued Nintendo on June and announced its license with Coleco The company sent cease and desist letters to Nintendo s licensees all of which agreed to pay royalties to Universal except Milton Bradley and Ralston Purina Universal City Studios Inc v Nintendo Co Ltd was heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by Judge Robert W Sweet Over seven days Universal s counsel the New York firm Townley Updike argued that the names King Kong and Donkey Kong were easily confused and that the plot of the game was an infringement on that of the films Nintendo s counsel John Kirby countered that Universal had argued in a previous case that King Kong s scenario and characters were in the public domain by way of the Novelisation of the film Judge Sweet ruled in Nintendo s favor awarding them Universal s profits from Tiger s game damages and attorney s fees br Universal appealed trying to prove consumer confusion by presenting the results of a telephone survey and examples from print media where people had allegedly assumed a connection between the two Kongs On October the court upheld the previous verdict Nintendo and its licensees filed counterclaims against Universal On May Judge Sweet awarded Nintendo million for legal fees lost revenues and other expenses but he denied Nintendo s claim of damages from those licensees who had paid royalties to both Nintendo and Universal Both parties appealed this judgment but the verdict was upheld on July br Nintendo thanked John Kirby with the gift of a sailboat named Donkey Kong and exclusive worldwide rights to use the name for sailboats Kirby the protagonist of the Kirby series was named in John Kirby s honor The court battle also taught Nintendo they could compete with larger entertainment industry companies br After the release of Donkey Kong Jr the arcade successor to Donkey Kong Ikegami sued Nintendo for the unauthorized duplication of the Donkey Kong program code Nintendo managed to settle the dispute out of court after the two companies came to an agreement At the time of the suit computer programs were not considered copyrightable material The Tokyo High Court gave a verdict in that acknowledged the originality of program code Ikegami and Nintendo reached a settlement the following year the terms of it were never disclosed br br br Legacy br In Next Generation listed the arcade Atari and cancelled Coleco Adam versions as number on their Top Games of All Time commenting that even ignoring its massive historical significance Donkey Kong stands as a great game due to its demanding challenges and graphics which manage to elegantly delineate an entire scenario on a single screen In February Nintendo Power rated it the th best game made on a Nintendo system In The Strong National Museum of Play inducted Donkey Kong to its World Video Game Hall of Fame Today Donkey Kong is the fifth most popular arcade game among collectors br br br Impact br Donkey Kong spawned a number of other titles with a mix of running jumping and vertical traversal a novel genre that did not match the style of games that came before it The genre was initially referred to as Donkey Kong type or Kong style games before the genre eventually came to be known as platform games The game was also a milestone in terms of video game storytelling and cutscenes While there were earlier games that either told a story or used cutscenes Donkey Kong combined both concepts together to introduce its own new concept using cutscenes to visually advance a complete story It also notably had multiple distinct levels that progressed the storyline br Donkey Kong was also one of the first Japanese games brought to Western regions that introduced a surreal concept using cute artwork a representation of typical Japanese fantasy but unusual to Western audiences For that reason Donkey Kong and similar games that followed were briefly called novelty games by Western gaming press Donkey Kong and other such games helped to acclimate Western audiences to Japanese approaches to game design narrative and abstraction that would become key elements in the decade that followed with the release of the NES br Computer and Video Games called Donkey Kong the most momentous release of as it introduced three important names to the global video game industry Nintendo Shigeru Miyamoto and Mario These three figures went on to play a significant role in video game history Donkey Kong paved the way for the NES known as the Famicom in Japan Following the success of Donkey Kong Nintendo began developing the Famicom the hardware of which was largely based on the Donkey Kong arcade hardware with the goal of matching the system s powerful sprite capabilities in a home system Nintendo wanted the Famicom to match the Donkey Kong arcade hardware so they took a Donkey Kong arcade cabinet to semiconductor chip manufacturer Ricoh for analysis which led to Ricoh producing the Picture Processing Unit PPU chip for the NES br br br Emulation br The NES version was

home platforms There were so many games with multiple ladder and platforms stages by that Electronic Games described Nintendo s own Popeye game as yet another variation of a theme that s become all too familiar since the success of Donkey Kong That year Sega released a Donkey Kong clone called Congo Bongo in arcades Although using isometric perspective the structure and gameplay are similar br Crazy Kong was officially licensed from Nintendo and manufactured by Falcon for some non US markets Nevertheless Crazy Kong machines found their way into some American arcades often installed in cabinets marked as Congorilla Nintendo was quick to take legal action against those distributing the game in the US Bootleg copies of Donkey Kong also appeared in both North America and France under
