previously produced Atari related products and the Game Gadget Blaze began development of the Evercade in with the intention of creating a console superior to plug and play devices The Evercade was announced in April as a portable retrogaming console with the ability to be connected to a television screen The console would play emulated video games with a focus on the bit and bit gaming eras br The Evercade was initially scheduled to release in the fourth quarter of before being delayed to March The release was later pushed back to May although this was expected to be delayed up to two additional weeks in some areas because of shipping delays caused by the COVID pandemic The console retailed for with a pack in game cartridge while a premium edition retailed for and included three game cartridges The console is white and red in color for a retro appearance like the Nintendo Famicom although a black edition was also sold in the United Kingdom Development director Andrew Byatt hoped to sell hundreds of thousands of units within the first year br On May Blaze announced that it would discontinue the Evercade in favor of an upgraded version known as the Evercade EXP br br br Hardware br The Evercade has a GHz Cortex A processor and it uses a Linux base The Evercade is just over seven inches long has megabytes of RAM and has a horizontal inch LCD screen with a resolution of x pixels The screen uses the aspect ratio as some of the console s games were originally released for systems such as the Atari Lynx that use a wider screen ratio than The player can switch between the two aspect ratios br Like the Nintendo Switch the Evercade can be connected to a television however with a mini HDMI cable as opposed to a normal HDMI output The Evercade offers a television output of p and supports high definition upscaling on all games when the console is connected to a television The console has a rechargeable mAh battery that lasts four to five hours A minijack for headphones is located on the bottom of the console along with two volume controls The cartridge slot power button and the mini HDMI port are located on the top of the system A MicroUSB port is used for charging the battery Unlike modern handheld consoles the Evercade does not have a touch screen or Wi Fi connectivity br Blaze Entertainment developed versions of the Evercade D pad before settling on a final version The design is based on the D pads featured on the Genesis and Saturn controllers Aside from the D pad the console includes four action buttons on the front and two trigger buttons on top It also has menu select and start buttons The layout of the four action buttons was determined after Blaze conducted an online poll which found that percent of people wanted a layout like those used on modern game controllers However this created confusion as in game prompts never match the buttons a player may need to press B when prompted to press A As the console launched Blaze released a firmware update for the layout issue requiring the user to connect the console through USB to the Evercade website br Two player games converted for the Evercade retain the multiplayer function with the intention that future hardware will allow two players The addition of Bluetooth had been considered as a way to add multiplayer but the development team scrapped this idea because of cost and complexity which did not go well with the console s focus At the end of before the Evercade s release Blaze was already working on a second version with multiplayer capability and a possible easier alternative for connecting the console to a television br br br Games br br Games for the Evercade are distributed on multi game ROM cartridges each one usually containing between and games although several cartridges contained fewer than five games Evercade cartridges support the ability to save a game a modern feature not usually present in older games The Evercade s use of game cartridges was considered unique as most retro handheld consoles used built in or downloaded game ROMs Unlike other retro consoles the goal for the Evercade was to provide retrogamers a chance to build a collection of physical games Cartridges clamshell packaging and paper instruction manuals were part of the effort to appeal to retrogamers as digital game downloads had become common in recent years Cartridges and their packaging are numbered to encourage collecting Evercade cartridges are white in color and are similar in size to Game Boy and Game Gear cartridges Giga Carts though identical in appearance and size will feature additional storage space for emulating modern games on the Evercade These cartridges will debut in br Cartridges contain recreations of existing games through emulation and Evercade developers worked with the original software developers to ensure accurate game recreations Atari was announced in April as the first game publisher to work with the Evercade developers Subsequent partnerships were announced with Interplay Entertainment Data East and Bandai Namco Entertainment Each Evercade cartridge contains games unique to their respective publishing company br br Blaze Entertainment held discussions with game licensees and requested specific games for release on the Evercade Such games were usually well known or rare Games from Japanese studios were also sought for release on the Evercade Aside from Blaze s requests licensees would also make their own suggestions on which games to release Byatt said that many games were turned down for consideration We ve gone for quality over quantity in our view We don t want to be a console that has games Other games could not be licensed for an Evercade release because of lost paperwork that was necessary to prove who owns the rights to such games Discussions were also held with indie game developers about launching original retro like games on the console Mega Cat Studios later made an agreement to release an Evercade cartridge with homebrew games that had previously been released for the NES and the Mega Drive br The Evercade runs emulators that have been licensed by Blaze or custom built in some cases The console is capable of playing games originally released for the Atari the Atari the Atari Lynx the br NES the SNES the Mega Drive and the Intellivision The Evercade is also capable of running Neo Geo games although such games have not been emulated for the console and developers would need to reach a compromise between accuracy and performance br The Evercade had game cartridges available at launch providing a total of games Blaze intended to build up an Evercade game collection of more than cartridges over the next few years Cartridges by Piko Interactive and Mega Cat were among those available at launch Evercade games typically sell for Arc System Works published a cartridge full of beat em up games originally developed by Techn s The Namco Museum Collection cartridge includes the first official English translation of the game Mappy Kids Iron Commando which had previously received only a limited release by Piko also saw a release on the Evercade Other cartridges include games such as Tanglewood and a collection of Atari Lynx games br Home conversions of arcade games such as Asteroids for the Atari and Pac Man for the NES have also been released The original arcade ROMs were initially not used because of issues concerning the aspect ratio as some arcade games use a vertical screen that would not display properly on the Evercade s horizontal screen A collection of games by the Oliver Twins was released later in The collection has games including Wonderland Dizzy A cartridge of Jaleco games was released in along with another cartridge containing games from the Worms series Other cartridges included collections of indie games as well as Intellivision games In Blaze also began releasing cartridges featuring arcade ROMs with the first four containing games from Techn s Data East Gaelco and Atari In July Blaze announced a cartridge featuring Commodore games the first with ROMs from a home computer system Cartridge cases are different in color red for retro purple for arcade and blue for computer Each type is also numbered separately br In addition to those available on cartridges hidden games can be unlocked from menu codes button combo codes and certain combinations of cartridges inserted into the Evercade VS together br br br Reception br Reviewers praised the console s emulation of classic games Andrew Liszewski of Gizmodo stated that the games worked flawlessly There s no stutter no dropped frames no screen tearing artifacts and no issues with sound sync They just all work and let you immediately jump into what s important the gameplay Brendan Griffith of GamesRadar rated the Evercade three and a half stars out of five and called it handheld heaven for older gamers wanting to revisit some classic games while writing that curious newcomers may also have an interest in it Damien McFerran of Nintendo Life called the system appealing enough to surely sell in the modest numbers required to build a fairly robust audience John Linneman of Digital Foundry praised the size of the console compared to smaller handhelds writing that it has a nice weight and doesn t feel like a cheap hollow device Adam Patrick Murray of PC World rated the console four and a half stars out of five and also praised its size Liszewski praised the Evercade for its simplicity Simon Hill of Wired rated it out of and praised the save feature br Andrew Webster of The Verge stated that the Evercade straddles the line between modern and retro in a way that s very satisfying while writing that the game cartridges strike a nice balance of well known hits and more obscure releases Nick Thorpe of Retro Gamer praised the inclusion of Atari games which are lesser known and more difficult to acquire Adam Ismail of Tom s Guide rated the console four stars out of five but criticized the lack of games from Nintendo and Sega Marcus Estrada of Hardcore Gamer praised the variety of available games but criticized arcade games such as Centipede for being home conversions rather than original releases He ultimately concluded that the console is a love letter to retro games that will be welcomed into the homes of classic gaming fans and collectors worldwide Will Greenwald of PC Magazine rated the Evercade out of but was also critical of the home conversion arcade games McFerran praised the cartridges for their inclusion of popular games but wrote you really have to buy all carts to get all of the best games and some of the collections are padded out with filler that you ll play once and forget about Other reviewers also opined that many of the games would have limited appeal Some reviewers overwhelmed by the wide selection of downloadable ROMs through the Internet praised the Evercade for its limited selection br Reviewers praised the controls but criticized the layout of the action buttons Linneman wrote With NES games for instance A and B are mapped to the corresponding buttons where I would typically prefer X and A Mega Drive Genesis games also make use of A B and Y which again doesn t feel entirely natural to me Ismail praised the company for its quick response to the layout issue The fact Blaze moved swiftly to push this update out in such close proximity to the handheld s release is a very encouraging sign that the company is listening Murray was critical of the shoulder buttons for being too sensitive and the action buttons for being placed too close to each other br Reviewers complained that the games fit too tightly in the cartridge slot making extraction difficult This was worsened by the fact that the cartridges have a smooth design which makes gripping them difficult Blaze stated that these reviewers had received an early model and that the issue was remedied ahead of the console s launch Kyle Orland of Ars Technica criticized the use of cartridges at a time when downloadable games had become commonplace Going back to the bad old days of switching between cartridges just isn t that appealing anymore br The console s price was praised and considered affordable The cartridge packaging received praise as well Some critics were disappointed that the console uses a MicroUSB port rather than USB C and others were disappointed by the lack of multiplayer functionality Estrada wrote that a small number of games such as Splatterhouse suffer from audio glitches Other critics also complained of audio problems but Blaze worked to correct them br Reviewers stated that viewing the screen from an angle reduces the quality and visibility Liszewski wrote that the screen is one of the largest ever seen on a handheld console but not one of the best stating you don t have to tilt the console too far to find the screen starting to lose color He added that the resolution is fine for gameplay but it leaves menus looking over pixelated unless you re willing to just pass that off as retro charm Other reviewers criticized the minimal menu designs as well Some reviewers complained of a visual problem in which shimmering was present during scrolling Linneman was critical of the limited aspect selections br br br Subsequent consoles br br br Evercade VS br br In April Blaze announced a home console version known as Evercade VS It is backwards compatible with most games released for the handheld Evercade with an output of p Unlike the handheld console
