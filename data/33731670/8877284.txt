The R Zone is a portable game console originally head worn later handheld developed and manufactured by Tiger Electronics The R Zone was shown at the American International Toy Fair in February and was released later that year The R Zone was panned by critics and was also a commercial disaster with its lifespan lasting only two years before being discontinued in Although the R Zone was not designed to compete directly with any other handhelds it marked Tiger Electronics first multi game entry into the portable electronic game market br The original R Zone unit consists of a headset and a separate controller containing batteries Each game cartridge has its own transparent LCD display screen which is projected onto a mirrored surface held in front of the player s eye It is thought that this original design including the red color scheme was designed to capitalize on popular buzz for the Nintendo Virtual Boy at the time However Tiger has never confirmed this theory br Three additional versions of the R Zone were subsequently released the R Zone SuperScreen the XPG Xtreme Pocket Game and the DataZone It has been constantly regarded as one of the worst video game consoles ever made br br br Games br br R Zone games mostly vary only in title and subject gameplay within the R Zone s gaming library is almost identical from title to title As with Tiger s other gaming units the software lineup is dominated by licensed titles Games released for the console include Batman Forever Virtua Fighter Mortal Kombat VR Troopers Indy Star Wars Men in Black and The Lost World

The R Zone has ten face buttons The buttons on the right are labeled A B C and D The functions of these face buttons vary from game to game but typically the buttons correspond to a four direction attack scheme where the C button attacks to the left the D button attacks up the B button attacks right and the A button attacks down or does nothing at all The buttons on the bottom are labeled ON START SELECT SOUND PAUSE and OFF The functions of these face buttons are universal and do not vary from game to game The ON button simply turns on the console but is largely un used as inserting a game cartridge automatically turns the unit on The START button is required to begin all games The SOUND button toggles the audio on and off The PAUSE button allows for any game to be paused The OFF button turns the console off br The R Zone also features a directional pad allowing four directions of movement in its games br The R Zone has no microprocessor or memory Those components are contained in a microcontroller inside the game cartridge The console itself acts as a front polarizer for the LCD a Speaker and a shift register for the controls br The R Zone game cartridges are transparent in the center This allows light to pass through and reflect off a specialized mirror to the gamer s eyes The LCD in each cartridge operates identically to Tiger s earlier handheld LCD game units All of the graphics were pre drawn and permanently set into the LCD itself Different portions of the display are darkened activated at different times to provide animation br The mirror has minor tilt adjustment and can be pushed up against the unit for protection and storage The games only display a dark red color br The bottom side of the console shows two ports one on the left side the other on the right Each port is accessible with a screwdriver and holds the batteries br A single speaker allows for mono audio output br br br Variations br br A few variations of the R Zone were produced br br The R Zone Headgear was released in late and is largely different from later units in that the game cartridge is inserted into a device that is strapped onto the user s head The user flips down a transparent lens that was designed to reflect the game images into the user s right eye The head unit holds the game being played and is connected to a controller with a cable approximately feet m long The controller requires AAA batteries and sports a cartridge storage slot for keeping an additional game protected and available volume adjustment dial and brightness adjustment dial The console was priced at launch and included a pack in game br The R Zone SuperScreen was released in late and initially cost It allowed R Zone games to have color for the first time Some games allow for a special lens to be used with this particular R Zone and simply provide the user with a non animated color background Game movement on screen is black The screen is considerably larger than the other R Zone models because of this and the fact that the user is not required to look at a mirror at a precise angle to see the gameplay other people can also see gameplay The unit changed the layout again and requires D batteries to run In this model the D pad was swapped out for four directional buttons up down left and right br The R Zone DataZone was released in late It is another handheld version of the console but includes a data organizer It no longer projects the image through a mirror but rather just flat displays it with a backlight It uses one watch battery to store data and AAA batteries to run the games br The R Zone XPG short for Xtreme Pocket Game is a completely handheld version of the console released in It lacks a headset and instead projects the display onto a mirrored surface directly above the game controller area on the unit This version also uses AAA batteries br br br Reception br The console was panned by critics upon its release At the time of its release David Jones of the Chicago Tribune called the R Zone a waste of time and money and wrote that its screen is hard to see and the controls are very awkward That s not all if you keep the headband on for say five minutes you ll have two deep lines on your forehead and a headache Jones noted the failure of the R Zone s extra headband padding which was designed to prevent pain and concluded the R Zone should be dumped into the trash can where it belongs Electronic Gaming Monthly remarked that while the display takes time to get used to and is not even in the same league as the Virtual Boy s immersive experience the R Zone is much less expensive and unlike the Virtual Boy is functionally portable br In Mikel Reparaz of GamesRadar included the R Zone on a list of the worst game consoles released up to that time Reparaz considered the R Zone to be a poor version of Nintendo s Virtual Boy and stated that it was essentially just a gimmicky version of the same awful clicky beepy LCD games that Tiger had been dumping on the market since the s br In in the episode Tiger Electronic Games the Angry Video Game Nerd described the console as basically a shitty version of the Virtual Boy and questioned what planet the console came from during his review of it br In Motherboard called the R Zone perhaps the most infamous product ever associated with Tiger stating that the console s games were glorified versions of Tiger s LCD games Motherboard stated that the R Zone was similar to the Virtual Boy in some ways but considered the R Zone to be much much worse br br br br
