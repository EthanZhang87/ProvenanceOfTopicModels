The Legend of Zelda Link s Awakening is a action adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy It is the first installment in The Legend of Zelda series for a handheld game

stranded on Koholint Island a place guarded by a whale like deity called the Wind Fish Assuming the role of Link the player fights monsters and solves puzzles while searching for eight musical instruments that will awaken the sleeping Wind Fish and allow him to escape from the island br Development began as an effort to port the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game A Link to the Past to the Game Boy developed after hours by Nintendo staff It grew into an original project under the direction of Takashi Tezuka with a story and script created by Yoshiaki Koizumi and Kensuke Tanabe The majority of the Link to the Past team reassembled for Link s Awakening and Tezuka wanted the game world to feel like the television series Twin Peaks After a development period of one and a half years Link s Awakening was released in Japan in June and worldwide later in the year br Link s Awakening was critically and commercially successful Critics praised the game s depth and number of features complaints focused on its control scheme and monochrome graphics An updated rerelease The Legend of Zelda Link s Awakening DX was released for the Game Boy Color in featuring color graphics compatibility with the Game Boy Printer and an exclusive color based dungeon The game has sold four million units worldwide and have appeared on multiple game publications lists of the best video games of all time A high definition remake for the Nintendo Switch was developed by Grezzo and released worldwide in br br br Gameplay br br Like most games in The Legend of Zelda series Link s Awakening is an action adventure game focused on exploration and combat The majority of the game takes place from an overhead perspective The player traverses the overworld of Koholint Island while fighting monsters and exploring underground dungeons Dungeons steadily become larger and more difficult and feature Nightmare boss characters that the player must defeat taking different forms in each dungeon and getting harder to defeat each time Success earns the player heart containers which increase the amount of damage the player character can survive when all of the player s heart containers have been emptied the game restarts at the last doorway entered by the character Defeating a Nightmare also earns the player one of the eight instruments necessary to complete the game br Link s Awakening was the first overhead perspective Zelda game to allow Link to jump this enables sidescrolling sequences similar to those in the earlier Zelda II The Adventure of Link Players can expand their abilities with items which are discovered in dungeons and through character interactions Certain items grant access to previously inaccessible areas and are needed to enter and complete dungeons The player may steal items from the game s shop but doing so changes the player character s name to THIEF for the rest of the game and causes the shopkeeper to knock out the character upon re entry of the shop br In addition to the main quest Link s Awakening contains side missions and diversions Collectible secret seashells are hidden throughout the game when twenty of these are found the player can receive a powerful sword that fires energy beams when the player character is at full health similar to the sword in the original The Legend of Zelda Link s Awakening is the first Zelda game to include a trading sequence minigame the player may give a certain item to a character who in turn gives the player another item to trade with someone else It is also the first game in the Zelda series in which the A and B buttons may be assigned to different items which enables more varied puzzles and item combinations Other series elements originating in Link s Awakening include fishing and learning special songs on an ocarina the latter mechanic is central to the next Zelda game released Ocarina of Time br br br Synopsis br br br Setting and characters br br Unlike most The Legend of Zelda titles Link s Awakening is set outside the kingdom of Hyrule It omits locations and characters from previous games aside from protagonist Link and a passing mention of Princess Zelda Instead the game takes place entirely on Koholint Island an isolated landmass cut off from the rest of the world The island though small contains a large number of secrets and interconnected pathways Within the Zelda timeline Link s Awakening takes place after Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past but before Oracle of Seasons and Ages br In Link s Awakening the player is given advice and directions by non player characters such as Ulrira a shy old man who communicates with Link exclusively by telephone The game contains cameo appearances by characters from other Nintendo titles such as Wart Yoshi Kirby Dr Wright renamed Mr Write from the Super NES version of SimCity and the exiled prince Richard from The Frog for Whom the Bell Tolls Chomp an enemy from the Mario series was included after a programmer gave Link the ability to grab the creature and take it for a walk Enemies from Super Mario Bros such as Goombas and Piranha Plants also appear in underground side scrolling sections Link may land on top of them much as with Super Mario Bros or he can attack them in the usual way the two methods yield different bonuses Director Takashi Tezuka said that the game s freewheeling development made Link s Awakening seem like a parody of The Legend of Zelda series Certain characters in the game break the fourth wall for example little children inform the player of game mechanics such as saving but admit that they do not understand the advice they are giving br br br Plot br After the events of A Link to the Past the hero Link travels by ship to other countries to train for further threats A storm destroys his boat at sea and he washes ashore on Koholint Island where he is taken to the house of Tarin by his daughter Marin She is fascinated by Link and the outside world and tells Link wishfully that if she were a seagull she would leave and travel across the sea After Link recovers his sword a mysterious owl tells him that he must wake the Wind Fish Koholint s guardian in order to return home The Wind Fish lies dreaming in a giant egg on top of Mt Tamaranch and can only be awakened by the eight Instruments of the Sirens br Link proceeds to explore a series of dungeons in order to recover the eight instruments During his search for the sixth instrument Link goes to the Ancient Ruins There he finds a mural that details the reality of the island that it is merely a dream world created by the Wind Fish After this revelation the owl tells Link that this is only a rumor and only the Wind Fish knows for certain whether it is true Throughout Koholint Island nightmare creatures attempt to obstruct Link s quest for the instruments as they wish to rule the Wind Fish s dreamworld br After collecting all eight instruments from the eight dungeons across Koholint Link climbs to the top of Mt Tamaranch and plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish This breaks open the egg in which the Wind Fish sleeps Link enters and confronts the last evil being a Nightmare that takes the form of Ganon and other enemies from Link s past Its final transformation is DethI a cyclopean dual tentacled Shadow After Link defeats DethI the owl reveals itself to be the Wind Fish s spirit and the Wind Fish confirms that Koholint is all his dream When Link plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish again he and the Wind Fish awaken Koholint Island and all its inhabitants slowly disappear Link finds himself lying on his ship s driftwood in the middle of the ocean with the Wind Fish flying overhead If the player did not lose any lives during the game Marin is shown flying after the ending credits finish br br br Development br Link s Awakening began as an unsanctioned side project programmer Kazuaki Morita created a Zelda like game with one of the first Game Boy development kits and he used it to experiment with the platform s capabilities Other staff members of the Nintendo Entertainment Analysis Development division joined him after hours and worked on the game in what seemed to them like an afterschool club The results of these experiments with the Game Boy started to look promising Following the release of the Super NES video game A Link to the Past director Takashi Tezuka asked for permission to develop a handheld Zelda title he intended it to be a port of A Link to the Past but it evolved into an original game The majority of the team that had created A Link to the Past was reassembled to advance this new project Altogether it took them one and a half years to develop Link s Awakening br br Tezuka recalled that the early free form development of Link s Awakening resulted in the game s unrestrained contents such as the unauthorized cameo appearances of characters from the Mario and Kirby series A Link to the Past script writer Kensuke Tanabe joined the team early on and came up with the basis of the story Tezuka sought to make Link s Awakening a spin off and he gave Tanabe instructions to omit common series elements such as Princess Zelda the Triforce relic and the setting Hyrule As a consequence Tanabe proposed his game world idea of an island with an egg on top of a mountain Tezuka recalled that it felt as though they were making a parody of The Legend of Zelda rather than an actual Zelda game br Later on Yoshiaki Koizumi who had previously helped with the plot of A Link to the Past was brought into the team Koizumi was responsible for the main story of Link s Awakening provided the idea of the island in a dream and conceived the interactions with the villagers Link s Awakening was described by series producer Eiji Aonuma as the first Zelda game with a proper plot which he attributed to Koizumi s romanticism Tezuka intended the game s world to have a similar feeling to the American television series Twin Peaks which like Link s Awakening features characters in a small town He suggested that the characters of Link s Awakening be written as suspicious types akin to those in Twin Peaks a theme which carried over into later Zelda titles Tanabe created these odd characters he was placed in charge of the subevents of the story and wrote almost all of the character dialog with the exception of the owl s and the Wind Fish s lines Twin Peaks co creator Mark Frost had previously met with a Nintendo engineer in for a conversation regarding a Twin Peaks video game and they discussed the inspiration of Twin Peaks in regards to the expansion of the Zelda universe Tanabe implemented a previous idea of the world ending when a massive egg breaks on top of a mountain this idea was originally meant for A Link to the Past Tanabe really wanted to see this idea in a game and was able to implement it in Link s Awakening as the basic concept br Masanao Arimoto and Shigefumi Hino designed the game s characters while Yoichi Kotabe served as illustrator Save for the opening and the ending all pictures in the game were drawn by Arimoto Yasahisa Yamamura designed the dungeons which included the conception of rooms and routes as well as the placement of enemies Shigeru Miyamoto who served as the producer of Link s Awakening did not provide creative input to the staff members However he participated as game tester and his opinions greatly influenced the latter half of the development br The music for Link s Awakening was composed by Minako Hamano Kozue Ishikawa for whom it was their first game project and Kazumi Totaka who also was responsible for the sound programming and all sound effects As with most Zelda games Link s Awakening includes a variation of the recurring overworld music The staff credits theme Yume o Miru Shima e was later arranged for orchestra by Yuka Tsujiyoko and performed at the Orchestral Game Music Concert in Super Smash Bros Brawl includes a remix of the game s Tal Tal Heights theme which has since returned in subsequent Super Smash Bros titles br In an interview about the evolution of the Zelda series Aonuma called Link s Awakening the quintessential isometric Zelda game At another time he stated that had the game not come after A Link to the Past Ocarina of Time would have been very different Tezuka said that he prefers the game over A Link to the Past as he enjoyed the challenge of making a similar game on lower specced hardware Several elements from Link s Awakening were re used in later Zelda titles for example programmer Morita created a fishing minigame that reappeared in Ocarina of Time among others Tanabe implemented a trading sequence Tezuka compared it to the Japanese Straw Millionaire folktale in which someone trades up from a piece of straw to something of greater value This concept also appeared in most sequels br br br Release br br To support the North American release of Link s Awakening Nintendo sponsored a crosscountry train competition called the Zelda Whistle Stop Tour The event which lasted three days allowed select players to test Link s Awakening in a timed race to complete the game The event was meant not only to showcase the game but also the Game Boy s superior battery life and portability the latter of which was critical to the accessibility of a portable Zelda title The company owned magazine Nintendo Power published a guide to the game s first three areas in its July issue br In to promote the launch of the Game Boy Color Nintendo re released Link s Awakening as The Legend of Zelda Link s Awakening DX It features fully colorized graphics and is backward compatible with the original Game Boy Link s Awakening DX contains a new optional dungeon with unique enemies and puzzles based on color due to this the dungeon cannot be accessed on the earlier non color Game Boy models After completing the dungeon the player may choose to receive either a red or blue tunic which increase attack and defense respectively The DX version also allows players to take photos after the player visits a camera shop its owner will appear in certain locations throughout the game A total of twelve photos can be taken which may be viewed at the shop or printed with the Game Boy Printer accessory For Link s Awakening DX Tezuka returned as project supervisor with Yoshinori Tsuchiyama as the new director Nobuo Matsumiya collaborated with Tsuchiyama on applying changes to the original script for example hint messages were added to the boss battles For the new dungeon Yuichi Ozaki created a musical piece based on Kondo s dungeon theme from the original The Legend of Zelda br Nintendo later re released the DX version on the Virtual Console of the Nintendo DS on June In July Link s Awakening DX was offered as one of several Virtual Console games which elite status members of the North America Club Nintendo could redeem as a free gift A high definition remake was developed by Grezzo and released for the Nintendo Switch on September br Link s Awakening was included in a Zelda themed Game Watch console alongside The Legend of Zelda and
