Online console gaming involves connecting a console to a network over the Internet for services Through this connection it provides users the ability to play games with other users online in addition to other online services br The three most common networks now are Microsoft s Xbox network Sony s PlayStation Network and Nintendo s Nintendo Switch Online and Nintendo Network These networks feature cross platform capabilities which allows users to use a single account However the services provided by both are still limited to the console connected e g an Xbox One cannot download an Xbox game unless the game is part of the Xbox to Xbox One backwards compatibility program br Additional services provided by these networks include the capability of buying additional games online chatting downloadable content and game demos br br br Early attempts br The earliest experiments relating to online connectivity on game consoles were done as far back as the early s For some consoles Dial Up internet connectivity was made available through the use of special cartridges along with an adapter The GameLine for the Atari and the PlayCable for the Intellivision are two notable examples of this Services like these did not have multiplayer online gaming capability but did allow users to download games from a central server and play them usually requiring a fee for continued access However neither the GameLine or PlayCable attained mainstream popularity and both services were shut down during the video game crash br During the s a number of online gaming networks were introduced for home consoles but due to a multitude of problems they failed to make a significant impact on the console gaming industry For a number of years such networks were limited to the Japanese market In a November interview Shigeru Miyamoto remarked that online multiplayer gaming had not achieved mainstream success and would not for a long while yet because the technology of the time could not provide the quick and easy startup that general consumers would want from a plug and play console br The first online initiative by Nintendo was the Family Computer Network System for the Famicom only released for Japan in This device allowed users to access things such as game cheats stock trades weather reports and some downloadable content for their games It failed to catch on br The Sega Net

January but it was never released for the region br Sega then brought a similar online service to North America the Sega Channel debuted in December Sega Channel provided users the opportunity to download new games straight to their consoles with the purchase of a cartridge similar sold through General Instruments The service cost USD per month and at one point had over American subscribers while also building a following overseas but Sega decided to halt the project and provide an online portal in their new console the Sega Saturn br AT T unveiled the Edge an online gaming peripheral which featured simultaneous voice and data transmission at the Consumer Electronics Show However AT T cancelled it in having decided that its USD price tag and lack of a match up service meaning players would have to find someone to play with on the network themselves would prevent it from achieving any popularity br In an American company Catapult Entertainment developed the XBAND a rd party peripheral which provided customers the ability to connect with other users and play games through network connections The peripheral cost USD and required a monthly fee of USD for sessions month or USD for unlimited use The XBAND supported the Super NES and Sega Genesis consoles and received a mushrooming installed base the number of users quadrupled over the second half of but once the Super NES and Sega Genesis s popularity faded the peripheral was discontinued br The Satellaview was launched in mid for the Super Famicom in Japan The access provided downloadable versions of hit games free to the user but required the user to download the games only at certain times through a TV antenna in a fashion similar to recording a TV show br br NET Link for the Sega Saturn provided users the ability to surf the web check email and play multiplayer games online Released in the modem peripheral cost USD and came with a web browser program and a free month of access Despite the device s low price strong functionality and prominent marketing less than of Saturn owners purchased the NetLink in an outcome cited as evidence that the idea of online console gaming had not yet achieved widespread interest Phil Harrison of Sony Computer Entertainment commented on the issue of online console gaming during a round table discussion I think online gaming is a little bit of a myth A lot of consumers when asked if they would like online gaming automatically say yes because they don t actually know what it is very few people have actually had the experience It s like asking someone if they would like a Ferrari They say yes but then discover it costs a lot to run it s going to be in the shop all the time and it s going to guzzle gas And currently this is the experience most consumers get when they play online br The first home console with built in internet connection the Apple Pippin was launched in However its price tag kept it from effectively competing with other internet gaming options by comparison the Sega Saturn and its separately sold Netlink device combined cost less than br The Philips CD i and its CD Online service released in also rang up at less than the Pippin but suffered from mediocre functionality br In Nintendo decided to take another shot at online gaming with the Nintendo DD The new peripheral was delayed often and only released in Japan it provided users to connect with each other and share in game art and designs and even play games online after purchasing the peripheral for yen The DD failed to impact gamers as it was released shortly

accessory Network Adapter but was a built in feature of the later slim consoles and allowed the connection of an Ethernet cable or in some markets a phone line port for dial up connection The highly
