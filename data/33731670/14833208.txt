title: Pandora (computer)
id: 14833208
The Pandora is a handheld gaming computer originally released in It is designed to take advantage of existing free and open source software and to be a target for homebrew development It is developed and produced by OpenPandora which is made up of former distributors and community members of the GP and GP X handhelds Until multiple batches of slightly updated Pandora variants were produced In the development of a redesigned and upgraded successor called DragonBox Pyra was started br br br History br br Development of the Pandora began when Craig Rothwell Fatih Kilic Michael Mrozek and later Michael Weston teamed up and planned a portable system that would excel in the areas where they thought the GP and GP X systems from Game Park and GamePark Holdings respectively were flawed The Pandora was designed based on ideas and suggestions contributed by GP X forum members with the goal of creating the ultimate open source handheld device When announcing the system the designers of Pandora stated that it would be more powerful than any handheld video game console that had yet existed br The final case and keymat design was made by Dave Cancilier DaveC who was known on the forums for custom hardware modifications br In February the Pandora wiki had already been created as of it contains a thousand pages and is translated with the MediaWiki Translate extension br The initial development and setup costs were funded through a crowdfunding approach where early supporters provided enough money to support a production run and when the console made it into production each supporter would receive the device they paid for what actually ended up happening due to cost overruns is that the early supporters received devices as later sales recouped the initial investment costs OpenPandora began taking payments on September and began shipping to customers on May In late after production problems OpenPandora shifted its production from Texas to Germany delaying production and the device was upgraded from MB to MB RAM br As of September units had been shipped and early supporters were still waiting to receive a console as these pre orders are only fulfilled when sales to new customers are made Since June a new GHz model has been made available in limited amounts during the summer Due to the shortage of previous MHz chips this new model has become the de facto standard in br In March the pre order queue of the German OpenPandora GmbH company owned by Michael Mrozek aka EvilDragon was finally cleared The remaining pre order queue of the UK OpenPandora Ltd company owned by Craig Rothwell turned out to be significantly larger than originally reported and the UK company has requested to be struck off This means that the original pre orderers at the UK company are unlikely to ever get their unit from the UK company Also because of this buyers have lost their money Although there is no legal connection between the two companies the German OpenPandora GmbH company is trying to help those UK customers by offering them significant discounts if they decide to buy a unit from the German company instead of waiting for the UK company and by organizing community donations to get them peer funded units br As of December about units have been shipped On November it was announced that the production of the final Pandora batch has been started About Pandoras have been made and sold altogether between and with further production made impossible due to shortage of WiFi chips br In the OpenPandora project opened the hardware design files to the community making the OpenPandora a kind of open source hardware br Speculation and discussion about a successor to the Pandora has started on the OpenPandora boards Features and a demo prototype were announced at FOSDEM the project is called DragonBox Pyra br br br Overview br br The Pandora is designed to be a handheld game console with high end PDA capabilities but may also be run as a low power full featured Linux desktop The system by default comes with a Linux based OS based on ngstr m br The interface is custom themed to fit the small form factor and touchscreen analogue joystick and keyboard based inputs available Users can install and run their own desktop environment if they choose Users may even install other Linux distributions like Ubuntu or Gentoo themselves It is possible as well to run Android gingerbread through a PND package on top of the ngstr m distribution while it requires overclocking to perform flawlessly br One of Pandora s major intended uses is for homebrew gaming and for the emulation of older computer systems and video game consoles which is possible through efficient use of the resources made available by the Texas Instruments OMAP SoC The Pandora developers have already shown working emulators for Dreamcast Dreamcast emulator was never released PlayStation Nintendo Amiga SNES Atari Jaguar and Sega Mega Drive software and the Pandora is thought by its developers to have the potential to emulate most if not all machines older than the Dreamcast br For software and video games where source code is available see List of commercial video games with available source code instead of emulation source ports were created for the Pandora notable examples are Jagged Alliance and Homeworld br The device is also intended for use as a portable media playback device with a storage capacity of up to GB of data GB SDXC cards across two SD memory card slots br The Pandora uses standard libraries such as OpenGL ES and SDL which are freely available allowing anyone who wishes the ability to develop for the system Many developers from the GP x community have publicly stated that they will be developing applications for the new system br The Pandora is compatible with Debian packages built for the ARM architecture using APT A Git repository offers the latest kernel source br Lists on the community maintained Pandora Wiki keep track of new software releases Most but not all Pandora software is uploaded to either the Pandora Apps the Pandora File Archive or Pandora Repo websites The Pandora File Archive existed first and is run by Michael Mrozek Pandora Apps was launched by Craig Rothwell in May and is designed for viewing on the Pandora s smaller screen resolution br The Pandora Repo yet unnamed was developed by a member of the community with help from the community Its use has been adopted quickly as it tends to have the latest software releases first as it doesn t require developers to enter any details about the application being uploaded instead these are automatically acquired from the application itself br The Pandora Repo is also the first that uses the community created REPO specifications which allows native clients to get applications from the pandora repo without actually visiting the website much akin to Synaptic package manager br The Pandora community is also notable for the development of tools required to achieve several successful static recompilations of complex binary software to the Pandora platform For instance in an ARM architecture version of the video game StarCraft was generated by static recompilation from the original x version In a similar port of Diablo II followed br br br Technical specifications br There are several Pandora variants br br br Pandora Classic
