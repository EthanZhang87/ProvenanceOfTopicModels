Some of the Mini Classics models particularly the often reissued Mario and Donkey Kong titles have undergone several different color changes since the original releases mostly due to multiple companies working with Nintendo to make and distribute the titles Some titles have also been given new color tinted LCD displays since then The companies that help distribute them are also responsible
