id: 11762000
The seventh generation of home video game consoles began on November with the release of Microsoft s Xbox home console This was followed by the release of Sony s PlayStation on November and Nintendo s Wii on November Each new console introduced new technologies The Xbox offered games rendered natively at high definition video HD resolutions the PlayStation offered HD movie playback via a built in D Blu ray Disc player and the Wii focused on integrating controllers with movement sensors as well as joysticks Some Wii controllers could be moved about to control in game actions which enabled players to simulate real world actions through movement during gameplay By this generation video game consoles had become an important part of the global IT infrastructure it is estimated that video game consoles represented of the world s general purpose computational power in br Joining Nintendo in releasing motion devices and software Sony Computer Entertainment released the PlayStation Move in September which featured motion sensing gaming similar to that of the Wii In November Microsoft released Kinect for use with the Xbox Kinect did not use controllers instead using cameras to capture the player s body motion and using that to direct gameplay effectively making the players act as the controllers Having sold eight million units in its first days on the market Kinect claimed the Guinness World Record of being the fastest selling consumer electronics device br Among handheld consoles the seventh generation began somewhat earlier than the home consoles November saw the introduction of the Nintendo DS and the PlayStation Portable PSP came out in December The DS features a touch screen and built in microphone and supports wireless standards The PSP became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format as its primary storage media Sony also gave the PSP multimedia capability connectivity with the PlayStation PlayStation other PSPs as well as Internet connectivity Despite high sales numbers for both consoles PSP sales consistently lagged behind those of the DS br A crowdfunded console the Ouya received million in preorders before launching in Post launch sales were poor and the device was a commercial failure Additionally microconsoles like Nvidia Shield Console Amazon Fire TV MOJO Razer Switchblade GamePop GameStick and more powerful PC based Steam Machine consoles have attempted to compete in the video game console market however they are seldom classified as seventh generation consoles br The seventh generation slowly began to wind down when Nintendo began cutting back on Wii production in the early s In Sony announced they were discontinuing the production of the PSP worldwide and the release of new games for the DS eventually ceased later that year with the last third party titles Microsoft announced in that same year that they would discontinue the Xbox The following year Sony announced that it would soon discontinue the PlayStation Around that time the remaining Wii consoles were discontinued ending the generation as all hardware was discontinued The final Xbox physical games were released in as FIFA and Just Dance Despite this several more Wii games were released including a few more annual Just Dance sequels as well as a limited copy print run of a physical release of Retro City Rampage DX The eighth generation had already begun in early with the release of the Nintendo DS br br br Home video game consoles br br br Xbox br br The Xbox gained an early lead in terms of market share largely due to its established Xbox Live online gaming system and its early launch date which was one year before its rivals Sales in North America and Europe continued to be strong even after the release of the Wii and PlayStation Like its predecessor the Xbox received a muted reception in Japan attributed to the lack of content aimed at Japanese gamers which was a key reason why its predecessor underperformed in that country Despite its early launch date the Xbox finished in rd place behind its competitors br This early launch did come with some trouble as technical problems appeared in a portion of Xbox units sold The most well known problem is the red ring of death and Error E which received a great deal of attention due to some users having to replace their consoles multiple times Microsoft attempted to address this by offering a three year warranty on all affected consoles and repairing them free of charge It also retroactively reimbursed owners of affected systems who paid for repairs and ultimately made several adjustments to the console s design to improve reliability consulting with an established ASIC vendor br As they share many cross platform games and competed for the same audience as their predecessors frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox and PlayStation The PS uses the Blu ray format while the Xbox uses a standard DVD The Xbox was less expensive to produce and broke even on manufacturing costs earlier than the PS while industry consensus was that the Xbox s conventional architecture is easier to develop for br At the end of the first half of the console stabilized at million units shipped as sales dropped while its rival Wii gained momentum and Sony announced a competitive price drop on the PlayStation Microsoft s strategy to boost sales with the release of the highly anticipated Halo in September paid off outselling the Wii that month in North America Microsoft s Entertainment and Devices Division experienced a huge increase in revenue largely driven by the release of Halo and posted a quarterly profit for the first time in two years br The Xbox focused on the release of high profile games such as additions to the Halo franchise The Game Critics Awards honored the platform with nominations and wins more than any other platform At the Game Developers Conference Microsoft announced that it expected over games available for Xbox by the end of the year The Xbox has managed to gain a simultaneous release of titles that were initially planned to be PS exclusives including Devil May Cry Ace Combat Virtua Fighter Grand Theft Auto IV Final Fantasy XIII Tekken Metal Gear Rising Revengeance and L A Noire br In November Microsoft released Kinect Kinect did not use controllers instead making the players act as the controllers Having sold eight million units in its first days on the market Kinect claimed the Guinness World Record of being the fastest selling consumer electronics device At E Microsoft revealed a new Xbox SKU known officially as the Xbox S and referred to as the Slim by various media outlets At E Microsoft revealed the Xbox E the final iteration of the Xbox series to be succeeded by Xbox One The E featured a new square design with a simplified exterior akin to the Xbox One br br br PlayStation br br Sony s PlayStation was released on November in Japan and November in the US and Canada The system s reliance on new technologies such as the Cell microprocessor and Blu ray format caused difficulties in manufacturing especially the Blu ray diode leading to shortages at launch and the delay of the PAL region launches however by early December Sony announced that all production issues had been resolved Market analysts and Sony executives noted that the success of the PlayStation and the Blu ray format were dependent on each other Rich Marty VP of New Business Development at Sony Pictures Home Entertainment stated that the PS is critical to the success of Blu ray while Phil Harrison stated that the PlayStation s success would be ensured by the growth of the Blu ray Disc movie market br Sony would provide support for its console with new titles from first party franchises such as Gran Turismo Team Ico and God of War and secured a number of highly anticipated third party exclusive titles including Metal Gear Solid Guns of the Patriots Yakuza and Valkyria Chronicles Titles that were originally exclusive or recognized with the platform such as Devil May Cry Ace Combat Virtua Fighter and Monster Hunter have been released on other platforms The previous Grand Theft Auto titles were originally timed exclusives on the PlayStation before making their release on other platforms such as the Xbox months later however Grand Theft Auto IV the latest installment was released simultaneously on the Xbox and PlayStation Titles initially announced as PlayStation exclusives such as Assassin s Creed Bladestorm The Hundred Years War and Fatal Inertia were ultimately released on Xbox as well with the latter making its appearance on Xbox before the PlayStation version Sony blamed lower than expected sales of the PS on the loss of exclusive titles in its software library its higher price and stock shortages br The high launch price of the PlayStation was considered a major drag on its popularity In July Sony announced a drop in the price of the already discontinued GB models of the console by in the United States and Canada On October Sony announced a US price drop for the GB model and a new US GB model to launch on November with reduced features such as the removal of backward compatibility with PS games Within weeks Sony announced that sales of the GB and GB models by major retailers had increased In November Sony launched a GB model and on August Sony announced the PS Slim The PS slim sold million in under a month It was then announced that a GB slim model was to be released It was released on September or depending on country br In September Sony announced a new slimmer PS redesign CECH commonly referred to as the Super Slim PS It was released in late available with either a GB or GB hard drive The Super Slim model was the last model to be produced by Sony before the system was slowly discontinued around the world Shipments of new units to the United States were terminated in October and Sony officially discontinued the system in Japan on May the last territory where it was selling new units up until then br br br Wii br br Nintendo entered the generation with a new approach embodied by its Wii The company planned to attract current hardcore and casual gamers non gamers and lapsed gamers by focusing on new gameplay experiences and new forms of interaction with games rather than cutting edge graphics and expensive technology This approach was previously implemented in the portable market with the Nintendo DS Nintendo expressed hope that the new control schemes it had implemented would render conventionally controlled consoles obsolete leading to Nintendo capturing a large portion of the existing market as well This strategy paid off with demand for the Wii outstripping supply throughout Since Nintendo profited on each console right from the start unlike its competitors it achieved very positive returns With only a few exceptions monthly worldwide sales for the Wii were higher than those of the Xbox and PlayStation eroding Microsoft s early lead and widening the gap between its market share and Sony s In it was reported by the British newspaper Financial Times that the Wii s sales surpassed those of the Xbox which had been released one year previously and became the market leader in worldwide home console sales for the generation br As in previous generations Nintendo provided support for its new console with first party franchises like Mario The Legend of Zelda Metroid and Pok mon To appeal to casual and non gamers Nintendo developed a group of core Wii games consisting of Wii Sports Wii Play Wii Fit and Wii Music where players make use of the motion sensing abilities of the console and its peripherals to simulate real world activities br Publishers such as Ubisoft Electronic Arts Capcom and Majesco Entertainment continued to release exclusive titles for the console but the Wii s strongest titles remained within its first party line up Analysts speculated that this would change in time as the Wii s growing popularity persuaded third party publishers to focus on it however some third party developers expressed frustration at low software sales Goichi Suda developer of No More Heroes for the Wii noted that only Nintendo titles are doing well and that he expected more games for hardcore gamers Conversely the PAL publisher of No More Heroes Rising Star Games were greatly impressed with the game s sales Goichi Suda later retracted his comment saying his point was that No More Heroes unlike a lot of Nintendo Wii titles currently available is the kind of product that will attract a different kind of consumer to the hardware br In early the NPD Group revealed sales data showing that while the Wii s life to date attach rate was low in December it reached higher than the attach rates for the Xbox and PlayStation in that month The Wii s low overall attach rate could be explained by reference to its rapidly increasing installed base as financial analysts have pointed to the Xbox s high attach rates as indicative of an unhealthy lack of installed base growth and warned that what actually benefits third party developers is quicker adoption of hardware and a rapidly growing installed base on which to sell progressively more game units which tends to lower the attach rate of a product br br br Comparison br br a Game packages not listed Bundles special editions and limited editions may include additional or exchanged items br b There is a variety of other input devices available for all three consoles including rhythm game controllers microphones and third part gamepads controllers br c All consoles are capable of producing D images using anaglyph or frame compatible systems side by side SbS top and bottom TaB as these do not require any special output hardware As such these display modes are dependent on the software being displayed rather than the console br d Facebook and Twitter apps for Xbox were retired in October br br br Sales standings br br Worldwide figures are based on data from the manufacturers The Canada and the United States figures are based on data from the NPD Group the Japan figures are based on data from Famitsu Enterbrain and the United Kingdom figures are based on data from GfK Chart Track br br br Discontinuations and revisions br The PlayStation GB was discontinued in North America in April and effectively discontinued in Japan in early br The PlayStation GB was discontinued in NTSC territories by September and replaced with the GB version br The PlayStation GB was effectively discontinued for PAL territories in late When the remaining stock in stores was sold the GB version served as its replacement br Sony announced before the PS launch in Europe that the PlayStation s Emotion Engine CPU would be removed from it for cost savings and all backward compatibility would be software based This is also the same for the GB model launched in the North American market in br An HDMI out port was added to the Premium Xbox in May br The Xbox Core system was discontinued and replaced by the Arcade version in October br The price of the Xbox Premium version was dropped to US in North America on July Supplies of the existing GB model were exhausted by early August and it was replaced by an identical model with a GB HDD at a MSRP of US br The PlayStation GB was discontinued in all territories in early August and the new GB version served as its replacement br The Xbox Arcade MB internal memory SKU was discontinued in all territories in early and a new MB internal memory SKU still named the Xbox Arcade was released br The PlayStation Slim was introduced on August At US it is US cheaper than the previous model it is also approximately lighter and more energy efficient The two original PS Slim models priced at US and US respectively hold GB These were then superseded by GB and GB models which are priced at US and US respectively br The black Wii console was released in Japan on August and in Europe in November br The Wii package for North America has been updated to include a copy of Wii Sports Resort as well as the required Wii MotionPlus accessory to play it beginning May The console is also available in black br A special edition red Wii console was released in honor of Super Mario Bros th Anniversary br The Xbox S was announced at E by Microsoft It is a smaller revision of the Xbox hardware which includes either a built in GB hard drive or GB of Flash storage n Wi Fi a TOSLINK connector USB ports and an AUX connector for the Kinect sensor device br The Wii Family Edition was released on October It drops support for GameCube games and accessories and is designed to sit horizontally br The PlayStation Super Slim was released on September It has manual sliding disc cover instead of a motorized loading slot disc cover br The Wii Mini was released on December It has a top loading disc drive instead of a motorized loading slot disc drive and drops Wi Fi support online connectivity and the SD card slot br The Xbox E was revealed and released at E on June It featured a new slimmer design that was quieter than previous models br br br Backward compatibility br Early models of the Wii are fully backward compatible with GameCube software and most of its accessories the Wii Family Edition and the Wii Mini iterations lack GameCube support Early models of the PlayStation and all models of the Xbox only offer partial support and use software emulation for backward compatibility Later models of the PS do not offer PlayStation compatibility though PS compatibility is retained Some models of the first generation of the PS offered full backward compatibility for PS games The Xbox s compatibility is increased through game specific patches automatically downloaded from Xbox Live or downloaded and burned to a CD or DVD from the Xbox website and the PS s compatibility is expanded with firmware updates br All three consoles provide titles from older consoles for download the Xbox through the Xbox Originals service the PlayStation through the PlayStation Store and the Wii through the Virtual Console When purchased the game is saved to console s internal memory or optionally on the Wii to an inserted SD SDHC card Initially the Xbox also provided Xbox Live support for backward compatible games but the service has since been discontinued for original Xbox games No more games will be added to the list of backward compatible games for the Xbox In response to the lack of backward compatibility for most PS s many popular games have been released for download as PlayStation Classics and other popular series have been updated with gameplay graphics as high definition remasters for PlayStation consoles and have been released on Blu ray Disc or are available for download on the PlayStation Network br br br HDTV capable video support and service br Both the PlayStation and the Xbox support p high definition video output However the output signal may be protected by digital rights management and may require an HDCP compliant display if HDMI is used The Xbox Live Marketplace service and the PlayStation Store offer HD movies TV shows movie trailers and clips for download to the console s HDD Other regional PlayStation Stores only allow download of movie trailers and short segment clips As of November the Video Download service present on the American PlayStation Store will be available for select European countries br While only a small number of games render video in native p many games can be automatically scaled to output this resolution The Wii is capable of outputting p for the Wii Menu and most games through a component cable which must be purchased separately br br br Reliability br In the September issue of Game Informer magazine survey results were published in which among nearly readers who responded of those who owned an Xbox had experienced a console failure for that system compared with for PlayStation and for Wii br In August warranty provider SquareTrade published console failure rate estimates in which the proportion of its customers reporting a system failure in the first two years is for Xbox for PlayStation and for Wii br br br Other consoles br There were also other consoles released during the seventh generation time period Generally they are either niche products or less powerful br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Handheld systems br br For video game handhelds the seventh generation began with the release of the Nintendo DS on November This handheld was based on a design fundamentally different from the Game Boy and other handheld video game systems The Nintendo DS offered new modes of input over previous generations such as a touch screen the ability to connect wirelessly using IEEE b as well as a microphone to speak to in game NPCs On December Sony released its first handheld PlayStation Portable The PlayStation Portable was marketed at launch to an above year old or core gamer market while the Nintendo DS proved to be popular with both core gamers and new customers br Nokia revived its N Gage platform in the form of a service for selected S devices This new service launched on April Other less popular handheld systems released during this generation include the Gizmondo launched on March and discontinued in February and the GP X launched on November and discontinued in August The GP X Wiz Pandora and Gizmondo were scheduled for release in br Another aspect of the seventh generation was the beginning of direct competition between dedicated handheld gaming devices and increasingly powerful PDA cell phone devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch and the latter being aggressively marketed for gaming purposes Simple games such as Tetris and Solitaire had existed for PDA devices since their introduction but by PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented with the advantage of distribution over wireless broadband br Sony announced in that they had discontinued the
