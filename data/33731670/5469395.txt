The Nintendo controller model number NUS is the standard game controller for the Nintendo home video game console It was first manufactured and released by Nintendo on June in Japan in September in North America and March in Europe It is the successor to the Super Nintendo controller and is designed in an M shape and features buttons a Control Stick and a D pad br br br Design br br The controller was designed by Nintendo R D under direction to try new ideas that would break from typical game controllers With original visual designs having been mocked up in clay form and extensive test group studies being performed before and during the design phase the Nintendo s controller design was eventually solidified in tandem with that of Shigeru Miyamoto s gameplay mechanics in Super Mario Though Miyamoto tested the controller while developing Super Mario the controller was not designed around the game while it did influence its mechanics like movement br br Nintendo of America s head designer Lance Barr said that the design studies revealed that most games use a few buttons for most of the main controls such as jumping and shooting or accelerating and braking That s why the A and B Buttons are placed for easiest access on the new controller and why they are larger than the other buttons They re the buttons that get high traffic br The controller was designed to be held in three different positions First it can be held by the two outer grips allowing use of the D pad right hand face buttons and the L and R shoulder buttons but not the Z trigger or analog stick This style was intended to optimize play in D games by emulating the setup on the Super NES controller It can be also held by the center and right hand grip allowing the use of the single control stick the right hand buttons the R shoulder button and the Z trigger on the rear but not the L shoulder button or D pad This style was intended for D games Finally the controller can be held by the center and left hand grip allowing for a combination of the D pad L shoulder analog stick and Z trigger as was implemented in GoldenEye Additionally though the controller was not designed with this setup in mind one controller can be held in each hand with a thumb on each analog stick and index fingers on the Z trigger This setup allows dual analog control on some first person shooters such as Perfect Dark In some games such as Mortal Kombat Trilogy the control stick and directional pad are interchangeable Very few games use the directional pad exclusively such as Tetrisphere and Kirby The Crystal Shards br This design is controversial as by its nature it generally prevents the use of all of its features with the player s hands in any one position the D pad L shoulder analog stick and Z trigger cannot generally all be used at the same time as it typically requires the player to switch hand positions taking the hands off of the key directional controls Some though realized they can hold the controller with the outer grips and use their index fingers for the R and L triggers middle fingers for the Z trigger right thumb for the right hand buttons and left thumb for the D pad and stretching analog stick without changing hand positions When Sony released its Dual Analog and DualShock controllers for the competing PlayStation it retained the original controllers two handled ergonomics placing the analog sticks below and inside the primary D pad and face buttons allowing the player to quickly switch from the D pad and face buttons to the analog sticks without letting go of the controller Several third party manufacturers would produce aftermarket Nintendo controllers with similar layouts to the Dual Analog DualShock such as the MakoPad and Hori Mini Nintendo would largely follow suit with the stock controller for its GameCube console but swapped the positions of the analog stick and D pad Such a layout would become dominant in gamepad design as by that time the left analog stick had become universally accepted as the primary movement control on D games across all consoles br The controller has four C buttons on the top which were originally intended to control the camera in three dimensional game environments However since the pad only contains three other face buttons the C buttons often became assigned to ulterior functions An example of this is The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time where three of the C buttons can be assigned to secondary items and the upper C button is used to call Navi for assistance while the Z trigger is used to lock focus onto enemies and center the camera behind the player br br One game Robotron allows one player to use two controllers to control an avatar This way the game plays like its predecessor Robotron Star Wars Episode I Racer GoldenEye and Perfect Dark also use this set up for slightly different gameplay experiences in terms of control at least compared to the standard single controller option br The controller initially came in six colors grey black red green yellow and blue but other colors were released later many of them coinciding with the release of a similarly colored or designed system Some of these others include smoke black watermelon red jungle green fire orange ice blue grape purple and special edition colors like gold atomic purple extreme green Donkey Kong banana bunch yellow Pok mon blue and yellow and Millennium platinum Players would often take apart Nintendo controllers to mix and match the tops and bottoms of the shell creating bi color controllers br When the Nintendo is switched on the joystick on each controller is automatically calibrated by recording the current position as the center position That works assuming the hands are off the joystick when the Nintendo is powered on The joystick can also be recalibrated while the Nintendo is on by pressing L R START to indicate that the current position of the joystick is the center position br br br Analog stick br br The Nintendo controller was one of the first game controllers to incorporate analog stick technology as a main feature intended to provide the user with a wider range of functions such as mobility and camera control The stick is designed to detect independent directions compared to the independent directions detected by a D pad allowing the potential for Nintendo games to more accurately emulate of motion br Analog joysticks prior to the Nintendo include those used by the Atari Sega s arcade systems Sega s analog Mission Stick for the Saturn and Sony s PlayStation Analog Joystick The Nintendo controller distinguished itself from these precursors by using an analog thumbstick which was predated only by the Mega Drive s XE AP designed by third party manufacturer Dempa in The Nintendo controller was released contemporaneously with Sega s D Pad for their Saturn system and was followed during the fifth generation of video game consoles by Sony s Dual Analog and DualShock controllers for the PlayStation console br The analog stick uses a pair of optical encoding disks to determine its position similar to how ball mice work Since optical encoding disks only give the system relative changes in the position of the analog stick the system assumes that the stick is centered during power on and tracks relative movements from there If things get out of sync or if the control stick was not centered during power on the center position can be reset by pressing the left and right shoulder buttons L and R at the same time as the Start button or resetting the console with the correct neutral position While the optical encoding disks are mostly digital and provide very accurate relative movements third party controllers and joysticks often use cheaper potentiometers instead These allow the controller to track the absolute position of the joystick but since the signal is analog it is very noisy and can fluctuate even if the joystick is not moved br br br Controller Pak br br The Controller Pak is Nintendo s external memory card similar to those used on the PlayStation and other CD ROM consoles Though the Nintendo s cartridges can store battery backed memory much like its predecessors in supported games the Controller Pak allows save game data to be stored separately from the cartridge for instance allowing save data to be used with a different copy of the game or to store data that will not fit on a cartridge s battery backed memory such as Mario Kart s ghost data Whereas other console developers opted to plug the memory card directly into a console Nintendo opted to have the card be plugged into the controller and thus transported as one unit envisioning scenarios in which players would want to bring their own controller and memory card to play with other Nintendo owners In such scenarios having the cartridge port on the controller would allow individual players to each use their own distinct game settings and controller configurations while playing simultaneously on the same system br br br Rumble Pak br br The original Rumble Pak designed for the Nintendo controller was released in April to coincide with the release of Star Fox and requires two AAA batteries It provides haptic feedback during gameplay intending to make the gaming experience more engaging It was designed to be inserted into the controller s memory cartridge slot which prevents the use of the Controller Pak The insertion of a Controller Pak is prompted at every point of save in case one was not already in place br br br LodgeNet variant br br In LodgeNet and Nintendo released a controller and game playing service for various hotels in the United States It is a slightly modified Nintendo controller featuring an improved GameCube style analog control stick and LodgeNet TV control buttons It attaches to the hotel television and is not compatible with a standard Nintendo console It functions as a secondary remote control for the television with up and down on the D pad able to change channels and as a controller for available Nintendo games on the LodgeNet service Customers could choose from a large library of Nintendo games including most first party Nintendo games and play at a rate of for every minutes br br br Reception br Nintendo s own magazine Nintendo Power reviewed the controller The magazine said that it is a little wider than the Super NES controller but it felt very comfortable and the control elements were exceptionally well placed Large and small hands alike found it easy to manipulate In their overview of the controller Electronic Gaming Monthly commented All in all Nintendo has made the most advanced and easy to use controller we have ever seen It is extremely versatile and has enough buttons to take care of every possible contingency now or in the future GamePro s overview stated The N s tri handled controller may look weird but it feels great Third party developers were reportedly enthusiastic about the controller as well Dave Perry called it the big special move that Nintendo have gone for while Jez San said that The joystick is unusual looking but I like the controls The thumb control feels nice and strong and also sensitive br Stocks of extra Nintendo controllers were sold out on the Japanese launch of the Nintendo despite the fact that all three launch games are single player only Similar results followed in North America retailers reported extremely high sales of the controllers despite only a handful of multiplayer games being available br Although its design and usability received praise by most reviewers the controller did have some mechanical issues that could be detrimental to users Overuse of the analog stick could cause it to become loose hampering controllability and intense rotating of the analog stick reportedly resulted in friction injuries to the hands of some players of s Mario Party As a result of a settlement with the New York Attorney General Nintendo offered protective gloves to prevent injuries In Q Nintendo reported that out of more than million copies sold in the year since the game s release the company had received about complaints none serious Tim Weaver editor of the UK s N Magazine said his staff experienced no problems with the controller adding that the entire investigation was ludicrous and could only happen in America although blister injuries were common especially in Mario Party mini games such as Pedal Power and Tug o War Some aftermarket controllers have since sought to remedy both issues including rubberised analog sticks with steel construction underneath often employed by speedrunners and or retrogaming enthusiasts br br br Nintendo Switch version br Nintendo released a version of the Nintendo controller compatible with its Nintendo Switch console in October The controller was released in conjunction with an additional tier of the company s Nintendo Switch Online service called the Expansion Pack which gives customers access to a catalog of Nintendo games The new version makes a series of changes to the design including the addition of wireless functionality and the incorporation of a rumble feature without the need for an additional accessory like the Rumble Pak br The Switch version also adds additional buttons to allow players access to the home and capture buttons that correspond with Switch functionality that was not available on Nintendo br br br See also br List of Nintendo controllers br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Media
