title: Nintendo 64 Game Pak
id: 40051481
Nintendo Game Pak part number NUS is the brand name of the ROM cartridges that store game data for the Nintendo As with Nintendo s previous consoles the Game Pak s design strategy was intended to achieve maximal read speed and lower console manufacturing costs through not integrating a mechanical drive with a drawback of lower per dollar storage capacity compared to a disk From the console s first year from late through Game Pak sizes were to megabytes with a typical third party retail price of US equivalent to about in then available in megabytes in and finally megabytes from onwards br As with the Famicom Disk System floppy drive of the s Nintendo sought a higher capacity and cheaper medium to complement the Game Pak resulting in the DD a Japan only floppy drive peripheral which launched late in and was a commercial failure br Some developers such as Factor Rare and Nintendo were supportive of the solid state medium due to fast read speeds and bank switching Some other developers had vastly heavier designs such as the use of full motion video but sufficient data compression techniques had not yet been invented and ROM chips were not yet cost efficient leading many developers like Square to target CD ROM based platforms instead br The Nintendo was the last major home console to have cartridge as its primary storage format Despite common misconceptions the Nintendo Switch uses game cards which are more similar to SD cards and so differ from cartridges Portable systems such as the PlayStation Vita Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS also use game cards br br br History br br br Development br Nintendo had already invested into high capacity secondary storage devices with the Famicom Disk System and the cancelled SNES CD for their previous two home consoles In a interview Nintendo of America NOA summarised its analysis of the advantages of cartridges and CDs with respect to its next console eventually the Nintendo br br Right now cartridges offer faster access time and more speed of movement and characters than CDs So we ll introduce our new hardware with cartridges But eventually these problems with CDs will be overcome When that happens you ll see Nintendo using CD as the software storage medium for our bit system br That sentiment was soon revised in the same year when NOA s Vice President of Sales Marketing Peter Main stated that The choice we made is not cartridge versus CD it s silicon over optical When it comes to speed no other format approaches the silicon based cartridge br At Shoshinkai Nintendo announced the complementary DD a rewritable magnetic disk drive for the then upcoming Nintendo with several times faster transfer rates and seek time than competing CD ROM consoles In Nintendo game designer Shigesato Itoi explained CD holds a lot of data DD holds a moderate amount of data and backs the data up and cartridge ROMs hold the least data and processes the fastest By attaching a DD to the game console we can drastically increase the number of possible genres I think we ll make the game on a cartridge first then finish it up as a full out DD game Many DD games entered development however after the device s launch was delayed several years until and restricted to Japan many of these games switched to the Game Pak or were outright cancelled The DD was a commercial failure and was discontinued only months after launch br In prior to the Nintendo s launch President of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi praised the user experience of the cartridge format br br Many of you feel that CD ROM is the call of the day but look at the latest buzzword in the computer world plug and play which is nothing but Nintendo culture Customers think having no loading time is a great advantage More importantly by using cartridge other chips can later be incorporated into the cartridge which allows Nintendo to offer new game opportunities to game developers br Until the launch of the Switch in the Nintendo was the latest major home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format and most handheld systems except the PlayStation Portable use cartridges Most home systems since the fifth generation use disc flash and online formats The succeeding GameCube uses an optical disc format in a boon to some developers The company stated its goal was to reduce manufacturing costs and did not cite storage space as a rationale Because the new console lacks backwards compatibility with Nintendo Game Paks Nintendo said players could simply keep their Nintendo br br br Features br br br Save files br Some Game Paks include internal EEPROM flash memory or battery backed up RAM for saved game storage Otherwise game saves may be stored on a separate memory card marketed by Nintendo as a Controller Pak br br br Copy protection br Each Nintendo Game Pak contains a lockout chip conceptually similar to the NES to prevent production of unlicensed games and piracy Unlike previous Nintendo systems the Nintendo lockout chip contains a seed value which is used to calculate a checksum of the game s boot code To prevent playing of illegitimate games by piggybacking on a real Game Pak as was a common workaround for the NES Nintendo produced five different versions of the lockout chip During the boot process and occasionally while the game is running the console computes the checksum of the boot code and verifies it with the lockout chip in the Game Pak failing to boot if the check fails br On June a U S District Court issued a temporary restraining order against Games City for its Game Doctor and Doctor V products which allow users to copy from a Game Pak to a CD or hard disk drive Games City was ordered to stop importing distributing advertising or selling any such devices br br br Modem br The cartridge for the officially licensed Japanese game Morita Shogi featured a modem and a custom shell to accommodate an RJ port and activity LED br br br Analysis br The Nintendo Game Pak medium provides essential benefits alongside drawbacks Though it provides the faster load times and greater durability than the CD ROM format its solid state silicon could not be produced as quickly and was more expensive to manufacture leading to low storage capacity br For example a Top Gun video game was announced in as a launch title for the Nintendo and then cancelled five months prior to the system s launch partially due to the additional lead time of ordering the more expensive proprietary cartridge format plus Nintendo s licensing fees The game s developer Spectrum Holobyte said The question is does Nintendo really think it needs licensees It seems to want the lion s share of the software sales possibly as much as two thirds br In journalist Alex S Kasten observed that the issue goes beyond the economics of the media because market strategy and style of game play also factor into the cartridge CD decision so Nintendo has remained cartridge based for two main reasons economics and performance br br br Console cost br Nintendo knew that a CD ROM drive would greatly increase the cost of the console in a price sensitive market Nintendo software engineering manager Jim Merrick said We re very sensitive to the cost of the console We could get an eight speed CD ROM mechanism in the unit but in the under console market it would be hard to pull that off br br br Performance br br Specified at to MiB s Nintendo emphasised the Game Pak fast load times in comparison to the competing Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation s CD ROM drives running at about kB s with high latency This speed discrepancy can be observed through the loading screens that appear in many multiplatform games such screens were often nonexistent on the Nintendo version Bank switching was a common practice for developers in many games such as Nintendo EAD s Super Mario or Factor s Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine which allowed for efficient memory usage Howard Lincoln said Genyo Takeda the Nintendo engineer working with Silicon Graphics to design Project Reality and those guys felt very strongly that it was absolutely essential to have it on a cartridge in order to do the kind of things that we wanted to do with Super Mario br Sega countered by claiming that load times on CD ROMs could eventually be minimised Ted Hoff vice president of sales and marketing at Sega said We are finding more and more ways to mask the load factor We are working out ways to overlay or leapfrog the loading time br br br Durability br Game Paks are far more durable than compact discs the latter of which must be carefully used and stored in protective cases It also prevents accidental scratches and subsequent read errors While Game Paks are more resistant than CDs to physical damage they are sometimes less resistant to long term environmental damage particularly oxidation although this can be simply cleaned off wear of their electrical contacts or static electricity br br br Manufacturing cost br Due to the complex manufacturing processes cartridge based games are more expensive and difficult to manufacture than their disk based counterparts PlayStation CD ROMs reportedly cost US equivalent to about in to manufacture while cartridges for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System cost and Nintendo cartridges reportedly more than br Publishers had to pass these higher expenses to the consumer so Nintendo games tended toward higher prices than PlayStation games Rarely would a PlayStation game exceed equivalent to about in whereas some Nintendo cartridges were like the first print of The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Games in Sony s Greatest Hits budget line retailed for whereas Nintendo s equivalent Player s Choice line retailed for In August Kelly Flock president of Sony Interactive Studios America SISA said Most N carts are costing consumers to compared with to for a PlayStation CD In the United States the typical price of a third party game was around in the system s first year on the market in though this dropped incrementally after Nintendo reduced wholesale prices on the cartridges NOA Vice President George Harrison was enthused about the increasing third party cartridge orders placed after that price drop In the United Kingdom Nintendo games were priced equivalent to in at release with PlayStation games priced at equivalent to in br br br Manufacturing time br Game Paks took longer to manufacture than CDs with each production run taking at least two weeks from order to delivery By contrast extra copies of a CD based game could be ordered with a lead time of a few days This meant that publishers of Nintendo games had less flexibility to forecast demand and risked being left with a surplus of expensive Game Paks for a failed game or a weeks long shortage of product they underestimated br Sony used this shortcoming to appeal to publishers Andrew House Vice President of Marketing at Sony Computer Entertainment America said They can manufacture the appropriate amount of software without taking a tremendous inventory risk associated with the cartridge business Sony s Kelly Flock added And the CD allows smaller manufacturing runs with very short lead times The CD allows the publisher to take creative content risks not inventory risk br br br Storage space br Throughout the fifth generation of video game consoles even during development of Nintendo Nintendo repeatedly revised its estimates of maximum cartridge size in late the maximum deliverable cartridge size reportedly had been recently thought to be megabits megabytes and was then revised to megabits megabytes with a future theoretical maximum of megabits megabytes By the largest Game Paks ever officially made were megabits megabytes whereas CDs can hold more than megabytes Storage sizes range from MB Mbit such as Automobili Lamborghini and Dr Mario to MB Mbit such as The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time to MB Mbit such as Resident Evil and Conker s Bad Fur Day Games ported from other platforms may utilise more aggressive data compression as with Resident Evil or altered content as with Spider Man and Mortal Kombat Mythologies Sub Zero so that they may fit on a Game Pak Exceptionally large games on CD based systems could span multiple discs totalling in the gigabytes which would have been prohibitively expensive to distribute across multiple Game Paks Furthermore the DD expansion with MB floppy disks was released late and discontinued quickly br Due to the Game Pak s space limitations full motion video is not usually feasible for use in cutscenes A notable exception is Resident Evil which contains the equivalent material of the two CD ROM discs of the original PlayStation version albeit compressed plus some expanded content higher quality instruments and surround sound support and what Eurogamer called one of the most ambitious and impressive console ports of all time Some games contain cinematic scenes with graphics generated by the system in real time like The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Nintendo downplayed the importance of prerendered videos with software engineering manager Jim Merrick saying Full motion video demos fit really well on a CD ROM but once you get into the software as a gamer you re thinking let s get on with the game br Nintendo also countered that developers did not generally use the full MiB capacity of CD ROMs stating that the smaller storage space encouraged developers to place a premium on substance over flash br br br Copy protection br CD ROMs are known for relative ease of copying on personal computers whereas Game Paks use Nintendo s proprietary format and are more difficult to bootleg br br I ve seen speculation about how the choice of cartridges was some plot to control third party publishers That s completely nonsense There is just not a grain of truth in that thing No discussion like that ever occurred that was never an issue It was strictly technology and counterfeiting br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br John Ricciardi writing for Electronic Gaming Monthly called Nintendo s decision to stick with a cartridge format for the Nintendo stubborn and a major contributor to the company s competitive disadvantages Brian Dipert writing for EDN Magazine said that the Nintendo Game Paks are bulky and expensive eating into Nintendo s profit margins compared with competitors inexpensive CD and DVD plastic discs On a more positive side Aaron Curtiss of The Los Angeles Times praised Nintendo s choice of the cartridge medium with its nonexistent load times and continuous fast paced action CD ROMs simply cannot deliver concluding that the cartridge based Nintendo delivers blistering speed and tack sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing bit disc based consoles from Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation seem downright sluggish Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge based development Curtiss cited Nintendo s position that cartridge game developers tend to place a premium on substance over flash and noted that the launch games lack the poorly acted live action sequences or half baked musical overtures he found on CD ROM games at the time br br br Industry reception br As part of the controversial technological tradeoffs between storage and performance which has been endemic to the entire computing industry and which Nintendo had faced since the Famicom s cassette and floppy disk systems the selection of a cartridge format for the Nintendo was essential to several developers projects However the choice of a cartridge format coupled with the commercial failure of the DD were also key factors in Nintendo losing both their marketshare and favour with developers br The Nintendo s primary competitors the Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn use CD ROMs for game storage As a result of lower manufacturing costs quicker pressing and greater storage some publishers who had traditionally supported Nintendo s consoles prior to the Nintendo were now producing games primarily or solely for Nintendo s competitors This includes Square Capcom and also Enix who had initially pre planned Dragon Warrior VII for the Nintendo and its yet unreleased DD disk drive peripheral at least by but migrated to the PlayStation due to the developers increasingly ambitious use of storage space with their fundamentally cinematic game format Shiny Entertainment had been planning to develop MDK for the Nintendo but switched to PC when they found the cartridge space was insufficient for their plans and Nintendo failed to produce the promised DD in a timely manner In November Nintendo of America VP George Harrison acknowledged that Square was a significant loss noting the popularity of role playing games especially in Japan br br Some developers who remained on Nintendo released fewer games for the system Konami was a major example of this releasing Nintendo games but more than on the PlayStation Overall new game releases were less frequent for the Nintendo than those for the PlayStation br When interviewed by Computer Video Games at Shoshinkai about how the using CDs could have impacted their game development Rare said that Blastdozer would require more time and much more RAM and that Goldeneye would require twice the RAM In the Director s Commentary video about Conker s Bad Fur Day after observing the imperceptible loading times and the seamless transitions between major scenes of the game Rare programmers said that the thing about cartridges is it s solid state so it s actually a much more advanced better medium than discs You can t have as much content on there or rather you can but it s very expensive but as a medium cartridge is vastly ahead in superiority to any Blu ray or disc or hard drives br In November Star Fox designer Jez San lamented that Very few third party developers are actually working with N for several major business reasons plus the extra time of optimizing a game for constrained cartridge space At that time Nintendo of America VP George Harrison acknowledged the historical problem of price br After having developed CD ROM media in two different LucasArts releases for PlayStation Factor s co founder Julian Eggebrecht said in a February publication br br We immediately liked the N because we didn t have to deal with CDs You shouldn t underestimate what a battle it can be to make a CD game on the PlayStation You have to fill it you have to burn it which takes an hour every time you want to see a new version of your game you have to work around loading errors and so on CDs can be a real pain br Eggebrecht identified RAM not storage as the key bottleneck for any console he identified CD ROM read speeds as exacerbating that bottleneck and favoured cartridges to mitigate it Speaking on his programmers optimisations for Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine Eggebrecht stated br br The big strength was the N cartridge We use the cartridge almost like normal RAM and are streaming all level data textures animations music sound and even program code while the game is running With the final size of the levels and the amount of textures the megabytes of RAM of the N never would have been even remotely enough to fit any individual level So the cartridge technology really saved the day br br br See also br br Nintendo technical specifications br br br
