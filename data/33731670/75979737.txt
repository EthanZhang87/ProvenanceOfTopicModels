as well as a gift varying on the rhythm game br br br History and development br The first game Rhythm Tengoku began development sometime in under the working title of Rhythm IQ when Kazuyoshi Osawa the game programmer had created a tech demo for the Game Boy Advance where players could play a drum kit with each button on the console being designated to a different drum Osawa had previously been involved in the development of the WarioWare series of games In Tsunku brought his proposal to Nintendo of a rhythm game that did not rely on visual indicators for its rhythm Osawa was wary that people would enjoy it due to its lack of a music score as he felt that it might only appeal to a niche audience It was decided to be released on the GBA due to Osawa s desire for a smaller screen and portability After the game s release in Japan in SEGA approached the development team to co develop a Rhythm Tengoku game for arcades released on the SEGA NAOMI in This was due to the popularity of the game with its development staff Osawa brought this offer to the attention of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata and others who approved of the idea br During development of the next Rhythm Heaven game for the Nintendo DS Kazuyoshi Osawa wanted to take advantage of the DS Touch Screen Due to this the game s development wasn t easy for the staff Since Osawa didn t like the idea of using buttons he considered a control mechanic that involved the Touch Screen Finding the ideal method of control took a lot of effort and time For example the ability to touch the edge of the Touch Screen was considered but was determined to be too difficult The Flick action took them about two to three months to research and six months to eventually adapt the control into the game br br br Games br The
