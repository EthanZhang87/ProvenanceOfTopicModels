id: 32168061
The eighth generation of video game consoles began in and consists of four home video game consoles the Wii U released in the PlayStation family in the Xbox One family in and the Nintendo Switch family in br The generation offered few signature hardware innovations Sony and Microsoft continued to produce new systems with similar designs and capabilities as their predecessors but with improved performance processing speed higher resolution graphics and increased storage capacity that further moved consoles into confluence with personal computers and furthering support for digital distribution and games as a service Motion controlled games of the seventh generation had waned in popularity but consoles were preparing for advancement of virtual reality VR with Sony introducing the PlayStation VR in Sony focused heavily on its first party developers and console exclusives as key selling points while Microsoft expanded its gaming services creating the Xbox Game Pass subscription service for Xbox and Windows computers and its xCloud game streaming service Microsoft and Sony consoles saw mid generation refreshes with high end revisions PlayStation Pro and the Xbox One X and lower cost PlayStation Slim and Xbox One S models that lacked some features As of September the PlayStation and Xbox One families had sold an estimated and million units respectively br Nintendo remained on a separate path from Sony or Microsoft in its blue ocean strategy The Wii U was designed to be a more robust Wii to appeal to dedicated gamers but its means and purpose were lost in how it was marketed The Wii U substantially undersold Nintendo s projections selling only million units by its discontinuation in which drove Nintendo to release the Nintendo Switch by its design and marketing accounting for several of the faults of the Wii U while meeting a broad range of global demographics and possible gaming situations Later Nintendo released the Nintendo Switch Lite a version that lacked the Switch s docking capabilities but had other component optimization and was otherwise compatible with all games By March all Switch models have shipped over million units outselling the Wii br Handheld consoles fought against increasing pressure of mobile gaming The Nintendo DS and DS succeeded the Nintendo DS line while the PlayStation Vita was the successor to the PlayStation Portable Combined shipped units of the Nintendo DS DS family had reached million by September but the Vita was estimated to have only sold about million by the end of Sony discontinued the unit in and stated it had no present plans for handheld systems Nintendo discontinued the Nintendo DS in ending the Nintendo DS families of systems The Switch Lite acts as its de facto handheld successor br The eighth generation console market was also influenced by the lifting of China s ban on video consoles in as well as the growth of the mobile gaming sector A number of retro microconsoles were also released during this period br In November Sony and Microsoft released the PlayStation and Xbox Series X and Series S respectively Considered to be their highly anticipated next generation systems they continue the trend from the eighth generation with overall general improved computational performance graphical output and strong backward compatibility support to minimize the disruption of upgrading to the new platform br br br Background br This generation was predicted to face competition from smartphones tablets and smart TVs In gaming revenue on Android overtook portable game console revenue while remaining a distant second to iOS gaming revenue In fiscal year FY ending early Nintendo sold million consoles while Apple sold million iPads in FY ending late One particular threat to the traditional console game sales model has been the free to play model wherein most users play free and either a small number of dedicated players spend enough to cover the rest or the game is supported by advertising br The PlayStation Xbox One and Wii U all use AMD GPUs and two of them PS and XBO also use AMD CPUs on an x architecture similar to common personal computers as opposed to the IBM PowerPC Architecture used in the previous generation Microsoft Nintendo and Sony were not aware that they were all using AMD hardware until their consoles were announced This shift was considered to be beneficial for multi platform development due to the increased similarities between PC hardware and console hardware It also provided a boost in market share for AMD which had faced increased competition from Intel in the PC market br Various microconsoles which are smaller and mostly Android based have been released since although they are seldom referred to as being part of the eighth or any generation of video game consoles These microconsoles have included the Ouya Nvidia Shield Console Amazon Fire TV PlayStation TV MOJO Razer Switchblade GamePop GameStick and PC based Steam Machine consoles A number of microconsoles that were modeled as scaled down versions of consoles from previous generations running a selection of games from that console were also released These included the NES Classic Edition the SNES Classic Edition the PlayStation Classic and the Sega Genesis Mini br Cloud gaming options for the consoles also were developed in the eighth generation PlayStation Now enables cloud gaming of PlayStation and games to current PlayStation consoles and personal computers Microsoft began developing a comparable service xCloud for Xbox and Windows games Google released Stadia a dedicated cloud gaming platform designed around reduced latency and advanced features not typical of these other cloud gaming options br br br Transition br While earlier console generations generally lasted five to six years the shift from seventh to eighth generation lasted about eight Unusually the prior generation s best selling unit the Wii was the first to be replaced in the eighth generation In Microsoft and Sony officials said they considered themselves only halfway through a ten year lifecycle for their seventh generation offerings The companies also said the addition of cameras and motion based controllers like Xbox s Kinect and PlayStation Move extended these systems lifetimes Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said that his company would release the Wii U due to declining sales of seventh generation home consoles and that the market is now waiting for a new proposal for home consoles Sony considered making its next console a digital download only machine but decided against it due to concerns about the inconsistency of internet speeds available globally especially in developing countries br The introduction of the high end PlayStation Pro and Xbox One X in and respectively led to some journalists to call these machines part of a half generation step within the th generation new consoles that would continue to drive sales without introducing a significantly different line of hardware that would segment their consumer base br In Microsoft and Sony released their th generation consoles Xbox Series X and PlayStation Both said they wanted a soft transition meaning that the new hardware plays most or all of the platform s previous games Microsoft said Xbox Series X can play all Xbox One games including games from the Xbox and original Xbox console that are playable on the Xbox One and introduced its Smart Delivery program to update some Xbox One games to enable play on the Xbox Series X Sony has said the overwhelming majority of PlayStation games play on the PlayStation and that many run at higher frame rates and resolutions br br br Chinese market br br The eighth generation of consoles also saw manufacturers re enter the Chinese market Since the Chinese government had banned the sale and distribution of video game consoles citing concerns on their effect on youth The ban led console gaming to a niche sector including a black market for the purchase of these consoles while also causing personal computing gaming to take off within China including the spread of Internet cafes and PC bangs This ban lasted through January where the Chinese government first opened up to allow the sale of consoles in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone FTZ By July the ban on video game consoles was wholly lifted Access to the Chinese video game market is lucrative having an estimated million potential players and representing over US billion in revenues as of br Microsoft and Sony quickly took advantage of the lifting of the ban announcing sales of the Xbox One and PlayStation platforms within the FTZ shortly after the announcement Microsoft established a partnership with BesTV New Media Co a subsidiary of the Shanghai Media Group to sell Xbox One units in China with units first shipping by September Sony worked with Shanghai Oriental Pearl Media in May to establish manufacturing in the FTZ with the PlayStation and PlayStation Vita shipping into China by March CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Andrew House explained in September that the company intended to use the PlayStation Vita TV as a low cost alternative for consumers in an attempt to penetrate the Chinese gaming market br Nintendo did not initially seek to bring the Wii U into China Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aim stated that China was of interest to the company after the ban was lifted but considered that there were similar difficulties with establishing sales there as they had recently had with Brazil Later Nintendo had teamed up with Tencent by April to help sell and distribute the Nintendo Switch as well as aid its games through the Chinese government approval process led by National Radio and Television Administration br br br Home consoles br br br Wii U br br In November Nintendo of America CEO Reggie Fils Aim stated that the release of the next generation of Nintendo would be determined by the continued success of the Wii Nintendo announced its successor to the Wii the Wii U at the Electronic Entertainment Expo on June After the announcement several journalists classified the system as the first eighth generation home console However prominent sources have disputed this because of its comparative lack of power and older disc media type with respect to the announced specifications for PlayStation and the Xbox One br The Wii U s main controller the Wii U GamePad features an embedded touchscreen that can work as an auxiliary interactive screen in a fashion similar to the Nintendo DS DS or if compatible with Off TV Play can even act as the main screen itself enabling games to be played without the need of a television The Wii U is compatible with its predecessor s peripherals such as the Wii Remote Plus the Nunchuk and the Wii Balance Board br The Wii U was released in North America on November in Europe on November and in Japan on December It came in two versions the Basic Model and the Deluxe Premium Model at the price of and US Dollars respectively On August Nintendo announced the production of the Basic model has ended and expected supplies to be exhausted by September On October the Deluxe Premium model was price cut from US to US br The Wii U was initially expected to have lifetime sales of about over million comparable to the Wii However it had lifetime sales of about only million in sharp contrast with the Wii This financially hurt Nintendo with several financial quarters running at a loss through Nintendo had anticipated the Wii U would sell similarly to the Wii but it ended up selling worse than the GameCube and became Nintendo s least successful home console to date Nintendo officially discontinued the Wii U on January due to its commercial failure to make way for its second competitor the Nintendo Switch released one month later br br br PlayStation br br On February Sony announced the PlayStation during a press conference in New York City The console places an emphasis on features surrounding social interaction Gameplay videos can be shared via the PlayStation Network and other services Users can stream games being played by themselves or others either through the console or directly to Twitch The DualShock is similar to the previous DualShock controller with the addition of a touchpad and a Share button along with a Light emitting diode bar on the front to allow motion tracking The PlayStation Camera camera accessory is offered for the system with stereo camera lenses up to px resolution with support for depth sensing similar to Microsoft s Kinect It also remains compatible with the PlayStation Move peripherals Second screen capabilities are available through mobile apps and the PlayStation Vita as well as cloud gaming streaming through the Gaikai service br The PlayStation was released on November in North America and November in Australia and Europe at US A and respectively br br br Xbox One br br On May Microsoft announced the Xbox One at an event in Redmond Washington The console focuses on entertainment including the ability to pass television programming from a set top box over HDMI and use a built in electronic program guide and the ability for computer multitasking by snapping applications such as Skype and Internet Explorer to the side of the screen similarly to Windows The controller has Impulse Triggers that provide Haptic technology feedback and the ability to automatically record and save highlights from gameplay An updated version of Kinect was developed with a p camera and expanded voice controls Originally bundled with the console it has since been excluded br The Xbox One was released in North America Europe and Australia on November at a launch price of US and A respectively with Japan and was later released in other markets in It had two mid generation upgrades one cheaper option released in called the Xbox One S and the other called the Xbox One X which added K gaming Microsoft claimed that the Xbox One X was the World s most powerful console and more powerful than any other console at the time of its release br Production of the Xbox One family of consoles were discontinued shortly after the launch of their successor the Xbox Series X and S at the end of br br br Nintendo Switch br br Due to the commercial failure of the Wii U along with competition from mobile gaming then president Satoru Iwata sought to revitalize the company by creating a new strategy for Nintendo that included embracing mobile gaming and developing new hardware that would be attractive to a wider range of audiences The hardware product was announced under the codename NX in a press conference held with DeNA on March and fully revealed as the Nintendo Switch on October It was released worldwide on March competing with the Xbox One and PlayStation br The Switch is considered by Nintendo a home console that has multiple ways to play The main unit the Console is a tablet sized device with a touch sensitive screen It can be inserted into a Docking Station which allows games to be played on a connected television Alternatively two Joy Con motion sensitive controllers comparable to the Wii Remotes can be slotted onto the sides of the Console so the unit can be played as a handheld Further the Console can be set on a kickstand allowing multiple players to see the screen and play games with separate Joy Con Additionally Nintendo built the Switch on standard industry components allowing for ease of porting games onto the system using standard software libraries and game engines rather than Nintendo s usual proprietary approaches This enabled them to bring several third party and independent game developers on board prior to launch to assure some third party games in their software library br Despite the Switch being significantly weaker in terms of processing power than its competitors it was met with critical praise and commercial success Nintendo had anticipated selling about million Switches in the first year of release but ended up exceeding this projection with total first year sales of over million units exceeding the Wii U s lifetime sales In late the Nintendo Switch was the fastest selling console in US history and in November it was the fastest selling of all the th generation consoles in the US br A hardware revision the Switch Lite was announced on July and was released on September The unit integrates the Joy Con onto the main console with a smaller form factor making the unit strictly handheld rather than a hybrid system Further details are described below under Handhelds An enhanced model was announced on July and was released on October featuring a K ready dock a inch OLED screen a wider and adjustable stand enhanced audio a wired LAN port built into the dock and GB of internal storage br br br Comparison br br Notes br br br Handheld systems br A trend starting from the eighth generation of handheld systems is the general shift from dedicated handheld gaming consoles to mobile gaming on smart devices such as smartphones and tablets As such smart devices have eroded sales of dedicated handheld gaming consoles with analysts predicting that smart devices will replace handheld gaming consoles in the near future br br br Nintendo DS br br The Nintendo DS is a
