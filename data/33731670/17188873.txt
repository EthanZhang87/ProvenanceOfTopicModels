Mario Donkey Kong The Legend of Zelda and Star Fox These games would enjoy limited inherited popularity based on the popularities of the original series and they would periodically be re released in a variety of colors Originally retailing at moderate prices these games have now become collectors items on the secondary market and fetch large prices at places like eBay br The earliest of the Nintendo licensed watches was Super Mario Bros which was released in June The Super Mario Bros Game Watch was released shortly after Subsequent to this Nelsonic released Game Watch versions of Super Mario Bros Super Mario Bros based on Super Mario World and Super Mario Race Additionally Donkey Kong was released as a wristwatch featuring Mario br Critics were generally pleased with the game watches and praised their stylishness as articles of clothing Gameplay was roundly criticized as oversimplified however and the watches were considered to have been largely unsuccessful in evoking their original NES title namesakes Super Mario Brothers was described as nothing like the NES game and its single screen layout resulted in play dynamics that were described as boring br br br Barcode
