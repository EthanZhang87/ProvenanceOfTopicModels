Tomy Company Ltd Kabushikigaisha Takara Tom trading as Takara Tomy in Asia and Tomy elsewhere is a Japanese toy company It was established in by Eiichir Tomiyama as Tomiyama Toy Manufacturing Company became known for creating popular toys like the B friction toy and luck based game Pop up Pirate In Tomy merged with another toy manufacturer Takara and although the English company name remained the same it became Takara Tomy in Asia It has its headquarters in Katsushika Tokyo br br br History and corporate name br br br Before the merger br The company was named Tomy as an abridgement of Tomiyama which was the founder s surname Starting as a manufacturer Tomy had the largest product development team in the toy industry and plaudits for its technology Nonetheless by its third generation president Mikitaro Tomiyama decided to streamline the company to be more competitive with wholesaler Bandai Bandai developed its products more quickly which was more appealing to television properties that required a fast turnaround Despite internal and external opposition Tomiyama was determined to aggressively pursue TV licenses such as Akakage Giant Robo and Osomatsu kun br Tomiyama was shocked when his son told him that Tomy s toys were bad and that he wanted to work for Bandai when he grew up In response he created the moderately successful Zettai Muteki Raijin Oh then Genki Bakuhatsu Ganbaruger but the product development team followed these with Nekketsu Saiky Go Saurer which was a catastrophic failure It became common wisdom within the industry that Tomy could not support a multimedia franchise However Tomy established a relationship with Shogakukan and created the successful Wedding Peach and Let s Go br Tomy learned about the growing popularity of Pok mon through monthly CoroCoro Comic and obtained the commercial rights Bandai at the time was busy with its big hit Tamagotchi and was not interested in Pok mon Tomy acquired the rights to commercialize a wide range of merchandise mainly toys and released the Monster Collection of figures next year The anime became a huge hit and sales of related products doubled Tomy who had been the third largest company in the toy industry since the s rose to second place in br In competitor Takara s hit franchise Beyblade and Pok mon s slump saw Takara regaining second place and Tomy falling again to third However Beyblade subsequently faltered which adversely affected Takara s fortunes Tomy merged with the suffering company and became Takara Tomy br br br After the merger br br The company decided to use the name Tomy in international subsidiaries and Takara Tomy in Japan because Tomy had built considerable international brand recognition while Takara s products Microman Transformers Battle Beasts Beyblade B Daman etc had been sold and branded by other toy companies such as Hasbro Additionally the financial cost of rebranding was prohibitive br In Western media the Takara Tomy merger was typically characterised as a takeover of Takara by Tomy likely because several years of losses had put Takara in a financially weakened state at the time of the merger although Takara did have significantly higher sales than Tomy However the companies management teams had previously discussed merging including at times when Takara appeared stronger Under Japanese corporate law the move was a merger of both companies on an equal basis br Post merger media speculation about the control of brands from the Takara Tomy merger arose from the new use of a TOMY copyright on all packaging including former Takara brands shipped by Hasbro but this was merely a consequence of the decision to use only the Tomy name in international subsidiaries In Japan Takara Tomy continues to use both Tomy and Takara as distinct brand names on toy ranges which originated in each separate company and most new toy ranges or stand alone products now carry the new Takara Tomy brand br Takara purchased a majority stake in Tatsunoko Production in June The studio then became a full subsidiary of Takara Tomy following the March merger until Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings bought majority of Tatsunoko s stake and is now majorly owned by it affiliate company Nippon TV Tomy UK was founded in for the sale and distribution of Tomy products in Europe and it has successfully brought toys such as Zoids and games like Pop up Pirate to the West Tomy UK s slogan has traditionally been Trust Tomy In Tomy UK launched a website on which consumers can buy online from Tomy s catalogue In early Takara Tomy acquired RC Corporation and the RC sub brand Learning Curve which included The First Years Lamaze and Compass br br br Products br br Takara Tomy has manufactured a broad range of products based on its own properties which include from the Tomy side Tomica Plarail Zoids Idaten Jump Nohohon Zoku and Tomy branded baby care products and from the Takara side Space Pets Choro Q also known as Penny Racers

Sakura Kinomoto Clear Card Slayers Revolutionary Girl Utena Kirarin Revolution Sugarbunnies and Animal Crossing Tomy s rights to these licenses vary by region One of the first examples of product synergy for the merged company was the combining of Takara s Jinsei Game Game of Life license and Tomy s Pok mon license to produce a Pok mon Jinsei Game br Tomy sells many products worldwide
