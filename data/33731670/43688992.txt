Nintendo did not rule out the possibility of a release of the regular New Nintendo DS in the future Nintendo of America representative Damon Baker explained that they did not want to confuse consumers and that the face plates were not enough of a reason for the smaller sized system to be released in North America A social media campaign emerged that called upon Nintendo of America to release the

indeed consider releasing the smaller standard model at one point br On August at the GameStop Managers Conference in Las Vegas Nintendo of America confirmed that the standard New DS system would

production in July br br br Reception br Reviews of the New Nintendo DS line were positive br Critics felt the new Super Stable D system was successful in improving the consistency and viewing angles of the device s stereoscopic D effects especially in games that require use of its gyroscope An IGN writer noted that the constant swaying and occasional jolt of my morning train commute has only very occasionally shattered the new systems stereoscopic spell and even then the system quickly adjusts and snaps back into focus The improved technical specifications of the new systems were also noted making the device s operating system more responsive and providing modest performance enhancements for existing games such as Monster Hunter Ultimate br The incorporation of the Circle Pad Pro s additional shoulder buttons and secondary analog stick into the devices were praised along with their potential for use in ports of games from home consoles Opinions were mixed on the design of the C Stick itself however GameSpot felt it was surprisingly responsive and IGN drew comparisons to the similar pointing stick sometimes found on ThinkPad laptops but felt that while good for occasional functions such as camera control and aiming in third person games it would not function well for more intense use cases such as first person shooters due to its size and lack of grip in comparison to the Circle Pad br Aspects of the devices designs were noted IGN felt that the face plate options on the regular sized models added a level of personalization to the console but that while face plates will take off with younger gamers in particular these accessories could just as easily end up in the bargain bin faster than you can say Limited Edition Perfect Dark Zero Xbox face plate Nintendo s decision to exclude this feature from the XL version was also considered odd Wired felt that the new locations for the power button card slot and stylus holder were inconvenient Critics also felt the switch to MicroSD cards and the relocation of the SD card slot to the battery compartment would make manually transferring data from the previous DS models trickier GameSpot lamented on the difficulty of unscrewing the rear cover off the XL citing stubborn screws and a panel that practically refuses to detach Nintendo s decision to not bundle an AC adapter with the new models was criticized particularly in the case of first time DS owners br GameSpot felt that the New Nintendo DS XL was the best handheld Nintendo s ever made and recommended it to first time DS owners In regards to existing DS owners the new systems were recommended to those showing interest in its exclusives or wanting a better overall experience Giving the console an out of IGN concluded that the additional controls and increased processing power set the system up nicely for the future and if you re late to the DS party you ve got a back catalogue that features not just some of the best handheld games in recent years but some of the best games full stop br br br Sales br As of December million units of the New Nintendo DS and New Nintendo DS XL have shipped worldwide br br br Notes br br br br br br
