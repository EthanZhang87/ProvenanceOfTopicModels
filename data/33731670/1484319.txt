Handheld electronic games are interactive electronic games often miniaturized versions of video games that are played on portable handheld devices known as handheld game consoles whose controls display and speakers are all part of a single unit Rather than a general purpose screen made up of a grid of small pixels they usually have custom displays designed to play one game This simplicity means they can be made as small as a smartwatch and sometimes are The visual output of these games can range from a few small light bulbs or LED lights to calculator like alphanumerical screens later these were mostly displaced by liquid crystal and vacuum fluorescent display screens with detailed images and in the case of VFD games color Handhelds popularity was at its peak from the late s into the early s before declining They are the precursors to the handheld game console br br br History br br Early handheld games used simple mechanisms to interact with players often limited to illuminated buttons and sound effects Early handheld games include Mattel Auto Race and Mattel Electronic Football which have simple red LED displays gameplay involves pressing buttons to move a car or quarterback icon represented by a bright dot to avoid obstacles represented by less bright dots br In the Milton Bradley Company entered the handheld market with Simon a simple color and sound matching game Simon had no dedicated display but featured four colored lighted buttons the original version was large enough to be used as a tabletop game or a handheld later versions became increasingly smaller The same year Parker Brothers also released Merlin a more sophisticated handheld which could play six different games using an array of buttons with integrated LEDs Despite their relative simplicity each of these early games was highly successful br The initial success of Mattel and Parker Brothers entries spawned a wave of similar handheld devices which were released through the early s Notable among these were a series of popular player head to head games from Coleco Other games were miniaturized versions of popular arcade video games br In Gunpei Yokoi traveling on a bullet train saw a bored businessman playing with an LCD calculator by pressing the buttons Yokoi then thought of an idea for a watch that doubled as a miniature game machine for killing time a game watch Starting in Nintendo began to release a series of electronic games designed by Yokoi called the Game Watch games Taking advantage of the technology used in the credit card sized calculators that had appeared on the market Yokoi designed the series of LCD based games to include a digital time display in the corner of the screen For later more complicated Game Watch games Yokoi invented a cross shaped directional pad or D pad for control of on screen characters Yokoi also included his directional pad on the Famicom game console s controllers and the cross shaped thumb controller soon became standard on game console controllers and ubiquitous across the video game industry as a replacement for the joystick br During the s LCDs became inexpensive and largely replaced LED displays in handheld games The use of custom images in LCD and VFD games allows them to have greater detail and avoid the blocky pixellated look of console screens but not without drawbacks All graphics are fixed in place so every possible location and state of game objects has to be preset and are usually visible when resetting a game with no overlap Illusion of movement is created by sequentially flashing objects between their possible states Backgrounds for these games are static drawings layered behind the moving graphics which are transparent when not in use Partly due to these limitations the gameplay of early LCD games was often even more crude than for their LED antecedents br Some of the more well known handheld games of the LCD era are the Game Watch series by Nintendo and the games by Tiger Electronics and many titles from other companies were also popular especially conversions of arcade games New games are still being made but most are based on relatively simple card and board games br br br Bandai LCD Solarpower br br In the Bandai LCD Solarpower series were the first solar powered gaming devices Some of its games such as the horror themed game Terror House featured two LCD panels one stacked on the other for an early D effect In Takara Tomy s Tomytronic D series simulated D by having two LED panels that were lit by external light through a window on top of the device making it the first dedicated home video D hardware br The LCD Solarpower series are handheld electronic games powered by solar energy made by Bandai in The games in the Double Panel series feature two LCD panels stacked on top of each other This allows these games to progress in stages for more variation in game play br br br Games br It comprises the following games br First series br

Akuryo no Yakata ref br Frankenstein Mr Franken ref br Airport Panic Airport Panic ref br Other handheld games were built as flipcases and had two or even three LCDs with different foreground and background scenes offering some variety in the gameplay br br br Handhelds today br br Despite the increasing sophistication of handheld consoles such as the Nintendo Switch dedicated handhelds continue to find a niche Among technophilic gamer subcultures like Akiba kei unique control schemes like that of the Tuttuki Bako have been proven salable due to novelty but dedicated handhelds such as this are uncommon Adult fads such as blackjack poker and Sudoku also spawn dozens of original and knockoff handheld games br The Chinese Russian Brick Game popular in the early s include games using a block grid as a crude low resolution dot matrix screen Such devices often have many variations of Tetris and sometimes even other kinds of games like racing Breakout or even shoot em up such as those resembling Galaga or Battle City where one block projects blocks at the enemy blocks The most advanced of these designs usually have distinct games sorted in alphabetical letters and feature multi channel sound voice synthesis or digital sounds samples and internal CMOS memory which can save the current game progress and high scores when the system is turned off Many of these handhelds with a dozen such games are marketed as having hundreds or even thousands of games e g in though the vast majority are just different speed and difficulty settings The most basic can now be sold as low as br At the lowest end of handheld game sophistication there is also the avoid catch the falling objects game These games are controlled with movement buttons and sport a screen with a column of player positions and rows of projectiles to animate towards the player The player and projectiles could be any picture from tanks dodging missiles to a dog catching sausages br br br See also br br
