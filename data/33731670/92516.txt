The Shinkansen Japanese i ka se lit new main line colloquially known in English as the bullet train is a network of high speed railway lines in Japan Initially it was built to connect distant Japanese regions with Tokyo the capital to aid economic growth and development Beyond long distance travel some sections around the largest metropolitan areas are used as a commuter rail network It is owned by the Japan Railway Construction Transport and Technology Agency and operated by five Japan Railways Group companies br Starting with the Tokaido Shinkansen km mi in the network has expanded to currently consist of km mi of lines with maximum speeds of km h mph km mi of Mini Shinkansen lines with a maximum speed of km h mph and km mi of spur lines with Shinkansen services The network presently links most major cities on the islands of Honshu and Kyushu and Hakodate on the northern island of Hokkaido with an extension to Sapporo under construction and scheduled to commence in March The maximum operating speed is km h mph on a km mi section of the T hoku Shinkansen Test runs have reached km h mph for conventional rail in and up to a world record km h mph for SCMaglev trains in April br The original Tokaido Shinkansen connecting Tokyo Nagoya and Osaka three of Japan s largest cities is one of the world s busiest high speed rail lines In the one year period preceding March it carried million passengers and since its opening more than five decades ago it has transported more than billion total passengers At peak times the line carries up to trains per hour in each direction with cars each seat capacity and occasionally additional standing passengers with a minimum headway of three minutes between trains br The Shinkansen network of Japan had the highest annual passenger ridership a maximum of million in of any high speed rail network until when the Chinese high speed railway network surpassed it at million passengers annually reaching over billion annual passengers in br br br Etymology br Shinkansen in Japanese means new trunk line or new main line but this word is used to describe both the railway lines the trains run on and the trains themselves In English the trains are also known as the bullet train The term bullet train dangan ressha originates from and was the initial name given to the Shinkansen project in its earliest planning stages Furthermore the name superexpress ch tokky used exclusively until for Hikari trains on the T kaid Shinkansen is used today in English language announcements and signage br br br History br br Japan was the first country to build dedicated railway lines for high speed travel Because of the mountainous terrain the existing network consisted of mm ft in narrow gauge lines which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds due to technical limitations of narrow gauge rail For example if a standard gauge rail has a curve with a maximum speed of km h mph the same curve on narrow gauge rail will have a maximum allowable speed of km h mph Consequently Japan had a greater need for new high speed lines than countries where the existing standard gauge or broad gauge rail system had more upgrade potential br Among the key people credited with the construction of the first Shinkansen are Hideo Shima the Chief Engineer and Shinji Sog the first President of Japanese National Railways JNR who managed to persuade politicians to back the plan Other significant people responsible for its technical development were Tadanao Miki Tadashi Matsudaira and Hajime Kawanabe based at the Railway Technical Research Institute RTRI part of JNR They were responsible for much of the technical development of the first line the T kaid Shinkansen All three had worked on aircraft design during World War II br br br Early proposals br br The popular English name bullet train is a literal translation of the Japanese term dangan ressha a nickname given to the project while it was initially discussed in the s The name stuck because of the original Series Shinkansen s resemblance to a bullet and its high speed br The Shinkansen name was first formally used in for a proposed standard gauge passenger and freight line between Tokyo and Shimonoseki that would have used steam and electric locomotives with a top speed of km h mph Over the next three years the Ministry of Railways drew up more ambitious plans to extend the line to Beijing through a tunnel to Korea and even Singapore and build connections to the Trans Siberian Railway and other trunk lines in Asia These plans were abandoned in as Japan s position in World War II worsened However some construction did commence on the line several tunnels on the present day Shinkansen date to the war era project br br br Construction br Following the end of World War II high speed rail was forgotten for several years while traffic of passengers and freight steadily increased on the conventional T kaid Main Line along with the reconstruction of Japanese industry and economy By the mid s the T kaid Line was operating at full capacity and the Ministry of Railways decided to revisit the Shinkansen project In Odakyu Electric Railway introduced its series SE Romancecar train setting a world speed record of km h mph for a narrow gauge train This train gave designers the confidence that they could safely build an even faster standard gauge train Thus the first Shinkansen the series was built on the success of the Romancecar br In the s the Japanese national attitude was that railways would soon be outdated and replaced by air travel and highways as in the United States However Shinji Sog President of Japanese National Railways insisted strongly on the possibility of high speed rail and the Shinkansen project was implemented br Government approval came in December and construction of the first segment of the T kaid Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka started in April The cost of constructing the Shinkansen was at first estimated at nearly billion yen which was raised in the form of a government loan railway bonds and a low interest loan of US million from the World Bank Initial estimates however were understated and the actual cost was about billion yen As the budget shortfall became clear in Sogo resigned to take responsibility br A test facility for rolling stock called the Kamonomiya Model Section opened in Odawara in br br br Initial success br br The T kaid Shinkansen began service on October in time for the first Tokyo Olympics The conventional Limited Express service took six hours and minutes from Tokyo to Osaka but the Shinkansen made the trip in just four hours shortened to three hours and ten minutes by It enabled day trips between Tokyo and Osaka the two largest metropolises in Japan significantly changed the style of business and life of the Japanese people and increased new traffic demand The service was an immediate success reaching the million passenger mark in less than three years on July and one billion passengers in Sixteen car trains were introduced for Expo in Osaka With an average of passengers per hour in each direction in the T kaid Shinkansen was the world s busiest high speed rail line As of the train s th anniversary daily passenger traffic rose to which spread over its hour schedule represented an average of just under passengers per hour br The first Shinkansen trains the series ran at speeds of up to km h mph later increased to km h mph The last of these trains with their classic bullet nosed appearance were retired on November A driving car from one of the series trains was donated by JR West to the National Railway Museum in York United Kingdom in br br br Network expansion br The T kaid Shinkansen s rapid success prompted an extension westward to Okayama Hiroshima and Fukuoka the San y Shinkansen which was completed in Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was an ardent supporter of the Shinkansen and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines Two new lines the T hoku Shinkansen and J etsu Shinkansen were built following this plan Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as JNR slid into debt throughout the late s largely because of the high cost of building the Shinkansen network By the early s the company was practically insolvent leading to its privatization in br Development of the Shinkansen by the privatised regional JR companies has continued with new train models developed each generally with its own distinctive appearance such as the series introduced by JR West Since Shinkansen trains run regularly at speeds up to km h mph on the T hoku Shinkansen only the Shanghai maglev train China Railway High speed networks and the Indonesian Jakarta Bandung High speed railway have commercial services that operate faster br Since development has also been underway for the Ch Shinkansen a planned maglev line from Tokyo to Osaka On April a seven car L series maglev trainset set a world speed record of km h mph br br br Technology br To enable high speed operation Shinkansen uses a range of advanced technology compared with conventional rail achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort Its success has influenced other railways in the world demonstrating the importance and advantages of high speed rail br br br Routing br Shinkansen routes never intersect with slower narrow gauge conventional lines except mini shinkansen which runs along these older lines Consequently the shinkansen is not affected by slower local or freight trains except for Hokkaido Shinkansen while traveling through the Seikan Tunnel and has the capacity to operate many high speed trains punctually In addition shinkansen routes excluding mini shinkansen are completely grade separated from roads and highways meaning railway crossings are almost eliminated Tracks are strictly off limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law The routes use tunnels and viaducts to go through and over obstacles rather than around them with a minimum curve radius of m ft m ft on the oldest T kaid Shinkansen br br br Track br br The Shinkansen uses mm ft in standard gauge in contrast to the mm ft in narrow gauge of most other lines in Japan Continuous welded rail and swingnose crossing points are employed eliminating gaps at turnouts and crossings Long rails are used joined by expansion joints to minimize gauge fluctuation due to thermal elongation and shrinkage br A combination of ballasted and slab track is used with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels Slab track is significantly more cost effective in tunnel sections since the lower track height reduces the cross sectional area of the tunnel reducing construction costs up to br However the smaller diameter of Shinkansen tunnels compared to some other high speed lines has resulted in the issue of tunnel boom becoming a concern for residents living close to tunnel portals br The slab track consists of rails fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar On the roadbed and in tunnels circular upstands measuring mm inches in diameter and mm inches high are located at metre intervals The prefabricated upstands are made of either reinforced concrete or pre stressed reinforced concrete they prevent the track slab from moving latitudinally or longitudinally One track slab weighs approximately tons and is mm inches wide mm inches long and mm inches thick br br br Signal system br br The Shinkansen employs an ATC Automatic Train Control system eliminating the need for trackside signals It uses a comprehensive system of Automatic Train Protection Centralized traffic control manages all train operations and all tasks relating to train movement track station and schedule are networked and computerized br br br Electrical systems br Shinkansen uses a kV AC overhead power supply kV AC on Mini shinkansen lines to overcome the limitations of the V direct current used on the existing electrified narrow gauge system Power is distributed along the train s axles to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars The AC frequency of the power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is Hz br br br Trains br br Shinkansen trains are electric multiple units EMUs offering fast acceleration deceleration and reduced damage to the track because of the use of lighter vehicles compared to locomotives or power cars The coaches are air sealed to ensure stable air pressure when entering tunnels at high speed br Shinkansen trains excluding mini Shinkansen are also built to a larger loading gauge compared to conventional speed rolling stock This larger loading gauge permits wider coaches allowing for abreast seating in Standard Class coaches compared to the more common abreast seating usually found elsewhere On occasions this wider loading gauge was also used to allow abreast seating on certain trains such as the E and E series sets This combined with a lack of power cars allows for a higher passenger capacity within a shorter train length However since mini Shinkansen lines are effectively track regauged conventional lines the conventional loading gauge for mm lines still applies on mini Shinkansen lines br br br Traction br The Shinkansen has used EMUs from the outset with the Series Shinkansen having all axles powered Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant or unable to use distributed traction configurations Talgo the German ICE and the French and subsequently South Korean TGV and KTX I and KTX Sancheon use the locomotive also known as power car configuration with the Renfe Class and continues with it for the Talgo AVRIL because it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of Talgo s bogie design which uses a modified Jacobs bogie with a single axle instead of two and allows the wheels to rotate independently of each other on the ICE TGV and KTX it is because it easily allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment In Japan significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration A greater proportion of motored axles permits higher acceleration so the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high speed lines elsewhere in the world br br br Lines br br The main Shinkansen lines are br br In practice the Tokaido San y and Kyushu lines form a contiguous west southbound line from Tokyo as train services run between the Tokaido and San y lines and between the San y and Kyushu lines though the lines are operated by different companies br The Tokaido Shinkansen tracks are not physically connected to the lines of the Tohoku Shinkansen at Tokyo Station as they use different electrification standards signaling systems and earthquake mitigation devices There also exists a dispute between JR East and JR Central about the use of the two platforms which were added to the Tokaido line s half of Tokyo station Before JNR s privatization they were conceived as being shared with the Tohoku line and their construction used funds allocated to the Tohoku line s extension to Tokyo however the extension was finished after privatization by which time the platforms were owned by JR Central Therefore there is no through service between those lines All northbound services from Tokyo travel along the Tohoku Shinkansen until at least miya before splitting off towards Sendai or Takasaki br Two further lines known as Mini shinkansen have also been constructed by re gauging and upgrading existing sections of line br br Yamagata Shinkansen Fukushima Shinj br Akita Shinkansen Morioka Akita br There are two standard gauge lines not technically classified as Shinkansen lines but run Shinkansen trains as they use tracks leading to Shinkansen storage maintenance yards br br Hakata Minami Line Hakata Hakata Minami br Gala Yuzawa Line technically a branch of the J etsu Line Echigo Yuzawa Gala Yuzawa br br br Lines under construction br The following lines are under construction These lines except Ch Shinkansen called Seibi Shinkansen or planned Shinkansen are the Shinkansen projects designated in the Basic Plan of the Shinkansen Railway decided by the government br br Hokkaido Shinkansen from Shin Hakodate Hokuto to Sapporo is under construction and scheduled to open by March br Ch Shinkansen Tokyo Nagoya Osaka is the first maglev Shinkansen line which has been under construction since JR Central has abandoned a previously announced target date for the line from Tokyo to Nagoya due to a dispute with the prefecture of Shizuoka and as of there is no official target date br br br Planned lines br The extension of Hokuriku Shinkansen to Osaka is proposed with the route via Obama and Kyoto selected by the government on December Construction is proposed to commence in and take years br Nishi Kyushu Shinkansen has been built to full Shinkansen standards between Takeo Onsen and Nagasaki with the existing narrow gauge line from Shin Tosu to Takeo Onsen to remain as narrow gauge track although there is a proposal to build the section between Shin Tosu and Takeo Onsen to full Shinkansen standards In the Ministry of Land Infrastructure Transport and Tourism released cost benefit analysis results to compare and contrast full Shinkansen mini Shinkansen and Gauge Change Train for this section br br br Cancelled lines br The Narita Shinkansen project to connect Tokyo to Narita International Airport initiated in the s but halted in after landowner protests has been officially cancelled and removed from the Basic Plan governing Shinkansen construction Parts of its planned right of way were used by the Narita Sky Access Line which opened in and the Keiyo Line reused space originally set aside for the Narita Shinkansen terminus at Tokyo Station Although the Sky Access Line uses standard gauge track it was not built to Shinkansen specifications and there are no plans to convert it into a full Shinkansen line br br br Proposed lines br br Many Shinkansen lines were proposed during the boom of the early s but have yet to be constructed and have subsequently been shelved indefinitely br br Hokkaido Shinkansen northward extension Sapporo Asahikawa br Hokkaido South Loop Shinkansen Hokkaid Minami mawari Shinkansen Oshamanbe Muroran Sapporo br Uetsu

Nagaoka br u Shinkansen Fukushima Yamagata Akita br Fukushima Shinj and magari Akita exist as the Yamagata Shinkansen and Akita Shinkansen respectively but as Mini Shinkansen upgrades of existing track they do not meet the requirements of the Basic Plan br Hokuriku Ch ky Shinkansen Nagoya Tsuruga br Sanin Shinkansen Osaka Tottori Matsue Shimonoseki br Trans Ch goku Shinkansen Ch goku dan Shinkansen Okayama Matsue br Shikoku Shinkansen Osaka Tokushima Takamatsu Matsuyama ita br Trans Shikoku Shinkansen Shikoku dan Shinkansen Okayama K chi Matsuyama br There have been some activity regarding the Shikoku and Trans Shikoku Shinkansen in recent years In the Shikoku and Trans Shikoku Shinkansen were identified as potential future projects in a review of long term plans for the Shikoku area and funds allocated towards the planning of the route A profitability study has also been commissioned by the city of Oita in that found the route to be potentially profitable br East Kyushu Shinkansen Higashi Kyushu Shinkansen Fukuoka ita Miyazaki Kagoshima br Trans Kyushu Shinkansen Kyushu dan Shinkansen ita Kumamoto br In addition the Basic Plan specified that the J etsu Shinkansen should start from Shinjuku not Tokyo Station which would have required building an additional km mi of track between Shinjuku and miya While no construction work was ever started land along the proposed track including an underground section leading to Shinjuku Station remains reserved If capacity on the current Tokyo miya section proves insufficient at some point construction of the Shinjuku miya link may be reconsidered br In December then transport minister Seiji Maehara proposed a bullet train link to Haneda Airport using an existing spur that connects the T kaid Shinkansen to a train depot JR Central called the plan unrealistic due to tight train schedules on the existing line but reports said that Maehara wished to continue discussions on the idea The current minister has not indicated whether this proposal remains supported While the plan may become more feasible after the opening the Ch Shinkansen sometimes referred to as a bypass to the Tokaido Shinkansen frees up capacity construction is already underway for other rail improvements between Haneda and Tokyo station expected to be completed prior to the opening of the Tokyo Olympics so any potential Shinkansen service would likely offer only marginal benefit beyond that Despite these plans ultimately not being realized owing in part due to the effects of the COVID pandemic various rail projects in the vicinity of Haneda Airport including the Haneda Airport Access Line and the Tokyo Rinkai Subway Line continue to undergo planning br br br Services br br Originally intended to carry passenger trains by day and freight trains by night the Shinkansen lines carried exclusively passengers for the first five and a half decades of their operation Since light freight has been carried on some passenger services and there are plans to expand this with freight only trains in the future br The system shuts down between midnight and every day for maintenance The few overnight passenger trains that still run in Japan run on the older narrow gauge network that the Shinkansen parallels br There are three principal service types on the Shinkansen br br Express services these stop at only the very largest stations and as a result are the fastest Shinkansen services measured by average speed br Semi express services these stop at certain smaller stops alongside stopping at all the largest stations These allow for faster connections from smaller stops to larger stations than would be otherwise possible with a local service br Local services these stop at every station along the Shinkansen line Consequently local services are the slowest Shinkansen services measured by average speed Frequently these services only operate on a part of the line instead of covering the entirety br br br T kaid

br br Punctuality br The Shinkansen is very reliable thanks to several factors including its near total separation from slower traffic In JR Central reported that the Shinkansen s average delay from schedule per train was seconds This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes such as natural disasters In April a train arriving to Nagoya was delayed by minutes due to a report of small snakes slithering through a passenger carriage br br br Safety record br Over the Shinkansen s plus year history carrying over billion passengers there have been no passenger fatalities due to train accidents such as derailments or collisions despite frequent earthquakes and typhoons Injuries and a single fatality have been caused by doors closing on passengers or their belongings attendants are employed at platforms to prevent such accidents There have however been suicides by passengers jumping both from and in front of moving trains On June a passenger committed suicide on board a Shinkansen train by setting himself on fire killing another passenger and seriously injuring seven other people br There have been two derailments of Shinkansen trains in passenger service The first one occurred during the Ch etsu earthquake on October Eight of ten cars of the Toki No train on the J etsu Shinkansen derailed near Nagaoka Station in Nagaoka Niigata There were no casualties among the passengers br Another derailment happened on March on the Akita Shinkansen when the Komachi No train derailed in blizzard conditions in Daisen Akita No passengers were injured br In the event of an earthquake an earthquake detection system can bring the train to a stop very quickly newer trainsets are lighter and have stronger braking systems allowing for quicker stopping A new anti derailment device was installed after detailed analysis of the J etsu derailment br Several months after the exposure of the Kobe Steel falsification scandal which is among the suppliers of high strength steel for Shinkansen trainsets cracks were found upon inspection of a single bogie and removed from service on December br On January a massive power outage struck the Tohoku Hokuriku and Joetsu Shinkansen lines resulting in the cancellation of trains and affecting about passengers JR East said that the outage was caused by the Kagayaki train touching an overhead power cable which was left dangling after the metal rod supporting it fractured between Omiya Station in Saitama and Ueno Station in Tokyo The incident damaged the train s pantographs and a window while two railway employees were hospitalized following an explosion that occurred at the site during repairs Most Shinkansen services were restored the following morning br On April Shinkansen services between Tokyo and Osaka were delayed by minutes after a snake was found inside a train compartment br br br Effects br br br Economics br The Shinkansen has had a significant beneficial effect on Japan s business economy society environment and culture beyond mere construction and operational contributions The results in time savings alone from switching from a conventional to a high speed network have been estimated at million hours and the system has an economic contribution of billion per year That does not include the savings from reduced reliance on imported fuel which also has national security benefits Shinkansen lines particularly in the very crowded coastal Taiheiy Belt megalopolis met two primary goals br br Shinkansen trains reduced the congestion burden on regional transportation by increasing throughput on a minimal land footprint therefore being economically preferable compared to modes such as airports or highways common in less densely populated regions of the world br As rail was already the primary urban mode of passenger travel from that perspective it was akin to a sunk cost there was not a significant number of motorists to convince to switch modes The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as Kakegawa that would otherwise be too distant from major cities br However upon the introduction of the Basic Plan the initial prudence in developing Shinkansen lines gave way to political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of Kanto and Kinki Although in some cases regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition issues sometimes influenced by the cancellation of the Narita Shinkansen following fierce protests by locals over time Shinkansen lines were built to relatively sparsely populated areas with the intent the network would disperse the population away from the capital br Such expansion had a significant cost JNR the national railway company was already burdened with subsidizing unprofitable rural and regional railways Additionally it assumed Shinkansen construction debt to the point the government corporation eventually owed some trillion contributing to it being regionalised and privatized in The privatized JRs eventually paid a total of trillion to acquire JNR s Shinkansen network br Following privatization the JR group of companies have continued Shinkansen network expansion to less populated areas but with far more flexibility to spin off unprofitable railways or cut costs than in JNR days Currently an important factor is the post bubble zero interest rate policy that allows JR to borrow huge sums of capital without significant concern regarding repayment timing br A UCLA study found that the presence of a Shinkansen line had helped with housing affordability by making it more realistic for lower income city workers to live in exurban areas much further away from the city which tends to have cheaper housing options That in turn helps the city to decentralise and thus reduce the city property prices from what they could have otherwise been br br br Environment br Traveling by the Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka produces only around of the carbon dioxide of the equivalent journey by car a saving of tons of CO per year br br br Challenges br br br Noise pollution br Noise pollution concerns have made increasing speed more difficult In Japan population density is high and there have been severe protests against the Shinkansen s noise pollution Its noise is now limited to less than dB in residential areas br Improvement and reduction of the pantograph weight saving of cars and construction of noise barriers and other measures have been implemented Current research is primarily aimed at reducing operational noise particularly the tunnel boom phenomenon caused when trains transit tunnels at high speed br br br Earthquake br Because of the risk of earthquakes in Japan the Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System UrEDAS an earthquake warning system was introduced in It enables automatic braking of Shinkansen trains in the event of large earthquakes br br br Heavy snow br The T kaid Shinkansen often experiences heavy snow in the area around Maibara Station between December and February requiring trains to reduce speed thus disrupting the timetable Snow dispersing sprinkler systems have been installed but delays of minutes still occur during snowy weather Snow related treefalls have also caused service interruptions Along the J etsu Shinkansen route snow can be very heavy with depths of two to three metres the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and slab track to mitigate the snow s effects Despite having multiple days with delays longer than minutes the T hoku Shinkansen still presents a slight advantage in reliability compared to air travel on days with significant snowfall br br br Ridership br br br Annual br br The sum of the ridership of individual lines does not equal the ridership of the system because a single rider may be counted multiple times when using multiple lines to get proper ridership figures for a system in the above case is only counted once br Only refers to days of operation March opening date to March end of FY br Until Japan s high speed rail system had the highest annual patronage of any system worldwide China s HSR network s patronage reached billion and is now the world s highest br br br Cumulative comparison br br Notes br br Data in italics includes extrapolated estimations where data is missing Turkey and Russia data here is included in Europe column rather than split between Asia and Europe Only systems with km h or higher regular service speed are considered br Shinkansen share refers to percent of Shinkansen ridership including fully assembled exported trainsets as a percent of World total Currently this only pertains to Taiwan but may change if Japan exports Shinkansen to other nations br Shinkansen column does not include Shinkansen knock down kits made in Japan exported to China for assembly or any derivative system thereof in China br Asia other column refers to sum of riderships of all HSR systems geographically in Asia that do not use Shinkansen this data excludes Russia and Turkey which geographically have parts in Asia but for sake of convenience included in Europe column br For Japan s Ministry of Transport has not updated data nor is summed European data available even data is very rough however Taiwan ridership is million and Korea with million and China with million in br Cumulative ridership since October is over billion passengers for the Tokaido Shinkansen Line alone and billion passengers for Japan s entire shinkansen network Nevertheless China s share is increasing fast as close to billion passengers in that nation have been served by the end of and is projected to pass Japan s cumulative numbers by as early as br br br Future br br br Speed increases br br br T hoku Shinkansen br E series trains capable of up to km h mph initially limited to km h mph were introduced on the T hoku Shinkansen in March Operation at the maximum speed of km h mph between Utsunomiya and Morioka on this route commenced on March It reduced the journey time to around hours for trains from Tokyo to Shin Aomori a distance of km mi br Extensive trials using the Fastech test trains have shown that operation at km h mph is not currently feasible because of problems of noise pollution particularly tunnel boom overhead wire wear and braking distances On October JR East announced that it was pursuing research and development to increase speeds to km h mph on the Tohoku Shinkansen by The ALFA X is currently undergoing testing br br br Hokkaido Shinkansen br Upon commencement of services in the maximum speed on the approximately km mi dual gauge section of the Hokkaido Shinkansen including through the Seikan Tunnel was km h mph which was increased to km h mph by March There are approximately freight trains using the dual gauge section each day so limiting the travel of such trains to times outside of Shinkansen services is not an option Because of this and other weather related factors cited by JR East and JR Hokkaido the fastest journey time between Tokyo and Shin Hakodate Hokuto is currently hours minutes br During the New Year Holiday period certain Shinkansen services were operated at km h mph on the dual gauge section and was proposed again for the Golden Week Holiday period from May due to fewer freight trains operating br To achieve the full benefit of Shinkansen trains travelling on the dual gauge section at km h mph the maximum speed proposed through the tunnel alternatives are being considered such as a system to automatically slow Shinkansen trains to km h mph when passing narrow gauge trains and or loading freight trains onto special Train on Train standard gauge trains akin to a covered piggyback flatcar train built to withstand the shock wave of oncoming Shinkansen trains traveling at full speed This would enable a travel time from Tokyo to Shin Hakodate Hokuto of hours and minutes a saving of minutes on the current timetable br br br Hokuriku extension br br The Hokuriku Shinkansen was extended from Kanazawa to Tsuruga on March br There are further plans to extend the line from Tsuruga to Osaka with the Obama Kyoto route chosen by the government on December after a government committee investigated the five nominated routes br Construction of the extension beyond Tsuruga is not expected to commence before with a projected year construction period On March the government committee announced the chosen route from Kyoto to Shin Osaka is to be via Kyotanabe with a station at Matsuiyamate on the Katamachi Line br br br Abandoned interim Gauge Change plans br To extend the benefits of the Hokuriku Shinkansen to stations west of Tsuruga before the line to Osaka is completed JR West was working in partnership with Talgo on the development of a Gauge Change Train CGT capable of operating under both the kV AC electrification used on the Shinkansen and the kV DC system employed on conventional lines A trial of the proposed bogie was undertaken on a purpose built m ft gauge changer at Tsuruga but it was unsuccessful and the plans were abandoned br br br Tohoku extension Hokkaido Shinkansen br The Hokkaido Shinkansen forms an extension of the Tohoku Shinkansen north of Shin Aomori to Shin Hakodate Hokuto Station north of the Hokkaido city of Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel which was converted to dual gauge as part of the project opening in March br JR Hokkaido is extending the Hokkaido Shinkansen from Shin Hakodate Hokuto to Sapporo to open by March with tunnelling work on the km mi Murayama tunnel situated about km mi north of Shin Hakodate Hokuto Station commencing in March and due to be completed by March The km mi extension will be approximately in tunnels including major tunnels such as Oshima km mi Teine km mi and Shiribeshi km mi br Although an extension from Sapporo to Asahikawa was included in the list of planned lines at this time it is unknown whether the Hokkaido Shinkansen will be extended beyond Sapporo br br br Nishi Kyushu Shinkansen br br JR Kyushu opened the Nishi Kyushu Shinkansen from Takeo Onsen to Nagasaki built to full Shinkansen standard on September with the existing narrow gauge section between Shin Tosu and Takeo Onsen proposed to be upgraded as part of this project br This proposal initially involved introducing Gauge Change Trains GCT travelling from Hakata to Shin Tosu km mi on the existing Kyushu Shinkansen line then passing through a specific gauge changing standard to narrow section of track linking to the existing Nagasaki Main Line along which it would travel to Hizen Yamaguchi km mi then onto the Sasebo Line to Takeo Onsen km mi where another gauge changing section narrow to standard would lead onto the final Shinkansen line to Nagasaki km mi However significant technical issues with the axles of the GCT resulted in its cancellation br On October JR Kyushu announced it would utilize a car version of the N S for the isolated Shinkansen section from Nagasaki with cross platform change to a relay service at Takeo Onsen station to connect to Hakata JR Kyushu also announced the service would continue to use the name Kamome for the Hakata Nagasaki service which has been in use since br The Shinkansen line shortens the distance between Hakata and Nagasaki by km mi and while only of the route is built to full Shinkansen standards it eliminated the slowest sections of the previous narrow gauge route br As part of the GCT proposal the current km mi section of single track between Hizen Yamaguchi and Takeo Onsen was proposed to be duplicated However due to the issues with the development of the GCT the proposal has not advanced br The initial section between Nagasaki and Takeo Onsen opened on September br br br Maglev Ch Shinkansen br Maglev trains have been undertaking test runs on the Yamanashi test track since running at speeds of over km h mph As a result of this extensive testing maglev technology is almost ready for public usage An extension of this test track from to km to mi was completed in June enabling extended high speed running trials to commence in August This section will be incorporated into the Ch Shinkansen which will eventually link Tokyo to Osaka Construction of the Shinagawa to Nagoya section began in with of the km mi route to be in tunnels Plans were approved in for the Ch Shinkansen to begin at Tokyo Station rather than Shinagawa Station as initially planned due to difficulties in securing land br The CEO of JR Central originally announced plans to have the maglev Ch Shinkansen operating from Tokyo to Nagoya by with a subsequent extension to Osaka by However as of continuing controversy over routing across the i River has prevented the start of construction in Shizuoka and there is currently no target date for opening br Following the shortest route through the Japanese Alps JR Central estimates that it will take minutes to run from Shinagawa to Nagoya The planned travel time from Shinagawa to Shin Osaka is hour minutes Currently the Tokaido Shinkansen has a minimum connection time of hours minutes br While the government has granted approval for the shortest route between Tokyo and Nagoya some prefectural governments particularly Nagano lobbied to have the line routed farther north to serve the city of Chino and either Ina or Kiso Fukushima However that would increase both the travel time from Tokyo to Nagoya and the cost of construction JR Central has confirmed it will construct the line through Kanagawa Prefecture and terminate at Tokyo Station br The route for the Nagoya to Osaka section is also contested It is planned to go via Nara about km mi south of Kyoto Kyoto is lobbying to have the route moved north and be largely aligned with the existing Tokaido Shinkansen which services Kyoto and not Nara br br br Mini Shinkansen br Mini shinkansen is the name given to the routes where former narrow gauge lines have been converted to standard gauge to allow Shinkansen trains to travel to cities without the expense of constructing full Shinkansen standard lines br Two mini shinkansen routes have been constructed the Yamagata Shinkansen and Akita Shinkansen Shinkansen services to these lines traverse the Tohoku Shinkansen line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines On both the Yamagata Shinjo and Akita lines the narrow gauge lines were regauged resulting in the local services being operated by standard gauge versions of mm ft in suburban interurban rolling stock On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita one of the two narrow gauge lines was regauged and a section of the remaining narrow gauge line is dual gauge providing the opportunity for Shinkansen services to pass each other without stopping br The maximum speed on these lines is km h mph however the overall travel time to from Tokyo is improved due to the elimination of the need for passengers to change trains at Fukushima and Morioka respectively br As the Loading gauge size of the train that can travel on a line was not altered when the rail gauge was widened only Shinkansen trains specially built for these routes can travel on the lines At present they are the E and E series trains br As some of the E series on the Yamagata Shinkansen will be retiring soon they will be replaced by the new E Series Shinkansen trains from Spring with an increased speed of km h mph up from the current km h mph on the E Series trains br Whilst no further Mini shinkansen routes have been proposed to date it remains an option for providing Shinkansen services to cities on the narrow gauge network br br br Proposed Ou Base Tunnel br Construction of a Base tunnel on the Yamagata Shinkansen is proposed with JR East having undertaken a survey of a planned route from Niwasaka to Sekine just south of Yonezawa station km mi of the proposed km mi line would be in tunnel mostly to the north of the existing km mi Fukushima Yamagata section To be built on an improved alignment the tunnel would lower journey times between Fukushima and Yamagata by min due to a proposed line speed of up to km h br The tunnel would avoid the Itaya Toge pass through the Ou mountains west of Fukushima Gradients range from to and the line reaches an altitude of m ft The curvature and steep grades limit train speeds to km h mph or less and the line is vulnerable to heavy rain and snowfall as well as high winds Between and a total of Yamagata mini Shinkansen services were either suspended or delayed and of these incidents occurred on the line over the Itaya Toge pass br If the billion base tunnel is authorised detailed design would take five years and construction another years The cost could increase by billion if the tunnel were to be built with a cross section large enough to permit the line to be upgraded to the full Shinkansen loading gauge br br br Gauge Change Train br br This is the name for the concept of using a single train that is specially designed to travel on both mm ft in narrow gauge railway lines and the mm ft in standard gauge used by Shinkansen train services in Japan The trucks bogies of the Gauge Change Train GCT allow the wheels to be unlocked from the axles narrowed or widened as necessary and then relocked This allows a GCT to traverse both standard gauge and narrow gauge tracks without the expense of regauging lines br Three test trains have been constructed with the second set having completed reliability trials on the Yosan Line east of Matsuyama in Shikoku in September The third set was undertaking gauge changing trials at Shin Yatsushiro Station on Kyushu commencing in for a proposed three year period however testing was suspended in December after accumulating approximating km mi following the discovery of defective thrust bearing oil seals on the bogies The train was being trialled between Kumamoto travelling on the narrow gauge line to Shin Yatsushiro where a gauge changer has been installed so the GCT could then be trialled on the Shinkansen line to Kagoshima It was anticipated the train would travel approximately km mi over the three year trial br A new full standard Shinkansen line is under construction from Takeo Onsen to Nagasaki with the Shin Tosu Takeo Onsen section of the Nishi Kyushu Shinkansen to remain narrow gauge GCTs were proposed to provide the Shinkansen service from the line s scheduled opening in fiscal however with the GCT now being cancelled JR Kyushu has announced it will provide an interim relay service br br br Competition with air br Compared with air transport the Shinkansen has several advantages including scheduling frequency and flexibility punctual operation comfortable seats lower carbon emissions and convenient city centre terminals br Shinkansen fares are generally competitive with domestic air fares From a speed and convenience perspective the Shinkansen s market share has surpassed that of air travel for journeys of less than km mi while air and rail remain highly competitive with each other in the km mi range and air has a higher market share for journeys of more than km mi br During snowy weather the Shinkansen is known to face fewer delays compared to air travel due to snow One study done in concluded that the Tohoku Shinkansen between Tokyo and Aomori had substantially fewer days with delays longer than minutes compared to air travel br br Tokyo Nagoya km mi Tokyo Sendai km mi Tokyo Hanamaki Morioka km mi Tokyo Niigata km mi There were air services between these cities but they were withdrawn after Shinkansen services started Shinkansen runs between these cities in about two hours or less br Tokyo Osaka km mi Shinkansen is dominant because of fast hours minutes and frequent service up to every minutes by Nozomi however air travel has a certain share br Tokyo Okayama km mi Tokyo Hiroshima km mi Shinkansen is reported to have increased its market share from to over the last decade The Shinkansen takes about three to four hours and there are Nozomi trains every minutes but airlines may provide cheaper fares attracting price conscious passengers br Tokyo Fukuoka km mi The Shinkansen takes about five hours on the fastest Nozomi and discount carriers have made air travel far cheaper so most people choose air Additionally unlike many cities there is very little convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as Fukuoka Airport is located near the central Tenjin district and Fukuoka City Subway Line connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and Haneda Airport is similarly conveniently located br Osaka Fukuoka km mi One of the most competitive sections The Shinkansen takes about two and a half hours by Nozomi or Mizuho and the JR West Hikari Rail Star or JR West JR Kyushu Sakura trains operate twice an hour taking about hours and minutes between the two cities Again the location of the airports involved helps with the popularity of air travel br Tokyo Aomori km mi The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is hours JAL is reported to have reduced the size of planes servicing this route since the Shinkansen extension opened in br Tokyo Hokuriku km mi The fastest Shinkansen service between these areas is hours ANA is reported to have reduced the number of services from Tokyo to Kanazawa and Toyama from to per day since the Shinkansen extension opened in The share of passengers travelling this route by air is reported to have dropped from to in the same period br br br Outside Japan br br Railways using Shinkansen technology are not limited
