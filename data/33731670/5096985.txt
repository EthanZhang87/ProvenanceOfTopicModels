The Wii Remote also known colloquially as the Wiimote is the primary game controller for Nintendo s Wii home video game console An essential capability of the Wii Remote is its motion sensing capability which allows the user to interact with and manipulate items on screen via motion sensing gesture recognition and pointing using an accelerometer and optical sensor technology It is expandable by adding attachments The attachment bundled with the Wii console is the Nunchuk which complements the Wii Remote by providing functions similar to those in gamepad controllers Some other attachments include the Classic Controller Wii Zapper and the Wii Wheel which was originally released with the racing game Mario Kart Wii br The controller was revealed at the Tokyo Game Show on September with the name Wii Remote announced April The finalized version of the controller was later shown at E It received much attention due to its unique features not supported by other gaming controllers br The Wii s successor console the Wii U supports the Wii Remote and its peripherals in games where use of the features of the Wii U GamePad is not mandated The Wii U s successor the Nintendo Switch features a follow up named Joy Con br br br History br Development of a motion enabled controller began when development of the Wii console started in In that year Nintendo licensed a number of motion sensing patents from Gyration Inc a company that produces wireless motion sensing computer mice Gyration had previously pitched their idea and patents of a motion controller to Sony and Microsoft who both declined Nintendo then commissioned Gyration to create a one handed controller for it which eventually became the Gyropod a more traditional gamepad which allowed its right half to break away for motion control At this point Gyration brought in a separate design firm Bridge Design to help pitch its concept to Nintendo Under requirement to roughly preserve the existing GameCube button layout it experimented with different forms through sketches models and interviewing various hardcore gamers By late early however Nintendo had come up with the Wii Remote s less traditional wand shape and the design of the Nunchuk attachment Nintendo had also decided upon using a motion sensor infrared pointer and the layout of the buttons and by the end of the controller was ready for mass production br During development of the Wii Remote video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto brought in mobile phones and controllers for automotive navigation systems for inspiration eventually producing a prototype that resembled a cell phone Another design featured both an analog stick and a touchscreen but Nintendo rejected the idea of a touchscreen on the controller since the portable console and living room console would have been exactly the same Coincidentally this idea would later be implemented on the Wii U s GamePad controller as well as the Nintendo Switch br Sources also indicate that the Wii Remote was originally in development as a controller for the GameCube rather than the Wii Video game developer Factor stated that during development of launch title Star Wars Rogue Squadron II Rogue Leader it had an early prototype of a motion sensing controller Video game journalist Matt Casamassina from gaming website IGN stated that he believed that Nintendo had planned to release the Wii Remote for the GameCube noting that Nintendo said that it hoped that GCN could enjoy a longer life cycle with the addition of top secret peripherals that would forever enhance the gameplay experience He suggested that Nintendo may have wanted to release the Wii Remote with a new system instead of onto the GameCube as the Revolution addresses one of the GameCube s biggest drawbacks which is that it was is perceived as a toy Images of the GameCube prototype of the Wii Remote including the Nunchuk were found online in October when one of the prototypes was made available through an online auction br br br Counterfeit units br As the Wii gained in popularity reports surfaced of counterfeit Wii Remotes entering circulation Although these devices may provide the same functionality as official Wii Remotes the build quality is typically inferior and components such as the rumble pack and speaker are noticeably different It is also unclear whether official accessories operate correctly with counterfeit units due to the differences in internal components br br br Design br br The Wii Remote assumes a one handed remote control based design instead of the traditional gamepad controllers of previous gaming consoles This was done to make motion sensitivity more intuitive as a remote design is fitted perfectly for pointing and in part to help the console appeal to a broader audience that includes non gamers The body of the Wii Remote is mm in long mm in wide and mm in thick The Wii Remote model number is RVL a reference to the project code name Revolution The controller communicates wirelessly with the console via short range Bluetooth radio with which it is possible to operate up to four controllers at a distance of up to metres ft from the console The Wii Remote communicates with the Sensor Bar by infrared providing pointing functionality over a distance of up to five metres ft from Wii Remote to Sensor Bar The controller can be used in either hand it can also be turned horizontally and used like a Famicom NES controller or in some cases including Excite Truck Sonic and the Secret Rings Mario Kart Wii and Sonic Sega All Stars Racing a steering wheel It is also possible to play a single player game with a Wii Remote in each hand as in the Shooting Range game contained in Wii Play br At E a few minor changes were made to the controller from the design presented at the Game Developer s Conference The controller was made slightly longer and a speaker was added to the face beneath the center row of buttons The B button became more curved resembling a trigger The Start and Select buttons were changed to plus and minus and the b and a buttons were changed to and to differentiate them from the A and B buttons while also evoking the keypad of typical television remotes Also the symbol on the Home button was changed from a blue dot to a shape resembling a home house the shape of Power was made circular rather than rectangular and the blue LEDs indicating player number are now labeled using to small raised dots instead of numbers to resembling the dots used to mark the four controller ports of the GameCube console The Nintendo logo at the bottom of the controller face was replaced with the Wii logo Also the expansion port was redesigned with expansion plugs featuring a smaller snap on design The Wii Remote had the capability of turning the main console s power on or off remotely with a power button further reinforcing the impression that it looks like a television remote br The blue LEDs also indicate the battery s state on pressing any button other than the power button while the controller is not being used to play games four LEDs flash to indicate full battery three for two for and one for life remaining br Similarities have been noted between the Wii Remote and an early Dreamcast controller prototype br In the Red Steel trailer shown at E the Wii Remote had a smaller circular shaped image sensor instead of the larger opaque IR filters shown on other versions In the initial teaser video that revealed the controller at Tokyo Game Show the and buttons were labeled X and Y br br br Strap br br The Wii Remote has a wrist strap attached to the bottom to prevent it from flying away during game action if not held securely The wrist strap is tied with a cow hitch knot Every Wii game contains safety warnings concerning wrist strap use during its startup sequence and also at or near the beginning of its instruction booklet even if the game does not use motion controls The latter is a word for word reproduction of a standard wrist strap warning notice established by Nintendo The wrist strap is also used to restrain the Nunchuk s connector by its hook safely slowing any sudden movement of the Nunchuk s cord if the connector is forcibly disconnected In spite of widespread wrist strap safety notices there are certain Wii games in whole or part that are played by moving the Wii Remote in such a way that would be hindered by a wrist strap such as Let s Tap most House Party games in Wii Party and the Treasure Twirl game in Wii Play Motion In such games or game modes on screen prompts as well as instruction booklet text will specifically state that they must be played without the wrist strap br Video game web site IGN reported that the strap tends to break under heavy use which would potentially send the Wii Remote flying WarioWare Smooth Moves also sometimes requires the Wii Remote to be dropped which would cause problems in the event of a strap failure In response Nintendo has posted guidelines on proper use of the strap and the Wii Remote On December units with thicker straps began to appear in some areas of the world On December Nintendo denied reports of a Wii wrist strap recall While Nintendo denied claims that three million straps had been recalled it replaced broken wrist straps free of charge The U S Consumer Product Safety Commission became involved in the replacement program The old mm in diameter strap is replaced by a larger mm in diameter version Nintendo s online Wrist Strap Replacement Request Form allows owners to receive up to four free straps when a Wii serial number and shipping details are provided br On August a new wrist strap was found to be supplied with a lock clip instead of a movable slide to prevent the strap from working loose during prolonged play the lock clip strap became the standard form br In with the launch of the Wii U the wrist strap was once again updated to allow users to push the sync button through the new jackets and battery covers br br br Jacket br br Nintendo announced a free accessory for the Wii Remote the Wii Remote Jacket on October The removable silicone sleeve wraps around the Wii Remote to provide a better grip and cushioning to protect the Wii Remote if dropped Nintendo started including the jacket with the controller on October The safety jacket included with every Wii Remote is usually translucent However for black Wii Remotes and red Wii Remote Plus controllers the safety jacket would be of the same color br The original Wii MotionPlus accessory also comes with a built in safety jacket that is unsafe to remove according to Nintendo br br br Colors br At the E trade show Nintendo displayed white black and blue controllers press images released for the event featured white red silver lime green and black versions The Wii console and controllers launched in only white versions with Shigeru Miyamoto commenting that new hues would be provided when supplies became available br On June Nintendo revealed that it would release black versions of the Wii Wii Remote Nunchuk and Classic Controller PRO in Japan on August Each black Wii Remote includes a matching solid black Wii Remote Jacket In addition Club Nintendo in Japan held a contest between June and August wherein members who purchased and registered a copy of Wii Sports Resort would be entered into a draw to win one of blue controller sets Each set included a Wii Remote Wii MotionPlus and Nunchuk all in a sky blue color referred to as Mizuiro and distinct from other blue Wii Remotes br For North America Nintendo announced on September that black versions of the Wii Remote Wii MotionPlus and Nunchuk would be released during the holiday season On November the black Wii Remote and Wii MotionPlus was released as a bundle and the black Nunchuk was released as a standalone purchase br Blue and pink Wii Remotes were released in Japan on December In North America the blue and pink Wii Remotes were released February in a bundle with a standard white Wii MotionPlus br In Australia the black blue and pink versions of the Wii Remotes were released on February In addition the black Nunchuk and black Wii MotionPlus were also released on that day as well br When Nintendo released the Wii Remote Plus in late which featured built in Wii MotionPlus technology it would initially be available in the same four standard Wii Remote colors plus a special red variant that was included with red Wii consoles manufactured to celebrate the th anniversary of the Mario series In the years that followed Nintendo released more Wii Remote Plus color schemes based on its first party game franchises br br br Home Menu br Accessed with the Wii Remote s Home button the Home Menu displays information about the controller s currently being used and allows the user to configure certain options At the bottom of the menu screen the battery life of all connected controllers is displayed Below that is a bar labeled Wii Remote Settings Selecting it brings users to an options screen where they can control the audio output volume rumble settings and reconnect the controllers for example to connect Wii Remotes through one time synchronization Depending on when the Home Menu is accessed a different number of buttons are displayed br Wii Menu No matter when the menu is accessed the Wii Menu button will always be present Selecting this will exit a game or a Wii Menu channel and return the player to the Wii Menu where users can choose another channel When playing certain Virtual Console titles with the exception of the Nintendo and Neo Geo this will also create a suspend point br Reset In applications and games both retail and downloadable the Reset button is available This performs a soft reset of that particular application for example returning a game to its title screen or the loading screen of a Wii Menu channel the same as what would happen if the player were to press the console s physical reset button br Operations Guide On Wii Menu channels including the News Channel Forecast Channel Internet Channel Everybody Votes Channel certain WiiWare titles and Virtual Console titles the Operations Guide button appeared on the Home Menu The guide accessed acts as an instruction manual for the game being played br The Home Menu can be compared to the Xbox s in game menu accessed by pressing the Xbox button or the PlayStation s mid game XMB It may be accessed under most circumstances during Wii operation which pauses the on screen action Otherwise a home symbol with a no symbol on it appears onscreen It is also inaccessible during Nintendo GameCube play as the Wii Remote cannot control Nintendo GameCube software br br br Features br br br Sensing br br The Wii Remote has the ability to sense acceleration along three axes through the use of Analog Devices MEMS based three dimensional accelerometers br The Wii Remote also has a PixArt optical sensor that allows it to determine where it is pointing Unlike a light gun that senses light from a television screen the Wii Remote senses light from the console s Sensor Bar RVL which allows consistent usage not influenced by the screen used The Sensor Bar is about cm in long and has ten infrared LEDs five at each end of the bar The LEDs farthest from the center are pointed slightly outwards the LEDs closest to the center are pointed slightly inwards while the rest are pointed straight forward The Sensor Bar s cable is cm ft in in length The bar may be placed above or below the television centered horizontally in line with the front of the television or the front of the surface the television is placed on The Remote should be pointed approximately towards the Sensor Bar precise pointing is not necessary so long as it is within the limited viewing angle of the Wii Remote br Use of the Sensor Bar allows the Wii Remote to be used as an accurate pointing device up to meters approx ft away from the bar The Wii Remote s image sensor is used to locate the Sensor Bar s points of light in the Wii Remote s field of view The light emitted from each end of the Sensor Bar is focused onto the image sensor which sees the light as two bright dots separated by a distance mi on the image sensor The second distance m between the two clusters of light emitters in the Sensor Bar is a fixed distance From these two distances m and mi the Wii CPU calculates the distance between the Wii Remote and the Sensor Bar using triangulation Rotation of the Wii Remote with respect to the ground can also be calculated from the relative angle of the two dots of light on the image sensor Games can be programmed to sense whether the image sensor is covered which is demonstrated in a microgame featured in launch title WarioWare Smooth Moves where if the player does not uncover the sensor the champagne bottle that the remote represents will not open br The Sensor Bar is required when the Wii Remote is controlling up down left right motion of a cursor or reticle on the TV screen to point to menu options or objects such as enemies in first person shooters Some Wii games that depend on infrared pointing such as The Conduit and The House of the Dead Return allow the player to calibrate the Wii Remote s pointer in game Because the Sensor Bar allows the Wii Remote to calculate the distance between the Wii Remote and the Sensor Bar the Wii Remote can also control slow forward backward motion of an object in a dimensional game Rapid forward backward motion such as punching in a boxing game is controlled by the acceleration sensors Using these acceleration sensors acting as tilt sensors the Wii Remote can also control rotation of a cursor or other objects br The use of an infrared sensor to detect position can cause some detection problems in the presence of other infrared sources such as incandescent light bulbs or candles This can be alleviated by using fluorescent or LED lights which emit little to no infrared light around the Wii Innovative users have used other sources of IR light such as a pair of flashlights or a pair of candles as Sensor Bar substitutes The Wii Remote picks up traces of heat from the sensor then transmits it to the Wii console to control the pointer on your screen Such substitutes for the Sensor Bar illustrate the fact that a pair of non moving lights provide continuous calibration of the direction that the Wii Remote is pointing and its physical location relative to the light sources There is no way to calibrate the position of the cursor relative to where the user is pointing the controller without the two stable reference sources of light provided by the Sensor Bar or substitutes Third party wireless sensor bars have also been released which have been popular with users of Wii emulators since the official Sensor Bar utilizes a proprietary connector to connect to the Wii console br The position and motion tracking of the Wii Remote allows the player to mimic actual game actions such as swinging a sword or aiming a gun instead of simply pressing buttons An early marketing video showed actors miming actions such as fishing cooking drumming conducting a musical ensemble shooting a gun sword fighting and performing dental surgery br The LEDs can be seen by some digital cameras phone cameras and other devices with a wider visible spectrum than the human eye br br br Controller feedback br The Wii Remote provides basic audio and rumble vibration functionality but the Nunchuk does not At the E press conference it was revealed that the Wii Remote has its own independent speaker on the face of the unit This was demonstrated by a developer as he strung and shot a bow in The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess The sound from both the Wii Remote and television was altered as the bow shot to give the impression of the arrow traveling away from the player In addition to reproducing certain in game sound effects that reflect the on screen action the Wii Remote speaker can also function as a voice receiver through which non player characters can speak to the player with long distance telecommunication featured in games like Red Steel Real Heroes Firefighter and GoldenEye Some party games and hotseat multiplayer games also utilize the speaker to indicate changes between player turns The volume can be changed or muted with the Home button and selecting the corresponding controller icon at the bottom of the screen if the speaker is muted any sounds intended to be emitted from the speaker will come from the television in most cases The rumble feature can also be switched on or off using the Home Menu br br br Memory br The Wii Remote contains a KiB EEPROM chip of which a section of kilobytes can be read and written to by the host Part of this memory is available to store up to ten Mii avatars which can be transported to use with another Wii console but it can be used to upload Miis to the Mii Parade and keep it on the console by copying Mii to remote moving Mii to parade from console and then moving from remote to the console bytes are available for game use before the Mii data Pok mon Battle Revolution and Super Swing Golf also use this memory This function is also used in Super Smash Bros Brawl allowing the user to save controller configuration data to the Wii Remote Monster Hunter Tri also uses this function by allowing players to save their profiles to the Wii Remote Pok mon Rumble uses this section to store Pok mon Carnival Games Mini Golf and Club Penguin Game Day as well as other games use this to store the player s in game avatars The game Petz Monkey Madness allows players to transport their monkey between copies of the game br br br Power source br The Wii Remote uses two AA size alkaline batteries as a power source which can power a Wii Remote for hours using only the accelerometer functionality and hours using both accelerometer and pointer functionality In May Nintendo announced a rechargeable battery and dock accessory and various third party manufacturers market charging solutions for the controller see Wii Remote Chargers Nintendo s industrial designer Lance Barr said that the Wii Remote s expansion port is unsuitable for internal battery charging The only type of externally charged rechargeable battery supported is nickel metal hydride NiMH A F capacitor provides a temporary source of power during quick movements of the Wii Remote when connection to the batteries may be temporarily interrupted If the Wii Remote is not used for more than minutes such as when the player is using a GameCube controller it will shut off and can be re activated by pressing any button this was also the case when using a now discontinued video on demand service Games are able to determine and react to the current battery life of Wii Remotes with certain games using unique extra diegetic methods of alerting the player to low battery life br br br Wii Remote Plus br br In September rumors were circulating of a Wii Remote with Wii MotionPlus already built in after the box art for the upcoming FlingSmash revealed it to be bundled with Wii Remote Plus Nintendo initially declined to comment but later announced the device on September confirming it to be a Wii Remote with MotionPlus built in allowing players to use peripherals like the Wii Zapper and Wii Wheel and comfortably use the Wii Remote horizontally without having to remove the Wii MotionPlus attachment from the Wii Remote Wii Remote Plus competed with Microsoft Corporation s Kinect and Sony Computer Entertainment s PlayStation Move with PlayStation Eye motion controllers respectively Nintendo later announced that the remote would be available in white black blue and pink It was released in Australia on October in Europe on November in North America on November and in Japan on November br br br Other colors br br In addition to being available in the four standard Wii Remote colors specially colored Wii Remote Plus controllers themed after Nintendo s first party video game franchises were also released in the years that followed with one golden Legend of Zelda Wii Remote Plus and several others based on Mario characters A red Wii Remote Plus initially designed to celebrate the Mario series th anniversary was included in red Wii bundles released for the occasion along with a matching Nunchuk and console Wii Sports and New Super Mario Bros Wii The red Wii Remote Plus would also be bundled with European copies of Wii Play Motion which is replaced with a black one in other regions A red Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk of matching color is also included with every Wii Mini br At E it was revealed that a gold Wii Remote Plus with the Hylian Crest superimposed over its speaker would be released alongside The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword It was available as part of a bundle with Skyward Sword for a limited time A matching gold Nunchuk was also available to earn for Club Nintendo members for a limited time br In the Wii Remote Plus was reissued and branded for the Wii U the Wii s successor Another sync button on the battery cover was added allowing users to sync without removing the battery cover A year later Nintendo began releasing Wii Remote Plus controllers that are themed after Mario characters starting with Mario and Luigi on November to accompany the release of the Wii U Deluxe set A few months later Nintendo released a Princess Peach themed Wii Remote Plus on April A year later Nintendo also released Wii Remote Plus controllers themed after Bowser a Toad and Yoshi in the fall of to accompany the releases of Super Mario Maker and Yoshi s Woolly World exclusively available at GameStop br br br Expansions br br The Wii Remote has an expansion port at the bottom which allows various functional attachments to be added The connector and any accessories that attach to it use a kHz I C protocol This expandability is similar to that available with the port on the Nintendo controller There is a female connector on Wii remotes to which expansions with a male connector can be connected br The multiple kinds of controllers that can connect to the Wii Remote make it into a more versatile controller opening up new Wii controller configurations and likewise multiple control schemes Various racing games such as Mario Kart Wii and a few Need for Speed video games as well as some fighting games like Super Smash Bros Brawl Tatsunoko vs Capcom Ultimate All Stars and the Naruto Clash of Ninja Revolution trilogy take advantage of the versatility the expansion port confers to offer multiple control schemes to suit different kinds of players br br br Nunchuk br br The Nunchuk model number RVL was the first attachment Nintendo revealed for the Wii Remote at the Tokyo Game Show It connects to the Wii Remote via a cord to m to feet long Its appearance when attached resembles the nunchaku weapon hence the name It also resembles the middle handle of the Nintendo controller Like the controllers of the Wii s two predecessors the Nunchuk has an analog stick whose movement is restricted by an octagonal area The Nunchuk also has two trigger buttons a last minute modification changed the two triggers to one trigger and a C button as described below It works in tandem with the main controller in many games Like the Wii Remote the Nunchuk also provides a three axis accelerometer from STMicroelectronics for motion sensing and tilting but lacks any feedback features The presence of a motion sensor in the Nunchuk allows the Wii controller to recognize gestures from both of the player s hands independently a feature that is leveraged to implement boxing controls for Wii Sports or dual wield combat in some hack and slash games such as Prince of Persia Rival Swords Despite having fewer buttons the Nunchuk can also be used as a controller itself a feature that is leveraged by Opoona Bust A Move Bash and SpeedZone This allows two players to share a single Wii controller enabling the multiplayer modes of Bash and SpeedZone to support five to eight players across the maximum four Wii controllers that can be synced to a single console br One Nunchuk comes bundled with the Wii console Additional Wii Remote units are sold separately without the Nunchuk The two shoulder buttons formerly named Z and Z respectively have been reshaped and renamed from the Game Developers Conference on The circular top shoulder button now called C is much smaller than the lower rectangular shoulder button now called Z br The body of the Nunchuk is mm in long mm in wide and mm in thick The connection port also has a larger size br The Nunchuk can be connected to any microcontroller capable of I C e g Arduino s Atmel AVR where the accelerometer joystick and buttons data may be accessed Todbot has created the Wiichuk an adapter to facilitate connecting the Nunchuk to an Arduino board br In wireless Nunchuks became available from third party providers not requiring the cord that links the Wii Remote with the Nunchuk br The Nunchuk is generally available in white and black Sky blue Nunchuks were available in Japan as a prize for a contest used to promote Wii Sports Resort Red Nunchuks are bundled with the red Mario anniversary Wii console and Wii Mini Blue Nunchuks are bundled with the European blue Wii Family Edition consoles with the inclusion of Mario Sonic at the London Olympic Games released on November A gold Nunchuk was offered to Nintendo Club members for a limited time to complement Skyward Sword s gold Wii Remote Plus br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Classic Controller br br There are two versions of the Classic Controller the original Classic Controller and the Classic Controller Pro br At the Electronic Entertainment Expo Nintendo introduced the Classic Controller which plugs into the Wii Remote via a cord in a similar fashion to the Nunchuk Unlike most accessories the Classic Controller largely usurps the Remote s functionality with the Remote s buttons duplicated on the Controller The Remote is used primarily as a wireless transmitter for the Controller and where applicable retains its pointing device functionality It can also still be used as a valid active controller by another player in multiplayer modes of games like Bust A Move Bash and SpeedZone br br The Classic Controller is reminiscent of the Super NES controller being the same size and having the A B X Y L and R buttons and directional pad in the same location It also contains two analog sticks and two extra shoulder buttons used to replicate additional components found on the Nintendo GameCube controller The controller is primarily used for Virtual Console titles with several titles requiring either the Classic or GameCube controller to play being optimized for the Classic Controller Dozens of Wii titles are also compatible with the controller to allow for a more traditional control scheme br br br Wii MotionPlus br br The Wii MotionPlus is an expansion device that allows the Wii Remote to more accurately capture complex motion Incorporated with a custom version of the Wii Remote Jacket the Wii MotionPlus affixes directly to the Wii Remote expansion port extending the length of the controller body by approximately centimetres in The Wii MotionPlus uses a tuning fork gyroscope which supplements the accelerometer and Sensor Bar capabilities of the Wii Remote enabling controller motions to be rendered identically on the screen in real time according to Nintendo It is sold separately and also included in bundles with some MotionPlus compatible games such as Nintendo s Wii Sports Resort and Ubisoft s Red Steel Sky blue Wii MotionPlus expansions were available in Japan as a prize for a contest used to promote Wii Sports Resort Black Wii Remotes bundled with the MotionPlus add on of matching color were released in Europe and North America in November br br br Wii Vitality Sensor br The Wii Vitality Sensor was a cancelled peripheral a fingertip pulse oximeter sensor that connected through the Wii Remote According to Nintendo the device will initially sense the user s pulse and a number of other signals being transmitted by their bodies and will then provide information to the users about the body s inner world The Wii Vitality Sensor was announced by President and CEO Satoru Iwata at Nintendo s E media briefing on June No specific applications were revealed for the device but when presenting the device Iwata suggested that video games may soon be used for relaxation According to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aime more details concerning the Wii Vitality Sensor were to be revealed during E although in the event the device was not mentioned Reggie told GameTrailers E was not the kind of environment for a game based on relaxation and said that they were saving news on the device for another time and place At E Ubisoft introduced their own pulse oximeter sensor Innergy At E Nintendo announced more about the Wii Vitality Sensor Shigeru Miyamoto said that the Wii Vitality Sensor has a difficult time performing consistently across a variety of situations but still may be released br On July Satoru Iwata disclosed that the Wii Vitality Sensor project had been cancelled due to its lack of widespread compatibility with Nintendo finding that the device failed to work with approximately of people it was tested on noting that the device was of narrower application than we had originally thought Iwata also mentioned the possibility of returning to the project in the future when the technology allows for at least a success rate br br br Accessories br br br Wii Zapper br br The Wii Zapper is a gun shaped shell accessory for the Wii Remote As shown in the image the shell holds both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk and contains a trigger that actuates the Wii Remote s B button all other buttons are still accessible while the remote and Nunchuk are in the shell The name is a reference to the NES Zapper light gun for the Nintendo Entertainment System According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto the idea of a Zapper type expansion formed when the Wii Remote was first created He expressed that What we found is that the reason we wanted to have a Zapper is when you hold a Wii Remote it can be difficult for some people to keep a steady hand And holding your arm out like that can get your arm somewhat tired The Zapper is useful for most games primarily involving firearms such as light gun shooters first person shooters and third person shooters br br br Wii Wheel br br The Wii Wheel accessory is designed for use in driving games it is a steering wheel shaped shell that a Wii Remote can be placed inside enhancing driving games that allow for steering control by tilting the Wii Remote left and right The Wii Wheel was first shipped alongside Mario Kart Wii and features prominently on the game s packaging br br br Third party accessories br br Since the release of the Wii console many aesthetic ergonomic and functional accessories have been developed for the Wii Remote by third parties br br br Third party development br br Since the release of the Wii console people have been exploring different new ways in which to use the Wii Remote Many third party applications are currently in development through Wii homebrew One popular Windows program called GlovePIE allows the Wii Remote to be used on a personal computer to emulate a keyboard mouse or joystick Connecting the Wii Remote to a personal computer is done via a Bluetooth connection The Bluetooth program BlueSoleil has been proven to successfully connect a Wii Remote to a PC Still another program like GlovePIE is needed to utilize the Wii Remote s protocol and to use the data it offers br The Wii Remote Bluetooth protocol can be implemented on other devices including cell phones which often have poor usability with games Two students have demonstrated this concept by creating driver software that has the capability to connect the Wii Remote to a Symbian smartphone The idea behind this driver is that a mobile phone with a TV out port can replace the game console br Programmer Johnny Lee posted video demos and sample code at his website related to the use of the Wii Remote for finger tracking low cost multipoint interactive whiteboards and head tracking for desktop VR displays He demonstrated several such applications at a TED conference The WiimoteProject forum became the discussion support and sharing site for Lee s Wii Remote projects and other newer developments br br Studies have been conducted to use the Wii Remote as a practice method to fine tune surgeons hand motions Utilizing DarwiinRemote researchers at the University of Memphis adapted the Wii Remote for data collection in cognitive psychology experiments Autodesk released a plugin that allows the Wii Remote to control orientation of D models in Autodesk Design Review br br br Reception br Overall reception to the Wii Remote has changed over time The control styles which are provided by the controller were met with praise at its first public exhibition at E Since then comments have been noted by the press on its functionality Matt Wales of IGN UK highlighted the aiming and precision of Red Steel and stated Taking down swathes of enemies with nothing more than a twitch of the wrist proves immensely satisfying and more importantly incredibly involving Nintendo Power listed the Wii Remote as an innovative controller citing it as innovative for several firsts including the first use of motion control the first built in speaker and the first Infrared Pointer This is incorrect however the first video game controller to make use of motion sensitivity was Le Stick for the Atari and Commodore manufactured by Datasoft Inc and released in br Other publications have noted specific complaints regarding control GameSpot expressed that some motions in Cooking Mama Cook Off failed to transmit or meet expectation during gameplay Similar observations were made on other titles made available during the Wii launch period ComputerAndVideoGames com reported that Most prominent is the first batch of games many of which do a better job at exposing the obstacles of full motion control rather than the benefits Need For Speed Carbon is near unplayable Far Cry got it all wrong and the motion control in Marvel Ultimate Alliance just feels tacked on br The overall situation was described by Joystiq thus Over the months since launch the unpredictable Wii Remote has led to a maddening dichotomy Some games are too easy while others are too hard for all the wrong reasons Gamers who crave a deeper challenge have to settle for battling incomprehensible controls Critics felt that fault was largely attributed to the developers lack of experience with the Wii Remote Jeremy Parish of the magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly compared the initial phase of control implementation to that of the Nintendo DS Matt Casamassina of IGN also presumed that the first generation of Wii games were of an experimental stage and that potential for refinement had yet to be exploited br Later released titles saw mixed reactions in terms of control Of Tiger Woods PGA Tour from Electronic Arts Matthew Kato of Game Informer stated that the controller has a hard time detecting your backswing Thus it s harder to control There were even times the game putted for me by accident A GamePro review for Medal of Honor Vanguard said that the title is an encouraging sign that developers are finally starting to work out the kinks and quirks of the Wii Remote br First and second party video games produced more favorable utilization of the Wii Remote s unique capabilities Metroid Prime Corruption in particular was nearly universally praised for its unique control scheme which was seen as being unrivaled by any other console game Corruption utilizes the Nunchuk for strafing and the infrared pointing capability of the Wii Remote for turning and special gestures which are used to select visors Other Nintendo titles take a more minimalist approach using mostly the pointer and buttons only as with Big Brain Academy Wii Degree or use the controller in a sideways configuration to resemble a Nintendo Entertainment System controller while the player de emphasizes more advanced capabilities as used in Super Paper Mario br The Wii Remote and Nunchuk combined sold over million units in the United States and took the top two spots in video game accessories sales in In the United States the Nunchuk was the best selling video game hardware for January with units sold in a month where the Wii was the best selling console with units sold br According to Nintendo s Shinya Takahashi player feedback for the Wii Remote particularly on reducing its form factor led into the development of the Nintendo Switch a console small enough and with smaller controllers to also be used as a portable unit br br br Legal issues br The Wii Remote has come under a number of lawsuits from several different companies br Interlink Electronics filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Nintendo in December over the pointing functionality of the Wii Remote claiming loss of reasonable royalties reduced sales and or lost profits as a result of the infringing activities of Nintendo The lawsuit was terminated in March br On August Hillcrest Laboratories Inc filed a complaint against Nintendo with the U S International Trade Commission alleging that the Wii Remote infringed on three of its patents A fourth Hillcrest patent for graphical interfaces displayed on television screens was also allegedly violated Hillcrest sought a ban on Wii consoles imported to the U S On August Nintendo and Hillcrest reached a settlement although the terms were not publicly disclosed br In September ThinkOptics Inc filed a lawsuit against Nintendo in United States District Court of the Eastern District of Texas over their controller the Wavit Remote claiming that the Wii violated its patent for a handheld vision based absolute pointing system a Handheld Device for Handheld Vision Based Absolute Pointing System and a Handheld Vision Based Absolute Pointing System which make up the basis for the Wavit Remote They also said that the Wii U infringes on their patents as well and claims that Nintendo was aware of the fact that the Wii allegedly violates ThinkOptics patents The lawsuit sought an injunction against violating products royalties attorney s fees and damages for lost profits The lawsuit was dismissed by ThinkOptics in August br Starting in December iLife Technologies sued several large companies over patent infringement over a set of patents they held related to systems and methods for

class action lawsuit against Nintendo for its defective wrist straps A few days later Nintendo issued a product recall for the wrist straps and issued a new version of the strap with an improved securing mechanism for the wrist leading to the lawsuit to be dropped sometime thereafter br A second class action lawsuit was filed by a mother in Colorado in December claiming the updated wrist

issues br In the term Weemote was trademarked by Miami based TV remote manufacturer Fobis Technologies and was later used as the name of their remote designed for young children While spelled differently the term Weemote is phonetically identical to Wiimote the unofficial term for the Wii Remote Sales of the Weemote which totaled less than one million as of had fallen due to confusion with the Wiimote Fobis Technologies claims this to be trademark infringement however Nintendo does not actually use the term Wiimote in official promotional materials but many retailers that sell the Wii Remote do use the term Fobis sent out up to cease and desist letters to retailers and have made offers to Nintendo for them to purchase the trademark Nintendo declined the offer stating that it does not use and does not plan to use the Weemote trademark br The trademark application for the Wii Remote was initially rejected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office after the trademark was filed in March The USPTO claimed that the word remote is commonly used and therefore should not be trademarked The USPTO said they would accept Nintendo s trademark filing if the company disclaims exclusive rights to the word remote in the term and if the word Wii would always precede the word remote in marketing and manuals The USPTO accepted the Wii Remote trademark in July br br br See also
