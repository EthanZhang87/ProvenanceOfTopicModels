F Zero is a series of futuristic racing games published by Nintendo developed by Nintendo EAD and other third party companies The first game was released for the Super Famicom in Japan in Its success prompted Nintendo to create sequels on subsequent consoles br The series is known for its high speed racing characters and settings difficult gameplay and original music as well as for pushing technological limits to be one of the fastest racing games The original game inspired games such as Daytona USA and the Wipeout series br The series has been largely dormant since the release of F Zero Climax in in Japan although elements have been represented in other Nintendo video games most notably the Super Smash Bros and Mario Kart franchises Past installments have been emulated across multiple Nintendo consoles with the Virtual Console service The original F Zero is one of the selected games emulated on the Super NES Classic Edition F Zero was one of the launch games for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo Switch Online collection released on September After over years of absence a battle royale based on the original game called F Zero was released for the Nintendo Switch exclusively for Nintendo Switch Online members br br br Gameplay br Each of the games in F Zero series requires the player to beat opponents to the finish line while avoiding obstacles such as land mines and slip zones The games usually require a mixture of memorization of the tracks and quick reflexes for its fast paced racing gameplay In F Zero and F Zero Maximum Velocity a speed boost is given to the player for each lap completed Starting with F Zero X players may execute speed boosts if they have finished at least one lap but now in exchange for losing energy when boosting It is therefore necessary to use recharge strips around courses to replenish this energy or risk exploding when it drops to zero Strategically situated dash plates allow boosts without energy loss In combination with course obstacles drivers are allowed to attack each other with their vehicle bodies br The games planets include different climates and terrains and are home to many different races and tribes of aliens There are geographical differences from game to game but distinctive locations recur such as Big Blue Mute City and Port Town Circuits are usually set on the outskirts of cities or above them situated high in planet atmospheres at an elevation as much as feet m above ground They contain anti gravitational guide beams on both sides of the course that keep them in place Rich merchants from cities in the clouds or asteroids with almost uninhabitable environments invested their wealth in the construction of racing circuits Some cities have multiple circuits circuits not used for the Grand Prix are open to pilots for practice The dynamic structure of the courses are colossal in scale as most circuits feature a single lap that spans over six miles km br The vehicles used to race in these video games are known as F Zero machines which are designed to hover instead of travel on wheels An anti gravity unit known as the G Diffuser System first used by the Star Fox franchise s Arwing allows an F Zero machine to drive at high speeds while retaining a hold of the track located from a few inches to a foot below it However the slip zones also referred to as the magnetic field block coat in the first F Zero game blocks the vehicle from retaining a hold on the track The racing machines developed for these tracks used the latest in this magnetic technology and are able to perform tune ups Out of the over forty four known machines only five do not weigh over a short ton F Zero machines have a maximum speed exceeding that of sound This is possible due to the ultra compact micro plasma engines used by the machines br Each machine has four basic performance attributes body boost grip and weight Body boost and grip are rated on a scale from A to E A being the best E the worst The higher a machine s Body rating the more durable it is and the less damage it will sustain in a collision Machines with a good Body rating are therefore able to withstand more attacks before exploding The Boost rating takes into account the duration of a vehicle s boost and how great a speed increase it provides A machine with a high rating can travel at higher than normal speeds for a longer period of time Grip determines how well a machine negotiates turns A higher Grip rating means that the player s vehicle will execute steadier turns while a low one will cause the vehicle to drift more especially when turning tightly Weight affects a vehicle s acceleration grip cornering ability maximum speed and the amount of damage it sustains in a collision A lighter vehicle is superior in the first three categories while a heavier vehicle has the advantage in the latter two br br br Plot br While there were originally four F Zero pilots in the first game this has grown with each game to more than characters in the later games of the series Each character has their own unique vehicle story and reason for entering the F Zero Grand Prix but the most well known character is Captain Falcon The winner of the Grand Prix receives a huge sum of prize money but many pilots have been lost pursuing it br The F Zero games are derived from the th and st century Formula One races and the fictitious F Max Grand Prix races from the th century The games portray races in the future as having come under the influence of wealthy ex space merchants They thought that a fast and violent race would be an effective way to get people to gamble so the ex merchants established the F Zero Execution Project The F Zero Grand Prix dates to the th century and is still sponsored by the wealthy elite who originally organized the Execution Project for those events These races feature the most technologically advanced racing machines competing in numerous circuits of fast paced action It is known for its wild fans and usually eccentric competitors Winners of the Grand Prix receive large sums of money as well as a great deal of prestige throughout the universe br The F Zero games are primarily set on a futuristic Earth in the th century although some games take place much earlier and some circuits have been set on different planets F Zero X defined the F Max Grand Prix as the precursor to the F Zero races which took place during the th century According to the American version of F Zero GX the greatest driver in the F Max Grand Prix was Sterling LaVaughn a statement that would lead to inconsistencies in the sequence of events of F Zero s storyline br F Zero begins in the year where the human race s countless encounters with alien life forms throughout the universe greatly expanded Earth s social framework resulting in trade technology transfer and cultural interchange are carried out on an interplanetary basis An association of wealthy space merchants created the F Zero Grand Prix in an attempt to add some excitement to their opulent lifestyles When the first race was held people were angered at the brutality of the competition due to the various obstacles and traps along the raceway As time passed however they became accustomed to these dangers and even began to demand more excitement and danger in the races Winning the F Zero championship soon became the highest claim to fame in the universe This period of time is called the old school F Zero days where the rules seemed non existent in F Zero X br F Zero X s storyline starts after the seven year suspension of Grand Prix races due to the Horrific Grand Finale The game explains the Horrific Grand Finale was a violent and fiery accident that burnt fourteen drivers to death including Sterling LaVaughn during the old days of F Zero A racer named Super Arrow escaped unscathed as the only survivor No racing was allowed by the Federation after the crash despite the F Zero racing prohibition the sport went underground where many racers went to hone their skills in secret The crash ushered in the establishment of the F Zero Racing Academy after a speech by Super Arrow to the Federation Congress which helped to lift the ban The fictional competition was brought back with the rules and regulations revised br F Zero Maximum Velocity takes place years after the original in the year Players race against the descendants of the original F Zero racers Maximum Velocity is considered a reboot continuity to the rest of the home console games since it has made no indication of the safety revisions carried forth after the huge accident in fact it states just like the original F Zero game the extreme danger involved when participating in those races br F Zero GX does not mention the Grand Finale event but instead the game states Sterling LaVaughn was racing during the F Max era and the F Zero Grand Prix was suspended four years ago This game states the character Mighty Gazelle was injured in the huge accident four years ago The Nintendo game mentions that Mighty Gazelle s accident and the accident that suspended the Grand Prix were two separate events br F Zero GP Legend is set in a different continuity and begins in the year It was continued with F Zero Climax These games feature some different incarnations of Captain Falcon Zoda and other characters br br br Development br br br SNES Super Famicom br The first game in the series originally launched for the Super NES F Zero was also the first game for the platform to use a technique that Nintendo called Mode Scrolling When Mode was combined with scaling and positioning of the layer on a scanline by scanline basis it could simulate D environments Such techniques in games were considered to be revolutionary in a time when most console games were restricted to static flat backgrounds and dimensional D objects The result was developer Nintendo EAD creating a game that IGN reviewer Craig Harris called the fastest and smoothest pseudo D console racer of its time F Zero was one of the launch games for the SNES that Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development had approximately fifteen months to develop completely In Japan only it and Super Mario World were initially available for launch In North America and Europe Super Mario World shipped with the console and other initial games included F Zero Pilotwings which also demonstrated the console s Mode pseudo D rendering capability SimCity and Gradius III br F Zero later had a sequel for the SNES that was cancelled but was released unfinished through the Japanese only Satellaview peripheral under the name BS F Zero Grand Prix in Like most Satellaview games it was released in parts across multiple broadcasts and featured an update of the first game It was followed up by BS F Zero Grand Prix in an expansion which featured brand new courses br Zero Racers G Zero was in development for the Virtual Boy in early The game was completed and had an age rating from the ESRB but never released as the console was discontinued The game was previewed by Nintendo Power and had been earmarked for launch in the United States in fall Gameplay differed from all other F Zero games as the vehicles race in all three spatial dimensions in tunnels br br br Return to international markets br After a seven year hiatus outside Japan the series made the transition to D with the third installment F Zero X on the Nintendo The game introduces twenty six new vehicles while also including the four from the original F Zero game In addition to a Grand Prix mode the game introduces a death race mode and a random track generator called the X Cup In the death race the player s objective is to annihilate the twenty nine other racers as speedily as possible while the X Cup generates a different set of tracks each time played The hardware limitations of the N resulted in the game running at frames per second with thirty machines on screen at the same time but with little processor power left for graphical detail and music br br A Nintendo DD expansion F Zero X Expansion Kit was released in Japan as the last DD add on disk for the system The Expansion Kit added a course editor a vehicle editor two new cups three new machines and new music The course editor was the main attraction of this expansion and was praised for its depth as it was virtually the same program the game s designers used to make the courses br F Zero Maximum Velocity is the series fourth released installment but the first incarnation of the franchise for Nintendo s Game Boy handheld It was the first game developed by the first party subsidiary NDcube This Game Boy Advance GBA launch game returned to the SNES F Zero s gameplay with a Mode styled game engine br F Zero GX was released for the GameCube and developed by Sega s Amusement Vision team and is the first F Zero game to feature a story mode The game was initially titled F Zero GC The arcade counterpart of GX was called F Zero AX which was released alongside of its Nintendo GameCube counterpart in mid The game had three types of arcade cabinets standard the Monster Ride and the deluxe which resembled an F Zero vehicle F Zero AX had six original courses and ten original characters However by certain difficult means the six courses and ten characters could be unlocked in F Zero GX br F Zero GP Legend is the second handheld game released for the Game Boy Advance and the second installment featuring a story mode however this one is based on the anime series of the same name introducing a new character named Ryu Suzaku Rick Wheeler Unlike the games before it GP Legend takes place in an alternate continuity set in the nd century instead of following the original continuity set in the th century br F Zero Climax was released in Japan for the Game Boy Advance on October Like its handheld predecessor F Zero GP Legend Climax was published by Nintendo and developed by both them and Suzak This is the first F Zero game to have a built in track editor without the need for an expansion or add on Custom tracks can be saved to one of thirty slots for future use and they can be exchanged with other players via link cable If memory becomes full or link cable connection cannot be done the game can generate a password for the track when it is input on any Climax cartridge the password will generate the track br br br Hiatus br Takaya Imamura who worked directly on F Zero throughout its different incarnations said in hav ing worked on the F Zero series and seeing the results of the collaboration with Sega I found myself at something of a loss as to how we can take the franchise further past F Zero GX and AX br Edge magazine asked Shigeru Miyamoto in April regarding a future F Zero installment Miyamoto stated I think at the time F Zero was a really big surprise a new thing a product that made sense and the Wii and DS lacks to create a similar impact In June news site Nintendo Life reported that in early Nintendo of Europe approached Burnout series developer Criterion Games to work on a pitch for a new F Zero game which they hoped to unveil at E that same year alongside the then unreleased Wii U console and potentially release the game during the console s launch period However the developer was unable to handle the pitch as at the time they devoted much of their resources into the development of Need for Speed Most Wanted for multiple platforms Criterion co founder Alex Ward who left the company in confirmed that Nintendo of Europe did indeed approach the company for a potential F Zero game on the Wii U br In a January video from Smosh Games Miyamoto was featured as guest star and stated that a new installment in the franchise could be possible if Nintendo were to develop a unique controller interface for one of their upcoming consoles that would be suited for a new game br Six years later the producer of F Zero GX Toshihiro Nagoshi said that he would be open to working with Nintendo on another installment if the company were given the opportunity to do so and that he would make a future F Zero game challenging for advanced players unlike the fun and accessible nature of Nintendo s Mario Kart series In July former Nintendo artist Takaya Imamura cited the massive popularity of Mario Kart as a key factor to why there hasn t been any new developments with the F Zero series br br br F Zero br F Zero was released for the Nintendo Switch on September following its announcement in a Nintendo Direct the same day The game is a battle royale remake of the original F Zero taking inspiration from Tetris and Pac Man having racers on the track at once The game is available for free on the eShop but requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to play br br br Reception br br IGN s Lucas Thomas called the design and style of Mach Rider as an influence to the F Zero series noting its sense of speed where players have only a split second to react before you crash into a rock or enemy road warrior Matt Casamassina of IGN said in that the F Zero franchise has remained regarded one of the best video game series in the racing genre br In an editor from Pro G stated F Zero GX still ranks as one of the best high speed racers ever made but the series has been lying dormant for years br The Tampa Tribune s review of GP Legend mentioned that it feels a little strange to see what was an esoteric but outstanding racing franchise attempt to go mass market br Nintendo World Report gave Climax a out of Siliconera praised the fast gameplay and track editor features but criticized it for feeling more like an expansion pack than a sequel br Shigeru Miyamoto commented in that past F Zero and Star Fox collaborations with outside development houses turned out to be a disappointment for Nintendo He stated that consumers got very excited about the idea of those games but the games themselves did not deliver br br br Legacy br br br Anime br br F Zero GP Legend is a episode animated adaptation of the video game series produced by TV Tokyo Dentsu and Ashi Productions and directed by Ami Tomobuki

Zoda and the rest of Dark Million While pursuing his objectives Ryu unexpectedly meets up with the legendary racer and bounty hunter Captain Falcon as well as several other various racers along the

Nintendo s fighting game crossover franchise Super Smash Bros where Captain Falcon has consistently appeared as a well established playable character His moveset is almost entirely original as of Super Smash Bros Brawl however Falcon makes a reference to F Zero by using the Blue Falcon as his Final Smash a powerful single use special move The Super Smash Bros franchise also features a few
