company Activision had offered an opportunity for Nintendo to be a partner in a new video game franchise known as Skylanders which would use RFID equipped character figurines and a special reader component to interact with the game itself and could store data on the figurine itself such as the corresponding character s statistics While Nintendo passed on the exclusivity deal the franchise itself quickly became one of Activision s most successful franchises upon its launch as a spin off of the Spyro the Dragon series and also resulted in competition from Disney Interactive Studios who released a game with a similar concept known as Disney Infinity in br In March Nintendo unveiled Pok mon Rumble U the first game for the Wii U to use the Wii U GamePad s near field communications support to enable the use of its own interactive figurines During an investors meeting in May Nintendo presented a prototype of a more comprehensive figurine platform for its DS and Wii U consoles

vehicles for use in Skylanders SuperChargers These toys are compatible with either the Skylanders games or Amiibo compatible games by means of a mode switch on their bases They will work across all Nintendo platform versions of Skylanders SuperChargers The Amiibo are also compatible with all Nintendo platform versions of Skylanders Imaginators br On August an Amiibo toy of the titular character from the indie video game Shovel Knight was unveiled which unlocks content exclusive to the DS and Wii U versions of the game and its future installments It is the first Amiibo toy of a non Nintendo character that is not associated with a first party title previous Amiibo toys of third party characters were associated with Super Smash Bros Additionally production and distribution of the figurine was overseen by the game s publisher Yacht Club Games rather than Nintendo except in Japan where the latter is the publisher although it is still officially marketed by Nintendo as part of the Amiibo line as a form of brand licensing Explaining the arrangement a Nintendo representative stated that we were like what s one thing that Nintendo could do that nobody else could ever do br The Amiibo line for The Legend of Zelda initially began solely with the Wolf Link figurine which is mainly used in The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess HD and later Breath of the Wild It expanded with the th Anniversary collection bit Link Ocarina of Time Link The Wind Waker Link and The Wind Waker Zelda and the Breath of the Wild collection Archer Link Rider Link Zelda Bokoblin Mipha Daruk Revali Urbosa and the Guardian figurine At E Nintendo unveiled several new Amiibo figurines including wedding themed Mario Peach and Bowser figurines which coincided with the launch of the Nintendo Switch game

released alongside the DS remake of Metroid II Metroid Samus Returns and figurines released later based around the four Champions in The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild Third party software developer Bethesda Softworks announced that existing Zelda figurines would be compatible with the Nintendo Switch port of The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim allowing players to obtain select Zelda items and clothing for their Dragonborn including the Master Sword Hylian Shield and the Champion s Tunic from Breath of the Wild br br br Collectibility and supply issues br br Upon initial launch the Amiibo line quickly spiked in popularity with preorders selling out before the products became available to the public While Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata stated that Amiibo will be kept in stock he also explained that some will be limited time offers which will cede their positions to new ones once they are sold out The rarity of certain Amiibo figurines influenced the prices held by online retailers and auctions of which most can be seen offering select items at prices above the retail price In Nintendo s rd Quarter Financial Results Briefing for the Fiscal Year Ending March Satoru Iwata expressed surprise at such online auctions that offered premium prices of sold out Amiibo toys A number of first wave Amiibo toys with manufacturing defects were discovered and sold for notably high prices such as a Samus figurine with cannons on both arms instead of one arm being sold on eBay for US and a defect of Princess Peach with missing legs being sold for US br On April when preorders were being taken for the May release of the Super Smash Bros series Wave and the Splatoon series the US preorder process crashed both GameStop s website and in store register system Nintendo acknowledged these issues in early May Amazon forwent the entire preorder process for those waves it instead blocked out specific time intervals on their release date during which the non retailer exclusive Amiibo and the Super Mario series Silver Mario Amiibo were available The retailer continued this practice with its exclusive release of the Palutena Amiibo as well as those released on September br In May in the UK a truck was stolen that contained preorders of the special edition of Splatoon which included a rare Squid Inkling Amiibo as a preorder bonus the only way to obtain the figure in the UK As a result Nintendo lacked the stock to supply the Squid Inkling Amiibo to those who preordered and offered Inkling Girl or Inkling Boy Amiibo instead alongside a standard edition with a refund or full refunds br In response to the lack of certain Amiibo toys in the United States Satoru Iwata explained on February that an ongoing labor dispute on the west coast has delayed the discharge of cargo over the past six months and was the cause of the absences of certain Amiibo toys intended to be delivered before its launch in November Following this announcement rarer Amiibo toys such as Wii Fit Trainer Meta Knight and Ike have been receiving limited re releases in North America For the US the exclusive Best Buy release of the Dark Pit figurine the retailer announced it would not take any preorders or online orders and the item would be limited to one per customer While some news sources such as Kotaku came out in favour of Best Buy s practice alternatively in response to this and the difficulty of acquiring previous retailer exclusives others such as Brian Altano Jose Otero and Peer Schneider of IGN s Nintendo Voice Chat podcast have encouraged American collectors to import these hard to find items br br br Hardware support br The Wii U New Nintendo DS New Nintendo DS XL and Nintendo Switch contain integrated NFC support and are Amiibo compatible On Wii U toys are scanned using an NFC reader contained within the Wii U GamePad Amiibo support was formally introduced to the consoles firmware between November and December these updates added an Amiibo menu to the system settings area allowing users to scan register and erase data from toys The Nintendo Switch similarly features an NFC reader in both the Joy Con R and Pro Controller br A separate NFC reader accessory allows use of Amiibo on the original Nintendo DS DS XL and DS models in Japan released in Summer and released alongside Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer in North America The New Nintendo DS New DS XL and New DS XL contain an integrated NFC reader utilizing the touch bottom screen br br br Amiibo data communication br Supported games offer one of two kinds of Amiibo compatibility the ability to access an Amiibo toy s NFC tag and store data and read only recognition Each Amiibo toy largely corresponds to a specific game that can access its storage space though some may have multiple games that can use it However each Amiibo toy can only store data from one compatible game at a time meaning data must be deleted to use it with a different title For example a Mario Amiibo figurine containing data from Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U must have the data for that game deleted to store data from Mario Party Many games offer compatibility with specific Amiibo toys on a read only basis allowing for additional content to be unlocked in that game For example using certain figurines with Mario Kart or Mario Kart Deluxe unlocks Mii costumes based on the corresponding character Multiple variations of the same character offer the same compatibility although special variations can unlock unique content with specific games Existing Wii U and DS games can receive updates for Amiibo functionality Due to their co development effort on Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U Bandai Namco Entertainment were the first third party publishers to embrace the Amiibo concept in some of their own games br br br List of Amiibo br br The following list features all known NFC items branded under Amiibo originally produced in the form of character figurines as of then cards as of and other types in the future Nintendo designed all Amiibo characters to be cross compatible with all games that support specific Amiibo characters regardless of
