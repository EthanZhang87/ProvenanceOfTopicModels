The Classic Controller Kurashikku Kontor ra is a game controller produced by Nintendo for the Wii home video game console While it later featured some compatibility with the Wii U console the controller was ultimately succeeded by the Wii U Pro Controller In April Nintendo discontinued production of both the Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro br The Classic Controller is also compatible with the NES Classic Edition and Super NES Classic Edition br br br History br When the Wii Remote was first revealed in September Nintendo announced a controller shell which resembled a traditional game controller often referred to as a classic style expansion controller As described at the time the Wii Remote would fit inside the shell allowing gamers to play games using a traditional style gamepad while allowing use of the remote s motion sensing capability According to Satoru Iwata it would be meant for playing the existing games Virtual Console games and multi platform games Early demos of the Wii s capabilities showed two players competing in what appears to be Wii Sports with one player using a Classic Controller and another using two Wii Remotes though this cross functionality was dropped br br During E Nintendo introduced the Classic Controller model number RVL which rather than housing the remote instead plugs into it via a cord in a similar fashion as the Nunchuk It contains two analog sticks and two extra shoulder buttons the ZL and ZR buttons The overall configuration is similar to that of other major seventh generation console gamepads br In November Nintendo listed a special Super Famicom Classic Controller as one of the choices for the free gift for Japanese Club Nintendo platinum members In a similar SNES Classic Controller was made available on Europe s and Australia s Club Nintendo service br The Wii U Pro Controller has been developed for the Wii U console the Wii console s successor Despite the visual similarities it is incompatible with the Classic Controller however instead of or in addition to the Pro Controller some Wii U games are compatible with the Classic Controller especially games with flexible control schemes such as Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros for Wii U While no Wii games are compatible with the Wii U Pro Controller because the Wii is a prior generation system successful efforts have been made to make the controller work on a Wii via homebrew br br br Design br The Classic Controller is plugged into the Wii Remote in order to be used It features two analog sticks a D pad face buttons labeled a b x and y in lowercase which bears resemblance to a standard SNES controller Analog shoulder buttons labeled L and R and two digital Z buttons labeled ZL and ZR are located more closely to the center axis on their respective sides It also has a set of Home and buttons like those on the Wii Remote with the and buttons additionally labeled Select and Start respectively The body of the Classic Controller measures cm in tall cm in wide and cm in thick br The body of the controller contains slots on the underside opened via a button at the top of the controller the function of the slots was never officially clarified although third party gaming accessory manufacturer Nyko released a clip that snaps onto the slots and secures the Wii Remote upright behind the Classic Controller provided that the safety jacket is removed In addition to a grip shell the clip contains storage for the controller s three foot cable While the only color available for the Classic Controller in most markets was white a limited edition teal and gray version was released in tandem with Monster Hunter G in Japan in and in Sonic Colors was bundled with a blue version in Australia br br br Uses br br The Classic Controller can be used with the Virtual Console as well as with certain Wii and WiiWare games Along with the Nintendo GameCube controller the Classic Controller is one of the controllers required to play certain Virtual Console games such as SNES or Nintendo titles which require more buttons and an analog stick in the case of the Nintendo games than the Wii Remote However the Classic Controller cannot be used to play GameCube games When in the Wii Menu the left analog stick takes control of the cursor when the Wii Remote is not pointed at the screen The Classic Controller can navigate through the Message Board settings menus and Wii Shop Channel but becomes inactive on all other channels except for the YouTube channel which the directional button is the only way to navigate through YouTube except for using keyboard While the Classic Controller is used the Wii Remote it is connected to can still be used by another player which can allow certain Wii games like Bust A Move Bash and SpeedZone to support up to eight players in multiplayer mode with two players sharing one of the maximum four Wii controllers that can be linked to the console at once As the Wii U supports Wii Remotes this controller is also compatible with that console and some Wii U specific games support it as well such as Trine Director s Cut The Classic Controller can also be used to navigate the Wii U home screen and menus br br br Other versions br br br Classic Controller Pro br br In early Nintendo announced the Classic Controller Pro which functions the same as the original Classic Controller with the exception of the shoulder buttons which are now digital trigger shaped buttons arranged vertically rather than horizontally Instead of a SNES controller this one is shaped more like a GameCube controller and has an overall layout almost identical to a Sony Dual Analog Controller for the PlayStation Physical changes include the ZL and ZR buttons which are now full shoulder buttons the addition of grips underneath the controller for additional stability and analog sticks which are spaced farther apart than the original The cord is positioned on top of the controller rather than the bottom and the spring loaded attachment slot underneath the original model was removed The Pro version was first released in Japan in August in white and black versions It was subsequently released in Europe and North America in November and April respectively though only in black in Europe The black version was available bundled with Monster Hunter Tri Pro Evolution Soccer and SD Gundam Gashapon Wars br br In addition to the standard colors a black version with gold colored artwork on the face was available bundled with Samurai Warriors in Japan and a completely gold colored version was available bundled in the GoldenEye Classic Edition and in Japan as a Club Nintendo reward A red version was packed with limited copies of Xenoblade Chronicles in Europe and was eventually released separately in Europe as well The L and R shoulder buttons are also no longer analog as they were on the original Classic Controller br br br Wii U Fight Pad controller br Accessory maker PDP began releasing a line of officially licensed Wired Fight Pad controllers in Behaving identically to standard Classic Controller Pro models they are based on the design and layout of the GameCube controller but with the Home and dual shoulder buttons that the GameCube controller lacks On launch they were released in Super Mario themed variants including Mario Peach Luigi and Yoshi colored versions Four more variants featuring Donkey Kong Link Samus and Wario themes were released in February followed by Metal Mario as well as Toad and Zero Suit Samus as GameStop exclusives br br br Classic Edition controllers br In July Nintendo announced the miniature NES Classic Edition packaged with one controller based on the original NES controller Later in June Nintendo announced the miniature Super NES Classic Edition packaged with two controllers based on the original SNES controllers depending on the region Like the Super Famicom Classic Controller released by Club Nintendo both controllers feature a connector similar to Nunchuks and Classic Controllers br The controllers for the NES Classic Edition and Super NES Classic Edition can be plugged into their respective consoles They are also compatible with the Wii and Wii U as the controllers are recognized as Classic Controllers when plugged into a Wii Remote which can be used to play Virtual Console games on Wii and Wii U While the controllers are also technically compatible with Wii and Wii U games that support the Classic Controller it can be difficult or impossible to properly play certain games with these particular controllers because of the simple primitive button layouts of the NES and SNES controllers they represent with both controllers lacking the Classic Controller s analog sticks the Z shoulder buttons and the HOME button and the NES controller lacking the SNES controller s shoulder buttons and two extra face buttons With the case of certain Virtual Console titles on Wii U you can change button mappings to your preference br br br Legal issues br Anascape Ltd filed a lawsuit against Nintendo claiming that the Classic Controller and other Nintendo devices violated Anascape s six degrees of freedom interface device patent In July the court ruled in favor of Anascape Nintendo was ordered to stop selling the Classic Controller in the United States until further notice Nintendo exercised the right to continue selling the Classic Controller pending a verdict at the U S Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit On April Nintendo won the appeal and the previous court decision was reversed br br br See also br br GameCube controller br List of games that use the Classic Controller br br br
