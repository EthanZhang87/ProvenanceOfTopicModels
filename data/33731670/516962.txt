id: 516962
In the history of video games the third generation of video game consoles commonly referred to as the bit era began on July with the Japanese release of two systems Nintendo s Family Computer commonly abbreviated to Famicom and Sega s SG When the Famicom was released outside of Japan it was remodeled and marketed as the Nintendo Entertainment System NES This generation marked the end of the video game crash of and a shift in the dominance of home video game manufacturers from the United States to Japan Handheld consoles were not a major part of this generation the Game Watch line from Nintendo which started in and the Milton Bradley Microvision which came out in that were sold at the time are both considered part of the previous generation due to hardware typical of the second generation br Improvements in technology gave consoles of this generation improved graphical and sound capabilities comparable to golden age arcade games The number of simultaneous colors on screen and the palette size both increased which along with larger resolutions more sprites on screen and more advanced scrolling and pseudo D effects which allowed developers to create scenes with more detail and animation Audio technology improved and gave consoles the ability to produce a greater variation and range of sound A notable innovation of this generation was the inclusion of cartridges with on board memory and batteries to allow users to save their progress in a game with Nintendo s The Legend of Zelda introducing the technology to the worldwide market This innovation allowed for much more expansive gaming worlds and in depth storytelling since users could now save their progress rather than having to start each gaming session at the beginning By the next generation the capability to save games became ubiquitous at first saving on the game cartridge itself and later when the industry changed to read only optical disks on memory cards hard disk drives and eventually cloud storage br The best selling console of this generation was the NES Famicom from Nintendo followed by the Master System from Sega the successor to the SG and the Atari Although the previous generation of consoles had also used bit processors it was at the end of the third generation that home consoles were first labeled and marketed by their bits This also came into fashion as fourth generation bit systems like the Sega Genesis were marketed in order to differentiate between the generations In Japan and North America this generation was primarily dominated by the Famicom NES while the Master System dominated the Brazilian market with the combined markets of Europe being more balanced in overall sales between the two main systems The end of the third generation was marked by the emergence of bit systems of the fourth generation and with the discontinuation of the Famicom on September However in some cases the third generation still lives on as dedicated console units still use hardware from the Famicom specification such as the VT VT and OneBus hardware br br br Overview br br br br The Japanese video game market was still a growing wide open market for video game consoles in Japan had a relatively small console market where only consoles had been sold up until compared to the millions that had been sold in the United States up until then A number of Japanese manufacturers attempted to compete for the wide open Japanese console market with their own consoles The Epoch Cassette Vision released in was the best selling console in Japan at the time It was followed by the Bandai Arcadia priced a Japanese version of the Arcadia released in and the Atari priced a Japanese version of the Atari marketed in May br The third generation of consoles began when two Japanese companies Sega and Nintendo decided to enter the console gaming market On July they both released new consoles in Japan Sega s SG and Nintendo s Famicom Both companies previously had success as arcade game companies Sega one of Japan s largest arcade companies was intending to compete in both the console and personal computer markets with a home computer version called the SC released at the same time Meanwhile Nintendo focused on making the Famicom more powerful than competing home systems so that it would be comparable to their Donkey Kong arcade video game hardware while at the same time selling it for cheaper than the Cassette Vision selling the Famicom for about Nintendo unveiled the Famicom shortly before the Tokyo Toy Show in June becoming a sensation among toy show exhibitors prior to Sega unveiling the SG at the Tokyo Toy Show br The Famicom went on to become very popular in Japan where it quickly beat the Cassette Vision to become Japan s all time best selling console Sega would become Nintendo s main competitor for console sales during the era Sega s SG which preceded Sega s more commercially successful Master System initially had little to distinguish itself from earlier consoles such as the ColecoVision and contemporary computers such as the MSX although it was able to achieve advanced visual effects including parallax scrolling in Orguss and sprite scaling in Zoom br To enter the worldwide market Nintendo approached the American company Atari which had the majority share of the home video game market in North America with a proposal for Atari to license the Famicom and distribute it An agreement was concluded which was to be signed at the Consumer Electronics Show in July At the same CES however Coleco exhibited its Coleco Adam home computer which featured a version of Nintendo s Donkey Kong At that time Atari had exclusive rights to distribute Nintendo games on home computers and Coleco had exclusive rights to distribute the game on consoles However since Atari understood that Adam was a home computer they postponed signing the agreement with Nintendo and asked the company to resolve the issue with rights The problem was resolved but during this time the video game crash of had occurred and Atari began to lose influence in the market With this Nintendo had no competitor left and the company eventually decided to enter the market on its own br br br br Nintendo were initially discouraged after the crash with Nintendo of America s market research being met with warnings to stay away from home consoles and US retailers refusing to stock game consoles As a result Nintendo instead introduced the Famicom to North America in the form of an arcade hardware the Nintendo VS System in It became a major success in North American arcades giving Nintendo the confidence to release the Famicom in North America as a video game console for which there was growing interest due to Nintendo s positive reputation in the arcades br The company introduced a version of the Famicom in January at the Winter CES as the Nintendo Advanced Video System short for NAVS The gamepads were wireless and worked with it using an infrared port and the bundle would also include a light gun It was planned that the NAVS would be available in the spring of However this did not happen and the console was shown again at the summer CES in June of that year as an updated version called the Nintendo Entertainment System The system was released in October as an experiment within New York City bounds with Super Mario Bros game bundled The experiment was successful and showed that people still wanted to play games despite the crisis After that the system was released in all North America in February at a price of US br In Sega succeeded the SG with the Master System which incorporated hardware scrolling alongside an increased color palette greater memory pseudo D effects and stereoscopic D gaining a clear hardware advantage over the NES However the NES continued to dominate the North American and Japanese markets while the Master System had more success in the European and South American markets br The Family Computer commonly abbreviated the Famicom became popular in Japan during this era crowding out the other consoles in this generation The Famicom s Western counterpart the Nintendo Entertainment System dominated the gaming market in North America thanks in part to its restrictive licensing agreements with developers This marked a shift in the dominance of home video games from the United States to Japan to the point that Computer Gaming World described the Nintendo craze as a non event for American video game designers as virtually all the work to date has been done in Japan The company had an estimated of hardware sales in the console market Atari Corporation had including the Atari Jr and XEGS Sega had and other companies had br br br present br The popularity of the Japanese consoles grew so quickly that in Epyx stated that in contrast to a video game hardware industry in that the company had described as dead the market for Nintendo cartridges was larger than for all home computer software Nintendo sold seven million NES systems in almost as many as the number of units the Commodore sold in its first five years In The Los Angeles Times reported that the rise of video game consoles had a positive impact on computer games sales of which grew during the first quarter of In however Compute reported that Nintendo s popularity caused most computer game companies to have poor sales during Christmas that year resulting in serious financial problems for some and after more than a decade making computer games in Epyx converted completely to console cartridges By of American households owned the NES compared to for all personal computers and peer pressure to have a console was so great that even the children of computer game developers demanded them despite parents refusal and the presence of state of the art computers and software at home As Computer Gaming World reported in The kids who don t have access to videogames are as culturally isolated as the kids in our own generation whose parents refused to buy a TV br This era contributed many influential aspects to the history of the development of video games The third generation saw the release of many of the first console role playing video games RPGs Editing and censorship of video games was often used in localizing Japanese games to North America It was during this time that many successful video game franchises began which went onto to becoming mainstays of the video game industry Some examples are Super Mario Bros Final Fantasy The Legend of Zelda Dragon Quest Metroid Mega Man Metal Gear Castlevania Phantasy Star Megami Tensei Ninja Gaiden and Bomberman br In Europe during the late s the Master System had a stronger start than the Nintendo Entertainment System in some areas with NES sales lagging behind the Master System in the United Kingdom By the Master System was the biggest selling console in Europe though the NES was beginning to have a fast growing user base in the United Kingdom and this position had reversed by the end of the run of both consoles br The third generation also saw the beginning of the children s educational console market Due to their reduced capacities these systems typically were not labeled by their bits and were not marketed in competition with traditional video game consoles br In North America the Atari and Master System were discontinued in while the NES continued to be produced until In Europe the Master System was discontinued in the late s However it has continued to sell in Brazil through to the present day In Japan Nintendo continued to repair Famicom systems until October br br br Home systems br br br SG br br On July the SG was released in Japan the first console to be created by Sega It was released alongside the Famicom making them the first two consoles of the third generation While it did not sell as well as other consoles of the generation it was considered important to the development of Sega as a console manufacturer br br br Famicom Nintendo Entertainment System br br The Famicom released on July in Japan and in the North American region in October as the Nintendo Entertainment System NES is an bit cartridge based console developed and marketed by Nintendo It became the most popular console of the generation selling over million units It was the first home system to feature a controller with a directional pad designed by Gunpei Yokoi which became an industry standard While the NES was discontinued in North America on August it was not until September that the Famicom was discontinued in Japan br br br Sega Mark III Master System br br The Sega Mark III was released on October for the Japanese market and was the third iteration of the SG The name was changed to the Master System and the design altered for release outside of Japan It was designed to be more powerful than the NES in an attempt to give it an edge over the competition but despite good sales it did not match the success of the NES making it the second best selling console of the generation This was the case in all regions apart from Brazil where it continued to sell for years after the end of the generation br br br Atari br br The Atari was released in May and was the successor to the Atari It was the first console to be backward compatible without additional hardware It was originally due for launch on May but due to the sale of the company the launch did not happen until two years later and coupled with a small library of games the console did not sell as well as the Master System or NES br br br Comparison br br br Other

between Nintendo and Sega there was a to split in market share between the NES and the Master System in Nintendo s favor The NES sold million units in North America during much more than the Master System and Atari combined By Nintendo had a North American market share followed by Sega with a share NEC with and Atari with share Nintendo maintained its North American lead through when it had a market share of that year much more than Atari and Sega combined This was due to Nintendo s strong lineup of both first party titles such as Super Mario Bros Metroid Duck Hunt and The Legend of Zelda and third party titles along with Nintendo s strict licensing rules that required NES titles to be exclusive to the console for two years after release putting a damper on third party support for other consoles br In Europe competition was much tougher for the NES which was trailing behind the Master System up until despite the former s hegemony of the North American and Japanese markets NES sales began picking up from about after which sales were more evenly split between the NES and Master System through the NES eventually overtook the Master System in Western Europe by a narrow margin though the Master System maintained its lead in several markets such as the United Kingdom Belgium and Spain In other regions the Master System was the most successful console in Brazil South Korea
