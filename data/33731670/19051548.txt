The GP X Wiz is a handheld game console and portable media player developed by South Korean company GamePark Holdings running a Linux kernel based embedded operating system br GP X Wiz was released in May and was the first console from both Game Park and Game Park Holdings to also be released outside South Korea It was announced by GamePark Holdings in August and succeeded the GP X featuring a slimmer profile and enhanced capabilities including a MHz CPU overclockable to MHz GB NAND flash memory MB RAM and a inch AMOLED touchscreen Distinguished from its predecessor by a more consistent release of games and a focus on both commercial and homebrew development the Wiz targeted the open source community It supports various multimedia formats and comes with pre installed games and applications with an online application store launched in August Official accessories and the introduction of Flash Player enhanced its appeal br br br History br An image of the Wiz system was first leaked on the web in late July Rumors had been circulating that GamePark Holdings was in the process of making a new handheld since they had abruptly discontinued production of its first handheld the GP X in late June early July Prior to the official announcement this handheld was sometimes referred to as the GP X br On August GamePark Holdings announced that it was planning to release a new handheld named the Wiz Along with the announcement a brochure detailing a great amount of launch information was released complete with the system s specs The brochure stated that new games would be released every month for the system This is a deviation from the GP X which did not have many commercial games However the Wiz still appears to be primarily advertised as an open source system meant for homebrew development of games and emulators br On September it was reported that the GP X Wiz s button layout was to be revised and the second D Pad on the right hand side of the system was to be removed In order to make these design changes the release of the system was to be pushed back to November br Around the last week of April GamePark shipped test units of the GP X Wiz These are thought to be the final hardware revision before the actual product launch br Retailers for the GP X Wiz stated that they planned to begin shipping the GP X Wiz as soon as October As of May retailers are listing the price of the Wiz at US The GP X Wiz started shipping as of May br An online application store was set to launch in August of br Official accessories for the GP X Wiz include the Accessory Kit which comes with an SD card case a wrist strap and a spare stylus a screen protector and a Genuine Leather Case br The successor of GP X Wiz is GP X Caanoo br br br Myungtendo br In February South Korean president Lee Myung bak had stated that Korea needs to develop a video game console like a Nintendo DS This statement was parodied with the Myungtendo MB an obvious rip off of the Nintendo DS While completely unrelated to the Myungtendo incident the GP X Wiz is often nicknamed as the Myungtendo due to its release shortly after the statement br br br Hardware br br br Specifications br
