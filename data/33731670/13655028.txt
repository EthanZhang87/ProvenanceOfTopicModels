objective is to force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage Most attacks inflict damage and can if enough damage is dealt knock back the enemy Each character s health is measured by a meter that represents damage as a percentage The higher the percentage value the farther the player gets knocked back and the easier they are to knock off the stage which will result in the character s death and the loss of a stock or life Unlike other games of the same genre in which moves are entered by button input combinations most moves in Super Smash Bros Melee can be accessed via one button presses and a joystick direction For example by tilting the joystick to the side and pressing the B button the character will use their side special attack Tilting the joystick up down or not tilting it at all while pressing B will use the up down or neutral special respectively br During battles items related to Nintendo games or merchandise fall onto the game field These items have purposes ranging from inflicting damage on the opponent to restoring health to the player Some items are throwable ranged items some do melee damage battering items and some have an instant effect on the player transforming items br Most stages have a theme relating to a Nintendo franchise or a specific Nintendo game and are interactive to the player For example the Mushroom Kingdom stage is from Super Mario Bros and the Temple stage is from The Legend of Zelda Although the stages are rendered in three dimensions players can only move on a two dimensional plane Not all stages are available immediately some stages must be unlocked by achieving particular requirements Some stages feature moving elements and platforms and hazards that harm players while others lack these elements br br br Single player br Single player mode provides the player with a variety of side scrolling fighting challenges The applicable modes range from Classic Mode which involves the player battling multiple opponents and a boss character to the Home Run Contest a minigame involving the player trying to launch a sandbag as far as possible with a Home Run Bat for ten seconds Some of these modes are personalized for the character for example the Target Test sets out a specialized area for a character in which they aim to destroy ten targets in the least amount of time they can These areas may include references to that particular character s past and legacy Melee introduced Adventure Mode which takes the player to several predefined universes of characters in the Nintendo franchise All Star Mode is an unlockable feature that requires the player to defeat every character in the game while having only one stock and three health supplements between battles br br br Multiplayer br br In the multiplayer mode up to four players or computer controlled characters may fight in a free for all or on separate teams The central processing unit CPU characters artificial intelligence AI difficulty is ranked from one to nine in ascending order of difficulty Individual players can also be handicapped the higher the handicap the stronger the player Victory is determined in five ways depending on the game type The two most common multiplayer modes are Time mode where the player or team with the most KOs and least falls wins after a predetermined amount of time and Stock mode a battle in which the last player or team with lives remaining wins This can be changed to less conventional modes like Coin mode which rewards the richest player as the victor Players must collect coins created by hitting enemies and try not to lose them by falling off the stage harder hits release higher quantities of coins Other options are available updating from Super Smash Bros such as determining the number and type of items that appear during the battle br br br Trophies br Trophies known as Figures in the Japanese version of various Nintendo characters and objects can be collected throughout the game These trophies include figures of playable characters accessories and items associated with them as well as series and characters not otherwise playable in the game The trophies range from the well known to the obscure and even characters or elements only released in Japan Super Smash Bros had a similar system of plush dolls however it only included the playable characters One trophy is exclusive to the Japanese version of the game br br br Playable characters br br Super Smash Bros Melee features if Zelda and Sheik are considered separate characters with Zelda and Sheik separate more than its predecessor Fourteen are available initially while the other characters require completing specific tasks to become available Every character featured in the game is derived from a popular Nintendo franchise All characters have a symbol that appears behind their damage meter which represents their series such as a Triforce symbol behind Link s damage meter and a Pok Ball behind a Pok mon species Some characters represent popular franchises while others were less known at the time of the release Marth and Roy represent the Fire Emblem series which was not released outside Japan at the time The characters appearance in Super Smash Bros Melee led to a rise in the popularity of the series including releasing it outside of Japan References are made throughout the game to the relationship between characters of the same universe in one of the events from Event mode Mario must defeat his enemy Bowser to rescue Princess Peach Furthermore each character has recognizable moves from their original series such as Samus s firearms from the Metroid series and Link s arsenal of weapons br br br Development and release br Super Smash Bros Melee was developed by HAL Laboratory with Masahiro Sakurai as the head of production Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto served as co producer The game was one of the first games released on the GameCube and highlighted the advancement in graphics over the Nintendo The project proposal initial design document for the game was completed on July Sakurai wanted to make an opening FMV sequence to pay homage to the debut of the GameCube HAL and Sakurai worked with three separate graphic houses in Tokyo to make the opening sequence On their official website the developers posted screenshots and information highlighting and explaining the attention to physics and detail in the game with references to changes from its predecessor The game was in development for months beginning around autumn and Sakurai called his lifestyle during this period destructive with no holidays and short weekends Unlike the experimental first Super Smash Bros he felt great pressure to deliver a quality sequel claiming it was the biggest project I had ever led up to that point Despite the stressful development cycle in a interview Sakurai proudly called Melee the sharpest game in the series it just felt really good to play even compared to its successor Super Smash Bros Brawl br On the game s official Japanese website Sakurai and the developers explained reasons for making particular characters playable and why some characters were not added Initially the development team wanted to replace Ness with Lucas the main character of Mother but retained Ness in consideration of delays Video game developer Hideo Kojima originally requested the inclusion of Solid Snake to Sakurai and Yuji Naka of Sonic Team requested the inclusion of Sonic the Hedgehog to Sakurai but neither characters were added as the game was too far in development Additional development time later enabled all three characters to be included in Brawl Marth and Roy were initially intended to be playable exclusively in the Japanese version of Super Smash Bros Melee due to Fire Emblem s lack of representation in the West at the time however they received favorable attention during the game s North American localization leading to the decision for the developers to include them in the Western version br Sakurai stated that the development team had suggested characters from four other games to represent the Famicom NES era until the developers eventually chose the Ice Climbers to fulfill this role Additionally Ayumi Tachibana from Famicom Detective Club was considered as a playable character but was ultimately relegated to a cameo role as a trophy The developers have noted characters that have very similar moves to each other on the website such characters have been referred to as clones in the media br Nintendo presented

battles between Nintendo characters which has been suggested as being overly hectic N Europe questioned whether the gameplay is too Frantic even though they enjoyed the variety of modes on offer Similarly Nintendo Spin s Clark Nielsen stated that Melee was too fast for its own good and skill was more about just being able to wrap your head around what was happening as opposed to really getting into the combat In regards to the pace of the game Edge commented that it even made gameplay features such as blocking redundant as the player is not given enough time to react to an attack br
