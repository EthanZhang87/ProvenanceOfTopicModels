The Genesis Nomad also known as Sega Nomad is a handheld game console manufactured by Sega and released in North America in October The Nomad is a portable variation of the Sega Genesis home video game console known as the Mega Drive outside North America It could also be used with a television set via a video port It was based on the Mega Jet a portable version of the home console designed for use on airline flights in Japan br The Nomad was the last handheld console released by Sega Released late in the Genesis era it had a short lifespan It was sold exclusively in North America and uses regional lockout Sega s focus on the Sega Saturn left the Nomad under supported and it was incompatible with several Genesis peripherals including the Power Base Converter the Sega CD and the X About million units of the Nomad were sold and it is considered a commercial failure br br br History br br The Sega Genesis was Sega s entry into the bit era of video game consoles In Japan Sega released the Mega Jet a portable version of the Mega Drive for use on Japan Airlines flights The Mega Jet requires a connection to a television screen and a power source and so outside of airline flights can only be used in cars equipped with a television set and cigarette lighter receptacle On planes the Mega Jet was connected into armrest monitors It had a limited consumer release in Japanese department stores in but did not see success br br Planning to release a new handheld console to succeed the Game Gear Sega originally intended to produce a system with a touchscreen interface two years before the Game com handheld by Tiger Electronics However touchscreen technology was expensive at the time so Sega instead released the Genesis Nomad a handheld version of the Genesis The development codename was Project Venus Sega hoped to capitalize on the Genesis s popularity in North America At the time the Genesis Nomad was the only handheld console that could connect to a television br The Nomad was released in October in North America only The release was five years into the market span of the Genesis with an existing library of more than Genesis games While Sega Technical Institute s The Ooze was originally planned as a launch game it was not included According to former Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller the Nomad was not intended to replace the Game Gear and Sega had few plans for the new handheld Sega was supporting five different consoles Saturn Genesis Game Gear Pico and the Master System as well as the Sega CD and X add ons In Japan the Mega Drive had never been successful and the Saturn was more successful than Sony s PlayStation so Sega Enterprises CEO Hayao Nakayama decided to focus on the Saturn resulting in the end of support for the Genesis and Genesis based products Additionally the Game Boy Nintendo s handheld console that had been dominant in the market became even more dominant with the release of Pok mon Red and Blue This meant the Nomad was not successful By the Nomad was being sold at less than a third of its original price br br br Technical specifications br br Similar to the Genesis and the Mega Jet the Nomad s main CPU is a Motorola Possessing similar memory graphics and sound capabilities the Nomad is nearly identical to the full size console the only variation is that it is completely self sufficient The Nomad has a inch diagonal backlit color LC display and an A V output that allows the Nomad to be played on a television screen Design elements of the handheld were made similar to the Game Gear but included six buttons for full compatibility with later Genesis releases Also included were a red power switch headphone jack volume dial and separate controller input for multiplayer games The controller port functions as player so single player games cannot be played with a Genesis controller The Nomad can be powered by an AC adapter a battery recharger known as the Genesis Nomad PowerBack or six AA batteries which provide a battery life of two to three hours br The Nomad is fully compatible with several Genesis peripherals including the Sega Activator Team Play Adaptor Mega Mouse and the Sega Channel and XBAND network add ons However the Nomad is not compatible with the Power Base Converter Sega CD or X This means the Nomad can only play Genesis games whereas the standard Genesis can also play Master System Sega CD and X games with the respective add ons br br br Game library br br The Nomad does not have its own game library but instead plays Genesis games At the time of its launch the Nomad had over games available for play However no pack in game was included The Nomad can boot unlicensed homebrew and bootleg games made for the Genesis Some earlier third party games have compatibility issues when played on the Nomad but can be successfully played through the use of a Game Genie Likewise due to its lack of compatibility with any of the Genesis add ons it is unable to play any games for the Master System Sega CD or X The Nomad employs two different regional lockout methods physical and software but methods have been found to bypass these br br br Reception and legacy br Reviewing the Nomad shortly after launch Game Players considered the price of a bit steep but said it was the best portable system on the market and recommended it over the stock Genesis since it could play all the same games in a portable format In a year end review a team of four Electronic Gaming Monthly editors gave the Nomad scores of and They praised its support for the entire Genesis library but criticized its hefty battery usage and noted that despite a recent price drop it was still expensive enough to discourage interested consumers While they generally complimented the screen display they remarked that its small size makes it difficult to play certain games Sushi X declared the Nomad the best portable gaming system then on the market while his three co reviewers had more misgivings saying it has merits but might not be a worthwhile buy However in their first review reviewers from Electronics Gaming Monthly noted that the screen suffers from display motion blur particularly during fast scrolling br Blake Snow of GamePro listed the Nomad as fifth on his list of the Worst Selling Handhelds of All Time criticizing its poor timing into the market inadequate advertising and poor battery life Scott Alan Marriott of Allgame placed more than simply timing into reasons for the Nomad s lack of sales stating The reason for the Nomad s failure may have very well been a combination of poor timing company mistrust and the relatively high cost of the machine without a pack in Genesis owners were too skittish to invest in another bit system Stuart Hunt of Retro Gamer however praised the Nomad saying in a retrospective that Nomad was the first true bit handheld and declared it the best variant of the Genesis He noted the collectability of the Nomad due to its low production and stated Had Sega cottoned on to the concept of the Nomad before the Mega Drive and rolled it out as a true successor to the Mega Drive then perhaps Sega may have succeeded in its original goal to prolong the life of the Mega Drive in the U S In a mod was developed to allow the Nomad to receiver power using USB devices br br br See also br br VMU br Comparison of handheld game
