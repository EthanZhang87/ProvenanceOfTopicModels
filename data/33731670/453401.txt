The Rumble Pak Japanese Hepburn Shind Pakku is a removable device from Nintendo that provides force feedback while playing video games Games that support the Rumble Pak cause it to vibrate in select situations such as when firing a weapon or receiving damage to immerse the player in the game Versions of the Rumble Pak are available for the Nintendo the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo DS Lite A select few Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance GBA games use a similar technology built into the game cartridge Force feedback vibration has become a built in standard feature in almost every home video game console controller since br br br Nintendo br br The original Rumble Pak designed for the Nintendo controller was released in April in Japan July in North America and October in Europe It requires two AAA batteries and is inserted into the controller s memory cartridge slot which prevents simultaneous use of the Controller Pak This does not significantly affect games that feature on cartridge save functions but is a drawback with games that require the Controller Pak to save as software by default was not designed to support hot swapping Paks although some games support saving to a Controller Pak in a second controller Nintendo remedied the situation in later games by offering developers the inclusion of special screens for hot swapping The Rumble Pak is estimated to provide hours of continuous rumbling before the batteries must be replaced br Originally named Jolting Pak it was announced as what IGN called the biggest surprise of the Shoshinkai show The Rumble Pak was introduced bundled with the game Star Fox known as Lylat Wars in the PAL region and made available as a separate purchase two months later Rumble Pak support soon became a standard for N games Wave Race and Super Mario were re released in Japan in July with Rumble Pak support br Several third party versions of the Rumble Pak such as the Tremor Pak followed Some draw power from the controller instead of batteries but the lower power makes them less effective The TremorPak Plus allows a memory card to be inserted simultaneously eliminating the need to switch between two accessories The Nyko Hyper Pak Plus contains internal memory and allows the user to adjust the amount of feedback between hard and too hard Though it does not allow the use of rumble and memory functions simultaneously users can toggle between the two functions by flipping a switch instead of having to swap accessories br br br Reception br Atomic Dawg s review of the Rumble Pak in GamePro described it as cute gimmicky and actually kind of fun When reviewing Star Fox IGN praised the Rumble Pak stating that it adds an unusual burst of arcade ecstasy to the game Electronic Gaming Monthly commented Sure a vibrating joystick may sound lame even a little naughty but trust us it s cool The Pak s only drawback is that it slips into your analog stick s memory cartridge port and doesn t offer a through port The magazine s review crew later reviewed the standalone release of the Rumble Pak giving it an out of While Kraig Kujawa and John Ricciardi commented that its usage in games thus far had been as a gimmick rather than an enhancement to the actual gameplay Kelly Rickards and Sushi X lauded its usage in games such as GoldenEye and Star Fox and all four of them praised the low retail price of the unit saying that at worst gamers risk little by purchasing it At their Editors Choice Awards they named it Best Peripheral br IGN s Levi Buchanan wrote an th birthday article on the Nintendo s Rumble Pak describing how its influence led to rumble being an industry standard within a single generation He said that it is bulky and heavy when attached to the Nintendo controller but that the trade off was actually worth it br More recently in TWGNews s Top Controller Innovations article the Rumble Pak is listed as saying the Rumble Pak added a whole new level of immersion to the fifth generation of video games br br br Nintendo DS br br The Rumble Pak for the Nintendo DS is an official DS Option Pak shaped like a Game Boy Advance Game Pak and is designed to be inserted in the system s GBA game slot SLOT It is the first Nintendo DS accessory to have utilized the slot In North America it was first made available bundled with Metroid Prime Pinball but was later sold through other promotions or as a stand alone purchase from Nintendo s online store The accessory was released differently in Europe due to a delay of Metroid Prime Pinball in that region Various DS games supporting the Rumble Pak Metroid Prime Hunters Mario Luigi Partners in Time and All Time Classics had been released in Europe before the accessory was available The accessory was eventually released as a pack in with the game Actionloop in the UK br Although the Rumble Pak works with both the Nintendo DS and the redesigned Nintendo DS Lite it protrudes from the Nintendo DS Lite when inserted as do GBA Game Paks because of the Nintendo DS Lite s smaller size For this reason a smaller version of the Rumble Pak is available in Japan which is flush with the system when inserted It was initially available in just black but other colors produced by unlicensed accessory manufacturer eWin such as white see picture have been released Other color variations have been released by eWin br Some GBA flash cartridges SLOT flash cartridges have a built in rumble feature that when used in tandem with a SLOT flash card on a Nintendo DS can provide rumble as if it was an ordinary Rumble Pak br The Nintendo DS Rumble Pak is incompatible with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL as both consoles lack a SLOT However none of the games supporting the Rumble Pak require it for proper operation of the game meaning that the games themselves are still compatible with DSi some software titles such as Nintendo DS Browser and Guitar Hero On Tour have SLOT peripherals that are required for operation and are hence incompatible with DSi and DSi XL although the former already has an alternative version made specifically for the Nintendo DSi and later consoles Although Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL lack the SLOT some Nintendo DS titles released after the Nintendo DSi s launch do support the Rumble Pak accessory likely due to the fact the Nintendo DS Lite console was sold concurrently with the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL br br br Reception br The Nintendo DS Rumble Pak was initially met with criticism as reviewers pointed out the limited number of games compatible with the card at the time only four were compatible Reviewers also pointed out the annoying squealing noise or electronic chirp that the device made when rumbling IGN stated that Good thing it s free because at this point we wouldn t bother buying it as an extra Up until the removal of the expansion slot from later Nintendo DS models the DS Rumble Pak was supported by games in total br br br Game Boy family br While there is no dedicated Rumble Pak for the Game Boy family Game Boy Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance due to these more primitive systems lacking an expansion slot there were several games released for the Game Boy s successors that featured built in rumble Game Boy Color games with built in rumble such as Pin Bowling Vigilante and Star Wars Episode I Racer were released as bulkier Game Paks with an added rumble motor powered by an extra AAA battery that is inserted into the Game Pak itself The only two Game Boy Advance games that feature built in rumble Drill Dozer and WarioWare Twisted draw power from the system itself and thus do not require an extra battery or a specially enlarged Game Pak Twisted also rumbles weakly whenever its special built in piezoelectric gyroscope for its motion controls are utilized Other Game Boy Advance games such as Mario Luigi Superstar Saga support rumble when played on a Game Boy Player for the GameCube utilizing its controller s built in vibration br
