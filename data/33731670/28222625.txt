America The Mega Drive struggled against competition in Japan but the Genesis found success overseas after the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in and briefly outsold its main competitor the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the US Later in the decade Sega suffered several commercial failures such as the X Saturn and Dreamcast In Sega stopped manufacturing consoles to become a third party developer and publisher and was acquired by Sammy Corporation in Sega Holdings Co Ltd was established in Sega Corporation was renamed Sega Games Co Ltd and its arcade entertainment and toy divisions separated into other companies In Sega Games and Sega Interactive merged to become Sega Corporation br Sega s international branches Sega of America and Sega Europe are headquartered in Irvine

operate amusement arcades and produce other entertainment products including Sega Fave however these are largely separate ventures Sega is recognized for its video game consoles creativity and innovations In more recent years it has been criticized for its business decisions and the quality of its creative output br Being the entertainment contents division of Sega Sammy Holdings forming one half of the Sega Sammy Group Sega also owns a toy and amusement machine company Sega Fave which compromises their arcade development manufacturing divisions that were previously under Sega and two animation studios TMS Entertainment which animates produces and or distributes anime such as Lupin the rd Case Closed and Anpanman Marza Animation Planet which specializes in CG animation br br br History br br br Origins and arcade success br br In May American businessmen Martin Bromley Irving Bromberg and James Humpert formed Standard Games in Honolulu Hawaii Their aim was to provide coin operated amusement machines including slot machines to military bases as the increase in personnel with the onset of World War II would create demand for entertainment After the war the founders sold Standard Games in and in established Service Games named for the military focus After the US government outlawed slot machines in its territories in Bromley sent employees Richard Stewart and Ray LeMaire to Tokyo to establish Service Games of Japan to provide coin operated slot machines to US bases in Japan A year later all five men established Service Games Panama to control the entities of Service Games worldwide The company expanded over the next seven years to include distribution in South Korea the Philippines and South Vietnam The name Sega an abbreviation of Service Games was first used in on a slot machine the Diamond Star br Due to notoriety arising from investigations by the US government into criminal business practices Service Games of Japan was dissolved on May On June Bromley established two companies to take over its business activities Nihon Goraku Bussan and Nihon Kikai Seiz The two new companies purchased all of Service Games of Japan s assets Kikai Seiz doing business as Sega Inc focused on manufacturing slot machines Goraku Bussan doing business under Stewart as Utamatic Inc served as a distributor and operator of coin operated machines particularly jukeboxes The companies merged in retaining the Nihon Goraku Bussan name br Around the same time David Rosen an American officer in the United States Air Force stationed in Japan launched a photo booth business in Tokyo in This company became Rosen Enterprises and in began importing coin operated games into Japan In Nihon Goraku Bussan acquired Rosen Enterprises to form Sega Enterprises Ltd Rosen was installed as the CEO and managing director while Stewart was named president and LeMaire was the director of planning Shortly afterward Sega stopped leasing to military bases and moved its focus from slot machines to coin operated amusement machines Its imports included Rock Ola jukeboxes pinball games by Williams and gun games by Midway Manufacturing br br Because Sega imported second hand machines which required frequent maintenance it began constructing replacement guns and flippers for its imported games According to former Sega director Akira Nagai this led to the company developing its own games The first arcade electro mechanical game EM game Sega manufactured was the submarine simulator Periscope released worldwide in the late s It featured light and sound effects considered innovative and was successful in Japan It was then exported to malls and department stores in Europe and the United States and helped standardize the cent per play cost for arcade games in the US Sega was surprised by the success and for the next two years the company produced and exported between eight and ten games per year The worldwide success of Periscope led to a technological renaissance in the arcade industry which was reinvigorated by a wave of audio visual EM novelty games that followed in the wake of Periscope during the late s to early s However rampant piracy led Sega to cease exporting its games around br In Sega was sold to the American conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries although Rosen remained CEO In Gulf and Western made Sega Enterprises Ltd a subsidiary of an American company renamed Sega Enterprises Inc Sega released Pong Tron its first video based game in Despite late competition from Taito s hit arcade game Space Invaders in Sega prospered from the arcade video game boom of the late s with revenues climbing to over US million by During this period Sega acquired Gremlin Industries which manufactured microprocessor based arcade games and Esco Boueki a coin op distributor founded and owned by Hayao Nakayama Nakayama was placed in a management role of Sega s Japanese operations In the early s Sega was one of the top five arcade game manufacturers active in the United States as company revenues rose to million saw the release of Head On which introduced the eat the dots gameplay Namco later used in Pac Man In Sega licensed Frogger its most successful game until then In Sega introduced the first game with isometric graphics Zaxxon br br br Entry into the game console market and arcade resurgence br br Following a downturn in the arcade business starting in Gulf and Western sold its North American arcade game manufacturing organization and the licensing rights for its arcade games to Bally Manufacturing in September Gulf and Western retained Sega s North American R D operation and its Japanese subsidiary Sega Enterprises Ltd With its arcade business in decline Sega Enterprises Ltd president Nakayama advocated for the company to use its hardware expertise to move into the home consumer market in Japan This led to Sega s development of a computer the SC Learning that Nintendo was developing a games only console the Famicom Sega developed its first home video game system the SG alongside the SC Rebranded versions of the SG were released in several other markets worldwide The SG sold units in which far exceeded Sega s projection of in the first year but was outpaced by the Famicom This was in part because Nintendo expanded its game library by courting third party developers whereas Sega was hesitant to collaborate with companies with which it was competing in the arcades br In November Rosen announced his intention to step down as president of Sega Enterprises Inc on January Jeffrey Rochlis was announced as the new president and CEO of Sega Shortly after the launch of the SG and the death of company founder Charles Bluhdorn Gulf and Western began to sell off its secondary businesses Nakayama and Rosen arranged a management buyout of the Japanese subsidiary in with financial backing from CSK Corporation a prominent Japanese software company Sega s Japanese assets were purchased for million by a group of investors led by Rosen and Nakayama Isao Okawa head of CSK became chairman while Nakayama was installed as CEO of Sega Enterprises Ltd br br In Sega began working on the Mark III a redesigned SG For North America Sega rebranded the Mark III as the Master System with a futuristic design intended to appeal to Western tastes The Mark III was released in Japan in October Despite featuring more powerful hardware than the Famicom in some ways it was unsuccessful at launch As Nintendo required third party developers not to publish their Famicom games on other consoles Sega developed its own games and obtained the rights to port games from other developers To help market the console in North America Sega planned to sell the Master System as a toy similar to how Nintendo had done with the Nintendo Entertainment System Sega partnered with Tonka an American toy company to make use of Tonka s expertise in the toy industry Ineffective marketing by Tonka handicapped sales of the Master System By early production had ceased in North America The Master System sold between million and million units in the region This was less market share in North America than both Nintendo and Atari which controlled percent and percent of the market The Master System was eventually a success in Europe where its sales were comparable to the NES As late as the Master System s active installed user base in Europe was million units The Master System has had continued success in Brazil New versions continue to be released by Sega s partner in the region Tectoy By the Master System had sold million units in Brazil br During Sega opened its European division of arcade distribution Sega Europe It re entered the North American arcade market in with the establishment of Sega Enterprises USA at the end of a deal with Bally The release of Hang On in would prove successful in the region becoming so popular that Sega struggled to keep up with demand for the game UFO Catcher was introduced in and as of was Japan s most commonly installed claw crane game In Sega of America was established to manage the company s consumer products in North America beginning with marketing the Master System During Sega s partnership with Tonka Sega of America relinquished marketing and distribution of the console and focused on customer support and some localization of games Out Run released in became Sega s best selling arcade cabinet of the s Former Sega director Akira Nagai said Hang On and Out Run helped to pull the arcade game market out of the downturn and created new genres of video games br br br Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog and mainstream success br br With the arcade game market once again growing Sega was one of the most recognized game brands at the end of the s In the arcades the company focused on releasing games to appeal to diverse tastes including racing games and side scrollers Sega released the Master System s successor the Mega Drive in Japan on October The launch was overshadowed by Nintendo s release of Super Mario Bros a week earlier Positive coverage from magazines Famitsu and Beep helped establish a following with the latter launching a new publication dedicated to the console but Sega shipped only units in the first year br The Mega Drive struggled to compete against the Famicom and lagged behind Nintendo s Super Famicom and the TurboGrafx made by NEC in Japanese sales throughout the bit era For the North American launch where the console was renamed Genesis Sega had no sales and marketing organization After Atari declined an offer to market the console in the region Sega launched it through its own Sega of America subsidiary The Genesis was launched in New York City and Los Angeles on August and in the rest of North America later that year The European version of the Mega Drive was released in September br Former Atari executive and new Sega of America president Michael Katz developed a two part strategy to build sales in North America The first part involved a marketing campaign to challenge Nintendo and emphasize the more arcade like experience available on the Genesis with slogans including Genesis does what Nintendon t Since Nintendo owned the console rights to most arcade games of the time the second part involved creating a library of games which used the names and likenesses of celebrities such as Michael Jackson s Moonwalker and Joe Montana Football Nonetheless Sega had difficulty overcoming Nintendo s ubiquity in homes Sega of America sold only Genesis units in its first year half of Nakayama s goal br br After the launch of the Genesis Sega sought a new flagship line of releases to compete with Nintendo s Mario series Its new character Sonic the Hedgehog went on to feature in one of the best selling video game franchises in history Sonic the Hedgehog began with a tech demo created by Yuji Naka involving a fast moving character rolling in a ball through a winding tube this was fleshed out with Naoto Ohshima s character design and levels conceived by designer Hirokazu Yasuhara Sonic s color was chosen to match Sega s cobalt blue logo his shoes were inspired by Michael Jackson s boots and his personality by Bill Clinton s can do attitude br Nakayama hired Tom Kalinske as CEO of Sega of America in mid and Katz departed soon after Kalinske knew little about the video game market but surrounded himself with industry savvy advisors A believer in the razor and blades business model he developed a four point plan cut the price of the Genesis create a US team to develop games targeted at the American market expand the aggressive advertising campaigns and replace the bundled game Altered Beast with Sonic the Hedgehog The Japanese board of directors disapproved but it was approved by Nakayama who told Kalinske I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas so go ahead and do it br In large part due to the popularity of Sonic the Hedgehog the Genesis outsold its main competitor the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES in the United States nearly two to one during the holiday season By January Sega controlled percent of the bit console market Sega outsold Nintendo for four consecutive Christmas seasons due to the Genesis head start lower price and a larger library compared to the SNES at release Nintendo s dollar share of the US bit market dropped from at the end of to at the end of Sega claimed of all bit hardware sales during and the SNES outsold the Genesis from through br br In Sega launched the Game Gear a handheld console to compete against Nintendo s Game Boy The Game Gear was designed as a portable version of the Master System and featured a full color screen in contrast to the monochrome Game Boy screen Due to its short battery life lack of original games and weak support from Sega the Game Gear did not surpass the Game Boy having sold approximately million units Sega launched the Mega CD in Japan on December initially retailing at JP The add on uses CD ROM technology Further features include a second faster processor vastly expanded system memory a graphics chip that performed scaling and rotation similar to the company s arcade games and another sound chip In North America it was renamed the Sega CD and launched on October with a retail price of US It was released in Europe as the Mega CD in The Mega CD sold only units during its first year in Japan falling well below expectations br br Throughout the early s Sega largely continued its success in arcades around the world In and the new Sega Model arcade system board showcased in house development studio Sega AM s Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter the first D fighting game which though expensive played a crucial role in popularizing D polygonal graphics In addition complex simulator equipment like the rotational R kept Sega competing with machines by rival arcade companies including Taito New official region specific distributors and manufacturers including the UK s Deith Leisure allowed Sega to sell its machines outside of Japan with ease Sega s domestic operations division also opened hundreds of family oriented suburban Sega World amusement arcades in Japan during this period as well as large over s GiGO facilities in the high profile urban areas of Roppongi and Ikebukuro In this success was mirrored in overseas territories with the openings of several large branded entertainment centers such as Sega VirtuaLand in Luxor Las Vegas In Sega generated a revenue of billion or equivalent to in br In the American media began to focus on the mature content of certain video games such as Night Trap for the Sega CD and the Genesis version of Midway s Mortal Kombat This came at a time when Sega was capitalizing on its image as an edgy company with attitude and this reinforced that image To handle this Sega instituted the United States first video game ratings system the Videogame Rating Council VRC for all its systems Ratings ranged from the family friendly GA rating to the more mature rating of MA and the adults only rating of MA Executive vice president of Nintendo of America Howard Lincoln was quick to point out in the United States congressional hearings in that Night Trap was not rated at all Senator Joe Lieberman called for another hearing in February to check progress toward a rating system for video game violence After the hearings Sega proposed the universal adoption of the VRC after objections by Nintendo and others Sega took a role in forming the Entertainment Software Rating Board br br br X Saturn falling console sales and continued arcade success br br Sega began work on the Genesis successor the Sega Saturn more than two years before showcasing it at the Tokyo Toy Show in June According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless Nakayama became concerned about the release of the Atari Jaguar and that the Saturn would not be available until the next year As a result Nakayama decided to have a second console release to market by the end of Sega began to develop the X a Genesis add on which would serve as a less expensive entry into the bit era The X would not be compatible with the Saturn but would play Genesis games Sega released the X on November in North America December in Japan and January in PAL territories and was sold at less than half of the Saturn s launch price After the holiday season interest in the X rapidly declined br br Sega released the Saturn in Japan on November Virtua Fighter a port of the popular arcade game sold at a nearly one to one ratio with the Saturn at launch and was crucial to the system s early success in Japan Sega s initial shipment of Saturn units sold out on the first day and it was more popular than the PlayStation made by Sony in Japan In March Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske announced that the Saturn would be released in the US on Saturn day Saturday September Sega of Japan mandated an early launch to give the Saturn an advantage over the PlayStation At the first Electronic Entertainment Expo E in Los Angeles on May Kalinske revealed the release price and that Sega had shipped Saturns to Toys R Us Babbage s Electronics Boutique and Software Etc for immediate release A by product of the surprise launch was the provocation of retailers not included in Sega s rollout KB Toys in particular decided to no longer stock its products in response br The Saturn s release in Europe also came before the previously announced North American date on July Within two days of the PlayStation s American launch on September the PlayStation sold more units than the Saturn Within its first year the PlayStation secured over twenty percent of the US video game market The console s high price point surprise launch and difficulty handling polygonal graphics were factors in its lack of success Sega also underestimated the continued popularity of the Genesis bit sales accounted for percent of the market in Despite capturing percent of the US market dollar share and selling more than million Genesis units in Kalinske estimated that if prepared for demand another could have been sold br Sega announced that Shoichiro Irimajiri had been appointed chairman and CEO of Sega of America in July while Kalinske left Sega after September of that year A former Honda executive Irimajiri had been involved with Sega of America since joining Sega in The company also announced that Rosen and Nakayama had resigned from their positions at Sega of America though both remained with Sega Bernie Stolar a former executive at Sony Computer Entertainment of America became Sega of America s executive vice president in charge of product development and third party relations Stolar was not supportive of the Saturn believing its hardware was poorly designed br While Stolar had said the Saturn is not our future at E he continued to emphasize the quality of its games and later reflected that we tried to wind it down as cleanly as we could for the consumer At Sony Stolar had opposed the localization of certain Japanese PlayStation games that he felt would not represent the system well in North America He advocated a similar policy for the Saturn generally blocking D arcade games and role playing games from release although he later sought to distance himself from this stance Other changes included a softer image in Sega s advertising including removing the Sega scream and holding press events for the education industry br br Sega partnered with GE to develop the Sega Model arcade system board building on D technology in the arcade industry at the time This led to several successful arcade games including Daytona USA launched in a limited capacity in late and worldwide in Other popular games included Virtua Cop Sega Rally Championship and Virtua Fighter Virtua Fighter and Virtua Fighter became Sega s best selling arcade games of all time surpassing their previous record holder Out Run There was also a technological arms race between Sega and Namco during this period driving the growth of D gaming br Beginning in Sega launched a series of indoor theme parks in Japan under a concept dubbed Amusement Theme Park including Joypolis parks sited in urban Tokyo locations such as Yokohama and Odaiba A rapid overseas rollout was planned with at least locations across the world proposed to be opened by however only two Sega World London and Sega World Sydney would ultimately materialise in September and March respectively Following on from difficulties faced in setting up theme parks in the United States Sega established the GameWorks chain of urban entertainment centers in a joint venture with DreamWorks SKG and Universal Studios during March br In Sega partnered with Atlus to launch Print Club purikura an arcade photo sticker machine that produces selfie photos Atlus and Sega introduced Purikura in February initially at game arcades before expanding to other popular culture locations such as fast food shops train stations karaoke establishments and bowling alleys Purikura became a popular form of entertainment among youths across East Asia laying the foundations for modern selfie culture By about Purikura machines had been sold earning Sega an estimated billion million or equivalent to in from Purikura sales that year Various other similar Purikura machines appeared from other manufacturers with Sega controlling about half of the market in br Sega also made forays in the PC market with the establishment of SegaSoft which was tasked with creating original Saturn and PC games From to Sega also participated in the arcade pinball market when it took over Data East s pinball division renaming it Sega Pinball br In January Sega announced its intentions to merge with the Japanese toy maker Bandai The merger planned as a billion stock swap whereby Sega would wholly acquire Bandai was set to form a company known as Sega Bandai Ltd Though it was to be finalized in October of that year it was called off in May after growing opposition from Bandai s mid level executives Bandai instead agreed to a business alliance with Sega As a result of Sega s deteriorating financial situation Nakayama resigned as Sega president in January in favor of Irimajiri Nakayama s resignation may have in part been due to the failure of the merger as well as Sega s performance Stolar became CEO and president of Sega of America br After the launch of the Nintendo in the US during sales of the Saturn and its games fell sharply in much of the west The PlayStation outsold the Saturn three to one in the US in and the latter failed to gain a foothold in Europe and Australia where the Nintendo would not release until March After several years of declining profits Sega had a slight increase in the fiscal year ended March partly driven by increasing arcade revenue while outperforming Nintendo during the mid term period However in the fiscal year ending March Sega suffered its first financial loss since its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as both a parent company and a corporation as a whole Shortly before the announcement of the losses Sega discontinued the Saturn in North America to prepare for the launch of its successor the Dreamcast releasing remaining games in low quantities br The decision to discontinue the Saturn effectively left the North American home console market without Sega games for over a year with most of its activity in the country coming from arcade divisions The Saturn lasted longer in some Europe territories and particularly Japan with it notably outperforming the Nintendo in the latter Nonetheless Irimajiri confirmed in an interview with Japanese newspaper Daily Yomiuri that Saturn development would stop at the end of and games would continue to be produced until mid With lifetime sales of million units the Saturn is retrospectively considered a commercial failure in much of the world While Sega had success with the Model arcade board and titles like Virtua Fighter Sega s arcade divisions struggled in the West during the late s On the other hand Sega s arcade divisions were more successful in Asia with Sega s overall arcade revenues increasing year on year throughout the late s but it was not enough to offset the significant declining revenues of Sega s home consumer divisions br br br Dreamcast and continuing struggles br br Despite a percent drop in half year profits just before the Japanese launch of the Dreamcast Sega felt confident about its new system The Dreamcast attracted significant interest and drew many pre orders Sega announced that Sonic Adventure the next game starring company mascot Sonic the Hedgehog would be a Dreamcast launch game It was promoted with a large scale public demonstration at the Tokyo Kokusai Forum Hall Due to a high failure rate in the manufacturing process Sega could not ship enough consoles for the Dreamcast s Japanese launch As more than half of its limited stock had been pre ordered Sega stopped pre orders in Japan Before the launch Sega announced the release of its New Arcade Operation Machine Idea NAOMI arcade system board which served as a cheaper alternative to the Sega Model NAOMI shared technology with the Dreamcast allowing nearly identical ports of arcade games br The Dreamcast launched in Japan on November The entire stock of consoles sold out by the end of the day Irimajiri estimated that another to Dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply He hoped to sell more than a million Dreamcast units in Japan by February but less than were sold The low sales undermined Sega s attempts to build up a sufficient installed base to ensure the Dreamcast s survival after the arrival of competition from other manufacturers Sega suffered a further billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March and announced plans to eliminate jobs nearly a quarter of its workforce Before the Western launch Sega reduced the price of the Dreamcast in Japan by JP effectively making it unprofitable but increasing sales br On August Sega of America confirmed that Stolar had been fired Peter Moore whom Stolar had hired as a Sega of America executive only six months before was placed in charge of the North American launch The Dreamcast launched in North America on September with games Sega set a record by selling more than Dreamcast units in hours earning million in what Moore called the biggest hours in entertainment retail history Within two weeks US Dreamcast sales exceeded By Christmas Sega held percent of the US video game market by revenue On November Sega announced it had sold more than a million Dreamcast units Nevertheless the launch was marred by a glitch at one of Sega s manufacturing plants which produced defective GD ROMs where data was not properly recorded onto the disc Sega released the Dreamcast in Europe on October While Sega sold units in Europe by Christmas sales there slowed and by October Sega had sold only about a million units br Though the Dreamcast was successful Sony s PlayStation still held percent of the overall market share in North America at the end of On March in what one report called a highly publicized vaporware like announcement Sony revealed the first details of the PlayStation The same year Nintendo announced that its next console would meet or exceed anything on the market and Microsoft began development of its own console the Xbox Sega s initial momentum proved fleeting as US Dreamcast sales which exceeded million by the end of began to decline as early as January Poor Japanese sales contributed to Sega s billion million consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March This followed a similar loss of billion the previous year and marked Sega s third consecutive annual loss Sega s overall sales for the term increased percent and Dreamcast sales in North America and Europe greatly exceeded its expectations However this coincided with a decrease in profitability due to the investments required to launch the Dreamcast in Western markets and poor software sales in Japan At the same time worsening conditions reduced the profitability of Sega s Japanese arcade business prompting the closure of locations br Moore became the president and chief operating officer of Sega of America on May He said the Dreamcast would need to sell million units in the US by the end of to remain viable but Sega fell short of this goal with some million units sold Moreover Sega s attempts to spur Dreamcast sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses In March Sega posted a consolidated net loss of billion million While the PlayStation s October US launch was marred by shortages this did not benefit the Dreamcast as much as expected as many disappointed consumers continued to wait or purchased a PSone Eventually Sony and Nintendo held and percent of the US video game market while Sega held only percent br br br Shift to third party software development br br CSK chairman Isao Okawa replaced Irimajiri as president of Sega on May Okawa had long advocated that Sega abandon the console business Others shared this view Sega co founder David Rosen had always felt it was a bit of a folly for them to be limiting their potential to Sega hardware and Stolar had suggested Sega should have sold the company to Microsoft In a September meeting with Sega s Japanese executives and heads of its first party game studios Moore and Sega of America executive Charles Bellfield recommended that Sega abandon its console business In response the studio heads walked out Sega announced an official company name change from Sega Enterprises Ltd to Sega Corporation effective November Sega stated in a release that this was to display its commitment to its network entertainment business br On January Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shinbun reported that Sega would cease production of the Dreamcast and develop software for other platforms After an initial denial Sega released a press release confirming it was considering producing software for the PlayStation and Game Boy Advance as part of its new management policy On January Sega announced the discontinuation of the Dreamcast after March and the restructuring of the company as a platform agnostic third party developer Sega also announced a Dreamcast price reduction to eliminate its unsold inventory estimated at units as of April This was followed by further reductions to clear the remaining inventory The final manufactured Dreamcast was autographed by the heads of all nine of Sega s first party game studios plus the heads of sports game developer Visual Concepts and audio studio Wave Master and given away with all first party Dreamcast games through a competition organized by GamePro br Okawa who had loaned Sega million in died on March Shortly before his death he forgave Sega s debts to him and returned his million worth of Sega and CSK stock helping the company survive the third party transition He held failed talks with Microsoft about a sale or merger with their Xbox division According to former Microsoft executive Joachim Kempin Microsoft founder Bill Gates decided against acquiring Sega because he didn t think that Sega had enough muscle to eventually stop Sony A business alliance with Microsoft was announced whereby Sega would develop games for the Xbox As part of the restructuring nearly one third of Sega s Tokyo workforce was laid off in was Sega s fifth consecutive fiscal year of net losses br After Okawa s death Hideki Sato a year Sega veteran who had worked on Sega s consoles

pachislot manufacturing company and Namco The president of Sammy Hajime Satomi had been mentored by Okawa and was previously asked to be CEO of Sega On February Sega announced that it would merge with Sammy however as late as April Sega was still in talks with Namco which was attempting to overturn the merger Sega s consideration of Namco s offer upset Sammy executives The day after Sega announced it no longer planned to merge with Sammy Namco withdrew its offer br In Sato and COO Tetsu Kamaya stepped down Sato was replaced by Hisao Oguchi the head of the Sega studio Hitmaker Moore left Sega in

Center Business Sega s theme parks and arcades and Pachislot and Pachinko Business Sammy s pachinko and pachislot business br According to an industry survey as of sales of arcade machines were up for the previous four years in Japan while down for nine straight years overseas In response to the decline of the global arcade industry in the late s Sega created several novel concepts tailored to the Japanese market Derby Owners Club was an arcade machine with memory cards for data storage designed to take over half an hour to complete and costing JP to play Testing of Derby Owners Club in a Chicago arcade showed that it had become the most popular machine at the location with a replay rate While the eight player Japanese version of the game was released in the game was reduced to a smaller four player version due to size issues and released in North America in The cabinet was too expensive and the game did not entice casual users which are essential to the western arcade market While the Japanese market retained core players western arcades had become more focused on casual players and Sega Amusements Europe the entity created to officially distribute and manufacture Sega s machines on the continent after the consolidation of its regional divisions subsequently decided to develop more games locally that were better suited to western tastes br In the GameWorks chain of
