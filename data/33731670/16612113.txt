Nintendo released the Game Boy which became the first handheld console to sell in large numbers In the early s Nintendo s market lead began to decrease although the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES was a strong seller the Sega Genesis was a very strong contender Nintendo and Sega would both lose a significant portion of the console market towards the end of the s as Sony s PlayStation

developers Many of Nintendo s most iconic franchises such as The Legend of Zelda and Metroid were started on the NES Nintendo continued to repair Famicom consoles in Japan until October attributing

third home console second outside of Japan following the Nintendo Entertainment System Whereas the earlier console had struggled in the PAL region and large parts of Asia the SNES was a global success albeit one that could not match its predecessor s popularity in Northeast Asia and North America due in part to increased competition from Sega s Genesis console Despite its relatively late start the

GameCube is the most compact sixth generation console The GameCube is Nintendo s first game console to use optical discs rather than game cartridges An agreement with the optical drive manufacturer Matsushita led to a DVD playing GameCube system named the Panasonic Q which was only released in Japan Much of Nintendo s core line up centered on sequels to their established hit franchises such as

although the former franchise had seen a Japan exclusive release on the N The GameCube has sold million units br br br Wii br br Nintendo released the Wii on November as their seventh generation home console Nintendo designed the console to appeal towards a wider audience than those of its main competitors the PlayStation and Xbox including casual players and audiences that were new to video games br These aims were emphasized by the console s distinguishing feature the Wii Remote a handheld motion controller that can detect motion and rotation in three dimensions using a mixture of internal sensors and infrared positioning The controller includes an expansion port that can be used to connect other accessories such as the Nunchuk an attachment with an analog stick and additional buttons a Classic Controller gamepad providing a traditional control scheme and Wii MotionPlus an accessory designed to enhance the motion detection capabilities of the original Wii Remote models br The Wii s internal hardware is an updated derivative of that of the GameCube in comparison to its seventh generation competitors the Wii had lower overall graphics capabilities and does not output in high definition The Wii also featured internet enabled features the Nintendo Wi Fi Connection service allowed supported games to offer online multiplayer and other features while the WiiConnect feature allowed messages and updates to be downloaded while the console was in standby Through Wii Shop Channel additional games and apps can be downloaded or purchased for the console including Virtual Console a selection of classic video games emulated from older consoles That service was discontinued as of January Early models of the Wii also had backwards compatibility with GameCube games and controllers but this was dropped from later hardware revisions namely the Wii Family Edition and the Wii Mini br The Wii was a major success for Nintendo in April the Wall Street Journal declared that Nintendo had become the company to beat in the games business citing the success of the Wii and the portable Nintendo DS line As of March the Wii has sold million consoles worldwide Wii Sports a

mainstream audience br br br Wii U br br The Wii U was released on November as a direct successor to the Wii and the first entry in the eighth generation of home video game consoles The Wii U s distinguishing hardware feature is the GamePad a tablet like controller which contains a touchscreen that wirelessly streams a video output from the console The GamePad s display can be used to provide alternative or complementary perspectives within a game or as the main display instead of a television In particular Nintendo promoted the concept of asymmetric multiplayer where a player with the GamePad would have a different objective and perspective than that of other players Alongside the GamePad the Wii U supports Wii controllers and games A conventional gamepad known as the Wii U Pro Controller was also released br The Wii U features more extensive online functionality than the Wii using the Nintendo Network platform as with the Wii it supports online multiplayer and downloading and purchasing new games and apps but also allows video chat It previously featured an internal social network known as Miiverse which allowed users to write and draw posts in game specific communities the service was discontinued on November Nintendo also attempted to provide second screen experiences for television programming for the Wii U through a feature known as Nintendo TVii but it was discontinued outside of Japan in August Unlike the Wii the Wii U s hardware is capable of high definition graphics br The Wii U was met with low adoption attributed by Nintendo executives to a lack of third party support poor marketing of the system which led to a lack of clarity of the Wii U game pad from being a tablet device and the subsequent release of the PlayStation and Xbox One the following year However some critics argued that the Wii U still had advantages over PS and Xbox One including its lower cost and notable early exclusives such as Super Mario D World Sales steadily increased following the release of several notable first party exclusives including new entries in the Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros franchises and the new franchise Splatoon br In January a

Tiger Electronics and their Star Wars themed games Nintendo s Game Watch units were eventually superseded by the original Game Boy Each Game Watch was only able to play one game due to the use of a
