Jeremy Parish considers it an important and influential handheld for being a technological bridge between the bit portable era and the Game Boy Advance and for its clicky stick having been used for modern video game consoles He praised the game s small library for its quality and wide selection of genres specifically titles such as SNK vs Capcom Card Fighters Clash Sonic Pocket Adventure Magical Drop and Pac Man and for the system s build quality being robust and well built Parish blamed the system s commercial failure on both SNK s large lack of retail presence and for Aruze acquiring the company in concluding the article with Neo Geo Pocket Color s life may have been painfully brief but it was nevertheless memorable for those who experienced it Perhaps all the more so for the system s brevity in fact Ryan Lamble of Den of Geek felt that the Neo Geo Pocket Color was the best rival to Nintendo s Game Boy Color for its brilliant game library design and overall quality Lamble expressed somber towards the system s early defeat in the handheld market saying It was a premature end for a system that although doomed to remain a distant second to the Game Boy could have forged a great little niche of its own NintendoLife s Damien McFerran said that both it and the WonderSwan served as some of the most interesting challengers towards Nintendo He commended the system for its game library and clamshell boxes hardware capabilities battery life and lasting legacy on future systems writing Like the WonderSwan the Neo Geo Pocket Color may not have succeeded in its goal of wrestling market share away from Nintendo but that doesn t automatically mean it was a failure Many fans will argue that the quality of the software available was far in advance of that on the Game Boy Color and the fantastic controls amazing battery life cool PDA features and excellent screen combine to make a system which is still hard to put down even today br br br See also br List of Neo Geo Pocket
