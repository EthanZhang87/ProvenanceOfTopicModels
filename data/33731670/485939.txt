id: 485939
The fifth generation era also known as the bit era the bit era or the D era refers to computer and video games video game consoles and handheld gaming consoles dating from approximately October to March The best selling home console was the Sony PlayStation followed by the Nintendo and Sega Saturn The PlayStation also had a redesigned version the PSone which was launched on July br Some features that distinguished fifth generation consoles from previous fourth generation consoles include br br D polygon graphics with texture mapping br D graphics capabilities lighting Gouraud shading anti aliasing and texture filtering br Optical disc CD ROM game storage allowing much larger storage space up to MB than ROM cartridges br CD quality audio recordings music and speech PCM audio with bit depth and kHz sampling rate br Wide adoption of full motion video displaying pre rendered computer animation or live action footage br Analog controllers br Display resolutions from i p to i br Color depth up to colors bit true color br This era is known for its pivotal role in the video game industry s leap from D to D computer graphics as well as the shift in home console games from being stored on ROM cartridges to optical discs This was also the first generation to feature internet connectivity some systems had additional hardware which provided connectivity to an existing device like the Sega Net Link for the Sega Saturn The Apple Pippin a commercial flop was the first system to feature on board internet capabilities br For handhelds this era was characterized by significant fragmentation because the first handheld of the generation the Sega Nomad had a lifespan of just two years and the Nintendo Virtual Boy had a lifespan of less than one Both of them were discontinued before the other handhelds made their debut The Neo Geo Pocket was released on October but was dropped by SNK in favor of the fully backward compatible Neo Geo Pocket Color just a year later Nintendo s Game Boy Color was the most successful handheld by a large margin There were also two minor updates of the original Game Boy the Game Boy Light released in Japan only and the Game Boy Pocket br There was considerable time overlap between this generation and the next the sixth generation of consoles which began with the launch of the Dreamcast in Japan on November The fifth generation ended with the discontinuation of the PlayStation specifically its re engineered form the PSOne on March a year after the launch of the seventh generation br br br History br br br Transition to D br br The bit bit era is most noted for the rise of fully D polygon games While there were games prior that had used three dimensional polygon environments such as Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter in the arcades and Star Fox on the Super NES it was in this era that many game designers began to move traditionally D and pseudo D genres into D on video game consoles Early efforts from then industry leaders Sega and Nintendo saw the introduction of the X and Super FX which provided rudimentary D capabilities to the bit Genesis and Super NES Starting in D video games began to take off with releases such as Virtua Fighter on the Saturn Tomb Raider on the PlayStation and Saturn Tekken and Crash Bandicoot on the PlayStation and Super Mario on the Nintendo Their D environments were widely marketed and they steered the industry s focus away from side scrolling and rail style titles as well as opening doors to more complex games and genres D became the main focus in this era as well as a slow decline of cartridges in favor of CDs due to the ability to produce games less expensively and the media s high storage capabilities br br br CD vs cartridge br br After allowing Sony to develop a CD based prototype console for them and a similar failed partnership with Philips Nintendo decided to make the Nintendo a cartridge based system like its predecessors Publicly Nintendo defended this decision on the grounds that it would give games shorter load times than a compact disc and would decrease piracy due to a certain chip in the ROM cartridge However it also had the dubious benefit of allowing Nintendo to charge higher licensing fees as cartridge production was considerably more expensive than CD production Many third party developers like EA Sports viewed this as an underhanded attempt to raise more money for Nintendo and many of them became more reluctant to release games on the N br Nintendo s decision to use a cartridge based system sparked a debate in the video game magazines as to which was better The chief advantages of the CD ROM format were larger storage capacity allowing for a much greater amount of game content considerably lower manufacturing costs making them much less risky for game publishers lower retail prices due to the reduced need to compensate for manufacturing costs and shorter production times which greatly reduced the need for publishers to predict the demand for a game Its disadvantages compared to cartridge were considerable load times their inability to load data on the fly making them reliant on the console RAM and the greater manufacturing costs of CD ROM drives compared to cartridge slots resulting in generally higher retail prices for CD based consoles A Nintendo Power ad placed a Space Shuttle representing cartridges next to a snail representing a CD as an analogy for their respective speeds stating that the future doesn t belong to snails br Almost every other contemporary system used the new CD ROM technology Consequent to the storage and cost advantages of the CD ROM format many game developers shifted their support away from the Nintendo to the PlayStation One of the most influential game franchises to change consoles during this era was the Final Fantasy series beginning with Final Fantasy VII which was developed for the PlayStation instead of the N due to storage capacity issues prior Final Fantasy games had all been published on Nintendo consoles either the NES or Super NES with the only other entries being on the Wonderswan or computers like the MSX br br br Overview of the fifth generation consoles br The fifth generation was characterized by an unusually high number of console formats More competing consoles comprised this generation than any other since the video game crash of leading video game magazines of the time to frequently predict a second crash br br br Major consoles br The DO Interactive Multiplayer was one of the earliest fifth generation consoles and was released in October Despite having massive third party support and an unprecedented amount of hype for a first time entrant into the industry it had early difficulties due to software development delays and its high price For its initial release the DO had a retail price tag and only a single available game ready for market The DO would be discontinued only three years later While generally regarded as a failed system the DO was this generation s fourth best selling console in a crowded field with sales of million units br The Sega Saturn was Sega s entry into the stand alone bit console market It was released in Japan simultaneously with the X in November although it would not have a North American release until six months later It became Sega s most successful console in Japan In America and Europe however a disastrous launch and an MSRP of compared to the PlayStation s caused it to be a commercial failure selling far fewer units than the Master System and Mega Drive Genesis before it br The PlayStation released in early December was the most successful console of this generation With attention given by third party developers and a more mature marketing campaign aimed at the age group enabling it to achieve market dominance it became the first home console to ship million units worldwide br The Nintendo originally announced as the Ultra was released in The system s delays and use of the expensive cartridge format made it an unpopular platform among third party developers Several popular first party titles allowed the Nintendo to maintain strong sales in the United States but it remained a distant second to the PlayStation br br br Other consoles br The Amiga CD was released in September and sold in Europe Australia Canada and Brazil It was never released in the United States due to Commodore s bankruptcy and court ordered import restrictions Despite promising initial sales the console was hampered by poor software quality with many titles being simply re releases of older games Production of the Amiga CD was discontinued after only eight months br The Atari Jaguar was released in November and was marketed as the world s first bit system However sales at launch were well below the incumbent fourth generation consoles and a small games library rooted in a shortage of third party support made it impossible for the Jaguar to catch up selling below units The system s bit nature was also questioned by many Its only add on the Jaguar CD was released in and was produced in limited quantities due to the low install base of the system The bit Atari Panther set to be released in was canceled due to unexpectedly rapid progress in developing the Jaguar br The Sega X an add on console produced by Sega for the Genesis was launched in November The Sega Neptune a standalone version of the X was announced but ultimately canceled Sega failed to deliver a steady flow of games for the X platform With customers anticipating the PlayStation on the horizon and with Sega s more technically advanced Saturn already competing on the market in Japan sales of the X were poor br NEC creator of the TurboGrafx of the previous generation entered the market with the PC FX in late December The system had a bit processor bit stereo sound and video capability Despite its impressive specifications it did not have a polygon processor and was marketed as a platform for D and full motion video games The PC FX game library was criticized for being low in quality and having titles that relied more on animation than gameplay Due to low expected sales it was never released outside of Japan br In Nintendo released the Virtual Boy a supposedly portable system capable of displaying true D graphics albeit in monochromatic red and black Despite being marketed as a portable system it is not actually portable in practice due to the lack of a head strap Also because of the nature of its display the system reportedly caused headaches and eye strain It was discontinued within a year with fewer than games being released for it Although it sold over units Nintendo felt that it was a failure compared to consoles such as the Super Nintendo which sold over million br br br Aftermath of the fifth generation br By the end of the Christmas shopping season the fifth generation had come down to a struggle between the Sony PlayStation Sega Saturn DO Interactive Multiplayer and the upcoming Nintendo The Amiga CD had already been discontinued the Jaguar and Genesis X were still on the market but were considered a lost cause by industry analysts the Neo Geo CD had proven to appeal only to a niche market and industry analysts had already determined that the yet to launch Apple Bandai Pippin was too expensive to make any impact in the market Moreover even the leading fifth generation consoles were still facing sluggish sales Combined sales for the PlayStation Saturn and DO barely topped million units for the Christmas shopping season as compared to combined sales of million for the Sega Genesis and Super NES Focus groups showed that most children under years old were equally happy playing on fourth generation consoles as they were playing on fifth generation consoles making the fourth generation consoles more appealing to adults buying gifts for children since they were cheaper Industry analysts began putting forth the possibility that the fifth generation of consoles would never overtake the fourth generation in sales and become superseded by a new generation of DVD player consoles before they could achieve mass acceptance br saw the fifth generation consoles fortunes finally turn around With the Saturn PlayStation and Nintendo all showing dramatic increases in sales over the previous year they claimed a combined of the retail market for hardware and software putting them in position to finally overtake the fourth generation consoles in br The Sega Saturn suffered from poor marketing and comparatively limited third party support outside Japan Sega s decision to use dual processors was roundly criticized as this made it difficult to efficiently develop for the console Sega was also hurt by the Saturn s surprise four month early U S launch of their console third party developers who had been planning for the originally scheduled launch could not provide many launch titles and were angered by the move Retailers were caught unprepared resulting in distribution problems some retailers such as the now defunct KB Toys were so furious that they refused to stock the Saturn thereafter br Due to numerous delays the Nintendo was released one year later than its competitors By the time it was finally launched in Sony had already established its dominance the Saturn was starting to struggle and the DO and Jaguar had been discontinued Its use of cartridge media rather than compact discs alienated some developers and publishers due to the space limits the relatively high cost involved and a considerably longer production time In addition the initially high suggested retail price of the console may have driven potential customers away and some early adopters of the system who had paid the initial price may have been angered by Nintendo s decision to cut the price of the system by six months after its release However the Nintendo turned out to be a commercial success particularly in the United States where it sold million units nearly two thirds of its worldwide sales of million units It was also home to highly successful games such as Star Fox Mario Kart The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time The Legend of Zelda Majora s Mask Super Mario GoldenEye Banjo Kazooie and Super Smash Bros While Nintendo sold far more units than the Sega Saturn Atari Jaguar and DO combined it posed no challenge to the PlayStation s lead in the market br By to of American homes played on video game consoles to of these homes owned a console while an additional to rented or shared a console br br br Changes in the industry br After the dust settled in the fifth generation console wars several companies saw their outlooks change drastically br br br Atari br Atari Corporation which was not able to recover its losses ended up merging into JTS Corporation in This caused the Atari name to virtually disappear from the gaming market until when Hasbro Interactive purchased the Atari assets from JTS for million br On May Hasbro Interactive announced that all rights to the Atari Jaguar were released into the public domain thus declaring the platform open this allowed anyone to freely create and publish games for the Jaguar without endorsement or licensing from Hasbro Interactive Since then homebrew developers began to release uncompleted Jaguar games as well as several brand new titles to satisfy the system s cult following br br br Sega br Sega s loss of consumer confidence coupled with its previous console failures along with their financial difficulties set the company up for a similar fate in the next round of console wars br br br Home systems br br br Comparison br br br Other consoles br These consoles are either less notable never saw a worldwide release and or sold particularly poorly and are therefore listed as Other br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Worldwide sales standings br br From to when the PlayStation N and Saturn were the major th generation consoles still on the market Sony managed a market share of the worldwide market followed by Nintendo with with a percentage of that figure from the bit Super NES while Sega was third with with a percentage of that from the Dreamcast br Production of the Sega Saturn was discontinued in Its demise was accelerated by rumors that work on its successor was underway these rumors hurt the systems sales in the west as early as The N was succeeded by the GameCube in but continued its production until however PlayStation production was not ceased as it was redesigned as
