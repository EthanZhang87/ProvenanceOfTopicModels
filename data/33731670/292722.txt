The Game Boy Advance SP GBA SP released in Japan on February is a foldable handheld game console developed released and marketed by Nintendo that served as an upgraded version of the original Game Boy Advance The SP in the name stands for Special It is the penultimate console in the Game Boy Advance product line before the Game Boy Micro which was released in September br br br History br The Game Boy Advance SP was championed by Satoru Okada who led the development of the original Game Boy Advance When Okada first pitched to Nintendo leadership the idea of a small and thin Game Boy Advance that used a rechargeable battery the feedback was almost entirely negative Not deterred Okada told one of his hardware engineers to build a conceptual model as small and thin as possible without regard to the feasibility of manufacturing the device What resulted was the clamshell design of the Game Boy Advance SP When Okada took this conceptual model to the same leadership group that rejected his initial pitch they were quickly won over br In addition to being smaller and using a rechargeable battery the Game Boy Advance SP also addressed a key shortcoming of the original Game Boy Advance the reflective color display that was hard to see in dark conditions br The first Game Boy Advance SP had a frontlight that illuminated the front of the display and a reflective surface behind the screen that sent light back through the liquid crystal pixel elements to the viewer A later revision replaced the frontlight and reflective surface with a backlight that also illuminated the liquid crystal pixel elements br br br Hardware br br br Technical specifications br br br Headphone jack br br Nintendo removed the mm headphone jack from the SP which had been included on all previous Game Boy models Headphones designed specifically for the GBA SP can be purchased or standard headphones can be attached with an optional adapter that plugs into the same port as the AC adapter As both the AC adapter and headphones use the same port it is not possible to charge the SP and listen to headphones at the same time with the Nintendo brand adapter There are however third party adapters that split into two different cords the power jack on one side and a headphone jack on the other br br br Backlit model AGS br br In Nintendo released an improved version of the Game Boy Advance SP in North America featuring a brighter backlit screen instead of the previous version s frontlit screen This GBA SP was Nintendo s first internationally released handheld system to feature an integrated backlight However there had already been a backlit system years earlier with the Japan only Game Boy Light which was essentially a Game Boy Pocket with an electroluminescent backlit display The AGS was never officially released in Japan however and the frontlit AGS models were still available on the market until the end of production br The new model can be distinguished by the following features br br The box states Now with a BRIGHTER backlit screen to distinguish the new model from the older frontlit models br The model number of the backlit SP is AGS whereas the model number of the original frontlit SP is AGS This can be found on the label at the bottom of the unit br The mini button at the top center of the console s lower face is now referred to in the manual as the Brightness Switch and selects between two levels of brightness Normal Low and Bright High with no off setting On the frontlit models this button turned the frontlight on or off only With the backlight set to Normal Low the brightness still surpasses the original AGS with the frontlight on br When powered off the backlit model s screen is completely black but the frontlit model s screen is noticeably lighter br The North American backlit version comes in three standard colors Pearl Blue Pearl Pink and Graphite a greyer version of Onyx Black There were also two Toys R Us exclusive backlit models a SpongeBob SquarePants model and a Limited Edition Pikachu model br In the AGS backlit model also saw a very limited release in Europe Few models made it to market likely due to the release of the Game Boy Advance compatible Nintendo DS one year prior The European version was released in Surf Blue as well as re issued in Pink and Tribal editions br Unlike the North American release the European box does not feature any prominent text to distinguish the backlit models from the older frontlit models In addition only the Surf Blue color was unique to the AGS the other two colors Pink and Tribal had already been released as frontlit models for these reasons it can be very difficult to identify a European backlit SP Apart from the AGS model number on the base of the unit the only other obvious distinguishing feature of the European backlit model is the large picture of the Game Boy Advance SP featured on the front of the box The European frontlit models of Pink and Tribal only feature small pictures of the Game Boy Advance SP on the sides of the box and Flower Tattoo patterns on the front respectively br The AGS Game Boy Advance SP was the final Nintendo handheld to have backward compatibility with Game Boy and Game Boy Color games in North America and Europe br br br Unit colors br The GBA SP launched in Platinum Silver and Cobalt Blue with the addition of Onyx in Europe and Japan Later colors include Flame Red Pearl Pink Pearl Blue Graphite Midnight Blue Charizard Fire Red Torchic Orange Venusaur Leaf Green Groudon Red Kyogre Blue Rayquaza Green NES classic design and Pikachu Yellow A limited gold edition with a Triforce and the Hyrule Royal Family crest was available in Europe which included a copy of The Legend of Zelda The Minish Cap In Toys R Us sold an exclusive gold edition without any Zelda symbols in the US starting on Black Friday of that year initially with a Super Mario Advance game br In Japan it was released in a variety of standard colors and special packages In most other regions it was released in Platinum Silver and Charcoal Black Later a Flame Red version was released Six special editions have also been released an NES Classics model with the same color scheme as a classic NES controller and designed to resemble an NES deck when closed a SpongeBob SquarePants model a Pikachu model and a silver model with a tattoo design printed on it known as the Tribal Edition In other regions such as Europe Asia and the Middle East additional colors have been released such as Pearl Green and Starlight Gold br The Game Boy Advance SP had other limited editions br br br Reception br M Wiley of IGN called the Game Boy Advance SP a step in the right direction for Nintendo praising the system s new redesign over the original GBA and highlighting its inclusion of a backlit screen and rechargeable battery although minor criticism went towards the system s omission of a headphone jack Engadget gave it a global score of out of also praising the new features of the redesign while noting the system s lack of a headphone jack Lawson Wong of Fresh Gear called it darn close to perfection aside from the missing headphone jack Matthew D Sarrel of PC Magazine suggested it to consumers as an improvement over the original model praising the backlight and integration of a charger as well as improved visual quality though he noted that players with larger hands may find difficulty with the system s design br br br Sales br As of June the Game Boy Advance series has sold million units worldwide of which
