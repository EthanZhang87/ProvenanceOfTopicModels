The PlayStation Vita PS Vita is a handheld game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment It was first released in Japan on December and in North America Europe and other international territories beginning on February The console is the successor to the PlayStation Portable and a part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles it primarily competed with the Nintendo DS br The original model of the handheld includes a inch mm OLED multi touch capacitive touchscreen two analog joysticks and front and shoulder push button input and supports Bluetooth Wi Fi and optional G The Vita features a quad core ARM Cortex A MPCore CPU and a quad core SGX MP GPU The PS Vita series a revised version of the system was released across and It has all of the same features with a slightly smaller size extended battery life and an LCD panel instead of an OLED Sony released the PlayStation TV a short lived re purposed version of the Vita that uses a television screen like a home video game console discontinued at the end of br The Vita s design was intended to meld the experience of big budget dedicated video game platforms with the then up and coming trend of mobile gaming as seen on smart phones and tablets However in the year after the device s successful launch sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled threatening to end its lifespan A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West combined with strong support from mid level Japanese companies helped keep the platform afloat Though this led to less diversity in its game library it strengthened support in JRPGs visual novels and Western developed indie games This built moderate sales in Japan and a smaller yet passionate userbase in the West Though Sony has not released exact sales figures estimates are around to million units In the platform s later years Sony promoted the PlayStation Vita s ability to work in conjunction with its other gaming products such as Remote Play of PlayStation games similar to the Wii U s function of Off TV Play br The platform stalled in upon the release of the Nintendo Switch and was completely discontinued in The system is regarded as a commercial failure in the video game industry and was significantly outsold by the Nintendo DS No direct successor was released by Sony though in a similar remote play accessory PlayStation Portal was announced for release by the end of the year for the PlayStation br br br History br br br Background br After the success of Nintendo s Game Boy family of handheld game consoles throughout the s and early s with little market competition and Sony s massive success with its PlayStation and PlayStation home video game consoles around the same time Sony entered the handheld market as well In it released the PlayStation Portable PSP to compete with the Nintendo DS as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles After a slow start in the worldwide market it was invigorated in Japan with multiple releases in the Monster Hunter series With the series being less popular in western regions it failed to revive the platform in the same way The PSP ended up being a mixed result for the company It was seen as a success in that it was the only handheld video game platform that had ever significantly competed with Nintendo for market share with almost million units sold in its lifespan roughly the same amount as Nintendo s Game Boy Advance had during the sixth generation of video game consoles This is only a little more than half of the sales of its actual market competitor the DS which was more than million units by the end of br Rumors of a successor to the PSP came as early as July when Eurogamer reported that Sony was working on such a device which would utilize the PowerVR SGX MP processor and perform at a level similar to the original Xbox Through mid websites continued to run stories about accounts of the existence of a PSP Reports arose during the Tokyo Game Show that the device was unveiled internally during a private meeting during mid September held at Sony Computer Entertainment s headquarters in Aoyama Tokyo Shortly after reports of development kits for the handheld had reportedly already been shipped to numerous video game developers including both first party and third party developers to start making games for the device a report later confirmed by Mortal Kombat Executive Producer Shaun Himmerick By November Senior Vice President of Electronic Arts Patrick Soderlund confirmed that he had seen that the PlayStation Portable successor existed but could not confirm details In the same month VG released pictures of an early prototype version showing a PSP Go like slide screen design along with two analog sticks two cameras and a microphone though the report mentioned that overheating issues had since caused them to move away from the design in favor of a model more similar to the original PlayStation Portable device br Throughout Sony would not confirm these reports of a PSP successor but would make comments regarding making future hardware Shuhei Yoshida President of SCE Worldwide Studios revealed that his studio despite usually being more involved with software had a continued role in future hardware development at the time In December Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Kazuo Hirai stated that Sony aimed to appeal to a wide demographic of people by using multiple input methods on future hardware buttons and joysticks for traditional handheld game system users and touchscreens for smart phone users The device was officially announced by Sony on January at their PlayStation Meeting press conference held by the company in Japan The system only known by its code name Next Generation Portable NGP was announced to be a handheld gaming device that aimed for PlayStation quality visuals which was later clarified to not be taken at a literal level because according to David Coombes platform research manager at Sony Computer Entertainment America Well it s not going to run at GHz like the PS because the battery would last five minutes and it would probably set fire to your pants Its power was later described by Sony engineers as about halfway between the PSP and PS As rumors had suggested the device was designed to present the best of both worlds between mobile and handheld gaming including a inch OLED touchscreen a rear touchpad coupled with physical buttons and dual analog sticks Sony also revealed that the device would be using a mix of retail and digital distribution of games Further details were announced at Game Developers Conference including that Sony would be dropping the PSP s UMD disc format in favor of small game cartridges of GB or GB size variants along with two cameras facial detection head detection and tracking capabilities br br br Launch and early years br On June at E Sony announced that the device s official name would be the PlayStation Vita with the word vita being Latin for life Mark Cerny was the lead architect of the device Despite reports of the earthquakes in Japan delaying the release of the device Sony reconfirmed that it was on track for a late release in Japan and a February release date for other major regions of the world The release date was later narrowed down to a December release in Japan and a February release date for America and Europe although a limited edition was released a week earlier in North America on February which included the G Wi Fi model of the device the game Little Deviants a limited edition carry case and a GB memory card The Vita launched with titles in Japan with Sony announcing that there were over titles in development prior to the system s release overall The Vita launched in the west with titles including original titles such as Uncharted Golden Abyss and Wipeout and ports of games such as FIFA and Rayman Origins br The sales of the Vita started strong at launch but then stalled and greatly underperformed The Vita had a strong launch in Japan selling over units in its first week of availability though figures shortly afterwards shrunk down to under sold in its second week and then settled into about sold per week in the following weeks Similarly in the United States the system debuted with units sold in the first month before slinking down into an amount of about a month million units were reported as sold as of February after it had launched in most regions The system continued to get high profile games over the course of including Gravity Rush LittleBigPlanet PS Vita Sonic All Stars Racing Transformed Persona Golden Assassin s Creed III Liberation and Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified Despite this the system still only managed to sell million units worldwide in its first months on the market and estimated by analysts to only be at million units sold after two years of availability After Sony ceased releasing direct sales figures of the Vita instead opting to release combined sales figures with it and the PSP Still the system under performed while Sony projected selling million units of combined Vita and PSP systems it had to slash its forecast twice in the same year down to and then million units sold br With higher profile games not pushing the system sales enough in big third party companies like Ubisoft and Activision started reducing or eliminating support for the system especially in the West Additionally while the Monster Hunter series had significantly boosted the sales of the PSP its absence instead hurt the Vita Its developer Capcom had decided to release Monster Hunter Tri and future Monster Hunter games exclusively on the Nintendo DS where it would sell millions of copies for Sony s main competitor With support diminishing Shahid Ahmad Sony s Director of Strategic Content instead began a new approach to software through directly reaching out to and making accommodations for smaller independent developers who had previously released games for mobile and PC platforms While not completely reversing the sales trends of the Vita the lower costs of making or porting smaller budget games made it easier for developers to make a profit on the system s smaller userbase and in turn increased consumer attention on the console keeping the device afloat Fez Spelunky Hotline Miami and OlliOlli all found success with releases on Vita Ahmad also maintained interest in the device by directly interacting with consumers on social media the game Tales of Hearts R was localized into English only because it was number one in a survey of games desired on the platform Sony continued to support the system with games through as well albeit lesser so with titles such as Killzone Mercenary and Tearaway along with a handful of other Western developed ports such as FIFA and Rayman Legends br While the focus on indie games kept the device afloat in the West in Japan no such measures were necessary as the Vita maintained moderate hardware sales While it was routinely outsold by its main competitor the Nintendo DS the Vita still managed to be one of the top consoles sold overall partially due to Japan s preference towards handheld gaming Strong support by Japanese developers also helped with companies such as Bandai Namco Falcom Koei Tecmo pb Compile Heart Spike Chunsoft and Atlus releasing many games in the JRPG and visual novels genre to help keep a steady flow of mid level releases coming to the system Additionally big games such as Final Fantasy X X HD Remaster sold well and roughly in line with their home console counterparts The heavier support from Japan in turn also helped support the system in the West as well with many games in the Atelier Ys Danganronpa Persona and Trails series localized into English on the Vita or made playable through the system s backward compatibility with digital PSP games br While the system managed to stay afloat as a minor success other issues continued to persist including the high price of the system in comparison to its main competitor the Nintendo DS and its sibling device the PS the high price of its memory cards used for game and data storage and the increasing popularity of smartphones and tablets In August Sony addressed the first two dropping the price to in North America and in Europe and cutting the suggested retail price of the memory cards as well The price cut also coincided with the release of a slight redesign of the system the PS Vita model The redesign included making the system thinner and lighter while adding GB of internal storage and an extra hour of battery life However the redesign did remove the OLED screen in favor of a cheaper LCD screen br br br Shifting focus br Towards the end of around the launch of Sony s next video game device the home video game console the PlayStation Sony began making comments in regard to the change in focus with the Vita Yoshida stated that Sony would be releasing fewer first party games for the platform Sony Computer Entertainment s Product Planning Platform Software Innovation Director Don Mesa stated that the economics simply don t work with the traditional process Sony addressed the economics of Vita game development issue with beginning on focusing on the fact that almost all PlayStation games could be streamed and played through a Vita through Remote Play Sony attempted to attach the device to the PS due to its extreme popularity it took only a few weeks for the sales to surpass the sales of the Vita over the course of almost two years In July Yoshida stated that the company would focus on it less as a dedicated handheld video game console and more on its combination of uses stating it s not about individual Vita games any more It s more about how Vita can have multiple uses with PS Remote Play PS games with PS Now and the dedicated games The whole ecosystem with PS at the center the Vita s a part of that Sony later announced that the Vita will have PlayStation VR integration in the form of a second screen as well Open beta trials for PlayStation Now functionality on the PS Vita began on October in North America The PlayStation TV released across late and also aimed to expand the system s userbase by allowing for Vita games to be played on a television like a home console though the device was discontinued in the West by the end of and did not fare well in Japan s handheld focused region either In November SCEA president Shawn Layden suggested that the new approach was working on hardware level stating that Vita sales had increased since the implementation of PS Remote Play though he and another Sony representative did not give specific figures Sony continued to make games for the device though in smaller number than in past The last major Sony developed title Freedom Wars still found success selling over copies in its first week of release in Japan The debut was the highest Sony game debut for the system and the second highest only to Namco Bandai s late release of God Eater on the platform br In September Yoshida stated that Sony had no current plans for a Vita successor stating that climate is not healthy for now because of the huge dominance of mobile gaming At E he had stated that Sony would not be making any more AAA big budget games to the system but by October the comment had been revised that Sony would not be making any more games for it at all Reasons cited included the company focusing on supporting the PS and the fact that it felt that third party Japanese developers and Western indie developers were sufficiently supporting the device In March Sony announced that instead it would be forming a new company Forward Works and be instead concentrating on bringing PlayStation based games to mobile platforms like iOS and Android br Despite Sony s focus on the PS and mobile for the future the Vita still continued to receive substantial third party company game support in the way of Japanese style role playing games and visual novels and Western style indie video games through Minecraft in particular was successful for the platform with it selling over million physical copies in Japan alone as of September The device is considered to have sold fairly well in Japan and still a crucial part of Sony s overall strategy in the region while Sony has acknowledged that the device still has a very vocal and passionate user base in the West as well with the company still encouraging third party companies to create games for the device At the Game Developers Conference research analyst firm EEDAR estimated the sales of the Vita to be about at million units sold through the end of Multi platform releases with the PS have also incidentally helped sustain the Vita s stream of software even in the west through and games receive a Vita version more to appeal to Japan s larger Vita user base and receive a PS version more to appeal to North America s larger user base The March launch of the Nintendo Switch which operates on a similar concept of providing high budget video games on a portable unit further overshadowed the Vita though niche support through indie games and JRPGs continued into the year In mid Glixel estimated the Vita userbase to be around million br On September Sony announced at Tokyo Game Show that the Vita would be discontinued in ending its hardware production Production of new physical Vita games in Europe and America ceased by the end of Sony s fiscal year which ended on March At the time of the announcement USgamer estimated that the Vita userbase had grown to approximately million units Production of Vita hardware officially ended on March In March Sony announced that the Vita s online storefront would be closing on August making it impossible to purchase digital games for the platform though still allowing for the download of previously purchased games this decision was later reversed following consumer feedback br br br Hardware br br In line with Sony s ambition to combine aspects of traditional video game consoles with mobile devices like smartphones and tablets the Vita contains a multitude of input methods The device features a super oval shape similar to the design of the original PlayStation Portable with a inch mm qHD OLED capacitive touchscreen in the centre of the device The device features two analog sticks a D pad a set of standard PlayStation face buttons and two shoulder buttons L and R a PlayStation button and Start and Select buttons Motion control is also possible through Sony s Sixaxis motion sensing system consisting of a three axis gyroscope and a three axis accelerometer In addition to these input methods specific to just the Vita is a secondary touchpad that is on the back of the device br Other hardware includes stereo speakers a microphone built in Wi Fi and Bluetooth EDR connectivity and two cameras The cameras are both megapixel and run at VGA at frames s or at at frames s They can be used to take photos or videos using built in applications on the system The two cameras feature the abilities of face detection head detection and head tracking The platform also launched with a model with G mobile data support which required a separate data plan through a data provider The G service has been partnered with NTT DoCoMo in Japan AT T in the US Rogers in Canada and Vodafone in Europe and Australia The G model was discontinued in and not made available in the system s future revised models br br Internally the device features a custom system on chip with a quad core ARM Cortex A MPCore processor and a quad core GPU SGX MP Sony has stated that the Vita generally runs well under its full clock speed due to overheating and battery consumption issues that would ensue instead placing its processing power around halfway between the current PSP and the PS The Vita s internal battery has between hours of power for game playing depending on the processing power required for the game screen brightness sound level and network connections as well as other factors Additionally the battery can supply about five hours for video watching and up to nine hours of music listening with the screen off The system does allow for additional external battery solutions as well The PlayStation Vita has MB of system RAM and MB of VRAM The amount of RAM allows cross game chat to be used on the system br Software for the PlayStation Vita is distributed on a proprietary flash memory card called PlayStation Vita game card rather than on Universal Media Discs UMDs as used by the PlayStation Portable The shape and size of the card itself is very similar to an SD card of the game card s space is reserved for game save data and patches The PS Vita is incompatible with standard memory cards such as SD cards and instead stores data on proprietary PS Vita memory cards which are available in sizes of GB GB GB GB and GB Initially a maximum of applications and games can be stored on the device at a time regardless of data storage available When the limit is reached applications or games must be moved or deleted in order to access those beyond the limit This limit was later raised to applications in system software version released in Due to the high price of official Sony memory cards inexpensive third party SD Vita adapter cards which allow the use of commodity micro SD storage media in conjunction with a modified console appeared on the market br br br Remote Play interactivity with PlayStation br br All games developed for the PlayStation with the exception of games requiring the use of special peripherals such as PlayStation Camera are playable on the Vita through Remote Play With the use of a Vita PS and PS game this allows a PS game to be run on the PS but its output transmitted to the Vita with the Vita being used for the controller input and the image and sound being transmitted to the Vita s screen and speakers instead of a television The end result is similar to what a Wii U console does with its GamePad controller through Off TV Play The Vita technically has Remote Play functionality with the PlayStation as well though very few PS games supported the feature due to limitations with the less powerful PS hardware More PS games are available for streaming on the Vita through Sony s cloud gaming service PlayStation Now though they are streamed over the internet in the form of cloud computing rather than directly from a physical PS console First implemented in the service was announced to be discontinued on the Vita on August br br br Revised model br br A revised model of the Vita was released in Japan on October in Europe on February and in North America on May The revised model officially called the PCH series and commonly referred to as the PS Vita Slim is thinner and lighter compared to the original model While it largely maintains the original s overall structure and layout the original s OLED screen has been replaced with a lower cost LCD display The model also roughly added about an extra hour of battery life The newer model also comes with GB of internal storage memory although it is not possible to use both the internal memory and memory card concurrently Upon inserting a PS Vita memory card the system will offer to copy the existing data from the internal memory to the new card This model has a micro USB Type B port which can be used to charge the device along with any standard micro USB cable The model was released in six colors in Japan white black light blue lime green pink and khaki although it was only released in black and light blue in North America and Europe br br br PlayStation TV br br The PlayStation TV is a non portable variant of the Vita instead of featuring its own display screen like a handheld video game console it connects to a television via HDMI like a traditional home video game console and is controlled though the use of a DualShock or DualShock controller Due to the difference in controller input between the Vita and a DualShock controller Vita games that are dependent on the system s touch screen rear touchpad microphone or camera are not compatible It also shares the Remote Play and PS Now functionality of a regular Vita The system was released in Japan in November in North America in October and in Europe on November The device did not fare well and had a short retail shelf life in North America and Europe where it was discontinued at the end of br br br Software br br br Game library br br Physical software for the Vita is distributed on a proprietary flash memory card called PlayStation Vita game card All Vita games are also made available to be downloaded digitally on the PlayStation Network via the PlayStation Store although not all games are released physically Since its launch digital only releases have slowly become more prominent partially in an effort to reduce production costs for release on the platform s comparatively smaller user base and partially due to the influx smaller scale indie mobile phone games that have always been digital only releases Like the PS and PS the Vita contains Trophy support for games br The system was designed so that it would be easy for developers to extract PS game assets and in turn use them to make Vita versions of games Prior to the Vita s release several third party studios showcased tech demos of the device by exporting existing assets from their PlayStation counterpart and then rendering them on the device high budget examples including Metal Gear Solid Guns of the Patriots Yakuza and Lost Planet While none of these particular high budget tech demos materialized into actual game releases and few big budget Western games would be made for both outside of PlayStation All Stars Battle Royale many Japanese development teams would go on to develop mid level games that would release for both platforms including the first two games from Falcom s Trails of Cold Steel series Compile Hearts original Hyperdimension Neptunia trilogy and many entries from Tecmo Koei s Atelier and Dynasty Warriors series The trend continued on the PS as well with Vita PS releases becoming common due to the spread of their userbases Vita versions for Japan where the Vita was larger in its initial years and PS versions of games for North America and Europe where the PS userbase was substantially larger Few PlayStation titles were ported to the Vita due to the PS s complicated infrastructure games that did such as Final Fantasy X X Remaster and Persona Golden required extensive reworking or were based on their PS counterparts such as Jak and Daxter Collection Ratchet and Clank Collection and Sly Cooper Collection Towards the end of its lifespan Vita versions of games began to be cancelled in favor of PS or Nintendo Switch releases br br br Backward compatibility br br The device is backward compatible with most PSP games however its lack of a UMD disc drive limits this capability to those titles which have been digitally released on the PlayStation Network via the PlayStation Store but not physical PSP games or films The Vita is also backward compatible with the majority of the PS one Classics the group of PlayStation games Sony has made available digitally for download and PlayStation Minis small budget downloadable titles originally created for the PSP and PS Games from Sony s PlayStation Mobile initiative had initially been compatible but were removed when the service was shut down in September In Japan select downloadable PC Engine and PocketStation titles became backward compatible as well br br br Applications br A number of applications are available to run on the Vita some initially pre loaded on the device while others are available via Sony s PlayStation Store Pre loaded apps include an internet browser a Content Manager app for monitoring data saved to the device an email client a music app a photo app and a video player The system s web browser supports HTML cookies and JavaScript but not Adobe Flash Also included was Near a social media GPS like app that allowed the user to see other Vita players in the area and what games or applications they had been using with the opportunity for some limited interactivity and communication although most of its functionality was disabled in br A number of other third party apps commonly found on mobile devices have also been made available on the Vita Crunchyroll Facebook removed in Flickr broken Google Maps removed in Hulu Live Tweet Sony s third party client for Twitter MLB tv broken Netflix Redbox Instant discontinued Skype removed in TuneIn broken Twitch WeatherNation and YouTube removed in Facebook Flickr Google Maps Twitter and YouTube no longer function as Vita apps but continue to be available by using the Vita s web browser br br br System software br br Unlike the PSP and PlayStation the PlayStation Vita does not use the XrossMediaBar interface Instead it uses a touchscreen based UI dubbed LiveArea which includes various social networking features via the PlayStation Network Each game or application is represented by its own circle icon and selecting it leads the user to a panel with multiple options present including running software itself going to its respective website through the internet seeing if there are downloadable updates available for the software and seeing a newsfeed like list of activities related to it such as installing it or obtaining trophies for both the user and others the user has interacted with recently br br br Reception and sales br br According to review aggregator Metacritic the Vita s original hardware release was generally well received with critics although a few concerns persisted as well Metacritic editor Jason Dietz noted that reviewers tended to praise the Vita s actual hardware design and operating system but expressed some concern on its practicality namely competing in onward with a large size and price where mobile phones with large screens and cheap games were prevalent as an alternative As of its initial Western launch in February out of professional critic reviews fell in the Great rating in the Good rating in the Mixed rating and in the Bad or Awful rating br Its initial launch sales were generally seen as positive selling over units in Japan and units in North America However a large dropoff occurred in both regions In Japan second week sales dropped and leveled off at selling about units per week Similarly sales dropped off to about to units sold per month for the year after launch in North America Overall Sony fell far short of the worldwide sales targets of million Vitas sold by the end of March The device sold million units as of the end of February million by the end of and were only estimated by analysts to have reached million by the end of figures that have not been confirmed due to Sony s ceasing to release Vita sales figures after hitting the million mark at the end of br Views on the hardware dropped to more moderate levels in after the platform s initial sales lulls Surveys in Japan showed that consumers were not purchasing the device due to its high retail price and perceived lack of software variety and that current Vita owners only showed a rate of approval for the device and its software library Similarly many Western critics felt that the low sales through would lead to an early death for the product br From onward Sony was able to reverse the trajectory of the system by changing focus aiming to be more of a niche product than one with mass market appeal focusing more on small Western mobile phone games and mid level Japanese developed games and attaching it to the rise of popularity of its PlayStation platform with its remote play connectivity functions Sony also released the Vita model revision the PCH which was generally well received by critics as well for addressing a number of prior complaints about the system which included a price and size reduction However reviewers felt more mixed on the decision to change from OLED to LCD screen in the revised model with some feeling it led to a minor downgrade in image quality br While not giving specific figures Sony stated that Vita sales beat projections in North America in which it was happy and surprised with sometimes even falling out of stock Similar response was found in the UK as well The platform has been considered to have sold well in Japan where it outsold the PS in and reached million units sold in according to sales tracker Media Create It also obtained million selling software in the same year with the Japanese Vita release of Minecraft By the end of research firm EEDAR estimated the sales of the Vita worldwide to be around million Despite the smaller userbase the platform continued to be viable for game releases into due to the high attach rate of software sold per hardware user Limited Run Games and various indie game developers praised the platform for its wide selection of more original and niche video games and the strong respective sales of them In mid Glixel estimated that approximately million units of the system had been sold while by September USGamer estimated it had grown to about million units br In a retrospective by The Verge Sony employees attributed several factors to the Vita s poor sales in contrast to the PSP which had an estimated million sales in its lifetime a similar drop had been seen by Nintendo with its transition from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo DS Christian Phillips a former senior director in Sony said they had underestimated the impact of mobile gaming at the time of the Vita s release They had considered gaming on smartphones to be just good enough for gameplay and instead felt tablet computers to be more their competitors to the Vita according to Phillips While some technologists in Sony had cautioned that mobile device computational power could outpace current consoles around the design of the Vita did not incorporate this caution Thus the Vita was released at the same time that mobile gaming was greatly expanding losing potential consumers to that market br John Koller the former vice president of marketing at Sony also believed that the Vita had been released too late into the main PlayStation console cycle and too close to the PlayStation s release in November As one of Sony s flagship products many of their first party developers had put more focus on games for that system rather than the Vita as a result The lack of interest from Sony s first party teams reverberated to third party developers who felt the Vita was not worth the effort to develop for over the upcoming PlayStation leaving the Vita without a strong software library Koller believed that if the Vita had launched earlier into the PlayStation s lifecycle they would have been able to capture more interest from developers during that time and build out a more compelling library for the Vita br br br Legacy and impact br The Vita was considered a commercial failure for Sony In Sony announced there would be no successor to the Vita PSP line of handhelds With the success of the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck handhelds moving into the s publications questioned Sony s decision to abandon the market In Sony announced Project Q a controller with an inch screen for the PlayStation that would replicate the experience of remote play on a Vita or Off TV Play of the Wii U GamePad The product was later named PlayStation Portal and was released on November br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br br Official website
