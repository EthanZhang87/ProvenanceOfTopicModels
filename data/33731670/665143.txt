The Super Scope Japanese romanized S p Suk pu known as the Nintendo Scope in Europe and Australia is a first party light gun peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System The successor to the NES Zapper the Super Scope was released in North America and the PAL region in followed by a limited release in Japan in due to a lack of consumer demand The peripheral consists of two devices the wireless light gun itself called the Transmitter and a Receiver that connects to the second controller port of the Super NES console The Transmitter has two action buttons a pause button a power switch and is powered by six AA batteries br br br Design br br The Transmitter is a bazooka shaped device just under ft cm long Located about midway on top of the barrel are two buttons the purple Fire button colored orange in Japanese and European models and the gray Pause button and a switch used to turn the Super Scope off or select regular or turbo fire In the middle on either side are two clips for attaching the sight On the far end of the gun on the bottom is a six inch cm grip with another button labeled Cursor br On the end is the infrared receiver lens approximately inch mm in diameter which picks up the light from a TV The sight mount is shaped like a wide very shallow U about five inches long The end that faces toward the shoulder mount end of the Super Scope has a round open cylinder holder where the eyepiece goes The other end has a short narrow tube which forms the sight when one looks through the eyepiece that is in line across from it The end of the eyepiece is very simple it is a cylinder with the diameter of a quarter with a removable rubber piece through which the shooter looks The sight is designed so that the aim will be correct at a distance of metres ft The Receiver is a small box in in in cm cm cm with a standard Super NES controller cord attached On the front is an oval shaped black area receding back from the two sides to an infra red transmitter about the size of a dime br All of the Super Scope games made by Nintendo have a soft reset to the game s main title This is accomplished by pausing the game then while holding CURSOR the FIRE button must be pressed twice br br br Hit detection br br The Super Scope makes use of the scanning process used in cathode ray tube monitors as CRTs were the only widely used TV monitors until the early s In short the screen is drawn by a scanning electron beam that travels horizontally across each line of the screen from top to bottom A fast photodiode will see any particular area of the screen illuminated only briefly as that point is scanned while the human eye will see a consistent image due to persistence of vision br The Super Scope takes advantage of this in a fairly simple manner it simply outputs a signal when it sees the television raster scan and a signal when it does not Inside the console this signal is delivered to the PPU which notes which screen pixel it is outputting at the moment the signal transitions from to At the end of the frame the game software can retrieve this stored position to determine where on the screen the gun was aimed Most licensed Super Scope games include a calibration mode to account for both electrical delays and maladjustment of the gunsight br The Super Scope ignores red light as do many guns of this type because red phosphors have a much slower rate of decay than green or blue phosphors Since the Super Scope depends on the short persistence and scan pattern of CRT pixels it will not function with modern displays such as plasma screens or LCDs that continuously light each pixel br br br Compatible games br Per GamePro br br Battle Clash br Bazooka Blitzkrieg br The Hunt for Red October used for bonus games br Lamborghini American Challenge features a Super Scope exclusive mode br Lemmings The Tribes secret easter egg allowing the super scope to destroy lemmings br Metal Combat Falcon s Revenge br Operation Thunderbolt br Super Scope bundled with the hardware br T The Arcade Game br Tin Star br X Zone br Yoshi s Safari required for play br br br See also br BatterUP A baseball bat controller for the Super NES and Genesis br Konami Justifier A light gun peripheral for the Super NES and Genesis for use with Lethal Enforcers br br br br br br External links br Media related to Super Scope at Wikimedia Commons
