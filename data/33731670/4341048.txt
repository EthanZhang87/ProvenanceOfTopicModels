The Ricoh A is an bit microprocessor produced by Ricoh for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES video game console It is based on the bit WDC C which was developed between and for the Apple IIGS personal computer It has instructions an bit data bus a bit accumulator and a bit address bus The CPU runs between MHz and MHz and uses an extended MOS Technology instruction set br br br Major features br In addition to the C CPU core the A contains support hardware including br br Controller port interface circuits including serial access to controller data br An bit parallel I O port which is mostly unused in the SNES br Circuitry for generating non maskable interrupts on V blank br Circuitry for generating interrupts on calculated screen positions br A DMA unit supporting two primary modes br General DMA for block transfers at a rate of MB s br H blank DMA for transferring small data sets at the end of each scanline outside of the active display period br Multiplication and division registers br Two separate address busses driving the bit data bus a bit Bus A for general access and an bit Bus B mainly for APU and PPU registers br br br Performance br The CPU as a whole employs a variable speed system bus with bus access times determined by the memory location accessed The bus runs at MHz for non access cycles and when accessing Bus B and most internal registers and either or MHz when accessing Bus A It runs at MHz only when accessing the controller port serial access registers It works at approximately MIPS and has a theoretical peak performance of million bit operations per second br br br See also br Super Nintendo Entertainment System technical specifications br Nintendo SA a co processor for the SNES based on the same C CPU core br br br
