PAL versions for certain titles the use of the original controller which lacked analog sticks and vibration and the price tag although its design received praise Most reviewers criticized the exclusion of many popular PlayStation titles such as Wipeout Crash Bandicoot Spyro the Dragon Tony Hawk s Pro Skater Tomb Raider PaRappa the Rapper Gran Turismo Castlevania Symphony of the Night The Legend of Dragoon Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver MediEvil and Silent Hill Tristan Ogilive of IGN criticised the console s lack of popular titles the basic user interface and pointing out that almost half of the games included in the PlayStation Classic s library are the PAL versions which caused consistency problems in NTSC regions Sam Loveridge of GamesRadar praised the look of the console but criticized the selection of games the weak presentation of the games due to the black bars on the side of the screen and the short length of the controller cables br The lower frame rates during gameplay poor emulation quality and the user interface were also criticized John Linneman of Eurogamer s Digital Foundry also gave it a similarly negative review noting the console s subpar emulation poor image quality lack of enhancements and use of PAL game releases on North American units though he did praise the user interface Chris Carter of Destructoid shares a similar opinion citing that the emulation on the classic console is at times worse than the original but praised the instant state recovery and the size of the internal storage Joe Juba of Game Informer lamented on the lack of analog sticks on the controller along with the lacking selection of titles and a barebones menu which makes the system a good fit only for an extremely specific audience However Twisted Metal Jumping Flash Tekken Final Fantasy VII and Metal Gear Solid were hailed as the best of the genre br In response to the console s perceived weak game selection many users have modded the console so any amount of game ROMs can be added to the console via external storage essentially turning the console into a dedicated emulator similar to software such as Retropie br br br Sales br The PlayStation Classic had sold units during its first week in Japan Its sales were noticeably low in the U S within the first four weeks over Christmas with many retailers and websites such as Amazon giving discounts for the console as low as US in several major U S retailers Reasons for the price drop at this time suggested a combination of overproduction of the unit over pricing on the original cost of the unit or disinterest in the unit which had been panned by journalists Just over two months after its release the console was further discounted by Walmart to US Another price drop to US and in all U S European and U K retailers respectively followed in June as part of PlayStation s Days of Play sale events In July Best Buy and Amazon began selling the console as low as US br br br br br br External links br
