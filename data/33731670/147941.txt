gameplay more palatable Many years after the release of The Lost Levels fans of the series would modify Mario games to challenge each other with nearly impossible levels The challenges of The Lost

in the franchise and a reminder of imbalanced gameplay in Nintendo s history br Luigi received his first distinctive character traits in The Lost Levels less ground friction and the ability to jump farther IGN considered this change to be the game s most significant though the controls remained cramped and crippled with either character The game s poison mushroom item with its character
