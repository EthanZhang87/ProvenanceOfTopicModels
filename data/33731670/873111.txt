Europe in January neither Game Boy Advance game was released in Japan until the Game Boy Wars Advance compilation which released for the Game Boy Advance on November The success of Advance Wars in the West is frequently credited as a driving force for Nintendo bringing Intelligent Systems franchise Fire Emblem outside of Japan as both series share a similar tactical gameplay style br In Advance Wars Dual Strike was released on the Nintendo DS family of systems which followed and expanded on the basic format of its predecessors That same year Battalion Wars developed by Kuju Entertainment was released for the GameCube in Japan under the title Totsugeki Famicom Wars where it is considered a spin off from the main series Battalion Wars is a D action real time strategy game as opposed to the

Rubinelle Laurentia in the European release In the single player campaign of the Advance Wars games each level consists of a new map and opposing CO to defeat Victory is achieved when all the opponent s units have been destroyed their HQ is captured or another victory condition has been met COs take turns recruiting and commanding units on grid based maps Units available include infantry tanks artillery bombers and many other military units Each turn each unit may move around and or perform an action such as attacking or capturing a property Certain actions such as capturing diving or loading may only be performed at certain instances throughout the game br The original Famicom Wars game consists of two armies Red Star which became Orange Star in later international versions possibly to avoid associations with Communism and Blue Moon fighting over square grid based maps The two armies could either be controlled by human players or a human player could play against an AI opponent The original Game Boy Wars games featured a system similar to Famicom Wars except the grid was changed so that the grid squares acted more like hexagons each square is adjacent to six other squares instead of four Game Boy Wars also features a different opposing army called White Moon Otherwise the rules remain identical and only in Game Boy Wars were unit levels and a new resource introduced Super Famicom Wars the sequel to Famicom Wars introduced Yellow Comet and Green Earth bringing the number of armies playable at once to four It returned to the basic square grid based map style of the original game br The Advance Wars games introduced several new elements The most notable is that COs now have special abilities called CO Powers that can affect the battle in different ways giving the CO a temporary advantage over the other COs such as providing allied units with increased firepower or causing damage to opposing units Black Hole Rising introduced Super CO Powers and Dual Strike introduced Tag CO Powers Conditions such as fog of war rain and snow affect the abilities of units to reveal the map and move around Days of Ruin removed many of the features added to previous Advance Wars games greatly weakening CO Powers and reintroducing a unit level system br br br Multiplayer br Multiplayer mode is an important part of the Nintendo Wars series This allows players to compete against friends each choosing a Commanding Officer to play and country to represent The Advance Wars series of games along with the far lesser known Game Boy Wars include map
