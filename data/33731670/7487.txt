The Fairchild Channel F short for Channel Fun is a video game console the first to be based on a microprocessor and to use ROM cartridges branded Videocarts instead of having games built in It was released by Fairchild Camera and Instrument in November across North America at a retail price of US equivalent to in It was launched as the Video Entertainment System but when Atari released its Video Computer System VCS the next year Fairchild rebranded their console as Channel F while keeping the Video Entertainment System descriptor br The Fairchild Channel F achieved only about units before Fairchild sold the technology to Zircon International in trailing well behind the VCS The system was discontinued in br br br History br br In Alpex Computer Corporation employees Wallace Kirschner and Lawrence Haskel developed a home video game prototype consisting of a base unit centered on an Intel microprocessor and interchangeable circuit boards containing ROM chips that could be plugged into the base unit The duo attempted to interest several television manufacturers in the system but were unsuccessful Next they contacted a buyer at Fairchild which sent engineer Jerry Lawson to evaluate the system Lawson was impressed by the system and suggested Fairchild license the technology which the company did in January br Lawson worked with industrial designer Nick Talesfore and mechanical engineer Ron Smith to turn the prototype into a viable project Jerry Lawson replaced the with Fairchild s own F CPU while Nick Talesfore and Ron Smith were responsible for adapting the prototype s complex keyboard controls into a single control stick and encasing the ROM circuit boards into plastic cartridges reminiscent of track tapes Talesfore providing Industrial Design ID and Ron Smith providing Mechanical Engineering ME collaborated on the styling and function of the degrees of freedom hand controller They were responsible for the design of the hand controllers console and video game cartridges In addition to providing the ID for this system Talesfore also art directed Tom Kamafugi the graphic designer who did the original graphic design for the early video cartridges cartons br The system was also released in Japan F in October br br br Channel F System II br br Lawson moved on to form his own company Video Soft in Talesfore continued working on the system at Fairchild and eventually a number of these improvements resulted in the improved System II The major changes were that the controllers were now removable using the Atari joystick port connector not Atari compatible and their storage was moved to the back of the machine The sound was now mixed into the RF modulator so you could adjust it on your TV set instead of a fixed volume internal speaker The internal electronics were also simplified with two custom logic chips replacing the standard TTL logic chips This resulted in a much smaller motherboard which allowed for a smaller simpler and more modern looking case design br Some time in Zircon International bought the rights to the Channel F and released the re designed console as the Channel F System II to compete with Atari s VCS Channel F II struggled managing to only release six new games after the debut before its demise several of these were developed at Fairchild before they sold the rights br br br Licensed variants br A number of licensed versions were released in Europe including the Luxor Video Entertainment System in Sweden Adman Grandstand Video Entertainment Computer Channel F II in the UK the SABA Videoplay ITT Telematch Processor and Nordmende Color TelePlay P from Germany and the Barco Challenger Dumont Videoplay and Emerson Videoplay from the Barco Dumont Emerson company in Italy and Belgium Swedish Luxor also released the Channel F II as Luxor Video Entertainment Computer br br br Design br br The F was very innovative compared to the existing processors and typical integrated circuits of the day Because chip packaging was not initially available with enough pins a few pins were used to communicate with other chips in the system You needed at least two chips to set up an F processor system to be able run any code The savings from using standard pin layout enabled the inclusion of Bytes of internal scratchpad RAM in the CPU br The VES Channel F as well as the System II had one CPU and two storage chips PSU s br A single chip variant of the F was used by the VideoBrain computer system br The Channel F is able to use one plane of graphics and one of four background colors per line with three plot colors to choose from red green and blue that turns white if the background is set to black at a resolution of with approximately pixels visible on the TV screen This VRAM or framebuffer was write only and not usable for anything else There was only Bytes of scratchpad RAM for general use half the amount of the later Atari The Maze game Videocart and Hangman game Videocart used bits of on cartridge static RAM connected directly to one PSU port adding to the cost of manufacturing it The Chess game contained considerably more on cartridge RAM than that Bytes accomplished by using an F memory interface circuit to be able to use industry standard ROM and RAM br The F processor at the heart of the console is able to produce enough AI to allow for player versus computer matches a first in console history All previous machines required a human opponent Tic Tac Toe on Videocart had this feature it was only for one player against the machine The same is true for the chess game which could have very long turn times for the computer as the game progressed depending on the set difficulty br In the original unit sound is played through an internal speaker rather than the TV set However the System II passed sound to the television through the RF modulator br The Channel F is also the first video game console to feature a pause function There is a Hold button on the main unit of the console which allows players to freeze inside the two built in games and change several game settings in the meantime Button is controlled through code so it was used for other things in other games br br br Controllers br The controllers are a joystick without a base the main body is a large handgrip with a triangular cap on top the top being the portion that actually moved for eight way directional control It could be used as both a joystick and paddle twist and not only could it be pushed down to operate as a fire button it could be pulled up as well The model unit contained a small compartment for storing the controllers when moving it or when not in use The System II featured detachable controllers with two holders at the back to wind the cable around and to store the controller in Zircon later offered a special controller that featured an action button on the front of the joystick It was marketed by Zircon as Channel F Jet Stick in a letter sent out to registered owners before Christmas br One feature unique to the console is the hold button which allows the player to freeze the game change the time or speed of the game The hold function is however not universal like the hardwired reset as the four buttons are set up in code The programmer can choose their function purpose The text labels explains the button functions in the built in games and some of the Videocarts br Despite the failure of the Channel F the joystick s design was so popular Creative Computing called it outstanding that Zircon also released an Atari joystick port compatible version the Video Command Joystick first released without the extra fire button Before that only the downwards plunge motion was connected and acted as the fire button the pull up and twist actions were not connected to anything br br br Technical specifications br br CPU microprocessor Fairchild F bit operating at MHz NTSC colorburst PAL gen MHz gen MHz double PAL

United States during the ownership of Fairchild and Zircon the first twenty one of which were released by Fairchild Several of these cartridges were capable of playing more than one game and were typically priced at equivalent to in The Videocarts were yellow and approximately the size and overall texture of an track cartridge They usually featured colorful label artwork The earlier artwork was created by nationally known artist Tom Kamifuji and art directed by Nick Talesfore The console contained two built in games Tennis and Hockey which were both advanced Pong clones In Hockey the reflecting bar could be changed to different diagonals by twisting the controller knob and could move all over the playing field Tennis was much like the original Pong br A sales brochure from listed Keyboard Videocarts for sale The three shown were K Casino Poker K Space Odyssey and K Pro Football These were intended to use the Keyboard accessory which is displayed on the Channel F II box All further brochures released after Zircon took over from Fairchild never listed this accessory nor anything called a Keyboard Videocart br There was one cartridge released outside the numbered series listed as Videocart and simply titled Demo This Videocart was shown in a single sales brochure released shortly after Zircon acquired the company It has not been seen listed for sale after this single brochure which was sent out in the winter of br br Democart was briefly available to the general public br Democart br Unreleased carts br br Keyboard Videocart Casino Poker br Keyboard Videocart Space Odyssey br Keyboard Videocart Pro Football br German electronics manufacturer SABA also released a few compatible carts different from the original carts translation in Videocart Tic Tac Toe to German words Videocart released with different abbreviations German and Videocart changed graphics and has a German word list br In a number of new Homebrew games were released on itch io by retro developer Arlasoft These included ports of mobile puzzle games Tents Trees and Threes as well as a port of the classic arcade shooter Centipede Through a secret button combination a hidden game could also be started the box and instruction booklet has multiple hints about the needed code br These were released on cartridge as Videocart br br br Reception br br The Channel F had beaten the Atari VCS to the market but once the VCS was released sales of the Channel F fell attributed to the types of games that were offered Most of the Channel F titles were slow paced educational and intellectual games compared to the action driven games that launched with the VCS Even with the redesigned Channel F II in Fairchild was unable to meet the sales that the VCS and its games were generating By the time Fairchild sold the technology to Zircon in around total units had been sold br Ken Uston reviewed games in his book Ken Uston s Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games in and rated some of the Channel F s titles highly of these Alien Invasion and Video Whizball were considered by Uston to be the finest adult cartridges currently available for the Fairchild Channel F System The games on a whole however rated last on his survey of over games for the Atari Intellivision Astrocade and Odyssey consoles and contemporary games were rated Average with future Channel F games rated below average Uston rated almost one half of the Channel F games as high in interest and called that an impressive proportion and further noted that Some of the Channel F cartridges are timeless no matter what technological developments occur they will continue to be of interest His overall conclusion was that the games serve a limited but useful purpose and that the strength of the Channel F offering is in its excellent educational line for children br In after Zircon announced its discontinuation of the Channel F Video Games reviewed the console Calling it the system nobody knows the magazine described its graphics and sounds as somewhat primitive by today s standards It described Space War as may be the most antiquated game of its type still on the market and rated the games for the console with an average interest grade of three not too good on a scale from one to ten and skill rating at an average of The magazine stated however that Fairchild managed to create some fascinating games even by today s standards calling the poker game Casino Royale actually Videocart Casino Poker the best card game from blackjack to bridge made for any TV game system It also favorably reviewed Dodge It simple but great Robot War Berzerk without guns and Whizball thoroughly original hockey with guns but concluded that only those interested in nostalgia video game collecting or card games
