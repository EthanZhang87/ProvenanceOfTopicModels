A display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form the latter used for example in tactile electronic displays for blind people When the input information that is supplied has an electrical signal the display is called an electronic display br Common applications for electronic visual displays are television sets or computer monitors br br br Types of electronic displays br br br In use br These are the technologies used to create the various displays in use today br br Liquid crystal display LCD br Light emitting diode LED backlit LCD br Thin film transistor TFT LCD br Quantum dot QLED display br Light emitting diode LED display br OLED display br AMOLED display br Super AMOLED display br br br Segment displays br br Some displays can show only digits or alphanumeric characters They are called segment displays because they are composed of several segments that switch on and off to give appearance of desired glyph The segments are usually single LEDs or liquid crystals They are mostly used in digital watches and pocket calculators Common types are seven segment displays which are used for numerals only and alphanumeric fourteen segment displays and sixteen segment displays which can display numerals and Roman alphabet letters br br br Other types br Vacuum fluorescent display br Electroluminescent ELD display br Plasma PDP display br Laser powered phosphor display br Cathode ray tubes were also formerly widely used br br br Full area dimensional displays br dimensional displays that cover a full area usually a rectangle are also called video displays since it is the main modality of presenting video br br br Applications of full area dimensional displays br Full area dimensional displays are used in for example br br Television set br Computer monitors br Head mounted displays Heads up displays and Virtual reality headsets br Broadcast reference monitor br Medical monitors br Mobile displays for mobile devices br Smartphone displays for smartphones br Video walls br br br Underlying technologies of full area dimensional displays br Underlying technologies for full area dimensional displays include br br Cathode ray tube display CRT br Light emitting diode display LED br Electroluminescent display ELD br Electronic paper E Ink br Plasma display panel PDP br Liquid crystal display LCD br High performance addressing display HPA br Thin film transistor display TFT br Organic light emitting diode display OLED br Digital Light Processing display DLP br Surface conduction electron emitter display SED experimental br Field emission display FED experimental br Laser TV forthcoming br Carbon nanotubes experimental br Quantum dot display QLED br Interferometric modulator display IMOD br Digital microshutter display DMS br microLED in development br The multiplexed display technique is used to drive most display devices br br br Three dimensional displays br Swept volume display br Laser display br Holographic display br Light field displays br br br Mechanical types br Ticker tape historical br Split flap display or simply flap display br Flip disc display or flip dot display br Vane display br Rollsign br Tactile electronic displays are usually intended for the blind They use electro mechanical parts to dynamically update a tactile image usually of text so that the image may be felt by the fingers br Optacon using metal rods instead of light in order to convey images to blind people by tactile sensation br br br See also br br Comparison of CRT LCD plasma and OLED displays br Graphical user interfaces br History of display technology br User interface br Input device br Text display br br br br br br External links br br Society for Information Display An international professional organization dedicated to the study of display technology br University of Waterloo Stratford Campus A university that offers students the opportunity to display their work on the school s storey Christie MicroTile wall
