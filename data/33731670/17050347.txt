Fighting Stick br br Hori built an arcade stick that was licensed by Nintendo The controller does not support control stick or C stick functionality The system treats the stick like the D pad on a

other cables The Japan only D Terminal cable also has this feature PAL released games lack progressive p output The connector plugs into the Digital AV port rather than the Analog AV port used by other cables and contains a Macronix CMPV DOL video chip a digital to analog converter This converts the YCBCR digital video coming from the digital port to the YPBPR analog format used by component video equipment CMPV DOL s reconfigurability allows it to carry out unusual functions such as YCBCR to RGBHV conversion but it cannot take advantage of the digital audio from the console s digital port This means that a separate cable such as the system s standard A V cable must also be connected to the Analog AV port in order to transmit the audio signal br br This cable is only compatible with DOL models of the GameCube as Nintendo chose to omit the Digital AV port in subsequent models of the console br br br D Terminal cable br The D Terminal Video Cable is identical to the Component
