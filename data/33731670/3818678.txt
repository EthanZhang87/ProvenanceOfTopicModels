title: Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector
id: 3818678
The Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector is a wireless game adapter developed by Nintendo and Buffalo Technology which allows the Nintendo DS Wii and DS users without a Wi Fi connection or compatible Wi Fi network to establish an Internet connection via a broadband connected PC When inserted into the host PC s USB port the connector functions with the Nintendo DS Wii DSi and DS permitting the user to connect to the Internet and play Nintendo games that require a Wi Fi connection and access various other online services According to the official Nintendo website this product was the best selling Nintendo accessory to date on November but was discontinued in the same month On September Nintendo announced the Nintendo Wi Fi Network Adapter an g wireless router bridge which serves a similar purpose br br br Functionality br The Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector is essentially a re branded version of the Buffalo WLI U KG YB The Buffalo WLI U KG YB is often confused for the Buffalo WLI U KG AI because the two adapters are almost identical and only differ in that the Buffalo WLI U KG AI features flash memory to allow for auto installation Both are based on the Ralink RT chipset This differentiated the Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector from most other Wi Fi adapters as it could operate as a software access point also known as a soft AP At the time of the Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector s release few Wi Fi adapters could do this on the Windows operating system as Windows lacked both the software necessary to configure a soft AP and capable drivers that were natively supported by hardware By bundling a soft AP compatible device with their own proprietary software Nintendo was able to overcome the limitations of Windows and simplified the otherwise complicated process of putting a supported device into soft AP mode configuring it and routing Internet traffic over it br Additionally a number of community development tools and drivers exist which expand the functionality of the Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector beyond its initial design While not officially supported by Nintendo the USB Connector can function as a standard wireless adapter by using modified Ralink or Buffalo Technology drivers and can be used to send official game demos and homebrew software to the Nintendo DS through the Wireless Multi Boot WMB protocol br br br Criticism br br br Proprietary authentication br The product uses a proprietary authentication mechanism Thus the Wi Fi USB Connector works only with approved devices which is limited to the Nintendo DS and Wii consoles This behavior is an intentional design decision on the part of Nintendo as it prevents outside parties from connecting to the Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector with their computers and accessing the user s Internet connection or computer While the Wi Fi USB Connector can be modified to bypass this it is unsupported by Nintendo br br br Operating system support br Initially the Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector only supported Microsoft Windows XP A main concern at the time was the lack of support for older versions of Windows principally Windows However after the introduction of the Windows Vista operating system criticism shifted to a lack of support for the new platform Though Vista drivers were eventually released by Nintendo of Europe and Nintendo of America it was two years after the first Windows XP drivers were available and several months after Vista s launch There is no official support for Windows although it is possible to install working drivers when under compatibility mode br It is possible to use the Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector as a USB Wi Fi NIC to connect to other access points under Linux and BSD when using the appropriate drivers br br br Internet connection sharing br The core functionality of the Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector is provided by Windows Internet Connection Sharing ICS feature which allows a Windows computer to act as a router and automatically configure client devices for Internet access Due to limitations in ICS there are a number of caveats with this method br Like the Wi Fi USB Connector software itself ICS offers the user no configurable options This means that ICS may not function as expected or at all in complex network environments In addition Windows cannot handle multiple ICS configurations simultaneously or in other words only a single application or network device can use and configure ICS at one time If a network is currently relying on ICS or is using software that utilizes it such as Windows Media Center Extender for the Xbox the Wi Fi USB Connector may not be usable br br br Software firewall compatibility br Though not an innate fault with the Wi Fi USB Connector itself due to the nature of the device a software firewall like those commonly installed on Microsoft Windows computers hosting the Wi Fi USB Connector will interfere with its operation To alleviate this issue the user must allow the software full access to the Internet or manually specify acceptable port ranges to allow through the firewall depending on how that particular firewall is configured br Unfortunately some firewall products such as ZoneAlarm and Windows Live OneCare are incompatible with the Wi Fi USB Connector software Therefore these programs must be either uninstalled or disabled leaving the computer open to possible attack from external sources The user s only option in this scenario is to risk connecting to the Internet unprotected or install a different firewall product br br br Network topology br A common complaint from more advanced users is the complete lack of user configurable options in the Wi Fi USB Connector software and installer Novice users see this as a much welcomed advantage of the Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector over a traditional wireless router but for those users who wish to use the device in a more complicated network environment it can be an insurmountable obstacle br For example the Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector will cause an IP conflict if an existing network is using the x or x IP schemes both common IP ranges used in consumer routers br br br Packaging br The Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector includes a USB extension cable a manual and a software CD It is recommended that the latest version of the Wi Fi USB Connector software should be downloaded and installed rather than using the CD versions as important updates have been made in the newer versions Devices shipped with software driver versions below are incompatible with Windows Vista until updated br br br Discontinuation br While Nintendo has not stated a reason for the discontinuation of the device manufacturers Buffalo Technology are reportedly no longer licensed to distribute it due to a successful recent lawsuit by the Australian Government s technology research agency CSIRO Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization As a result the company has been prevented from trading in any products adhering to the a g standards in the US including the Nintendo Wi Fi USB connector br Nintendo however only states on their website that the device is discontinued and offers a standard wireless router as replacement on the Wii br Please note The Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector has been discontinued until further notice As an alternative for online access Wii owners can use a standard wireless router or the Wii LAN Adapter br br br br br br External links br Latest Software for the Nintendo Wi Fi USB Connector
