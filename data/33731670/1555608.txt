Pok mon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pok mon Company under the Pok mon media franchise It was created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori the first games Pocket Monsters Red and Green were released in in Japan for the Game Boy later released outside of Japan as Pok mon Red Version and Blue Version The main series of role playing video games RPGs referred as the core series by their developers has continued on each generation of Nintendo s handhelds The most recently released core series games Pok mon Scarlet and Violet were released on November for the Nintendo Switch br In addition to Game Freak s development Creatures provides support through their Pok mon CG Studio which creates D models for the Pok mon in the games and also develops some spin off titles In Nintendo Creatures and Game Freak jointly established The Pok mon Company which manages licensing production publishing marketing and deals for the franchise both within Asia and worldwide through The Pok mon Company International br The core games are released in generations each with different Pok mon storylines and characters Remakes of the games are usually released around a decade after the original versions for the latest console at the time While the main series consists of RPGs developed by Game Freak many spin off games based on the series have been developed by various companies encompassing other genres such as action role playing puzzle fighting and digital pet games br Pok mon is one of the highest grossing media franchises of all time with successful anime series movies and merchandise with spin off game Pok mon Go having crossed billion mobile game downloads worldwide By November more than million Pok mon games had been sold worldwide on handheld and home consoles across titles including spin offs As of March the series has sold over million units worldwide This makes Pok mon the third best selling video game franchise behind Nintendo s own Mario franchise and Tetris br br br Gameplay br br One of the consistent aspects of most Pok mon games spanning from Pok mon Red and Blue on the Game Boy to the Nintendo DS games Pok mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon is the choice of one of three different Pok mon at the start of the player s adventures these three are often labeled starter Pok mon Players can choose a Pok mon type Grass type Fire type or Water type Pok mon indigenous to that particular region For example in Pok mon Red and Blue the player has the choice of starting with Bulbasaur Charmander or Squirtle The exception to this rule is Pok mon Yellow where players are given a Pikachu an Electric type mouse Pok mon famous for being the mascot of the Pok mon media franchise unique to Pok mon Yellow the three starter Pok mon from Red and Blue can be obtained during the quest by a single player br Another consistent aspect is that the player s rival will always choose the type that has a type advantage over the player s chosen Pok mon as their starter Pok mon excluding Sun and Moon Sword and Shield and Scarlet and Violet For instance if the player picks the Fire type Charmander the rival will always pick the Water type Squirtle This does not affect the first battle between the rivals as they can only use Normal type attacks at this point meaning that they cannot exploit weaknesses The exception to this is again Pok mon Yellow in which the rival picks Eevee a Normal type Pok mon with multiple evolutions Sun and Moon also is an exception is this rule as the rival picks the starter weak toward the player s starter with the Pok mon that has the type advantage going to a trainer in the Champion battle br However in Pok mon Black and White there are two rivals one picks the Pok mon with a type advantage over the player s chosen Pok mon while the other chooses the Pok mon with the type disadvantage In Pok mon Diamond Pearl and Platinum another Trainer chooses the Pok mon with a type disadvantage to the player s chosen Pok mon but never battles the player instead this character battles alongside the player as a tag partner in certain situations br The situation is similar in Pok mon X and Y but there are four rivals Two of them receive the starter Pok mon in an arrangement similar to Pok mon Black and White but the other two have completely different Pok mon br br br Development br br All of the licensed Pok mon properties overseen by The Pok mon Company are divided roughly by generation These generations are roughly chronological divisions by release when an official sequel in the main role playing game series is released that features new Pok mon characters and possibly new gameplay concepts that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise The main games and their spin offs the anime manga and trading card game are all updated with the new Pok mon properties each time a new generation begins
