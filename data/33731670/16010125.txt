Gekko is a superscalar out of order bit PowerPC microprocessor custom made by IBM in for Nintendo to use as the CPU in their sixth generation game console the GameCube and later the Triforce Arcade Board br br br Development br Gekko s role in the game system was to facilitate game scripting artificial intelligence physics and collision detection custom graphics lighting effects and geometry such as smooth transformations and moving graphics data through the system br The project was announced in when IBM and Nintendo agreed to a billion dollar contract IBM s largest ever single order for a CPU running at approximately MHz IBM chose to modify their existing PowerPC CXe processor to suit Nintendo s needs such as tight and balanced operation alongside the Flipper graphics processor The customization was to the bus architecture DMA compression and floating point unit which support a special set of SIMD instructions The CPU made ground work for custom lighting and geometry effects and could burst compressed data directly to the GPU br The Gekko is considered to be the direct ancestor to the Broadway processor also designed and manufactured by IBM that powers the Wii console br br br Features br Customized PowerPC CXe core br Clockrate MHz br Superscalar Out of order execution br stages long two integer ALUs IU and IU bit br stages long Floating Point Unit bit double precision FPU usable as bit SIMD for single precision GFLOPS performance using the Multiply accumulate operation The SIMD is often found under the denomination paired singles br Branch Prediction Unit BPU br Load Store Unit LSU br System Register Unit SRU br Memory Management Unit MMU br Branch Target Instruction Cache BTIC br SIMD Instructions PowerPC roughly new SIMD instructions geared toward D graphics br Front side Bus bit enhanced x bus to GPU chipset at MHz clock with GB s peak bandwidth br On chip Cache KB way associative L cache KB instruction data KB on die way associative L cache br DMIPS dhrystone br nm IBM six layer copper wire process mm die br V for logic and I O W dissipation br mm PBGA package with contacts br million logic transistors and million transistors total br br br See also br Broadway microprocessor the processor in the Wii br MIPS R the processor in the Nintendo br br br br br IBM Nintendo Announce Billion Technology Agreement br A PowerPC compatible processor supporting high performance D graphics
