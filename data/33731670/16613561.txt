multimedia platform with a floppy drive video capture and editor game building setup web browser and online service the controller plus its own expansions for storage and rumble feedback and the RAM boosting Expansion Pak for big improvements in graphics and gameplay Third party accessories include the essential game developer tools built by SGI and SN Systems on Nintendo s behalf an unlicensed SharkWire online service and unlicensed cheaper counterparts to first party items In the fifth generation of video game consoles the Nintendo had a market lifespan from to br br br First party br First party Nintendo accessories have a product code prefixed with NUS short for Nintendo Ultra Sixty four br br br Controller br br The Nintendo controller NUS is an m shaped controller with buttons A B C Up C Down C Left C Right L R Z and Start one analog stick in the center a digital directional pad on the left side and an extension port on the back for many of the system s accessories Initially available in the seven colors of gray yellow green red blue purple and black and it was later released in translucent versions of those colors except gray br br br Controller Pak br br The Controller Pak NUS is the console s memory card comparable to those of the PlayStation and GameCube Compatible games can save player data to the Controller Pak which plugs into the back of the Nintendo controller as do the Rumble and Transfer Paks The Controller Pak was marketed for exchanging data between Nintendo owners because data on the game cartridge can not be transferred br The original models from Nintendo have kilobit KB of battery backed SRAM split into pages with a limitation of save files but third party models have much more often in the form of selectable memory banks of kbits Games occupy varying numbers of pages sometimes using the entire card It is powered by a common CR battery br Upon launch the Controller Pak was initially useful and even necessary for early games Over time the Controller Pak lost popularity to the convenience of a battery backed SRAM or EEPROM in some cartridges Because the Nintendo Game Pak format also allows saving data on supported cartridges few first party and second party games use the Controller Pak The vast majority are from third party developers This is most likely due to the increased production and retail costs which would have been caused by including self contained data on the cartridge Some games use it to save optional data that is too large for the cartridge such as Mario Kart which uses of the total pages for storing ghost data or International Superstar Soccer which uses the entire cartridge s space for its save data Tony Hawk s Pro Skater uses pages Quest and Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon use the Controller Pak exclusively for saved data The Japan only game Animal Forest uses the Controller Pak to travel to other towns br Following the Christmas shopping season Next Generation reported impressive sales of the memory pack cartridges despite the lack of available games to take advantage of the units br br br Jumper Pak br br The Jumper Pak NUS is a filler that plugs into the console s memory expansion port It serves no functional purpose other than to terminate the Rambus bus in the absence of the Expansion Pak This is functionally equivalent to a continuity RIMM in a Rambus motherboard filling the unused RIMM sockets until the user upgrades Most Nintendo consoles were shipped with the Jumper Pak installed Replacement Jumper Paks were not sold individually in stores and could only be ordered through Nintendo s online store The system will not boot without a Jumper Pak or Expansion Pak installed br br br Expansion Pak br br The Expansion Pak NUS consists of MB megabytes of random access memory RAM which is RDRAM the same on the console motherboard increasing the console s RAM from MB to MB of contiguous main memory It is installed in a port on top of the console and replaces the pre installed Jumper Pak which is simply a Rambus terminator Originally designed for the DD disk drive s larger multimedia workstation applications the Expansion Pak was launched separately in Q and then bundled with the DD s delayed December launch package in Japan The Expansion Pak was bundled with Donkey Kong and in Japan the Expansion Pak additionally was bundled with The Legend of Zelda Majora s Mask and Perfect Dark br It was bundled with an ejector tool NUS meant for removing the original Jumper Pak br Game developers found ways to use the increased memory including greater visual appeal The Expansion Pak is required in order to run both Donkey Kong and Majora s Mask Perfect Dark blocks access to content including the single player campaign when no Expansion Pak is present and the game s packaging states that approximately of the game is available in that case It is required for all DD software In StarCraft it is needed to unlock levels from the Brood War add on from the PC version Quake II features higher color depth and better performance but not a higher resolution with the Expansion Pak In the vast majority of games with support such as Castlevania Legacy of Darkness and Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine the Expansion Pak is merely used as additional frame buffer memory to enable various high resolution usually interlaced mode options at a performance cost in some cases dramatically so This use of the Expansion Pak can be attributed to ease of implementation and games that mainly target the stock console additional RDRAM cannot be easily used to circumvent other bottlenecks of the console such as the small texture cache The original NTSC release of Space Station Silicon Valley may crash in certain places if the Expansion Pak is present br IGN celebrated the Nintendo industry s methods in launching and supporting the Expansion Pak for making a high impact accessory with immediate and noticeable though mostly optional effects br br br Rumble Pak br br The Rumble Pak NUS provides haptic feedback by vibration It is powered by two AAA batteries and connects to the controller s expansion port It was released in for the new game Star Fox with which it was originally bundled br br br Transfer Pak br br The Transfer Pak NUS plugs into the controller to transfer data between supported Nintendo games and Game Boy or Game Boy Color games It was released in Japan in August bundled with the game Pocket Monsters Stadium and in North America and Europe in February and April respectively where it was similarly bundled with Pok mon Stadium br br br Wide Boy br br Developed by Intelligent Systems the Wide Boy is a series of adapters similar to the Super Game Boy that plays Game Boy games The device was never sold in retail to general consumers and was only provided to developers and the gaming press Developers and magazines could purchase one directly from Nintendo at a cost of equivalent to about in The cartridge contains internal Game Boy hardware allowing the system to run games natively rather than via an emulator Two major versions of Wide Boy were released the CGB for Game Boy and Game Boy Color games and the updated AGB for those and Game Boy Advance Game Paks The gaming press used it to capture screen shots more easily Like the Super Game Boy and Game Boy Player the game screen is surrounded by a template mimicking the appearance of the portable system It was used for final matches at the Pok mon League Summer Training Tour The Canadian children s game show Video Arcade Top used Wide Boy adapters so contestants could play Game Boy games on some later episodes br br br S Video Cable br The S Video cable provides a better quality picture than composite RCA cables via the MultiAV port The NTSC cable is identical to and compatible with earlier SNES NTSC PAL and later GameCube NTSC only S Video cables The first party NTSC Nintendo S Video cable sold by Nintendo however was not produced in PAL regions The PAL Nintendo does natively output S Video Luma Chroma but require a different cable to NTSC Nintendo due to a design difference in most or all PAL motherboard revisions Nintendo never released an official S Video cable for the PAL console Using an NTSC S Video cable on a PAL console will usually produce over bright garish colors or it may not produce any video image at all br Third party S Video cables for NTSC and PAL consoles were produced though many cheaper S Video cables do not deliver a true S Video signal merely passing the composite video signal the yellow plug of the standard red white yellow AV cables through the S Video plug br br br DD br br The DD NUS is a MB floppy drive with real time clock font and audio library in ROM and a

Monegi Smart Pack is a collection of third party hardware and software which facilitates real time development while the game is running on the console br Through the decades many unlicensed third
