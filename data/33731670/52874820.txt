are asked a question and pick a team based on the answer that they chose For example players could be asked to pick between mayonnaise or ketchup or if they prefer using a fork or a spoon Similarly to the first game Splatoon features Splatfest events that include crossovers with other brands both from other Nintendo properties such as Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Super Mario and third party franchises including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles McDonald s Uniqlo Nike Sanrio Meiji Pocky and NPB For Splatoon there are three sides to choose from and just like in the first two games crossover Splatfest events are included with other Nintendo franchises such as Pok mon and The Legend of Zelda br Players then play a series of turf war matches and contribute scores to the side they picked A scoring system decides the winning side based on the overall score of those who played Although all Splatfests in Splatoon ended in July themes have been repeated since then and a Splatfest with a unique theme Super Mushroom vs Super Star happened from to January in celebration of the Super Mario th Anniversary br Due to the polarizing nature of the choices offered during Splatfests the themes themselves tend to be the subject of media attention The themes range from preference questionnaires e g cats vs dogs arts vs sciences to paradoxes e g chicken or the egg or sometimes be part of a real life corporate partnership or sponsorship with Nintendo such as a Transformers themed Splatfest with Hasbro the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and SpongeBob SquarePants themed ones with Nickelodeon or one with McDonald s br In most Splatfests the outcome tends to only affect the player s level of in game reward at the end of the event and typically have no impact on the overall playability of the game However the exception to the last Splatfest of each game which has marked the end of developer support for the game It was revealed that the outcome of the last Splatfest in Splatoon affected the story mode of Splatoon in which the losing protagonist Callie became an antagonist This was later confirmed by a developer after Splatoon s theme and setting seemed to be based on the winner of Splatoon s final Splatfest Chaos vs Order br br br Esports br Due to the availability of competitive game modes in Splatoon competitive esports tournaments with sponsored prizing have been held as early as in Japan br With the release of Splatoon Nintendo established the Splatoon World Championships and began hosting competitive tournaments in Teams of four compete in a series of online qualifiers or live tournaments to earn invitations to play at the World Championships which are played at the Nintendo World Championships alongside other Nintendo games such as Super Smash Bros Ultimate The event is typically held during Nintendo s E events and livestreamed br br br Setting br br br Inkling br br Inklings are a fictional species of terrestrial squid and are the primary playable characters br The player characters of Splatoon were originally anthropomorphic rabbits with the ability to burrow through virtually any solid surface This choice was considered because rabbits are highly territorial animals by nature However the idea was concerning to the designers who felt that there was a clash between the characters appearances and the ink based gameplay Designers came up with the idea for squid like Inklings that were able to hide and swim in ink When designing the Inklings the designers centered around it being female at first which they stated was because there were not many other female leads in Nintendo games at the time The Inklings were designed to be teenagers since the developers wanted to give the image of a strong rebelling character while having the attitude of being cool br Inklings can switch between humanoid and squid forms As humanoids they are able to wield weapons As squids they are able to hide in and swim through ink br The Inklings aesthetic design have received a positive critical reception from multiple video game publications following the release of the first Splatoon and have since become a popular subject for cosplay activities The integration of the Inklings physiological characteristics into the gameplay mechanics of the Splatoon series have been praised as it allowed players to explore a unique tactical concept Polygon staff in particular ranked two notable Inkling characters the Squid Sisters Callie and Marie among the best video game characters of the s decade they were described as an example of how Nintendo elevated anthropomorphized squids and made them into pop sensations A seemingly intentional decision to remove gendered language from player character customization in Splatoon s English localization was praised by some American publications br br br Development br br Splatoon was developed for the Wii U by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis Development It originally consisted of a four
