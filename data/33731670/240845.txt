the Game Watch handheld system inventor of the cross shaped Control Pad the original designer of the Game Boy and producer of a few long running and critically acclaimed video game franchises such as Metroid and Kid Icarus br br br Career br Yokoi graduated from Doshisha University with a degree in electronics He was first hired by Nintendo in to maintain the assembly line machines used to manufacture its hanafuda cards br In Hiroshi Yamauchi president of Nintendo came to a hanafuda factory where Yokoi was working and took notice of a toy an extending arm that Yokoi made for his own amusement during spare time while doing maintenance Yamauchi ordered Yokoi to develop it as a proper product for the Christmas rush The Ultra Hand was a huge success and Yokoi was asked to work on other Nintendo toys including the Ten Billion Barrel puzzle a miniature remote controlled vacuum cleaner called the Chiritory a baseball throwing machine called the Ultra Machine and a Love Tester He worked on toys until the company decided to make video games in when he became one of its first game designers only preceded by Genyo Takeda While traveling on the Shinkansen Yokoi supposedly saw a bored businessman playing with an LCD calculator by pressing the buttons Yokoi then got the idea for a watch that doubled as a miniature video gaming pastime br In Yamauchi appointed Yokoi to supervise Donkey Kong an arcade game created by Shigeru Miyamoto Yokoi explained many of the intricacies of game design to Miyamoto at the beginning of his career and the project only came to be approved after Yokoi brought Miyamoto s game ideas to the president s attention br After the worldwide success of Donkey Kong Yokoi continued to work with Miyamoto on the next Mario game Mario Bros He proposed the multiplayer concept and convinced his co worker to give Mario some superhuman abilities such as the ability to jump unharmed from great heights br br After Mario Bros Yokoi produced several R D games such as Kid Icarus and Metroid He designed R O B and the Game Boy the latter of which became a worldwide success Another of his creations the Virtual Boy was a commercial failure Nintendo has denied that the Virtual Boy s poor performance in the market was the reason for Yokoi s subsequent departure from the company holding that his retirement was absolutely coincidental to the market performance of any Nintendo hardware According to his Nintendo and Koto colleague Yoshihiro Taki Yokoi had originally decided to retire at age to do as he pleased but had simply delayed it According to David Sheff s book Game Over Yokoi never actually intended for the console to be released in its present form However Nintendo pushed the Virtual Boy to market so that it could focus development resources on the Nintendo br br Amid the failure of the Virtual Boy and the launch of the more successful Game Boy Pocket Yokoi left Nintendo on August after thirty one years at the company Leaving with several of his subordinates to form a new company called Koto Yokoi led the development of the Bandai WonderSwan handheld game console br br br Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology br Yokoi said The Nintendo way of adapting technology is not to look for the state of the art but to utilize mature technology that can be mass produced cheaply He articulated his philosophy of Lateral Thinking of Withered Technology Kareta Gijutsu no Suihei Shik also translated as Lateral Thinking with Seasoned Technology in the book Yokoi Gunpei Game House Withered technology in this context refers to a mature technology which is cheap and well understood Lateral thinking refers to finding radical new ways of using such technology Yokoi held that toys and games do not necessarily require cutting edge technology novel and fun gameplay are more important In the interview he suggested that expensive cutting edge technology can get in the way of developing a new product br Game Watch was developed based on this philosophy At the time of its development Sharp and Casio were fiercely competing in the digital calculator market For this reason there was a glut of liquid crystal displays and semiconductors The lateral thinking was to find an original and fun use for this cheap and abundant technology The NES and Game Boy were developed under a similar philosophy In the handheld market Yokoi s refusal to adopt a color display for the Game Boy in favor of long battery life is cited as the main reason it prevailed against Sega s Game Gear and Atari s Lynx br Satoru Iwata CEO of Nintendo from until his death in claimed that this philosophy has been passed on to the disciples of Yokoi such as Miyamoto and it continues to show itself in Nintendo s then current use of technology with the highly successful Nintendo DS and Wii br The Wii s internal technology was similar to that of Nintendo s previous home console the GameCube and was not as advanced in terms of computational capability and multimedia versatility compared to its competitors the Xbox and PlayStation Instead the system offered something completely different by introducing motion based controls to the console market in an attempt to change the ways video games are played and consequently to widen the audience for video games in general This strategy demonstrated Nintendo s belief that graphical advancement isn t the only way to make progress in gaming technology indeed after the Wii s overwhelming success Sony and Microsoft released their own motion control peripherals Nintendo s emphasis on peripherals for the Wii has also been pointed to as an example of Yokoi s lateral thinking at work br br br Death br On October Yokoi was riding in a car driven by his associate Etsuo Kiso on the Hokuriku Expressway when the vehicle rear ended a truck After the two men had left the car to inspect the damage Yokoi was hit and injured by a passing car The driver of the car that hit Yokoi in the second accident was Gen Tsushima a member of the tourism industry Yokoi s death was confirmed two hours later Kiso suffered only a fractured rib br br br Legacy br The
