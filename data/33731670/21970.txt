The Virtual Boy is a bit tabletop portable video game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo Released in it was marketed as the first console capable of displaying stereoscopic D graphics The player uses the console like a head mounted display placing the head against the eyepiece to see a red monochrome display The games use a parallax effect to create the illusion of depth Sales failed to meet targets and Nintendo ceased distribution and game development in having released only games for the system br Development of the Virtual Boy lasted four years and began under the project name VR Nintendo entered a licensing agreement to use a stereoscopic LED eyepiece technology that had been developed since the s by US company Reflection Technology It also built a factory in China to be used only for Virtual Boy manufacturing Over the course of development the console technology was downscaled due to high costs and potential health concerns and an increasing amount of resources were reallocated to the development of the Nintendo Nintendo s next home console Lead game designer Shigeru Miyamoto had little involvement with the Virtual Boy software The Virtual Boy was pushed to market in an unfinished state in to focus on the Nintendo br The Virtual Boy was panned by critics and was a commercial failure even after repeated price drops Its failure has been attributed to its high price dark display consisting of only red and black unimpressive stereoscopic effect poor ergonomics lack of true portability and health concerns due to it giving many players headaches dizziness nausea and eye pain Stereoscopic technology in video game consoles reemerged in later years to more success including Nintendo s DS handheld console As of March it is Nintendo s lowest selling standalone console and the only one to have less than one million units sold seconded by the Wii U s million units br br br History br br br Development br Since a red LED eyepiece display technology called Scanned Linear Array was developed by Massachusetts based Reflection Technology Inc RTI The company produced a stereoscopic head tracking inch display device prototype called Private Eye featuring a tank game Seeking funding and partnerships by which to develop it into a commercial technology RTI demonstrated Private Eye to the consumer electronics market including Mattel and Hasbro Sega declined the technology due to its single color display and concerns about motion sickness br Nintendo enthusiastically received the Private Eye as led by Gunpei Yokoi the general manager of Nintendo s R D and the inventor of the Game Watch and Game Boy handheld consoles He saw this as a unique technology that competitors would find difficult to emulate Additionally the resulting game console was intended to enhance Nintendo s reputation as an innovator and to encourage more creativity in games Codenaming the project VR Nintendo entered into an exclusive agreement with Reflection Technology Inc to license the technology for its displays While Nintendo s Research Development division R D was focused on developing the Nintendo the other two engineering units were free to experiment with new product ideas br Spending four years in development and eventually building a dedicated manufacturing plant in China Nintendo worked to turn its VR vision into an affordable and health conscious console design Yokoi retained RTI s choice of red LED because it was the cheapest and because unlike a backlit LCD its perfect blackness could achieve a more immersive sense of infinite depth RTI and Nintendo said a color LCD system would have been prohibitively expensive retailing for more than US equivalent to in A color LCD system was also said to have caused jumpy images in tests With ongoing concerns about motion sickness the risk of developing lazy eye conditions in young children and Japan s new Product Liability Act of Nintendo eliminated the head tracking functionality and converted its headmounted goggle design into a stationary heavy precision steel shielded tabletop form factor conformant to the recommendation of the Schepens Eye Research Institute br br W e experimented with a color LCD screen but the users did not see depth they just saw double Color graphics give people the impression that a game is high tech But just because a game has a beautiful display does not mean that the game is fun to play Red uses less battery and red is easier to recognize That is why red is used for traffic lights br Several technology demonstrations were used to show the Virtual Boy s capabilities Driving Demo is one of the more advanced demos its second clip shows a first person view of driving by road signs and palm trees This demo was shown at E and CES in The startup screen of the Virtual Boy prototype was shown at Shoshinkai A very confident projection of sales in Japan of three million hardware units and million software units as of March was given to the press The demo of what would have been a Star Fox game showed an Arwing doing various spins and motions Cinematic camera angles were a key element as they are in Star Fox It was shown at E and CES in br As a result of increasing competition for internal resources alongside the flagship Nintendo and little involvement from lead game designer Shigeru Miyamoto Virtual Boy software was developed without Nintendo s full attention According to David Sheff s book Game Over the increasingly reluctant Yokoi never intended for the increasingly downscaled Virtual Boy to be released in its final form However Nintendo pushed it to market so that it could focus development resources on its next console the Nintendo br br br Release br The New York Times previewed the Virtual Boy on November The console was officially announced via press release the next day November Nintendo promised that Virtual Boy would totally immerse players into their own private universe Initial press releases and interviews about the system focused on its technological capabilities avoiding discussion of the actual games that would be released The system was demonstrated the next day at Nintendo s Shoshinkai trade show Nintendo of America showed the Virtual Boy at the Consumer Electronics Show on January br Even with cost saving measures in place Nintendo priced the Virtual Boy at a relatively high US equivalent to in Though slightly less expensive and significantly less powerful than a home console this was considerably more costly than the Game Boy handheld With seemingly more advanced graphics than Game Boy the Virtual Boy was not intended to replace the handheld in Nintendo s product line as use of the Virtual Boy requires a steady surface and completely blocks the player s peripheral vision Design News described the Virtual Boy as the logical evolution of the View Master D image viewer br The Virtual Boy was released on July in Japan and on August in North America with the launch games Mario s Tennis Red Alarm Teleroboxer and Galactic Pinball It was not released in PAL markets In North America Nintendo shipped Mario s Tennis with every Virtual Boy sold as a pack in game Nintendo had initially projected sales of three million consoles and million games The system arrived later than other bit systems like PlayStation DO and Saturn but at a lower price br At the system s release Nintendo of America projected hardware sales of million units and software sales numbering million by the end of the year Nintendo had shipped units of the Virtual Boy by December around three and a half months after its North American release The system is number on GamePro s Top Worst Selling Consoles of All Time list in br The Virtual Boy had a short market timespan following its disappointing sales The last game officially released for the Virtual Boy was D Tetris released on March More games were announced for the system at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May but these games were never released The Virtual Boy was discontinued on December in Japan and August in North America without any announcement In June Nintendo reported to Famitsu worldwide sales of Virtual Boy units including in Japan Next Generation reported that Virtual Boy units were sold in December br br br Promotion br Nintendo extensively advertised the Virtual Boy and claimed to have spent US million on early promotional activities Advertising promoted the system as a paradigm shift from past consoles some pieces used cavemen to indicate a historical evolution while others utilized psychedelic imagery Nintendo targeted an older audience with advertisements for the Virtual Boy shifting away from the traditional child focused approach it had employed in the past Nintendo portrayed the system as a type of virtual reality as its name indicates Nintendo also focused on the technological aspects of the new console in its press releases neglecting to detail specific games br Challenged by showing three dimensional gameplay on two dimensional advertisements the company partnered with Blockbuster and NBC A million campaign promoted NBC s late lineup alongside the Virtual Boy American viewers were encouraged via television advertisements on NBC to rent the console for at a local Blockbuster This affordable demonstration provided consoles for rent some in a clamshell Blockbuster case Upon returning the unit renters received a coupon for off its purchase from any store The promotion included Blockbuster locations and sweepstakes with prizes including trips to see the taping of NBC shows The popular rental system proved harmful to the Virtual Boy s long term success allowing gamers to see just how non immersive the console was By mid Blockbuster was selling its Virtual Boy units at each The marketing campaign overall was commonly thought of as a failure br br br Hardware br The CPU is an NEC V bit RISC chip making the Virtual Boy Nintendo s first bit system The Virtual Boy system uses a pair of linear arrays one per eye and rapidly scans the array across the eye s field of view using flat oscillating mirrors These mirrors vibrate back and forth at a very high speed thus the mechanical humming noise from inside the unit Each Virtual Boy game cartridge has a yes no option to automatically pause every minutes so that the player may take a break before any injuries come to the eyes One speaker per ear provides the player with stereo audio br br br Display br br The Virtual Boy is the first video game console that was supposed to be capable of displaying stereoscopic D graphics marketed as a form of virtual reality Whereas most video games use monocular cues to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two dimensional screen the Virtual Boy creates an illusion of depth through the effect known as parallax Like using a head mounted display the user looks into an eyeshade made of neoprene on the front of the machine and then an eyeglass style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic red image br The display consists of two two bit four shade monochrome red screens of pixels and a frame rate of approximately Hz It uses an oscillating mirror to transform a single column of red LEDs into a full field of pixels Nintendo claimed that a color display would have made jumpy images and have been too expensive A color display would have required red green and blue LEDs blue LEDs were then considerably expensive This plus the other drawbacks influenced the decision for monochrome br br br Controller br br The Virtual Boy is meant for the player to be seated at a table and Nintendo promised but did not release a harness to wear while standing br The Virtual Boy s heavy emphasis on three dimensional movement requires the controller to operate along a Z axis Its controller is an attempt to implement dual digital D pads to control elements in the D environment The controller is shaped like an M like a Nintendo controller The player holds onto either side of the controller which has a unique extendable power supply that slides onto the back housing the system s six AA batteries The batteries can be substituted with a wall adapter via a slide on attachment for constant power br In more traditional two dimensional games the two directional pads are interchangeable For others with a more D environment like Red Alarm D Tetris or Teleroboxer each pad controls a different feature The symmetry of the controller also allows left handed gamers to reverse the controls as does the Atari Lynx br br br Connectivity br During development Nintendo promised the ability to link systems for competitive play A Virtual Boy link cable was being worked on at Nintendo as late as the third quarter of The system s EXT extension port located on the underside of the system below the controller port was never officially supported because no official multiplayer games were ever published Two games were intended to use the EXT port for multiplayer play but the multiplayer features were removed from Waterworld and Faceball was canceled br br br Games br br Nintendo initially showcased three launch games and planned two or three per month thereafter Given the system s short lifespan only games were actually released Of them games were released in the Japanese market and were released in North America Third party support was extremely limited compared to previous Nintendo platforms According to Gunpei Yokoi Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi had dictated that only a select few third party developers be shown the Virtual Boy hardware before its formal unveiling to limit the risk of poor quality software appearing on the system br When asked if Virtual Boy games were going to be available for download on the Virtual Console for the Nintendo DS Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils Aim said he could not answer as he was unfamiliar with the platform He noted that given his lack of familiarity he would be hard pressed to make the case for the inclusion of the games on the Virtual Console br The hobbyist community at Planet Virtual Boy has developed Virtual Boy software Two previously unreleased games Bound High and Niko Chan Battle the Japanese version of Faceball were released br br br Reception br br The Virtual Boy garnered negative critical reviews and was a commercial failure It failed for several reasons including its high price the discomfort caused by play and what was widely judged to have been a poorly handled marketing campaign br Gamers who previewed the system at the Shoshinkai trade show complained that the Mario demo was not realistic enough was not in full color and didn t motion track the image when players turn their heads In the lead editorial of Electronic Gaming Monthly following the show Ed Semrad predicted that the Virtual Boy would have poor launch sales due to the monochrome screen lack of true portability unimpressive lineup of games and the price which he argued was as low as it could get given the hardware but still too expensive for the experience Next Generation s editors were also dubious of the Virtual Boy s prospects after the show and concluded their article on the system by commenting But who will buy it It s not portable it s awkward to use it s antisocial unlike multiplayer SNES Genesis games it s too expensive and most importantly the VR i e D effect doesn t add to the game at all it s just a novelty br Following its release reviews of the Virtual Boy tended to praise its novelty but questioned its ultimate purpose and longtime viability The Los Angeles Times described the gameplay as being at once familiar and strange The column praised the quality of motion and immersive graphics but considered the hardware tedious to use and non portable In a later column the same reviewer found the system to be somewhat asocial but held hope for its future Reviewing the system shortly after its North American launch Next Generation said Unusual and innovative the Virtual Boy can be seen as a gamble in the same way that the Game Boy was but it s a lot harder to see the VB succeeding to the same world conquering extent that the Game Boy did They elaborated that while the sharp display and unique D effect are impressive aspects such as the monochrome display and potential vision damage to young gamers severely limit the system s appeal They added that the software library was decent but failed to capitalize on Nintendo s best selling franchises because games from The Legend of Zelda and Metroid were absent the Mario games were not in the same style as the series s most successful installments and it lacked a system seller to compare with the Game Boy s Tetris br Though Nintendo had promised a virtual reality experience the monochrome display limits the Virtual Boy s potential for immersion Reviewers often considered the three dimensional features a gimmick added to games that were essentially two or even one dimensional The Washington Post said that even when a game gives the impression of three dimensionality it suffers from hollow vector graphics Yokoi the system s inventor said the system did best with action and puzzle games although those types of games provided only minimal immersion Multiple critics lamented the absence of head tracking in the Virtual Boy hardware Critics found that as a result players were unable to immerse themselves in the game worlds of Virtual Boy games Instead they interacted simply via a controller in the manner of any traditional two dimensional game Boyer said the console struggles to merge the two distinct media forms of home consoles and virtual reality devices Though the device employs some basic virtual reality techniques it does so like the traditional home console with no bodily feedback incorporated into gameplay br Many reviewers complained of painful and frustrating physiological symptoms when playing the Virtual Boy Bill Frischling writing for The Washington Post experienced dizziness nausea and headaches Reviewers attributed the problems to both the monochromatic display and uncomfortable ergonomics Several prominent scientists concluded that the long term side effects could be more serious and articles published in magazines such as Electronic Engineering Times and CMP Media s TechWeb speculated that using any immersive headset such as the Virtual Boy could cause sickness flashbacks and even permanent brain damage Nintendo in the years after Virtual Boy s demise has been frank about its failure Howard Lincoln chairman of Nintendo of America said flatly that the Virtual Boy just failed br br br Legacy br According to Game Over Nintendo blamed the machine s faults directly on its creator Gunpei Yokoi The commercial failure of the Virtual Boy was reportedly a contributing factor to Yokoi s withdrawal from Nintendo although he had already planned to retire years prior and then finished the successful Game Boy Pocket which was released shortly before his departure According to his Nintendo and Koto colleague Yoshihiro Taki Yokoi had originally decided to retire at age to do as he pleased but had simply delayed it Nintendo held that Yokoi s departure was absolutely coincidental to the market performance of any Nintendo hardware The New York Times maintained that Yokoi kept a close relationship with Nintendo After leaving Nintendo Yokoi founded his own company Koto and collaborated with Bandai to create the WonderSwan a handheld system competing with the Game Boy br The commercial failure of the Virtual Boy reportedly did little to alter Nintendo s development approach and focus on innovation The console s focus on peripherals and haptic technology reemerged in later years The original inventor Reflection Technology Inc was reportedly financially devastated by the Virtual Boy s performance with dwindling operations by br The Nintendo DS console was launched in as a handheld gaming console with autostereoscopic D visuals without any special glasses Prior to launch Shigeru Miyamoto discussed the Virtual Boy He said it renders wireframe graphics but its effects are generally used for two dimensional games with depth separated planes He stated that the graphics are not as appealing and while developing the Nintendo he had ruled out the use of wireframe graphics as too sparse to draw player characters Finally he stated that he perceived the Virtual Boy as a novelty that should not have used the Nintendo license so prominently br In February Tatsumi Kimishima stated that Nintendo was looking into virtual reality but also explained that it would take more time and effort for them to assess the technology and in a February interview with Nikkei he stated that the company was studying VR and would add it to the Nintendo Switch once it is figured out how users can play for long durations without any issues Nintendo introduced a VR accessory for the Switch as part of Labo a line of player assembled cardboard toys leveraging the console s hardware and Joy Con controllers In this case the console is used as a head mounted display for the headset br Hobbyists adapted Virtual Boy to other displays Emulation enabled modern stereoscopic goggles such as Google Cardboard Samsung Gear VR and Oculus Rift in In hobbyist Furrtek released a board that replaces the display circuitry allowing the Virtual Boy to be played on a VGA monitor or television set On February a homebrew Virtual Boy emulator for the Nintendo DS was released named Red Viper which made it possible to play the Virtual Boy library using stereoscopic D br Nintendo has referenced the Virtual Boy in other games such as Tomodachi Life where a trailer for the life simulation game included a scene of several Mii characters worshipping the Virtual Boy In Luigi s Mansion Luigi uses a device by Professor E Gadd known as the Virtual Boo to access maps and other information in game succeeding the use of devices referencing the Game Boy Color and first generation Nintendo DS in previous installments Its menus use a red and black color scheme while E Gadd optimistically boasts that the device would fly off the shelves br br br See also br br Entex Adventure Vision a video game console with similar mechanical operation br Famicom D
