states for all of them br Nintendo produced and sold about million NES Classic Editions from November through April with shipments selling out nearly immediately In April Nintendo announced they were discontinuing the product leading to consumer confusion and incidents of greatly increased pricing among private sellers Due to the demand of the NES Classic and the success of the Super NES Classic Edition console Nintendo re introduced a limited run of the NES Classic on June Production was discontinued again in December It was well received for its emulation quality br br br Hardware br The NES Classic Edition is a dedicated console for emulating Nintendo Entertainment System NES games The console is distributed in two versions one for Japan featuring the likeness of the original Family Computer Famicom and one for the rest of the world which looks like the original NES For the NES version all of the games are based on their US release running at Hz and using the names by which they were released in the United States While the Famicom version s interface is only in Japanese the NES version supports up to eight other languages but neither affects the language for their games themselves br Internally the console uses an Allwinner R system on a chip with four ARM Cortex A central processing cores and an ARM Mali MP graphics processing unit It includes MB of flash storage and MB of DDR memory br For video output the system features an HDMI connection which puts out p at Hz video for all games br The controllers in the NES version of the console feature the Wii Nunchuk s connector which allows the controller to be connected to the Wii Remote for use with Virtual Console games on the Wii and Wii U Accessories for the Wii such as the Classic Controller can also be used The controllers for the Famicom version are hardwired into the console like its original counterpart so they cannot be used in conjunction with the Wii This version s two controllers are also proportioned to the size of the console to fit into its holding slots on the sides resulting in them being smaller than their NES counterpart The microphone on the Player controller is cosmetic and does not work br The console uses the Linux operating system running a new NES emulation engine developed by Nintendo European Research Development NERD The emulation included limited support for some of the memory management controllers aka mappers used in NES cartridges to extend the ability of the console such as for Super Mario Bros though not all known mappers were included with the emulation engine The emulation engine was regarded as superior in both visual and audio support when compared to the Virtual Console emulations of NES titles br A page book called Playing with Power Nintendo NES Classics published by Prima Games was released the same day as the console the book is a guide to some of the games included on the system Nintendo of America brought back the Nintendo Power Line as an automated phone hotline from November to as a celebration of the launch of the system br br br Included games br br Regardless of the model or region the microconsole included built in games in all regions Games that originally had different titles in the PAL regions use their respective American monikers such as Ninja Gaiden originally Shadow Warriors and Super C originally Probotector II Return of the Evil Forces From the included titles are common between all regions while the eight remaining ones are exclusive to either Japan or North America PAL region respectively br br br Release br The NES Classic Edition was first released on November in Japan and Australia and November in North America and Europe With the limited supply these initial shipments sold out almost immediately br Nintendo produced about million NES Classic Editions over the next five months By April Nintendo announced it was ceasing production of the unit with final shipments sent out within the next few days br Nintendo s decision to stop production of the console was met with criticism due to consumer s lack of awareness of the limited availability of the console as described below Following the announcement of the Super NES Classic Edition which served as a counterpart to the NES Classic Edition but for Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES titles Nintendo announced that it would also resume production of the NES Classic Edition in Nintendo brought renewed shipments of the system on June with production of the system expected to continue throughout the year br Upon its re release in June the NES Classic Mini sold more units than the PS Xbox One and the Nintendo Switch br Combined sales of the NES and SNES Classic editions by September exceeded million units br On December Reggie Fils Aim affirmed that both the NES and SNES Classic Editions would not be restocked after the holiday season nor does Nintendo anticipate producing any similar mini console version of its other home consoles in the near future br br br Reception br Aside from criticism regarding the controller cord being too short as well as minor emulation glitches especially with sound the NES Classic Edition has been well received br One of many plug n play consoles on the market the demand for NES Classic Edition was notably large with various retailers collectively selling approximately units in its first month remarkably selling out within hours of availability Nintendo reported million units had been sold by the end of On April Nintendo revealed that million consoles were sold in total Following the rerelease of the console Nintendo had sold about million additional units through June Combined sales of the NES and SNES Classic editions by September exceeded million units br Despite the positive reception journalists were confused about Nintendo s decision to discontinue the unit as announced in April Nintendo did not say at launch that the system was meant to be only a limited run and its messaging for it seemed to suggest it would be a product with a longer production life The company clarified when announcing the discontinuation that NES Classic Edition wasn t intended to be an ongoing long term product However due to high demand we did add extra shipments to our original plans The lack of availability of the unit since launch with shipments immediately selling out when they reach stores also suggested Nintendo was not prepared for the demand for the product Nintendo of America s CEO Reggie Fils Aim later stated that We just didn t anticipate how incredible the response would be having considered the sales of other similar retro consoles but they had to discontinue the unit as we ve got a lot going on right now and we don t have unlimited resources br According to an April report by Eurogamer the discontinuation of the NES Classic was in part to transition the production line to a SNES Classic system designed similarly to the NES Classic but featuring games from the SNES to be launched in late though Nintendo did not confirm this information While journalists agreed Nintendo would likely be more prepared to produce a larger number of SNES Classic systems Nintendo s decision with the NES Classic may have influenced consumers to be wary of trying to buy a system produced in low volumes or give the impression of artificial scarcity with the product as part of a longer term strategy to keep consumers demanding Nintendo products When the Super NES Classic Edition was officially announced in June Nintendo said it will produce significantly more units of Super NES Classic Edition than we did of NES Classic Edition to avoid a similar shortage issue but reaffirmed that it was not anticipated to be an ongoing product In December Fils Aim affirmed that both the NES and SNES Classic Editions will not be restocked after the holiday season nor does Nintendo anticipate producing any similar mini console version of its other home consoles in the future br br br Hacking br Shortly after the NES Classic Edition s release hackers discovered ways to unofficially add up to titles to the system s library as well as enable emulation support for other consoles Games from various consoles such as the Nintendo and X have been successfully made to run on the NES Classic Edition br br br Scalping and bootlegs br The NES Classic Edition s very limited stock during its original release in was one of its main criticisms with some stores receiving fewer than units at a time This coupled with the extremely high demand prompted internet scalpers to buy as many as they could so they could resell them with extreme price markups In the US prices were commonly set between and compared to its launch price of The separate controller that could be bought without the console suffered the same fate often being included with the main unit The limited supply of NES Classic was compared to the situation around Amiibo shortages which similarly were offered by Nintendo in limited quantity and led to scalping and high resale prices frustrating fans br When Nintendo announced it was discontinuing the NES Classic Edition in April Nintendo enthusiasts and some outlets such as Polygon and The Verge believed that Nintendo planned on a limited release of the NES classic to drive artificial scarcity and increase sales but which got out of hand with scalpers and secondary sales which have backfired on them Nintendo denied these claims stating that it was limited by its own rate of production with other hardware products and that It s definitely not intentional in terms of shorting the market br Following the April discontinuation consumers found that several bootleg versions of the NES Classic Edition appeared on third party auction sites typically produced by Chinese companies Some of these bootlegs have been found to be near identical in hardware and software which could confuse consumers who were looking to purchase a Classic Edition One of these is called the Mini Game Anniversary Edition Entertainment System which actually is a Famiclone and therefore only provides composite video out br br br Limited Sh nen Jump Version br A very limited gold Nintendo Classic Mini Family Computer Weekly Sh nen Jump th Anniversary Version was developed by M and released only in Japan on July Celebrating the th anniversary of Shueisha s Weekly Sh nen Jump manga magazine the special edition features Famicom games largely based on Sh nen Jump manga properties including Dragon Ball Saint Seiya and Kinnikuman br This edition of the console includes the following games br br Within two days over units of the Sh nen Jump Version had been sold Reviewing for Nintendo Life Damien McFerran criticized the unchanged design flaws from the Famicom version along with the quality of selected titles He did praise the packaging and called the gold casing utterly gorgeous McFerran noted the wide third party licensing put into this release and speculated whether Nintendo would release more third party titles on their services in the future br br br Gallery br br br NES version br br br br br
