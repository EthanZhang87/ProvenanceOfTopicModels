id: 3442219
In the history of video games the second generation era refers to computer and video games video game consoles and handheld video game consoles available from to Notable platforms of the second generation include the Fairchild Channel F Atari Intellivision Odyssey and ColecoVision The generation began in November with the release of the Fairchild Channel F This was followed by the Atari in Magnavox Odyssey in Intellivision in and then the Emerson Arcadia ColecoVision Atari and Vectrex all in By the end of the era there were over different consoles It coincided with and was partly fuelled by the golden age of arcade video games This peak era of popularity and innovation for the medium resulted in many games for second generation home consoles being ports of arcade games Space Invaders the first killer app arcade game to be ported was released in for the Atari though earlier Atari published arcade games were ported to the previously Coleco packaged Nintendo s Donkey Kong with the ColecoVision when it was released in August br Built in games like those from the first generation saw limited use during this era Though the first generation Magnavox Odyssey had put games on cartridge like circuit cards the games had limited functionality and required TV screen overlays and other accessories to be fully functional More advanced cartridges which contained the entire game experience were developed for the Fairchild Channel F and most video game systems adopted similar technology The first system of the generation and some others such as the RCA Studio II still came with built in games while also having the capability of utilizing cartridges The popularity of game cartridges grew after the release of the Atari From the late s to the mid s most home video game systems used cartridges until the technology was replaced by optical discs The Fairchild Channel F was also the first console to use a microprocessor which was the driving technology that allowed the consoles to use cartridges Other technology such as screen resolution color graphics audio and AI simulation was also improved during this era The generation also saw the first handheld game cartridge system the Microvision which was released by toy company Milton Bradley in br In gaming giant Activision was created by former Atari programmers and was the first third party developer of video games By the shelf capacity of toy stores was overflowing with an overabundance of consoles over hyped game releases and low quality games from new third party developers An over saturation of consoles and games coupled with poor knowledge of the market saw the video game industry crash in and marked the start of the next generation Beginning in December and stretching through all of the crash of caused major disruption to the North American market Some developers collapsed and almost no new games were released in The market did not fully recover until the third generation The second generation ended on January with the discontinuation of the Atari br br br Background br br The primary driver of the second generation of consoles was the introduction of the low cost microprocessor Arcade games and the first generation of consoles used discrete electronic components including simple logic chips such as transistor transistor logic TTL based integrated circuits ICs Custom application specific integrated circuits ASICs like the AY were produced to replicate these circuits within a single chip but still presented only a single fixed logic program Once a game was shipped there were only minimal variations that could be made by adjusting the positions of jumpers effectively the behavior of the cartridges that shipped with the Magnavox Odyssey As Atari Inc recognized spending from to and several months of development time on a hardware unit with a single dedicated game with only three month shelf life before it was outdated by other competitors offerings was not a practical business model and instead some type of programmable console would be preferred br Intel introduced the first microprocessor the in a special computer chip that could be sent a simple instruction and provide its result This allowed the ability to create software programs around the microprocessor rather than fix the logic into circuits and ICs Engineers at both Atari Inc via its Cyan Engineering subsidiary and at Alpex Computer Corporation saw the potential to apply this to home consoles as prices for microprocessors became more affordable Alpex s work led to partnership with semiconductor manufacturer Fairchild Camera and Instrument and lead to the release of the first such programmable home console the Fairchild Channel F released in based on the Fairchild F microprocessor The Channel F also established the use of ROM cartridges to provide the software for the programmable console consisting of a ROM chip mounted on a circuit board within a hard casing that can withstand the physical insertion into the console and potential static electricity buildup Atari s own programmable console the Atari Video Computer System Atari VCS or later known as the Atari was released in and based on the MOS Technology microprocessor with a cartridge design influenced in part by the Channel F system Other console manufacturers soon followed suit with the production of their own programmable consoles br At the start of the second generation all games were developed and produced in house Four former Atari programmers having left from conflicts in management style after Atari was purchased by Warner Communications in established Activision in to develop their own VCS games which included Kaboom and Pitfall Atari sued Activision on the basis of theft of trade secrets and violation of their non disclosure agreements but the two companies settled out of court in with Activision agreeing to pay a small license fee to Atari for every game of theirs they sold This established Activision as the first third party developer for a console This also established a working model for licensing other third party developers which several companies followed in Activision s wake partially contributing to the video game crash of due to oversaturation br As the second generation of consoles coincided with the golden age of arcade video games a common trend that emerged during the generation was licensing arcade video games for consoles Many of them were increasingly licensed from Japanese video game companies by which led to Jonathan Greenberg of Forbes predicting in early that Japanese companies would eventually dominate the North American video game industry later in the decade br At this stage both consoles and game cartridges were intended to be sold for profit by manufacturers However by segregating games from the console this approach established the use of the razorblade business model in future console generations where consoles would be sold at or below cost while licensing fees from third party games would bring in profits br br br Home systems br br br Fairchild Channel F br br The Fairchild Channel F also known early in its life as the Fairchild Video Entertainment System VES was released by Fairchild Semiconductor in November and was the first console of the second generation It was the world s first CPU based video game console introducing the cartridge based game code storage format The console featured a pause button that allowed players to freeze a game This allowed them to take a break without the need to reset or turn off the console so they did not lose their current game progress Fairchild released twenty six cartridges for the system with up to four games being on each cartridge The console came with two pre installed games Hockey and Tennis br Following the release of the Atari the Channel F s popularity waned quickly as the more action driven games of the Atari drew more attention than the more educational and slow paced games on the Channel F By only an additional units of the Channel F were sold for lifetime sales of br In Fairchild redesigned the system into a new model the Channel F System II The System II streamlined some of the initial Channel F to reduce cost and improve consumer usage compared to the Atari such as improved controller connections and using the television speakers for audio output but by the time it was released the Atari had too much market advantage for Fairchild to overcome After releasing games for the system Fairchild sold the Channel F technology to Zircon International in who then discontinued the system by br br br Atari and br br In Atari released its CPU based console called the Video Computer System VCS later called the Atari Nine games were designed and released for the holiday season Atari held exclusive rights to most of the popular arcade game conversions of the day They used this key segment to support their older hardware in the market This game advantage and the difference in price between the machines meant that each year Atari sold more units than Intellivision lengthening its lead despite inferior graphics The Atari sold over million units over its lifetime considerably more than any other console of the second generation In Atari released the Atari in an attempt to compete with the Intellivision While superior to the poor sales and lack of new games meant Atari only supported it for two years before it was discontinued br Early Atari cartridges contained kilobytes of read only storage This limit grew steadily from to up to kilobytes for Atari cartridges Bank switching a technique that allowed two different parts of the program to use the same memory addresses was required for the larger cartridges to work The Atari cartridges got as large as kilobytes through this technique The Atari had only bytes of RAM available in the console A few late game cartridges contained a combined RAM ROM chip thus adding another bytes of RAM inside the cartridge itself The Atari standard joystick was a digital controller with a single button released in br br br Bally Astrocade br br The Bally Astrocade was released in and was available only through mail order It was originally referred to as the Bally Home Library Computer Delays in the production meant that none of the units shipped until By this time the machine had been renamed the Bally Professional Arcade In this form it sold mostly at computer stores and had little retail exposure unlike the Atari VCS The rights to the console were sold to Astrovision in They re released the unit with the BASIC cartridge included for free this system was known as the Bally Computer System When Astrovision changed their name to Astrocade in they also changed the name of the console to the Astrocade to follow suit It sold under this name until the video game crash of when it was discontinued br br br Magnavox Odyssey br br In Magnavox released its microprocessor based console the Odyssey in the United States and Canada It was distributed by Philips Electronics in the European market and was released as the Philips G A defining feature of the system was the speech synthesis unit add on which enhanced music sound effects and speech capabilities The Odyssey was also known for its fusion of board and video games Some titles came with a game board and pieces which players had to use in conjunction to play the game Although the Odyssey never became as popular as the Atari consoles it sold million units throughout its lifetime This made it the third best selling console of the generation It was discontinued in br br br Intellivision br br The Intellivision was introduced by Mattel to test markets in and nationally in The Intellivision console contained a bit processor with bit registers and bit system RAM This was long before the bit era Programs were however stored on bit ROM It also featured an advanced sound chip that could deliver output through three distinct sound channels The Intellivision was the first console with a thumb pad directional controller and tile based playfields with vertical and horizontal scrolling The system s initial production run sold out shortly after its national launch in Early cartridges were kilobyte ROMs which grew to kilobytes for later games br The Intellivision introduced several new features to the second generation It was the first home console to use a bit microprocessor and offer downloadable content through the PlayCable service It also provided real time human voices during gameplay It was the first console to pose a serious threat to Atari s dominance A series of TV advertisements featuring George Plimpton were run They used side by side game comparisons to show the improved graphics and sound compared with those of the Atari It sold over million units before being discontinued in br br br ColecoVision br br The ColecoVision was introduced by toy manufacturer Coleco in August It was more powerful than previous consoles providing an experience that was closer to Arcades than what the could provide The console launched with several arcade ports including Sega s Zaxxon and later saw third party support from many developers such as Activision and even their competitor Atari The ColecoVision is notable for its Atari expansion module which enabled the console to play games resulting in a lawsuit from Atari The ColecoVision was a victim of the video game crash ultimately being discontinued in br br br Vectrex br br The Vectrex was released in It was unique among home systems of the time in featuring vector graphics and its own self contained display At the time many of the most popular arcade games used vector displays Through a licensing deal with Cinematronics GCE was able to produce high quality versions of arcade games such as Space Wars and Armor Attack Despite a strong library of games and good reviews the Vectrex was ultimately a commercial failure It was on the market for less than two years br br br Comparison br br br Sales standings br The best selling console of the second generation was the Atari at million units As of the Intellivision had sold million units This is around million higher than the Odyssey and ColecoVision sales and eight times the number of purchases for the Fairchild Channel F which was units br br br Other consoles br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Handheld systems br br br Microvision br br The Microvision manufactured and sold by Milton Bradley was released in It was the first handheld game console that used cartridges that could be swapped out and that contained their own processor as the console itself had no on board processor It had a small game library which was prone to damage from static electricity and the LCD screen could also rot These two factors contributed to its discontinuation two years after release br br br Entex Select A Game and Adventure Vision br Entex released two handheld systems in the second generation the Select A Game and the Adventure Vision There were games available for the Select A Game but it was only available for a year until focus shifted to the Adventure Vision which was released in the following year br The Adventure Vision was released only in North America in by Entex and was the successor to the Select A Game It was unique among the consoles as it used a spinning mirror system for its built in display and had to be used set down on a surface due to its size and shape It was discontinued one year later in after selling just over fifty thousand units br br br Palmtex Super Micro br Developed and manufactured by Palmtex the Super Micro was released in and discontinued later that year Due to financial problems between Palmtex and Home Computer Software only three games were released for the system despite more being planned It was criticized for its poor build quality and how easily it would break and sold fewer than units br br br Epoch Game Pocket Computer br br The Epoch Game Pocket Computer was released in Japan in Due to poor sales only five games were made for it and was not released outside of Japan br br br Nintendo Game Watch br br The Game Watch was a series of handheld consoles that contained a single game in each release The first titled Ball was released in and titles were released up until it was discontinued in Unlike the other handheld consoles in the second generation the Game Watch had a segmented LCD screen similar to a digital watch which limited the display to the configuration of the segments The series sold a combined million units making it the most popular handheld of the generation br br br Comparison br br br Software br br br Milestone titles br Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Cloudy Mountain Intellivision by Mattel Electronics won an
