feature on these games GamePro attributed their success to the following three factors br br Tiger s effective licensing Director of marketing Tamara Lebovitz stated We read all the magazines and talk to all the studios to keep on the cutting edge of what s hot with kids As a fairly small company at the time Tiger was able to pursue desirable licenses quickly and aggressively This allowed them to release licensed games while the properties they were licensed from were still at the peak of their popularity br The low price per game Tiger handheld games sold for roughly each By comparison most handheld games of the time cost over and required a separately sold system an additional or more to play it on br The simplistic addictive gameplay of the games While older gamers tended to find Tiger handheld games one dimensional and boring for kids aged five to twelve years old their simple and easy to learn mechanics were more appealing than other video games of the time which were often frustratingly difficult and dauntingly complex for younger children br In the fall of Tiger introduced a specialized line of their handheld LCD games called Tiger Barcodzz These were barcode games which read any barcode and used it to generate stats for the player character The line was a major success in Japan where there were even reality shows based around gamers competing to find the best

game Although running a software program stored in ROM those systems were dedicated consoles similarly to the plug and play TV games of the s decade Two systems running the same game could be linked with the included cable to allow two players to challenge each other br br br Cartridge based handhelds br Tiger made three notable cartridge based systems The first was the Quiz Wiz a highly popular interactive quiz game system Players inserted a cartridge and played using the corresponding quiz book The second was the R Zone It employed red LCD cartridges much like Nintendo s Virtual Boy which were projected via backlight onto a reflective screen that covered one of the player s eyes The third was the Game com handheld system which was meant to compete with Nintendo s Game Boy and Game Boy Color as well as Sega s Game Gear and Genesis Nomad and boasted such novel features as a touchscreen and limited Internet connectivity However the R Zone and Game com were commercial failures and garnered a negative reception br br br Furby br Hasbro previously shy of high tech toys was interested in the development of the Furby With Hasbro s support Tiger was able to rush through the development process and get the Furby on the shelves for the holiday season during which it was a runaway hit the it toy of the and seasons The continuing development of Furby type technology led to the release of the FurReal line of toys in the more modern iteration of the Furby toyline in and also the high tech Furby Connect in br br br Brain Family br br From Tiger invented the Brain Family

a spherical unit that has six colored knobs sticking out There were three different revisions of the circuit board of Brain Warp resulting in audio changes and pitch differences Two revisions were made in a blue base Revision has a different hidden sound sampling mode to the first revision When Hasbro re released Brain Warp in they took the programming from Revision and placed it on a new circuit board with an enhanced speaker which reduced the loudness of the device This game is very similar to Bop It A voice that was recorded for the game says a color or a number or a sequence of colors or numbers or both depending on the game selected and the correct knob must be shown facing upwards In a Star Wars version called Death Star Escape was released The game order is different and comes with six Star Wars characters br In Tiger released Brain Shift This game has six colored LED lights It is known for its distinctive low pitched Orange voice which is heard on the last color of a pattern in Stick Shift and in Memory Shift and Who Shifts It The player has to use the stick shift to follow the voice commands There is a memory game and both Brain Shift and Brain Warp have a code buster game where the player has to find a certain number of colors in sixty seconds Some Brain Shift game units had a bad chip in the game which causes the game to mess up the audio on low batteries and in rare cases the voice in the game will start counting going through a list of numbers and skipping a few br br br Making toys and games for other brands br The company became one of the most prominent producers of electronic toys based on a wide variety of licenses including Star Trek Star Wars Barney Friends Arthur Teletubbies Winnie the Pooh Franklin Neopets Jeopardy Wheel of Fortune

released The first version was buggy and it had issues playing several games games and In games and the player failed automatically sometime after seconds due to the speed of the red light being impossible to stay away from In game the light patterns went in different directions and it was harder to play Also the game had a loud voice but quiet background music In version all the issues were fixed in the audio and game modes The gameplay is similar to Pac Man in that the player maneuvers a green LED light through a maze of LED lights and has to either avoid ditch the red light or catch snag the yellow light The game was known for its Austin Powers and Melle Mel style voices the electronic voice would often say baby When the game was first turned on it said Oh you turned me on baby let s boogey When the player failed the game said Oh drat This game was also published by Hasbro The game also suffered from a glitch it would become stuck playing every sound from the game and pressing the power button would not turn the game off The loud crackling over the top of the rapidfire used to scare people The cause for this glitch is unknown but it might be trying to go through an automatic test mode br br br Harry Potter Challenge Wand br In Tiger Electronics released a memory game called the Harry Potter Magic Spell Challenge simply known as the Challenge Wand on which the game sees the player up against an Evil Wizard as he casts a spell on the wand unit which the player must memorize in order The first game in the unit is called Compete Against an Evil Wizard In this

The announcer will announce how many rounds the player has completed The game also includes a Simon style game called Wizards are Better Than One which involves sticking with one pattern and adding an extra command on it each time Game has different music to the other games on which requires wands One player makes a pattern and sends it to the other wand and then the other player has to repeat it back br br br Test modes demo modes br Tiger Electronics and Hasbro are known to include a hidden test mode also known as a demo mode in all their electronic games These test modes signal either a sine wave or a square wave tone usually at hz as a way of testing the speaker and then play through all of the sounds that are pre programmed in the device either manually by pushing a button or automatic playing every sound by itself Games like Brain Warp Brain Shift Boogey Ball and Brain Bash have these test modes as do tabletop games such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire br br br br br br
