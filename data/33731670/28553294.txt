PICA is a graphics processing unit GPU designed by Digital Media Professionals Inc DMP a Japanese GPU design startup company for use in embedded devices such as vehicle systems mobile phones cameras and game consoles The PICA is an IP Core which can be licensed to other companies to incorporate into their SOCs It was most notably licensed for use in the Nintendo DS br It was announced at SIGGRAPH and an operational demo Mikage was presented in collaboration with Futuremark at SIGGRAPH br br br Overview br The PICA is the successor to the ULTRAY a proof of concept graphics workstation presented at SIGGRAPH created with the goal of testing DMP s attempts at a low power fixed function MAESTRO GPU architecture br The PICA implements the MAESTRO G architecture and supports programmable vertex shaders and geometry shaders with a fixed function fragment stage It is advertised as supporting OpenGL ES with certain proprietary extensions br The PICA has up to programmable vertex processors which can work in parallel One of those processors the primitive engine can be used as either vertex processor or a geometry processor br Some MAESTRO G extensions include per pixel lighting where the lighting is calculated per pixel instead of per vertex procedural texture generation bidirectional reflectance distribution function BRDF Cook Torrance specular highlights polygon subdivision through geometry shaders soft shadow projection and fake subsurface scattering similar to two sided lighting br br br Applications br The PICA is used as the GPU for the Nintendo DS portable handheld game console br br br Specification br Manufacturing process nm br Maximum clock frequency MHz br Pixel performance theoretical br Megapixel s MHz br Megapixel s MHz br Vertex performance theoretical br Mtriangle s MHz br Mpolygon s MHz br Power consumption mW MHz br Frame Buffer max pixels br Supported pixel formats RGBA RGB RGBA RGBA br Vertex program ARB vertex program br Render to Texture br Hardware Transform and Lighting T L br MipMap br Bilinear texture filtering br Alpha blending br Full scene anti aliasing br Phong Shading br Cel Shading br Perspective Correct Texture Mapping br Dot Bump Mapping Normal Mapping br Shadow Mapping br Shadow Volumes br Self Shadowing br Lightmapping br Environment Mapping Reflection Mapping br Volumetric Fog br Post processing effects like motion bloom depth of field HDR rendering gamma correction br Polygon offset br Depth Test Stencil Test Alpha Test br Clipping Culling br bit stencil buffer br bit depth buffer br Single Double Triple buffer br Stage TEV Pipeline br TEV Combiner Buffer Only the first four TEV stages can write to the combiner buffer br Color Combiners Alpha Combiners Texture Combiners br DMP s MAESTRO G technology br per pixel lighting br fake sub surface scattering br procedural texture br refraction mapping br subdivision primitive br shadow br gaseous object rendering br bidirectional reflectance distribution function br Cook Torrance Model br polygon subdivision br soft shadowing br br br br br br External links br PICA D Graphics IP br PICA block diagram br SIGGRAPH GPU PICA August br DS DMP D IP PICA June
