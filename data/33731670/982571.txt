title: History of video game consoles
id: 982571
The history of video game consoles both home and handheld began in the s The first console that played games on a television set was the Magnavox Odyssey first conceived by Ralph H Baer in Handheld consoles originated from electro mechanical games that used mechanical controls and light emitting diodes LED as visual indicators Handheld electronic games had replaced the mechanical controls with electronic and digital components and with the introduction of Liquid crystal display LCD to create video like screens with programmable pixels systems like the Microvision and the Game Watch became the first handheld video game consoles br Since then home game consoles have progressed through technology cycles typically referred to as generations Each generation has lasted approximately five years during which the major console manufacturers have released console with broadly similar specifications Handheld consoles have seen similar advances and are usually grouped into the same generations as home consoles br While early generations were led by manufacturers like Atari and Sega the modern home console industry is dominated by three companies Nintendo Sony and Microsoft The handheld market has waned since the introduction of mobile gaming in the mid s and today the only major manufacturer in handheld gaming is Nintendo br br br Origins br br br Home consoles br br The first video games were created on mainframe computers in the s typically with text only displays or computer printouts and limited to simple games like Tic Tac Toe or Nim Eventually displays with rudimentary vector displays for graphics were available leading to titles like Spacewar in Spacewar directly influenced Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney to create Computer Space in the first recognized arcade game br Separately while at Sanders Associates in Ralph H Baer conceived of the idea of an electronic device that could be connected to a standard television to play games With Sanders permission he created the prototype Brown Box which was able to play a limited number of games including a version of table tennis and a simple light gun game Sanders patented the unit and licensed the patents to Magnavox where it was manufactured as the first home video game console the Magnavox Odyssey in Bushnell after seeing the Odyssey and its table tennis game believed he could make something better He and Dabney formed Atari Inc and with Allan Alcorn created their second arcade game Pong Pong first released in and was more successful than Computer Space Atari released a Pong home console through Sears in br br br Handheld consoles br br The origins of handheld game consoles are found in handheld and tabletop electronic game devices of the s and early s These electronic devices can only play built in games they fit in the palm of the hand or on a tabletop and they may make use of a variety of video display technologies such as LED VFD or LCD These games derived from the emerging optoelectronic display driven calculator market of the early s br The first such handheld electronic game was released by Mattel in where Michael Katz Mattel s new product category marketing director told the engineers in the electronics group to design a game the size of a calculator using LED technology This effort led to the games Auto Race and Football The two games were so successful that according to Katz these simple electronic handheld games turned into a million category Another Ralph Baer invention Simon published by Milton Bradley in followed which further popularized such electronic games and remained an enduring property by Milton Bradley later Hasbro that brought a number of copycats to the market Soon other manufacturers including Coleco Parker Brothers Entex and Bandai began following up with their own tabletop and handheld electronic games br The transition from handheld electronic games to handheld video games came with the introduction of LCD screens These screens gave handheld games the flexibility to play a wide range of games Milton Bradley s Microvision released in used a x pixel LCD screen and was the first handheld to use interchangeable game cartridges br Nintendo s line of Game Watch titles first introduced in was designed by Gunpei Yokoi who was inspired when he saw a man passing time on a train by playing with an LCD calculator Taking advantage of the technology used in the credit card sized calculators that had appeared on the market Yokoi designed the series of LCD based games to include a digital time display in the corner of the screen so that they could double as a watch While the Game Watch series were considered handheld electronic games rather than handheld video game consoles their success led Nintendo through Yokoi s design lead to produce the Game Boy in br br br Console generations br The history of video game consoles are typically segmented into generations which are used to group consoles that have shared a competitive market These console generations typically last about five years following a Moore s law progression where processing power increased by times roughly every five years This cyclic market has resulted in an industry wide adoption of the razorblade model where companies sell consoles at a small profit while making the bulk of their money from selling games The companies then transition users to their new console as the new generation comes on line using a form of planned obsolescence br The exact start and end of each console generation is not consistently defined Some schemes have been based on direct market data including a seminal work published in an IEEE journal in while others are based on shifts in technology Wikipedia itself has been noted for creating its own version of the console generations that differ from academic sources The discrepancies between how consoles are grouped into generations and how these generations are named have caused confusion when trying to compare shifts in the video game marketplace compared to other consumer markets Kemerer et al provide a comparative analysis of these different generations through systems released up to as shown below br br br Console generation timeline br The generations described here use the Wikipedia system of defining console generations which generally breaks consoles up by technology features whenever possible and uses the Odyssey and Pong style home consoles as the first generation an approach that has generally been adopted and extended by video game journalists In this approach the generation starts with the release of the first console considered to have the generation s defining features and ends with the last discontinuation of a console in that generation For example the third generation is considered to have ended in with the formal discontinuation of the Nintendo Entertainment System that year This can create years with overlaps between multiple generations as shown br This approach uses the concept of bit count generally meaning the word length used by the processors on the console to define the earlier console generations More bits generally led to improved gameplay graphics and audio capabilities For example the original Nintendo Entertainment System was bit while the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was bit Bits were commonly used in console marketing starting with the TurboGrafx which had an bit central processor but included a bit graphical processing unit NEC the console s manufacturer marketed the TurboGrafx as a bit console supposedly superior to the bit NES Other advertisers followed suit creating a period known as the bit wars that lasted through the fifth generation where console manufactures tried to outsell each other based on the bit count of their system br The bit wars essentially ended after the fifth generation although some sixth generation consoles like the PlayStation were marketed as bit Modern game consoles like essentially all modern computers are bit Though the bit terminology fell out of use older consoles are strongly associated with their bit count and the earlier generations gained alternate names based on the dominant bit count of the major systems of that era For example the third generation can be called the bit generation br Later console generations are based on groupings of release dates rather than common hardware as base hardware configurations between consoles have greatly diverged generally following trends in generation definition given by video game and mainstream journalism Handheld consoles and other gaming systems and innovations are frequently grouped within the release years associated with the home console generations for example the growth of digital distribution is associated with the seventh generation br br br Console history timeline by generation br The development of video game consoles primarily follows the history of video gaming in the North American and Japanese markets Few other markets saw any significant console development on their own such as in Europe where personal computers tended to be favored alongside imports of video game consoles The video game clone in less developed markets like China and Russia were not considered here br br br First generation br br The first generation of home consoles were generally limited to dedicated consoles with just one or two games pre built into the console hardware with a limited means to alter gameplay factors In the case of the Odyssey while it did ship with game cards these did not have any programmed games on them but instead acted as jumpers to alter the existing circuitry pathway and did not extend the capabilities of the console Unlike most other future console generations the first generation of consoles were typically built in limited runs rather than as an ongoing product line br The first home console was the Magnavox Odyssey in September based on Baer s Brown Box design Originally built from discrete transistors Magnavox transitioned to integrated circuit chips that were inexpensive and developed a new line of consoles in the Odyssey series from to At the same time Atari had successfully launched Pong as an arcade game in and began work to make a home console version in late which they eventually partnered with Sears to the new home Pong console by the Christmas season Pong had several technology advantages over the Odyssey including an internal sound chip and the ability to track score Coleco developed the first Telstar console in With Magnavox Atari and Coleco all vying in the console space by and further cost reductions in key processing chips from General Instruments numerous third party manufacturers entered the console market by with ball and paddle games This led to market saturation by and the industry s first market crash Atari and Coleco attempted to make dedicated consoles with wholly new games to remain competitive including Atari s Video Pinball series and Coleco s Telstar Arcade but by this point the first steps of the market s transition to the second generation of consoles had begun making these units obsolete near release br The Japanese market for gaming consoles followed a similar path at this point Nintendo had already been a business partner with Magnovox by and helped to design the early light guns for the console Dedicated home game consoles in Japan appeared in with Epoch Co s TV Tennis Electrotennis As in the United States numerous clones of these dedicated consoles began to appear most made by the large television manufacturers like Toshiba and Sharp and these games would be called TV geemu or terebi geemu TV game as the designation for video games in Japan Nintendo became a major player when Mitsubishi having lost their manufacturer Systek due to bankruptcy turned to the company to help continue to build their Color TV Game line which went on to sell about million units across four different units between and br br br Second generation br br The second generation of home consoles was distinguished by the introduction of the game cartridge where the game s code is stored in read only memory ROM within the cartridge When the cartridge is slotted into the console the electrical connections allow the main console s processors to read the game s code from the ROM While ROM cartridges had been used in other computer applications prior the ROM game cartridge was first implemented in the Fairchild Video Entertainment System VES in November Additional consoles during this generation all which used cartridge based systems included the Atari known as the Atari Video Computer System VCS at launch the Magnavox Odyssey Mattel Electronics Intellivision and the ColecoVision In addition to consoles newer processor technology allowed games to support up to colors and up to channel audio effects br With the introduction of cartridge based consoles came the need to develop a wide array of games for them Atari was one of the forefronts in development for its Atari Atari marketed the console across multiple regions including into Japan and retained control of all development aspects of the games Game developments coincided with the Golden age of arcade video games that started in with the releases of Space Invaders and Asteroids and home versions of these arcade games were ideal targets The Atari version of Space Invaders released in was considered the killer app for home video game consoles helping to quadruple the console s sales that year Similarly Coleco had beaten Atari to a key licensing deal with Nintendo to bring Donkey Kong as a pack in game for the Colecovision helping to drive its sales br br At the same time Atari has been acquired by Warner Communications and internal policies led to the departure of four key programmers David Crane Larry Kaplan Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead who went and formed Activision Activision proceeded to develop their own Atari games as well as games for other systems Atari attempted legal action to stop this practice but ended up settling out of court with Activision agreeing to pay royalties but otherwise able to continue game development making Activision the first third party game developer Activision quickly found success and were able to generate US million in revenue from about US million in startup funds within months Numerous other companies saw Activision s success and jumped into game development to try to make fast money on the rapidly expanding North America video game market This led to a loss of publishing control and dilution of the game market by the early s Additionally in following on the success of Space Invaders Atari and other companies had remained eager for licensed video game possibilities Atari had banked heavily on commercial sales of E T the Extra Terrestrial in but it was rushed to market and poorly received and failed to make Atari s sales estimates Along with competition from inexpensive home computers the North American home console market crashed in br For the most part the crash signaled the end of this generation as Nintendo s introduction of the Famicom the same year brought the start of the third generation When Nintendo brought the Famicom to North America under the name Nintendo Entertainment System it helped to revitalize the industry and Atari now owned by Jack Tramiel pushed on sales of the previously successful Atari under new branding to keep the company afloat for many more years while he transitioned the company more towards the personal computer market The Atari stayed in production until marking the end of the second generation br br br Handhelds of the second generation br Handheld electronic games had already been introduced on the market such as Mattel Auto Race in and Simon in While not considered video games as lacking the typical video screen element instead using LED lights as game indicators they still established a market for portable video games br The first handheld game console emerged during the second home console generation using simple LC displays Early attempts at cartridge based handheld systems included the Microvision by Milton Bradley and the Epoch Game Pocket Computer but neither gained significant traction Nintendo on the other hand introduced its line of Game Watch portable games each with a single dedicated game as its first venture into the video game market First introduced in the Game Watch series ran for over a decade and sold more than million units br br br Third generation br br Frequently called the bit generation the third generation s consoles used bit processors five audio channels and more advanced graphics capability including sprites and tiles instead of block based graphics of the second generation Further the third console saw the market dominance shift from the United States to Japan as a result of the crash br Both the Sega SG and the Nintendo Nintendo Entertainment System launched near simultaneously in Japan in The Famicom after some initial technical recalls soon gained traction and became the best selling console in Japan by the end of By that point Nintendo wanted to bring the console to North America but recognized the faults that the video game crash had caused It took several steps to redesign the console to make it look less like a game console and rebranded it as the Nintendo Entertainment System NES for North America to avoid the video game label stigma The company also wanted to avoid the loss of publishing control that had occurred both in North America as well as in Asia after the Famicom s release and created a lockout system that required all game cartridges to be manufactured by Nintendo to include a special chip If this chip was not present the console would fail to play the game This further gave Nintendo direct control on the titles published for the system rejecting those it felt were too mature The NES launched in North America in and helped to revitalize the video game market there br Sega attempted to compete with the NES with its own Master System released later in in both the US and Japan but did not gain traction to compete Similarly Atari s attempts to compete with the NES via the Atari in failed to knock the NES from its dominant position The NES remained in production until when it was discontinued along with its successor the Super Nintendo Entertainment System br br br Fourth generation br br The fourth generation of consoles also known as the bit generation further advanced core console technology with bit processors improving the available graphics and audio capabilities of games br NEC s TurboGrafx or PC Engine as released in Japan first released in is considered the first fourth generation console even though it still had an bit CPU The console s bit graphics processor gave it capabilities comparable to the other fourth generation systems and NEC s marketing had pushed the console being an advancement over the NES as a bit system Both Sega and Nintendo entered the fourth generation with true bit systems in the Sega Genesis Mega Drive in Japan and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES Super Famicom in Japan SNK also entered the competition with a modified version of their Neo Geo MVS arcade system into the Neo Geo released in which attempted to bridge the gap between arcade and home console systems with the shared use of common game cartridges and memory cards This generation was notable for the so called console wars between Nintendo and Sega primarily in North America Sega to try to challenge Nintendo s dominant position created the mascot character Sonic the Hedgehog who exhibited cool personality to appeal to the Western youth in contrast to Nintendo s Mario and bundled the Genesis with the game of the same name The strategy succeeded with Sega becoming the dominant player in North America until the mid s br br During this generation the technology costs of using optical discs in the form of CD ROMs has dropped sufficiently to make them desirable to be used for shipping computer software including for video games for personal computers CD ROMs offered more storage space than game cartridges and could allow for full motion video and other detailed audio video works to be used in games Console manufacturers adapted by created hardware add ons to their consoles that could read and play CD ROMs including NEC s TurboGrafx CD add on as well as the integrated TurboDuo system in and the Sega CD add on for the Genesis in and the Neo Geo CD in Costs of these add ons were generally high nearing the same price as the console itself and with the introduction of disc based consoles in the fifth generation starting in these fell by the wayside Nintendo had initially worked with Sony to develop a similar add on for the SNES the Super NES CD ROM but just before its introduction business relationships between Nintendo and Sony broke down and Sony would take its idea on to develop the fifth generation PlayStation Additionally Philips attempted to enter the market with a dedicated CD ROM format the CD i also released in that included other uses for the CD ROM media beyond video games but the console never gained traction br The fourth generation had a long tail that overlapped with the fifth generation with the SNES s discontinuation in marking the end of the generation To keep their console competitive with the new fifth generation ones Nintendo took to the use of coprocessors manufactured into the game cartridges to enhance the capabilities of the SNES This included the Super FX chip which was first used in the game Star Fox in generally considered one of the first games to use real time polygon based D rendering on consoles br br br Handhelds of the fourth generation br br Nintendo brought its experience from the Game Watch series to develop the Game Boy system in with subsequent iterations through the years The unit included a LCD screen that supported a shade monochrome pixel display the use of a cartridge based system and the means to link up two units to play head to head games One of the early packages included Tetris bundled with the unit which became the Game Boy s best selling game and led the unit to dominate handheld sales at the time The Game Boy also introduced the Kirby franchise worldwide which became a staple of Nintendo s handheld consoles br The Atari Lynx was also introduced in and included a color LED screen but its small game library and low battery life failed to make it competitive with the Game Boy Both Sega and NEC also attempted to compete with the Game Boy with the Game Gear and the TurboExpress respectively both released in Each were attempts to bring the respective home console games to handheld systems but struggled against the staying power of the Game Boy br br br Fifth generation br br During this time home computers gained greater prominence as a way of playing video games The video game console industry nonetheless continued to thrive alongside home computers due to the advantages of much lower prices easier portability circuitry specifically dedicated towards video games the ability to be played on a television set which PCs of the time could not do in most cases and intensive first party software support from manufacturers who were essentially banking their entire future on their consoles br Besides the shift to bit processors the fifth generation of consoles also saw most companies excluding Nintendo shift to dedicated optical media formats instead of game cartridges given their lower cost of production and higher storage capacity Initial consoles of the fifth generation attempted to capitalize on the potential power of CD ROMs which included the DO and the Atari Jaguar in However early in the cycle these systems were far more expensive than existing fourth generation models and has much smaller game libraries Further Nintendo s use of co processors in late SNES games further kept the SNES as one of the best selling systems over new fifth generation ones br Two of the key consoles of the fifth generation were introduced in the Sega Saturn and the Sony PlayStation both which challenged the SNES ongoing dominance While the Saturn sold well it did have a number of technical flaws but established Sega for a number of key game series going forward The PlayStation in addition to using optical media also introduced the use of memory cards as to save the state of a game Though memory cards had been used by Neo Geo to allow players to transfer game information between home and arcade systems the PlayStation s approach allowed games to have much longer gameplay and narrative elements leading to highly successful role playing games like Final Fantasy VII By the PlayStation became the best selling console over the GBA br Nintendo released their next console the Nintendo in late Unlike other fifth generation units it still used game cartridges as Nintendo believed the load time advantages of cartridges over CD ROMs was still essential as well as their ability to continue to use lockout mechanisms to protect copyrights The system also included support for memory cards as well and Nintendo developed a strong library of first party titles for the game including Wave Race and The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time that helped to drive its sales While the Nintendo did not match the PlayStation s sales it kept Nintendo a key competitor in the home console market alongside Sony and Sega br As with the transition from the fourth to fifth generation the fifth generation has a long overlap with the sixth console generation with the PlayStation remaining in production until br br br Handhelds of the fifth generation br br Nintendo released the Virtual Boy an early attempt at virtual reality in The unit required the player to play a game through a stereoscopic viewerfinder which was awkward and difficult and did not lend well to portable gaming Nintendo instead returned to focus on incremental improvements to the Game Boy including the Game Boy Pocket and the Game Boy Color br Sega also released the Genesis Nomad a handheld unit that played Sega Genesis games in in North America only The unit had been developed through Sega of America with little oversight from Sega s main headquarters and as Sega moved forward the company as a whole decided to put more focus on the Sega Saturn to stay competitive and drop support for all other ongoing systems including the Nomad br Despite Nintendo s domination of handheld console market some competing consoles such as Neo Geo Pocket WonderSwan Neo Geo Pocket Color and WonderSwan Color appeared in the late s and discontinued several years later after their appearance in handheld console market br br br Sixth generation br br By the sixth generation console technology began to catch up to performance of personal computers of the time and the use of bits as their selling point fell by the wayside The console manufactures focused on the individual strengths of their game libraries as marketing instead The consoles of the sixth generation saw further adoption of optical media expanding into the DVD format for even greater data storage capacity additional internal storage solutions to function as memory cards as well as adding support either directly or through add ons to connect to the Internet for online gameplay Consoles began to move towards a convergence of features of other electronic living room devices and moving away from single feature systems br By this point there were only three major players in the market Sega Sony and Nintendo Sega got an early lead with the Dreamcast first released in Japan in It was the first home console to include a modem to allow players to connect to the Sega network and play online games However Sega found several technical issues that had to be resolved before its Western launch in Though its Western release was more successful than in Japan the console was soon outperformed by Sony s PlayStation released in The PlayStation was the first console to add support for DVD playback in addition to CD ROM as well as maintaining backward compatibility with games from the PlayStation library which helped to draw consumers that remained on the long tail of the PlayStation While other consoles of the sixth generation had not anticipated this step the PlayStation s introduction of backwards compatibility became a major design consideration of future generations Along with a strong game library the PlayStation went on to sell million units before it was discontinued in and as of remains the best selling home console of all time Unable to compete with Sony Sega discontinued the Dreamcast in and left the hardware market instead focusing on its software properties Nintendo s entry in the sixth generation was the GameCube in its first system to use optical discs based on the miniDVD format A special Game Boy Player attachment allowed the GameCube to use any of the Game Boy cartridges as well and adapters were available to allow the console to connect to the Internet via broadband or modem br At this point Microsoft also entered the console market with its first Xbox system released in Microsoft considered the PlayStation s success as a threat to the personal computer in the living room space and had developed the Xbox to compete As such the Xbox was designed based more on Microsoft s experience from personal computers using an operating system built out from its Microsoft Windows and DirectX features utilizing a hard disk for save game store built in Ethernet functionality and created the first console online service Xbox Live to support multiplayer games While the original Xbox had modest sales compared to the PlayStation and was not profitable for the company Microsoft considered the Xbox to have successfully demonstrated their abilities to participate in the console market br br br Handhelds of the sixth generation br br Nintendo continued to refine its Game Boy design with the Game Boy Advance in including its Game Boy Advance SP in and Game Boy Micro in all with the ability to link to the GameCube to extend the functionality of certain games Also introduced were the Neo Geo Pocket Color in and Bandai s WonderSwan Color launched in Japan in South Korean company Game Park introduced its GP handheld in and with it came the dawn of open source handheld consoles br During the sixth generation a new type of market for gaming came from the growing mobile phone arena where advanced smart phones and other portable devices could be loaded with games Nokia s N Gage was one of the first devices marketed as a mobile phone and game system first released in and later redesigned as the N Gage QD br br br Seventh generation br br Video game consoles had become an important part of the global IT infrastructure by the mid s It was estimated that video game consoles represented of the world s general purpose computational power in the year br By the seventh generation Sony Microsoft and Nintendo had all developed consoles designed to interface with the Internet adding networking support for either wired and wireless connections online services to support multiplayer games digital storefronts for digital purchases of games and both internal storage and support for external storage on the console for these games With the start and transition to the HD era these consoles also added support for digital television resolutions through HDMI interfaces but as the generation occurred in the midst of the High definition optical disc format war between Blu ray and HD DVD a standard for high definition playback was yet to be fixed A further innovation came by the use of motion controllers either built into the console or offered as an add on afterwards Consoles in this generation started using custom CPUs based on the PowerPC instruction set and were increasingly sharing similarities with the personal computer in game development although with challenges due to the more complex nature of porting between the differences in architectures br Microsoft entered the seventh generation first with the Xbox in The Xbox saw several hardware revisions over its lifetime which became a standard practice for Microsoft going forward these revisions offered different features such as a larger internal hard drive or a fast processor at a higher price point As shipped the Xbox supported DVD discs and Microsoft had opted to support the HD DVD format with an add on for playback of HD DVD films However this format ended up as deprecated compared to Blu ray The Xbox was backward compatible with about half of the original Xbox library Through its lifetime the Xbox was troubled by a consistent hardware fault known as the Red Ring of Death RROD and Microsoft spent over billion correcting the problem br Sony s PlayStation was released in The PlayStation represented a shift of the internal hardware from Sony s custom Emotion Engine to a PowerPC based system Initial PlayStation units shipped with a special Emotion Engine daughterboard that allowed for backwards compatibility of PlayStation games but later revisions of the unit removed this leaving only software based emulation for PlayStation games available Sony banked on the Blu ray format which was included from the start and partially helped spur the adoption of Blu Ray as the favoured format for high definition optical media With the PlayStation Sony introduced the PlayStation Network for its online services and storefront While the system would initially have a slow start in the market in part due to its high price complex game development environment and initial lack of quality games the PlayStation eventually became more well received over time following gradual price cuts improved marketing campaigns new hardware revisions particularly the Slim models and key critically acclaimed exclusives br Nintendo introduced the Wii in around the same time as the PlayStation Nintendo lacked the same manufacturing capabilities and relationships with major hardware supplies as Sony and Microsoft and to compete diverged on a feature for feature approach and instead developed the Wii around the novel use of motion controls in the Wii Remote This blue ocean strategy releasing a product where there was no competition was considered part of the unit s success and which drove Microsoft and Sony to develop their own motion control accessors to compete Nintendo provided various online services that the Wii could connect to including the Virtual Console where players could purchase emulated games from Nintendo s past consoles as well as games for the Wii The Wii used regular sized DVDs for its game medium but also directly supported GameCube discs The Wii was generally considered a surprising success that many developers had initially overlooked br The seventh generation concluded with the discontinuation of the PlayStation in br br br Handhelds of the seventh generation br Nintendo introduced the new Nintendo DS system in a game cartridge based unit that support two screens including one being touch sensitive The DS also included built in wireless connectivity to the Internet to purchase new DS games or Virtual Console titles as well as the ability to connect to each other or to a Wii system in an ad hoc manner for certain multiplayer titles Sony entered the handheld market in with the PlayStation Portable PSP with a reduced design based on the PlayStation Like the DS the PSP also supported wireless connectivity to the Internet to download new games and ad hoc connectivity to other PSP or to a PlayStation The PSP used a new format called Universal Media Disc UMD for game and other media br Nokia revived its N Gage platform in the form of a service for selected S devices This new service launched on April Other less popular handheld systems released during this generation include the Gizmondo launched on March and discontinued in February and the GP X launched on November and discontinued in August The GP X Wiz Pandora and Gizmondo were scheduled for release in br Another aspect of the seventh generation was the beginning of direct competition between dedicated handheld video game devices and increasingly powerful PDA cell phone devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch and the latter being aggressively marketed for gaming purposes Simple games such as Tetris and Solitaire had existed for PDA devices since their introduction but by PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented with the advantage of distribution over wireless broadband Apple had launched its App Store in that allowed developers to publish and sell games for iPhones and similar devices beginning the rise of mobile gaming br br br Other seventh generation hardware br Based on the success of the Wii Remote controller both Microsoft and Sony released similar motion detection controllers for their consoles Microsoft introduced the Kinect motion controller device for the Xbox which served as both a camera microphone and motion sensor for numerous games Sony released the PlayStation Move a system consisting of a camera and lit handheld controllers which worked with its PlayStation br br br Eighth generation present br br Aside from the usual hardware enhancements consoles of the eighth generation focus on further integration with other media and increased connectivity Consoles at this point had also standardized on CPUs using the x instruction set the same as in personal computers and there was a convergence of the individual hardware components between consoles and personal computers making the porting of games between these systems much easier Later hardware improvements pushed for higher frame rates at up to K resolutions Digital distribution increased in popularity while the addition and improvements to remote play capabilities became standard and second screen experiences via companion apps added more interactivity to games br The Wii U introduced in was considered by Nintendo to be a successor to the Wii but geared to more serious players The console supported backward compatibility with the Wii including its motion controls and introduced the Wii U GamePad a tablet controller hybrid that acted as a second screen Nintendo further refined its network offerings to develop the Nintendo Network service to combine storefront and online connectivity services The Wii U did not sell as well as Nintendo had planned as they found people mistook the GamePad to be a tablet they could take with them away from the console and the console struggled to draw the third party developers as the Wii had br Both the PlayStation and Xbox One came out in Both were similar improvements over the previous generation s respective consoles providing more computational power to support up to frames per second at p resolutions for some games Each unit also saw a similar set of revisions and repackaging to develop high and low end cost versions In the case of the Xbox One the console s initial launch had included the Kinect device but this became highly controversial in terms of potential privacy violations and lack of developer support and by its mid generation refresh the Kinect had been dropped and discontinued as a game device Both consoles eventually released upgraded hardware during their mid cycle refresh with Sony releasing the PlayStation Pro and Microsoft releasing the Xbox One X which allowed for higher frame rates and up to K resolution in addition to Slim models marking a departure from previous generations while adding considerable longevity to this generation cycle br Later in the eighth generation Nintendo released the Nintendo Switch in The Switch is considered the first hybrid game console It uses a special CPU GPU combination that can run at different clock frequencies depending on how it is used It can be placed into a special docking unit that is hooked to a television and a permanent power supply allowing faster clock frequencies to be used to be played at higher resolutions and frame rates and thus more comparable to a home console Alternatively it can be removed and used either with the attached Joy Con controllers as a handheld unit or can be even played as a tablet like system via its touchscreen In these modes the CPU GPU run at lower clock speeds to conserve battery power and the graphics are not as robust as in the docked version A larger suite of online services was removed through the Nintendo Switch Online subscription including several free NES and SNES titles replacing the past Virtual Console system The Switch was designed to address many of the hardware and marketing faults around the Wii U s launch and has become one of the company s fastest selling consoles after the Wii br Game systems in the eighth generation also faced increasing competition from mobile device platforms such as Apple s iOS and Google s Android operating systems Smartphone ownership was estimated to reach roughly a quarter of the world s population by the end of The proliferation of low cost games for these devices such as Angry Birds with over billion downloads worldwide presents a new challenge to classic video game systems Microconsoles cheaper stand alone devices designed to play games from previously established platforms also increased options for consumers Many of these projects were spurred on by the use of new crowdfunding techniques through sites such as Kickstarter Notable competitors include the GamePop OUYA GameStick Android based systems the PlayStation TV the NVIDIA SHIELD the Apple TV and Steam Machines br br br Handhelds of the eighth generation br The Nintendo DS released in expanded on the Nintendo DS design and added support for an autostereoscopic screen to project stereoscopic D effects without the use of D glasses The console was otherwise remained backward compatible with all of the DS titles Sony introduced its PlayStation Vita in a revised version of the PSP but eliminating the use of external media and focusing on digital acquisition of games as well as incorporating a touchscreen and was released in Europe and North America on February br As noted above the Nintendo Switch is a hybrid console capable of both being used as a home console in its docked mode and as a handheld The Nintendo Switch Lite revision was released in which reduced some of the features of the system and its size including eliminating the ability to dock the unit making the Switch Lite primarily a handheld system but otherwise compatible with most of the Switch s library of games br br br Other eighth generation hardware br Virtual reality systems appeared during the eighth generation with three main systems the PlayStation VR headset that worked with PlayStation hardware the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive which ran off a personal computer br br br Ninth generation present br br Both Microsoft and Sony released successors to their home consoles in November Consoles in this generation also launched with lower cost models lacking optical disc drives targeting those who would prefer to purchase games exclusively through digital downloads Both console families target K and K resolution televisions at high frame rates support for real time ray tracing rendering D spatial audio variable refresh rates the use of high performance solid state drives SSD as internal high speed memory to make delivering game content much faster than reading from optical disc or standard hard drives which can eliminate loading times and support in game streaming With features that were commonly standard in PCs and the move to higher performance APUs consoles in the ninth generation now have capabilities comparable to high end personal computers often making cross platform development easier and more widely available than previously further converging and blurring the line between video game consoles and personal computers br Microsoft released the fourth generation of Xbox with the Xbox Series X and Series S on November The Series X has a base performance target of frames per second at K resolution to be four times as powerful as the Xbox One X One of Microsoft s goals with both units was to assure backward compatibility with all games supported by the Xbox One including those original Xbox and Xbox titles that are backward compatible with the Xbox One allowing the Xbox Series X and Series S to support four generations of games br Sony s PlayStation was released on November and also is a similar performance boost over the PlayStation The PlayStation uses a custom SSD solution with much higher input output rates that are almost comparable to RAM chip speeds significantly improving rendering and data streaming speeds The chip architecture is comparable to the PlayStation allowing backwards compatible with most of the PlayStation library while select games will need chip timing tweaking to make them compatible br In terms of handhelds Sony has announced no further
