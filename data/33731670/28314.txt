The Super Nintendo Entertainment System commonly shortened to Super Nintendo Super NES or SNES is a bit home video game console developed by Nintendo that was released in in Japan and South Korea in North America in Europe and Oceania and in South America In Japan it is called the Super Famicom SFC In South Korea it is called the Super Comboy and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics The system was released in Brazil on August by Playtronic Although each version is essentially the same several forms of regional lockout prevent cartridges for one version from being used in other versions br The Super NES is Nintendo s second programmable home console following the Nintendo Entertainment System NES The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time like the Sega Genesis It was designed to accommodate the ongoing development of a variety of enhancement chips integrated into game cartridges to be more competitive into the next generation br The Super NES received largely positive reviews and was a global success becoming the best selling console of the bit era after launching relatively late and facing intense competition from Sega s Genesis console in North America and Europe Overlapping the NES s million unit sales the Super NES remained popular well into the bit era with million units sold worldwide by the time it was discontinued in It continues to be popular among collectors and retro gamers with new homebrew games and Nintendo s emulated rereleases such as on the Virtual Console the Super NES Classic Edition Nintendo Switch Online as well as several non console emulators which operate on a desktop computer or mobile device such as Snes x br br br History br To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in and Sega followed suit with the Mega Drive in The two platforms were later launched in North America in as the TurboGrafx and the Sega Genesis respectively Both systems were built on bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the bit NES It took several years for Sega s system to become successful Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping Bill Mensch the co creator of the bit MOS Technology microprocessor and founder of the Western Design Center WDC gave Ricoh the exclusive right to supply bit and bit WDC microprocessors for the new system Meanwhile Sony engineer Ken Kutaragi reached an agreement with Nintendo to design the console s sound chip without notifying his supervisors who were enraged when they discovered the project though Kutaragi was nearly fired then CEO Norio Ohga intervened in support of the project and gave him permission to complete it br On September then Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi revealed the development of the Super Famicom in the newspaper Kyoto Shimbun On August in an interview with TOUCH Magazine Yamauchi announced the development of Super Mario Bros Dragon Quest V three original games and he projected sales of million units of the upcoming console Famicom Hissyoubon magazine speculated that Yamauchi s early announcement was probably made to forestall Christmas shopping for the PC Engine and relayed Enix s clarification that it was waiting on sales figures to select either PC Engine or Super Famicom for its next Dragon Quest game The magazine and Enix both expressed a strong interest in networking as a standard platform feature The console was demonstrated to the Japanese press on November and again on July br br br Launch br br Designed by Masayuki Uemura the designer of the original Famicom the Super Famicom was released in Japan on Wednesday November for equivalent to in It was an instant success Nintendo s initial shipment of units sold out within hours and the resulting social disturbance led the Japanese government to ask video game manufacturers to schedule future console releases on weekends This gained the attention of the yakuza criminal organizations so the devices were shipped at night to avoid robbery br With the Super Famicom quickly outselling its rivals Nintendo reasserted itself as the leader of the Japanese console market Nintendo s success was partially due to the retention of most of its key third party developers including Capcom Konami Tecmo Square Koei and Enix br Nintendo released the Super Nintendo Entertainment System a redesigned version of the Super Famicom in North America for US equivalent to in It began shipping in limited quantities on August with an official nationwide release date of September The Super NES was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland in April for equivalent to in br Most of the PAL region versions of the console use the Japanese Super Famicom design except for labeling and the length of the joypad leads The Playtronic Super NES in Brazil although PAL M uses the North American design Both the NES and Super NES were released in Brazil in by Playtronic a joint venture between the toy company Estrela and consumer electronics company Gradiente br The Super NES and Super Famicom launched with few games but these games were well received In Japan only two games were initially available Super Mario World and F Zero Bombuzal was released during the launch week In North America Super Mario World was launched as a bundle with the console other launch games include F Zero Pilotwings both of which demonstrate the console s Mode pseudo D rendering SimCity and Gradius III br br br Console wars br br The rivalry between Nintendo and Sega was described as one of the most notable console wars in video game history in which Sega positioned the Genesis as the cool console with games aimed at older audiences and aggressive advertisements that occasionally attacked the competition Nintendo scored an early public relations advantage by securing the first console conversion of Capcom s arcade hit Street Fighter II for Super NES which took more than a year to make the transition to the Genesis Though the Genesis had a two year lead to launch time a much larger library of games and a lower price point it only represented an estimated of the American bit console market in June and neither console could maintain a definitive lead for several years Donkey Kong Country is said to have helped establish the Super NES s market prominence in the latter years of the bit generation and for a time maintain against the PlayStation and Saturn According to Nintendo the company had sold more than million Super NES units in the U S According to a Wedbush Securities report based on NPD sales data the Super NES outsold the Genesis in the U S market by million units br br br Changes in policy br During the NES era Nintendo maintained exclusive control over games released for the system the company had to approve every game each third party developer could only release up to five games per year but some third parties got around this by using different names such as Konami s Ultra Games brand those games could not be released on another console within two years and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges Competition from Sega s console brought an end to this practice in Acclaim Entertainment began releasing games for both platforms with most of Nintendo s other licensees following suit over the next several years Capcom which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly and Square were the most notable holdouts br Nintendo continued to carefully review submitted games scoring them on a point scale and allocating marketing resources accordingly Each region performed separate evaluations Nintendo of America also maintained a policy that among other things limited the amount of violence in the games on its systems The surprise arcade hit Mortal Kombat a gory fighting game with huge splashes of blood and graphically violent fatality moves was heavily censored by Nintendo Because the Genesis version allowed for an uncensored version via cheat code it outsold the censored Super NES version by a ratio of nearly three to one br U S Senators Herb Kohl and Joe Lieberman convened a Congressional hearing on December to investigate the marketing of violent video games to children Though Nintendo took the high ground with moderate success the hearings led to the creation of the Interactive Digital Software Association and the Entertainment Software Rating Board and the inclusion of ratings on all video games With these ratings in place Nintendo decided its censorship policies were no longer needed br br br bit era and beyond br While other companies were moving on to bit systems Rare and Nintendo proved that the Super NES was still a strong contender in the market In November Rare released Donkey Kong Country a platform game featuring D models and textures pre rendered on Silicon Graphics workstations With its detailed graphics fluid animation and high quality music Donkey Kong Country rivals the aesthetic quality of games that were being released on newer bit CD based consoles In the last days of million copies were sold making it the fastest selling video game in history to that date This game conveyed that early bit systems had little to offer over the Super NES and proved the market for the more advanced consoles of the near future According to TRSTS reports two of the top five bestselling games in the U S for December are Super NES games br In October Nintendo released a redesigned model of the Super NES the SNS model referred to as New Style Super NES in North America for US equivalent to in with some units including the pack in game Super Mario World Yoshi s Island Like the earlier New Style NES model NES this is slimmer and lighter than its predecessor but it lacks S Video and RGB output and it is among the last major Super NES related releases in the region A similarly redesigned Super Famicom Jr was released in Japan at around the same time The redesign stayed out of Europe br Nintendo ceased production of the Super NES in North America in about two years after releasing Kirby s Dream Land its final first party game in the US on November and one year after releasing Frogger its final third party game in the US in In Japan Nintendo continued production of both the Family Computer and the Super Famicom until September and new games were produced until the year ending with the release of Metal Slader Glory Director s Cut on November br Many popular Super NES games were ported to the Game Boy Advance which has similar video capabilities In Nintendo announced that Super NES games would be made available for download via the Wii s Virtual Console service On October Nintendo Co Ltd announced that it would no longer repair Family Computer or Super Famicom systems due to an increasing shortage of the necessary parts On March Nintendo Co Ltd announced that it would bring Super NES games to the New Nintendo DS and New Nintendo DS XL and later the New Nintendo DS XL via its eShop download service At the Nintendo Direct event on September Nintendo announced that it would be bringing select Super NES games to the Nintendo Switch Online platform br br br Hardware br br br Technical specifications br The bit design of the Super NES incorporates graphics and sound co processors that perform tiling and simulated D effects a palette of colors and channel ADPCM audio These base platform features plus the ability to dramatically extend them all through substantial chip upgrades inside of each cartridge represent a leap over the bit NES generation and some significant advantages over bit competitors such as the Genesis br br br CPU and RAM br The CPU is a Ricoh A which is a derivative of the bit WDC C microprocessor In NTSC regions its nominal clock speed is MHz but the CPU will slow down to either MHz or MHz when accessing some slower peripherals br This CPU has an bit data bus and two address buses The bit Bus A is designated for general accesses and the bit Bus B can access support chip registers such as the video and audio co processors br The WDC C supports an channel DMA unit an bit parallel I O port a controller port interface circuits allowing serial and parallel access to controller data a bit multiplication and division unit and circuitry for generating non maskable interrupts on V blank and IRQ interrupts on calculated screen positions br Early revisions of the A used in SHVC boards are prone to spontaneous failure which can produce a variety of symptoms including graphics glitches in Mode a black screen on power on or improperly reading the controllers The first revision A has a fatal bug in the DMA controller that can crash games this was corrected in subsequent revisions br The console contains KB of general purpose RAM which is separate from the KB VRAM and KB ARAM dedicated to the video and audio subsystems respectively br br br Video br The Picture Processing Unit PPU consists of two closely tied IC packages It contains KB of SRAM for video data bytes of object attribute memory OAM for sprite data and bits of color generator RAM CGRAM for palette data This CGRAM provisions up to colors chosen from the bit RGB color space from a palette of colors The PPU is clocked by the same signal as the CPU and generates a pixel every two or four cycles br br br Audio br The S SMP audio chip consists of an bit CPU a bit DSP and KB of SRAM It was designed by Ken Kutaragi and produced by Sony and is completely independent from the rest of the system It is clocked at a nominal MHz in both NTSC and PAL systems It is capable of stereo sound composed from voices generated using bit audio samples and capable of applying effects such as echo br br br Regional lockout br br Nintendo employed several types of regional lockout including both physical and hardware incompatibilities br Physically the cartridges are shaped differently for different regions North American cartridges have a rectangular bottom with inset grooves matching protruding tabs in the console and other regions cartridges are narrower with a smooth curve on the front and no grooves The physical incompatibility can be overcome with the use of various adapters or through modification of the console br Internally a regional lockout chip CIC within the console and in each cartridge prevents the PAL region games from being played on Japanese or North American consoles and vice versa The Japanese and North American machines have the same region chip This can be overcome through the use of adapters typically by inserting the imported cartridge in one slot and a cartridge with the correct region chip in a second slot Alternatively disconnecting one pin of the console s lockout chip will prevent it from locking the console hardware in later games can detect this situation so it became common to install a switch to reconnect the lockout chip as needed br PAL consoles face another incompatibility when playing out of region cartridges the NTSC video standard specifies video at Hz but PAL operates at Hz resulting in an approximately slower framerate PAL s higher resolution results in letterboxing of the output image Some commercial PAL region releases exhibit this same problem and therefore can be played in NTSC systems without issue but other games will face a speedup if played in an NTSC console To mostly correct this issue a switch can be added to place the Super NES PPU into a Hz mode supported by most newer PAL televisions Later games will detect this setting and refuse to run requiring the switch to be thrown only after the check completes br br br Casing br br All models of the Super NES control deck are predominantly gray of slightly different shades The original North American version designed by Nintendo of America industrial designer Lance Barr who previously redesigned the Famicom to become the NES has a boxy design with purple sliding switches and a dark gray eject lever The loading bay surface is curved both to invite interaction and to prevent food or drinks from being placed on the console and spilling as with the flat surfaced NES The Japanese and European versions are more rounded with darker gray accents and buttons br All versions incorporate a top loading slot for game cartridges although the shape of the slot differs between regions to match the different shapes of the cartridges The MULTI OUT connector later used on the Nintendo and GameCube can output composite video S Video and RGB signals as well as RF with an external RF modulator Original versions additionally include a pin expansion port under a small cover on the bottom of the unit and a standard RF output with channel selection switch on the back the redesigned models output composite video only requiring an external modulator for RF br The Nintendo Super System NSS is an arcade system for retail preview of particular Super NES games in the United States similar to the PlayChoice for NES games It consists of slightly modified Super NES hardware with a menu interface and inch monitor that allows gameplay for a certain amount of time depending on game credits Manufacturing of this model was discontinued in br br br Redesigned model br A cost reduced version of the console referred to as the New Style Super NES model SNS in North America and as the Super Famicom Jr in Japan was released late in the platform s lifespan designed by Barr it incorporates design elements from both the original North American and Japanese European console models but in a smaller form factor Unlike the original console models the redesigned model is virtually identical across both regions save for the color palette The redesign did not receive a release in Europe br Externally the power and reset buttons were moved to the left hand side of the console while the cartridge eject button and power LED indicator were omitted Internally the redesigned model consolidates the console s hardware into a system on chip SoC design The redesigned console lacks the bottom expansion slot rendering it incompatible with the Japan exclusive Satellaview add on br For AV output the redesigned console features the same multi out port used on the original models Unlike the latter models the former s AV port only supports composite video output natively as support for RGB video and S Video was disabled internally however they can be restored via a relatively simple modification The internal RF modulator was also removed requiring an external one for such output if needed Due to the SoC design it is highly sought after by Super NES Famicom enthusiasts since its RGB video quality if restored is improved over earlier internal revisions of the console br The redesigned console first released in October in North America where it originally retailed for US in a bundle with Super Mario World Yoshi s Island br it was subsequently released in Japan on March where it retailed for Nintendo marketed it as an entry level gamer s system for consumers who were apprehensive about the higher price of newer systems such as the Nintendo Nintendo also introduced a slightly altered controller for it with the console s logo replaced by an embossed Nintendo logo br br br Yellowing br br The ABS plastic used in the casing of some older Super NES and Super Famicom consoles is particularly susceptible to oxidation with exposure to air This along with the particularly light color of the original plastic causes affected consoles to quickly become yellow if the sections of the casing came from different batches of plastic a two tone effect results This issue may be reversed with a method called Retrobrighting where a mixture of chemicals is applied to the case and exposed to UV light br br br Game cartridge br br Super NES games are distributed on ROM cartridges officially referred to as Game Pak in most Western regions and as Cassette Kasetto in Japan and parts of Latin America Though the Super NES can address Mbit only Mbit are actually available for cartridge use A fairly normal mapping could easily address up to Mbit of ROM data Mbit at FastROM speed with Mbit of battery backed RAM Most available memory access controllers only support mappings of up to Mbit The largest games released Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean contain Mbit of ROM data and the smallest games contain only Mbit br Cartridges may also contain battery backed SRAM to save the game state extra working RAM custom coprocessors or any other hardware that will not exceed the maximum current rating of the console br br br Games br br Super NES games were officially released in North America plus championship cartridges in Europe in Japan on Satellaview and on Sufami Turbo Many Super NES games have been called some of the greatest video games of all time such as Super Mario World The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past Final Fantasy VI Donkey Kong Country EarthBound Super Metroid Chrono Trigger and Yoshi s Island Many Super NES games have been rereleased several times including on the Virtual Console Super NES Classic Edition and the classic games service on Nintendo Switch Online All Game Boy games are playable with the Super Game Boy add on br br br Peripherals br br The Super NES controller design expands on that of the NES with A B X and Y face buttons in a diamond arrangement and two shoulder buttons Lance Barr created its ergonomic design and he later adapted it in for the NES dogbone controller The Japanese and PAL region versions incorporated the four colors of the face buttons into the system s logo The North American version s buttons were colored to match the redesigned console the X and Y buttons are lavender with concave faces and the A and B buttons are purple with convex faces Several later controller designs have elements from the Super NES controller including the PlayStation Dreamcast Xbox and Wii Classic Controller This face button layout is on future Nintendo systems since the Nintendo DS br Several peripherals add to the functionality of the Super NES Some are required by certain games such as the Super Scope light gun and the Super NES Mouse for a point and click interface Various third parties under license from Nintendo released multitap adapters connecting up to five controllers into a single console starting with the Super Multitap by Hudson Soft in conjunction with the Super Bomberman series Specialized third party controllers such as the AsciiPad and Super Advantage the successor to the NES Advantage by Asciiware and the Capcom Fighter Power Stick an arcade like joystick controller by Capcom designed specifically for Street Fighter II Unusual controllers include the BatterUP baseball bat the Life Fitness Entertainment System an exercise bike controller with built in monitoring software the TeeV Golf golf club and the Justifier a revolver shaped light gun made by Konami for Lethal Enforcers br br Though Nintendo never released an adapter for playing NES games on the Super NES the Super Game Boy adapter cartridge allows games designed for Nintendo s portable Game Boy system to be played on the Super NES The Super Game Boy touts several feature enhancements over the Game Boy including palette substitution custom screen borders and access to the Super NES console s features by specially enhanced Game Boy games Japan also saw the release of the Super Game Boy which adds a communication port to enable a second Game Boy to connect for multiplayer games br Like the NES before it the Super NES has unlicensed third party peripherals including a new version of the Game Genie cheat cartridge designed for use with Super NES games br Soon after the release of the Super NES companies began marketing backup devices such as the Super Wildcard Super Pro Fighter Q and Game Doctor These devices create a backup of a cartridge and can be used to play illicit ROM images or to copy games violating copyright laws in many jurisdictions br br The Japan only Satellaview is a satellite modem attached to the Super Famicom s expansion port and connected to the St GIGA satellite radio station from April to June Satellaview subscribers could download gaming news and specially designed games which were frequently either remakes of or sequels to older Famicom games and released in installments In the United States the relatively short lived XBAND allowed users to connect to a network via a dial up modem to compete against other players around the country br Nintendo attempted partnerships with Sony and then Philips to develop CD ROM based peripheral prototypes for the console to compete with the TurboGrafx CD and Sega CD Sony produced the PlayStation a brand name the company would used for their later independently produced console a Super NES console with a built in CD ROM drive that never made it past the prototype phase The Philips project was canceled without a prototype but Philips retained the contractual right to develop games based on Nintendo franchises which it published for its CD i multimedia console br br br Enhancement chips br br As part of the overall plan for the Super NES rather than include an expensive CPU that would still become obsolete in a few years the hardware designers made it easy to interface special coprocessor chips to the console just like the MMC chips used for most NES games This is most often characterized by additional pins on the cartridge card edge br The Super FX is a RISC CPU designed to perform functions that the main CPU can not feasibly do The chip is primarily used to create D game worlds made with polygons texture mapping and light source shading The chip can also be used to enhance D games br The Nintendo fixed point digital signal processor DSP chip allowed for fast vector based calculations bitmap conversions both D and D coordinate transformations and other functions Four revisions of the chip exist each physically identical but with different microcode The DSP version including the later A and B bug fix revisions is used most often the DSP DSP and DSP are used in only one game each br Similar to the A CPU in the console the SA chip contains a C processor core clocked at MHz a memory mapper DMA decompression and bitplane conversion circuitry several programmable timers and CIC region lockout functionality br In Japan games could be downloaded cheaper than standard cartridges from Nintendo Power kiosks onto special cartridges containing flash memory and a MegaChips MX TFC chip The chip manages communication with the kiosks to download ROM images and has an initial menu to select a game Some were published both in cartridge and download form and others were download only The service closed on February br Many cartridges contain other enhancement chips most of which were created for use by a single company in a few games br br br Reception and legacy br br Approximately million Super NES consoles were sold worldwide with million of those units sold in the Americas and million in Japan Although it could not quite repeat the success of the NES which sold million units worldwide the Super NES was the best selling console of its era br In a year end review a team of five Electronic Gaming Monthly editors gave the Super NES scores of and Though they criticized how few new games were coming out for the system and how dated its graphics were compared to current generation consoles they regarded its selection of must have games to be still unsurpassed Additionally noting that used Super NES games were readily available in bargain bins most of them still recommended buying a Super NES In GameTrailers named the Super NES as the second best console of all time only behind the PlayStation in their list of top ten consoles that left their mark on the history of gaming citing its graphics sound and library of top quality games In they also named it the best Nintendo console of all time saying The list of games we love from this console completely annihilates any other roster from the Big N Technology columnist Don Reisinger proclaimed The SNES is the greatest console of all time in January citing the quality of the games and the console s dramatic improvement over its predecessor fellow technology columnist Will Greenwald replied with a more nuanced view giving the Super NES top marks with his heart the NES with his head and the PlayStation for its controller with his hands GamingExcellence also gave the Super NES first place in declaring it simply the most timeless system ever created with many games that stand the test of time and citing its innovation in controller design graphics capabilities and game storytelling At the same time GameDaily rated it fifth of the ten greatest consoles for its graphics audio controllers and games In IGN named the Super NES the fourth best video game console complimenting its audio and number of AAA games br br br Emulation br br Super NES emulation began with VSMC in and Super Pasofami became the first working Super NES emulator in During that time two competing emulation projects Snes and Snes merged to form Snes x In ZSNES development began In Bsnes development began with the goal of preservation through maximal accuracy and compatibility and was later renamed to Higan br Nintendo of America maintained its stance against the distribution of Super NES ROM image files and the use of emulators as it does with the NES insisting that these things represent flagrant copyright infringement Emulation proponents assert that the discontinued hardware production constitutes abandonware status the owners right to make a personal backup space shifting for private use the development of homebrew games the frailty of ROM cartridges and consoles and the lack of certain foreign imports Nintendo designed a hobbyist development system for the Super NES but never released it br Unofficial Super NES emulation is available on virtually all platforms such as Android iOS game consoles and PDAs Individual games have been bundled with official dedicated emulators on some GameCube discs and Nintendo s Virtual Console service for the Wii introduced diverse and officially licensed Super NES emulation br The Super NES Classic Edition was released in September following the NES Classic Edition This emulation based mini console which is physically modeled after the North American and European versions of the SNES is bundled with two SNES style controllers and games including the unreleased Star Fox br br br Notes br br br br br br Bibliography br Kent Steven L The Ultimate History of Video Games The Story Behind the Craze that Touched our
