id: 1017661
The Transfer Pak is a removable accessory for the Nintendo controller that fits into its expansion port When connected it allows for the transfer of data between supported Nintendo N games and Game Boy or Game Boy Color GBC games inserted into its cartridge slot By using the Transfer Pak players can unlock additional content in compatible games the Pok mon Stadium games with which the Transfer Pak was initially bundled for sale also feature the ability to emulate specific Game Boy Pok mon titles for play on the N br The Transfer Pak was supported by roughly N games worldwide only six of which supported it outside of Japan Several games which initially planned to utilize the accessory were either cancelled or had the functionality removed As a result while recognized as one of the first examples of connectivity between Nintendo s home consoles and handhelds the Transfer Pak has come to be retrospectively regarded as largely unnecessary by members of the gaming press br br br History br The Transfer Pak was developed by Nintendo Integrated Research Development and was first revealed at Nintendo s Space World trade show It was released in Japan in August as a pack in with the game Pocket Monsters Stadium which required the Transfer Pak for many of its features In North America and Europe the Transfer Pak was similarly bundled with Pok mon Stadium which released in February and April respectively receiving a standalone release shortly thereafter br Unlike the Super Game Boy peripheral which allowed Game Boy games to be played on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System the Transfer Pak s primary use was not to play Game Boy games on the Nintendo Nintendo and Intelligent Systems developed a separate accessory to serve this function the Wide Boy but it did not receive a wide release and was instead only available to game developers and members of the gaming press However the Pok mon Stadium games included a built in Game Boy emulator allowing users to play compatible Pok mon games on the N by inserting them into the Transfer Pak In an independent software developer created a ROM hack of Pok mon Stadium that expanded the emulator s compatibility to include other Game Boy games In December as part of its update to add Nintendo support the Polymega aftermarket console implemented Transfer Pak functionality allowing players to use the device to dump their Game Boy games and save files to the system s memory br Some games with planned Transfer Pak support went unreleased One of these was Cabbage a Nintendo DD breeding simulator game which would have featured the Transfer Pak as a major gameplay component The game was planned to allow players to transfer their pet to the Game Boy and continue to nurture it throughout the day br Other games were intended to include Transfer Pak features during development only to remove them prior to release WWF No Mercy was meant to use the Transfer Pak to import points earned in its Game Boy Color counterpart which could be spent on rewards in the Nintendo game s SmackDown Mall However this feature was removed following the cancellation of the GBC version Perfect Dark was originally going to support transferring photos from the Game Boy Camera to create characters with real life faces but this function was removed during development as a result of both technical issues and a wave of anti violent video game sentiment after the Columbine High School massacre the final version only uses the Transfer Pak to immediately unlock four of the game s cheats via Perfect Dark on GBC The GBC version of The World Is Not Enough was initially reported to feature Transfer Pak connectivity with its N counterpart allowing players to strengthen their characters in the N game s multiplayer mode but this was seemingly dropped before release br A similar accessory the GB Cable was designed by Marigul Management to connect a Game Boy Color to a Nintendo controller port and would allow data to be transferred from the GBC to a DD storage cartridge as well as for the GBC to be used as a sub screen for certain DD games This was demonstrated at Space World with the DD game DT Bloodmasters a trading card game that would allow for the GBC to function as a second screen using the GB Cable The cable and DT Bloodmasters were ultimately never released though its GBC counterpart DT Lords of Genomes was released in Derby Stallion was also intended to support the GB Cable using the GBC as a second screen to place private bets on horse races but this feature was removed after the accessory s cancellation br br br Games br The following is a complete list of compatible Nintendo games along with the corresponding Game Boy games br br br Reception br Contemporary reviews of the Transfer Pak praised its implementation in the Pok mon Stadium games with some claiming that players who played the games without using it would find their appeal and features severely limited Similarly Peer Schneider of IGN considered the Transfer Pak functionality in PD Ultraman Battle Collection to be the game s sole redeeming feature When reviewing the Virtual Console releases of Mario Golf and Mario Tennis Lucas M Thomas of IGN was disappointed by the removal of Transfer Pak functionality from the rereleases lamenting their incompleteness due to the inability to unlock their Transfer Pak exclusive content Some members of the press identified the Transfer Pak as an influence on later examples of connectivity between Nintendo s home consoles and handhelds most prominently the GameCube Game Boy Advance link cable br However in the years following the Nintendo s discontinuation the Transfer Pak has been regarded as a largely underutilized and unnecessary add on In a retrospective for Nintendo Life Gavin Lane stated that the Transfer Pak while interesting never truly reached its full potential Brett Elston of GamesRadar claimed that many players misinterpreted the Transfer Pak as a device meant to play Game Boy games on the television leading to disappointment Elston also described most games Transfer Pak integration as an afterthought with features that were barely worth the hassle of digging it out of the closet Den of Geek s Daniel Kurland considered the Transfer Pak to be a frivolity rather than something fundamental particularly given the meager number of games that supported it Writing for GamesBeat Andr Bardin was also critical of the Transfer Pak s lack of support particularly outside of Japan br br br See also br Nintendo accessories br GameCube Game Boy
