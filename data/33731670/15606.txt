Japanese Nihongo iho o is the principal language of the Japonic language family spoken by the Japanese people It has around million speakers primarily in Japan the only country where it is the national language and within the Japanese diaspora worldwide br The Japonic family also includes the Ryukyuan languages and the variously classified Hachij language There have been many attempts to group the Japonic languages with other families such as the Ainu Austroasiatic Koreanic and the now discredited Altaic but none of these proposals have gained any widespread acceptance br Little is known of the language s prehistory or when it first appeared in Japan Chinese documents from the rd century AD recorded a few Japanese words but substantial Old Japanese texts did not appear until the th century From the Heian period extensive waves of Sino Japanese vocabulary entered the language affecting the phonology of Early Middle Japanese Late Middle Japanese saw extensive grammatical changes and the first appearance of European loanwords The basis of the standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo region modern Tokyo in the Early Modern Japanese period early th century mid th century Following the end of Japan s self imposed isolation in the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly and words from English roots have proliferated br Japanese is an agglutinative mora timed language with relatively simple phonotactics a pure vowel system phonemic vowel and consonant length and a lexically significant pitch accent Word order is normally subject object verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words and sentence structure is topic comment Sentence final particles are used to add emotional or emphatic impact or form questions Nouns have no grammatical number or gender and there are no articles Verbs are conjugated primarily for tense and voice but not person Japanese adjectives are also conjugated Japanese has a complex system of honorifics with verb forms and vocabulary to indicate the relative status of the speaker the listener and persons mentioned br The Japanese writing system combines Chinese characters known as kanji Han characters with two unique syllabaries or moraic scripts derived by the Japanese from the more complex Chinese characters hiragana or simple characters and katakana or partial characters Latin script r maji is also used in a limited fashion such as for imported acronyms in Japanese writing The numeral system uses mostly Arabic numerals but also traditional Chinese numerals br br br History br br br Prehistory br Proto Japonic the common ancestor of the Japanese and Ryukyuan languages is thought to have been brought to Japan by settlers coming from the Korean peninsula sometime in the early to mid th century BC the Yayoi period replacing the languages of the original J mon inhabitants including the ancestor of the modern Ainu language Because writing had yet to be introduced from China there is no direct evidence and anything that can be discerned about this period must be based on internal reconstruction from Old Japanese or comparison with the Ryukyuan languages and Japanese dialects br br br Old Japanese br br The Chinese writing system was imported to Japan from Baekje around the start of the fifth century alongside Buddhism The earliest texts were written in Classical Chinese although some of these were likely intended to be read as Japanese using the kanbun method and show influences of Japanese grammar such as Japanese word order The earliest text the Kojiki dates to the early eighth century and was written entirely in Chinese characters which are used to represent at different times Chinese kanbun and Old Japanese As in other texts from this period the Old Japanese sections are written in Man y gana which uses kanji for their phonetic as well as semantic values br Based on the Man y gana system Old Japanese can be reconstructed as having distinct syllables Texts written with Man y gana use two different sets of kanji for each of the syllables now pronounced ki hi mi ke he me ko so to no mo yo and ro The Kojiki has but all later texts have The distinction between mo and mo apparently was lost immediately following its composition This set of syllables shrank to in Early Middle Japanese though some were added through Chinese influence Man y gana also has a symbol for je which merges with e before the end of the period br Several fossilizations of Old Japanese grammatical elements remain in the modern language the genitive particle tsu superseded by modern no is preserved in words such as matsuge eyelash lit hair of the eye modern mieru to be visible and kikoeru to be audible retain a mediopassive suffix yu ru kikoyu kikoyuru the attributive form which slowly replaced the plain form starting in the late Heian period kikoeru all verbs with the shimo nidan conjugation pattern underwent this same shift in Early Modern Japanese and the genitive particle ga remains in intentionally archaic speech br br br Early Middle Japanese br br Early Middle Japanese is the Japanese of the Heian period from to It formed the basis for the literary standard of Classical Japanese which remained in common use until the early th century br During this time Japanese underwent numerous phonological developments in many cases instigated by an influx of Chinese loanwords These included phonemic length distinction for both consonants and vowels palatal consonants e g kya and labial consonant clusters e g kwa and closed syllables This had the effect of changing Japanese into a mora timed language br br br Late Middle Japanese br br Late Middle Japanese covers the years from to and is normally divided into two sections roughly equivalent to the Kamakura period and the Muromachi period respectively The later forms of Late Middle Japanese are the first to be described by non native sources in this case the Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries and thus there is better documentation of Late Middle Japanese phonology than for previous forms for instance the Arte da Lingoa de Iapam Among other sound changes the sequence au merges to in contrast with o p is reintroduced from Chinese and we merges with je Some forms rather more familiar to Modern Japanese speakers begin to appear the continuative ending te begins to reduce onto the verb e g yonde for earlier yomite the k in the final syllable of adjectives drops out shiroi for earlier shiroki and some forms exist where modern standard Japanese has retained the earlier form e g hayaku hayau hay where modern Japanese just has hayaku though the alternative form is preserved in the standard greeting o hay gozaimasu good morning this ending is also seen in o medet congratulations from medetaku br Late Middle Japanese has the first loanwords from European languages now common words borrowed into Japanese in this period include pan bread and tabako tobacco now cigarette both from Portuguese br br br Modern Japanese br br Modern Japanese is considered to begin with the Edo period which spanned from to Since Old Japanese the de facto standard Japanese had been the Kansai dialect especially that of Kyoto However during the Edo period Edo now Tokyo developed into the largest city in Japan and the Edo area dialect became standard Japanese Since the end of Japan s self imposed isolation in the flow of loanwords from European languages has increased significantly The period since has seen many words borrowed from other languages such as German Portuguese and English Many English loan words especially relate to technology for example pasokon short for personal computer int netto internet and kamera camera Due to the large quantity of English loanwords modern Japanese has developed a distinction between t i and ti and d i and di with the latter in each pair only found in loanwords br br br Geographic distribution br Although Japanese is spoken almost exclusively in Japan it has also been spoken outside of the country Before and during World War II through Japanese annexation of Taiwan and Korea as well as partial occupation of China the Philippines and various Pacific islands locals in those countries learned Japanese as the language of the empire As a result many elderly people in these countries can still speak Japanese br Japanese emigrant communities the largest of which are to be found in Brazil with million to million Japanese immigrants and descendants according to Brazilian IBGE data more than the million of the United States sometimes employ Japanese as their primary language Approximately of Hawaii residents speak Japanese with an estimated of the population of Japanese ancestry in Japanese emigrants can also be found in Peru Argentina Australia especially in the eastern states Canada especially in Vancouver where of the population has Japanese ancestry the United States notably in Hawaii where of the population has Japanese ancestry and California and the Philippines particularly in Davao Region and the Province of Laguna br br br Official status br Japanese has no official status in Japan but is the de facto national language of the country There is a form of the language considered standard hy jungo meaning standard Japanese or ky ts go common language or even Tokyo dialect at times The meanings of the two terms hy jungo and ky ts go are almost the same Hy jungo or ky ts go is a conception that forms the counterpart of dialect This normative language was born after the Meiji Restoration meiji ishin from the language spoken in the higher class areas of Tokyo see Yamanote Hy jungo is taught in schools and used on television and in official communications It is the version of Japanese discussed in this article br Formerly standard Japanese in writing bungo literary language was different from colloquial language k go The two systems have different rules of grammar and some variance in vocabulary Bungo was the main method of writing Japanese until about since then k go gradually extended its influence and the two methods were both used in writing until the s Bungo still has some relevance for historians literary scholars and lawyers many Japanese laws that survived World War II are still written in bungo although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language K go is the dominant method of both speaking and writing Japanese today although bungo grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect br The state constitution of Angaur Palau names Japanese along with Palauan and English as an official language of the state as at the time the constitution was written many of the elders participating in the process had been educated in Japanese during the South Seas Mandate over the island shown by the census of the Trust Territory of the Pacific that found that of Palauans born between and could speak and read Japanese but as of the Palau census there were no residents of Angaur that spoke Japanese at home br br br Dialects and mutual intelligibility br br Japanese dialects typically differ in terms of pitch accent inflectional morphology vocabulary and particle usage Some even differ in vowel and consonant inventories although this is less common br In terms of mutual intelligibility a survey in found that the four most unintelligible dialects excluding Ry ky an languages and T hoku dialects to students from Greater Tokyo were the Kiso dialect in the deep mountains of Nagano Prefecture the Himi dialect in Toyama Prefecture the Kagoshima dialect and the Maniwa dialect in Okayama Prefecture The survey was based on to second long recordings of to phonemes which students listened to and translated word for word The listeners were all Keio University students who grew up in the Kanto region br br There are some language islands in mountain villages or isolated islands such as Hachij jima island whose dialects are descended from Eastern Old Japanese Dialects of the Kansai region are spoken or known by many Japanese and Osaka dialect in particular is associated with comedy see Kansai dialect Dialects of T hoku and North Kant are associated with typical farmers br The Ry ky an languages spoken in Okinawa and the Amami Islands administratively part of Kagoshima are distinct enough to be considered a separate branch of the Japonic family not only is each language unintelligible to Japanese speakers but most are unintelligible to those who speak other Ry ky an languages However in contrast to linguists many ordinary Japanese people tend to consider the Ry ky an languages as dialects of Japanese br The imperial court also seems to have spoken an unusual variant of the Japanese of the time most likely the spoken form of Classical Japanese a writing style that was prevalent during the Heian period but began to decline during the late Meiji period The Ry ky an languages are classified by UNESCO as endangered as young people mostly use Japanese and cannot understand the languages Okinawan Japanese is a variant of Standard Japanese influenced by the Ry ky an languages and is the primary dialect spoken among young people in the Ryukyu Islands br Modern Japanese has become prevalent nationwide including the Ry ky islands due to education mass media and an increase in mobility within Japan as well as economic integration br br br Classification br br Japanese is a member of the Japonic language family which also includes the Ryukyuan languages spoken in the Ryukyu Islands As these closely related languages are commonly treated as dialects of the same language Japanese is sometimes called a language isolate br According to Martine Irma Robbeets Japanese has been subject to more attempts to show its relation to other languages than any other language in the world Since Japanese first gained the consideration of linguists in the late th century attempts have been made to show its genealogical relation to languages or language families such as Ainu Korean Chinese Tibeto Burman Uralic Altaic or Ural Altaic Mon Khmer and Malayo Polynesian At the fringe some linguists have suggested a link to Indo European languages including Greek and to Lepcha Main modern theories try to link Japanese either to northern Asian languages like Korean or the proposed larger Altaic family or to various Southeast Asian languages especially Austronesian None of these proposals have gained wide acceptance and the Altaic family itself is now considered controversial As it stands only the link to Ryukyuan has wide support br Other theories view the Japanese language as an early creole language formed through inputs from at least two distinct language groups or as a distinct language of its own that has absorbed various aspects from neighbouring languages br br br Phonology br br br Vowels br br Japanese has five vowels and vowel length is phonemic with each having both a short and a long version Elongated vowels are usually denoted with a line over the vowel a macron in r maji a repeated vowel character in hiragana or a ch onpu succeeding the vowel in katakana u is compressed rather than protruded or simply unrounded br br br Consonants br br Some Japanese consonants have several allophones which may give the impression of a larger inventory of sounds However some of these allophones have since become phonemic For example in the Japanese language up to and including the first half of the th century the phonemic sequence ti was palatalized and realized phonetically as t i approximately chi however now ti and t i are distinct as evidenced by words like t ti Western style tea and chii t ii social status br The r of the Japanese language is of particular interest ranging between an apical central tap and a lateral approximant The g is also notable unless it starts a sentence it may be pronounced in the Kanto prestige dialect and in other eastern dialects br The phonotactics of Japanese are relatively simple The syllable structure is C G V C that is a core vowel surrounded by an optional onset consonant a glide j and either the first part of a geminate consonant represented as Q or a moraic nasal in the coda represented as N br The nasal is sensitive to its phonetic environment and assimilates to the following phoneme with pronunciations including m n Onset glide clusters only occur at the start of syllables but clusters across syllables are allowed as long as the two consonants are the moraic nasal followed by a homorganic consonant br Japanese also includes a pitch accent which is not represented in syllabic writing for example ha i chopsticks and ha i bridge are both spelled hashi and are only differentiated by the tone contour br br br Grammar br br br Sentence structure br Japanese word order is classified as subject object verb Unlike many Indo European languages the only strict rule of word order is that the verb must be placed at the end of a sentence possibly followed by sentence end particles This is because Japanese sentence elements are marked with particles that identify their grammatical functions br The basic sentence structure is topic comment For example Kochira wa Tanaka san desu kochira this is the topic of the sentence indicated by the particle wa The verb desu is a copula commonly translated as to be or it is though there are other verbs that can be translated as to be though technically it holds no meaning and is used to give a sentence politeness As a phrase Tanaka san desu is the comment This sentence literally translates to As for this person it is Mx Tanaka Thus Japanese like many other Asian languages is often called a topic prominent language which means it has a strong tendency to indicate the topic separately from the subject and that the two do not always coincide The sentence Z wa hana ga nagai literally means As for elephant s the nose s is are long The topic is z elephant and the subject is hana nose br Japanese grammar tends toward brevity the subject or object of a sentence need not be stated and pronouns may be omitted if they can be inferred from context In the example above hana ga nagai would mean their noses are long while nagai by itself would mean they are long A single verb can be a complete sentence Yatta I we they etc did it In addition since adjectives can form the predicate in a Japanese sentence below a single adjective can be a complete sentence Urayamashii I m jealous about it br While the language has some words that are typically translated as pronouns these are not used as frequently as pronouns in some Indo European languages and function differently In some cases Japanese relies on special verb forms and auxiliary verbs to indicate the direction of benefit of an action down to indicate the out group gives a benefit to the in group and up to indicate the in group gives a benefit to the out group Here the in group includes the speaker and the out group does not and their boundary depends on context For example oshiete moratta literally explaining got with a benefit from the out group to the in group means he she they explained it to me us Similarly oshiete ageta literally explaining gave with a benefit from the in group to the out group means I we explained it to him her them Such beneficiary auxiliary verbs thus serve a function comparable to that of pronouns and prepositions in Indo European languages to indicate the actor and the recipient of an action br Japanese pronouns also function differently from most modern Indo European pronouns and more like nouns in that they can take modifiers as any other noun may For instance one does not say in English br br The amazed he ran down the street grammatically incorrect insertion of a pronoun br But one can grammatically say essentially the same thing in Japanese br br This is partly because these words evolved from regular nouns such as kimi you lord anata you that side yonder and boku I servant This is why some linguists do not classify Japanese pronouns as pronouns but rather as referential nouns much like Spanish usted contracted from vuestra merced your majestic plural grace or Portuguese voc from vossa merc Japanese personal pronouns are generally used only in situations requiring special emphasis as to who is doing what to whom br The choice of words used as pronouns is correlated with the sex of the speaker and the social situation in which they are spoken men and women alike in a formal situation generally refer to themselves as watashi literally private or watakushi also hyper polite form while men in rougher or intimate conversation are much more likely to use the word ore oneself myself or boku Similarly different words such as anata kimi and omae more formally the one before me may refer to a listener depending on the listener s relative social position and the degree of familiarity between the speaker and the listener When used in different social relationships the same word may have positive intimate or respectful or negative distant or disrespectful connotations br Japanese often use titles of the person referred to where pronouns would be used in English For example when speaking to one s teacher it is appropriate to use sensei teacher but inappropriate to use anata This is because anata is used to refer to people of equal or lower status and one s teacher has higher status br br br Inflection and conjugation br Japanese nouns have no grammatical number gender or article aspect The noun hon may refer to a single book or several books hito can mean person or people and ki can be tree or trees Where number is important it can be indicated by providing a quantity often with a counter word or rarely by adding a suffix or sometimes by duplication e g hitobito usually written with an iteration mark as Words for people are usually understood as singular Thus Tanaka san usually means Mx Tanaka Words that refer to people and animals can be made to indicate a group of individuals through the addition of a collective suffix a noun suffix that indicates a group such as tachi but this is not a true plural the meaning is closer to the English phrase and company A group described as Tanaka san tachi may include people not named Tanaka Some Japanese nouns are effectively plural such as hitobito people and wareware we us while the word tomodachi friend is considered singular although plural in form br Verbs are conjugated to show tenses of which there are two past and present or non past which is used for the present and the future For verbs that represent an ongoing process the te iru form indicates a continuous or progressive aspect similar to the suffix ing in English For others that represent a change of state the te iru form indicates a perfect aspect For example kite iru means They have come and are still here but tabete iru means They are eating br Questions both with an interrogative pronoun and yes no questions have the same structure as affirmative sentences but with intonation rising at the end In the formal register the question particle ka is added For example ii desu It is OK becomes ii desu ka Is it OK In a more informal tone sometimes the particle no is added instead to show a personal interest of the speaker D shite konai no Why aren t you coming Some simple queries are formed simply by mentioning the topic with an interrogative intonation to call for the hearer s attention Kore wa What about this O namae wa What s your name br Negatives are formed by inflecting the verb For example Pan o taberu I will eat bread or I eat bread becomes Pan o tabenai I will not eat bread or I do not eat bread Plain negative forms are i adjectives see below and inflect as such e g Pan o tabenakatta I did not eat bread br The so called te verb form is used for a variety of purposes either progressive or perfect aspect see above combining verbs in a temporal sequence Asagohan o tabete sugu dekakeru I ll eat breakfast and leave at once simple commands conditional statements and permissions Dekakete mo ii May I go out etc br The word da plain desu polite is the copula verb It corresponds approximately to the English be but often takes on other roles including a marker for tense when the verb is conjugated into its past form datta plain deshita polite This comes into use because only i adjectives and verbs can carry tense in Japanese Two additional common verbs are used to indicate existence there is or in some contexts property aru negative nai and iru negative inai for inanimate and animate things respectively For example Neko ga iru There s a cat Ii kangae ga nai I haven t got a good idea br The verb to do suru polite form shimasu is often used to make verbs from nouns ry ri suru to cook benky suru to study etc and has been productive in creating modern slang words Japanese also has a huge number of compound verbs to express concepts that are described in English using a verb and an adverbial particle e g tobidasu to fly out to flee from tobu to fly to jump dasu to put out to emit br There are three types of adjectives see Japanese adjectives br br keiy shi or i adjectives which have a conjugating ending i such as atsui to be hot which can become past atsukatta it was hot or negative atsuku nai it is not hot nai is also an i adjective which can become past atsuku nakatta it was not hot br atsui hi a hot day br keiy d shi or na adjectives which are followed by a form of the copula usually na For example hen strange br hen na hito a strange person br rentaishi also called true adjectives such as ano that br ano yama that mountain br Both keiy shi and keiy d shi may predicate sentences For example br br Both inflect though they do not show the full range of conjugation found in true verbs br The rentaishi in Modern Japanese are few in number and unlike the other words are limited to directly modifying nouns They never predicate sentences Examples include ookina big kono this iwayuru so called and taishita amazing br Both keiy d shi and keiy shi form adverbs by following with ni in the case of keiy d shi br br hen ni naru become strange br and by changing i to ku in the case of keiy shi br br atsuku naru become hot br The grammatical function of nouns is indicated by postpositions also called particles These include for example br br ga for the nominative case br Kare ga yatta He did it br ni for the dative case br Tanaka san ni agete kudasai Please give it to Mx Tanaka br It is also used for the lative case indicating a motion to a location br br Nihon ni ikitai I want to go to Japan br However e is more commonly used for the lative case br p t e ikanai ka Won t you go to the party br no for the genitive case or nominalizing phrases br watashi no kamera my camera br Suk ni iku no ga suki desu I like going skiing br o for the accusative case br Nani o tabemasu ka What will you eat br wa for the topic It can co exist with the case markers listed above and it overrides ga and in most cases o br Watashi wa sushi ga ii desu literally As for me sushi is good The nominative marker ga after watashi is hidden under wa br Note The subtle difference between wa and ga in Japanese cannot be derived from the English language as such because the distinction between sentence topic and subject is not made there While wa indicates the topic which the rest of the sentence describes or acts upon it carries the implication that the subject indicated by wa is not unique or may be part of a larger group br br Ikeda san wa yonj ni sai da As for Mx Ikeda they are forty two years old Others in the group may also be of that age br Absence of wa often means the subject is the focus of the sentence br br Ikeda san ga yonj ni sai da It is Mx Ikeda who is forty two years old This is a reply to an implicit or explicit question such as who in this group is forty two years old br br br Politeness br br Japanese has an extensive grammatical system to express politeness and formality This reflects the hierarchical nature of Japanese society br The Japanese language can express differing levels of social status The differences in social position are determined by a variety of factors including job age experience or even psychological state e g a person asking a favour tends to do so politely The person in the lower position is expected to use a polite form of speech whereas the other person might use a plainer form Strangers will also speak to each other politely Japanese children rarely use polite speech until they are teens at which point they are expected to begin speaking in a more adult manner See uchi soto br Whereas teineigo polite language is commonly an inflectional system sonkeigo respectful language and kenj go humble language often employ many special honorific and humble alternate verbs iku go becomes ikimasu in polite form but is replaced by irassharu in honorific speech and ukagau or mairu in humble speech br The difference between honorific and humble speech is particularly pronounced in the Japanese language Humble language is used to talk about oneself or one s own group company family whilst honorific language is mostly used when describing the interlocutor and their group For example the san suffix Mr Mrs Miss or Mx is an example of honorific language It is not used to talk about oneself or when talking about someone from one s company to an external person since the company is the speaker s in group When speaking directly to one s superior in one s company or when speaking with other employees within one s company about a superior a Japanese person will use vocabulary and inflections of the honorific register to refer to the in group superior and their speech and actions When speaking to a person from another company i e a member of an out group however a Japanese person will use the plain or the humble register to refer to the speech and actions of their in group superiors In short the register used in Japanese to refer to the person speech or actions of any particular individual varies depending on the relationship either in group or out group between the speaker and listener as well as depending on the relative status of the speaker listener and third person referents br Most nouns in the Japanese language may be made polite by the addition of o or go as a prefix o is generally used for words of native Japanese origin whereas go is affixed to words of Chinese derivation In some cases the prefix has become a fixed part of the word and is included even in regular speech such as gohan cooked rice meal Such a construction often indicates deference to either the item s owner or to the object itself For example the word tomodachi friend would become o tomodachi when referring to the friend of someone of higher status though mothers often use this form to refer to their children s friends On the other hand a polite speaker may sometimes refer to mizu water as o mizu to show politeness br br br Vocabulary br br There are three main sources of words in the Japanese language the yamato kotoba or wago kango and gairaigo br The original language of Japan or at least the original language of a certain population that was ancestral to a significant portion of the historical and present Japanese nation was the so called yamato kotoba or infrequently i e Yamato words which in scholarly contexts is sometimes referred to as wago or rarely i e the Wa language In addition to words from this original language present day Japanese includes a number of words that were either borrowed from Chinese or constructed from Chinese roots following Chinese patterns These words known as kango entered the language from the th century onwards by contact with Chinese culture According to the Shinsen Kokugo Jiten Japanese dictionary kango comprise of the total vocabulary wago make up other foreign words or gairaigo account for and the remaining constitute hybridized words or konshugo that draw elements from more than one language br There are also a great number of words of mimetic origin in Japanese with Japanese having a rich collection of sound symbolism both onomatopoeia for physical sounds and more abstract words A small number of words have come into Japanese from the Ainu language Tonakai reindeer rakko sea otter and shishamo smelt a type of fish are well known examples of words of Ainu origin br Words of different origins occupy different registers in Japanese Like Latin derived words in English kango words are typically perceived as somewhat formal or academic compared to equivalent Yamato words Indeed it is generally fair to say that an English word derived from Latin French roots typically corresponds to a Sino Japanese word in Japanese whereas an Anglo Saxon word would best be translated by a Yamato equivalent br Incorporating vocabulary from European languages gairaigo began with borrowings from Portuguese in the th century followed by words from Dutch during Japan s long isolation of the Edo period With the Meiji Restoration and the reopening of Japan in the th century words were borrowed from German French and English Today most borrowings are from English br In the Meiji era the Japanese also coined many neologisms using Chinese roots and morphology to translate European concepts these are known as wasei kango Japanese made Chinese words Many of these were then imported into Chinese Korean and Vietnamese via their kanji in the late th and early th centuries For example seiji politics and kagaku chemistry are words derived from Chinese roots that were first created and used by the Japanese and only later borrowed into Chinese and other East Asian languages As a result Japanese Chinese Korean and Vietnamese share a large common corpus of vocabulary in the same way many Greek and Latin derived words both inherited or borrowed into European languages or modern coinages from Greek or Latin roots are shared among modern European languages see classical compound br In the past few decades wasei eigo made in Japan English has become a prominent phenomenon Words such as wanpat n one pattern to be in a rut to have a one track mind and sukinshippu skin ship physical contact although coined by compounding English roots are nonsensical in most non Japanese contexts exceptions exist in nearby languages such as Korean however which often use words such as skinship and rimokon remote control in the same way as in Japanese br The popularity of many Japanese cultural exports has made some native Japanese words familiar in English including emoji futon haiku judo kamikaze karaoke karate ninja origami rickshaw from jinrikisha samurai sayonara Sudoku sumo sushi tofu tsunami tycoon See list of English words of Japanese origin for more br br br Writing system br br br History br Literacy was introduced to Japan in the form of the Chinese writing system by way of Baekje before the th century AD Using this script the Japanese king Bu presented a petition to Emperor Shun of Liu Song in AD After the ruin of Baekje Japan invited scholars from China to learn more of the Chinese writing system Japanese emperors gave an official rank to Chinese scholars and spread the use of Chinese characters during the th and th centuries br br At first the Japanese wrote in Classical Chinese with Japanese names represented by characters used for their meanings and not their sounds Later during the th century AD the Chinese sounding phoneme principle was used to write pure Japanese poetry and prose but some Japanese words were still written with characters for their meaning and not the original Chinese sound This was the beginning of Japanese as a written language in its own right By this time the Japanese language was already very distinct from the Ryukyuan languages br An example of this mixed style is the Kojiki which was written in AD Japanese writers then started to use Chinese characters to write Japanese in a style known as man y gana a syllabic script which used Chinese characters for their sounds in order to transcribe the words of Japanese speech syllable by syllable br Over time a writing system evolved Chinese characters kanji were used to write either words borrowed from Chinese or Japanese words with the same or similar meanings Chinese characters were also used to write grammatical elements these were simplified and eventually became two syllabic scripts hiragana and katakana which were developed based on Manyogana Some scholars claim that Manyogana originated from Baekje but this hypothesis is denied by mainstream Japanese scholars br Hiragana and katakana were first simplified from kanji and hiragana emerging somewhere around the th century was mainly used by women Hiragana was seen as an informal language whereas katakana and kanji were considered more formal and were typically used by men and in official settings However because of hiragana s accessibility more and more people began using it Eventually by the th century hiragana was used by everyone br Modern Japanese is written in a mixture of three main systems kanji characters of Chinese origin used to represent both Chinese loanwords into Japanese and a number of native Japanese morphemes and two syllabaries hiragana and katakana The Latin script or r maji in Japanese is used to a certain extent such as for imported acronyms and to transcribe Japanese names and in other instances where non Japanese speakers need to know how to pronounce a word such as ramen at a restaurant Arabic numerals are much more common than the kanji numerals when used in counting but kanji numerals are still used in compounds such as t itsu unification br Historically attempts to limit the number of kanji in use commenced in the mid th century but government did not intervene until after Japan s defeat in the Second World War During the post war occupation and influenced by the views of some U S officials various schemes including the complete abolition of kanji and exclusive use of r maji were considered The j y kanji common use kanji originally called t y kanji kanji for general use scheme arose as a compromise solution br Japanese students begin to learn kanji from their first year at elementary school A guideline created by the Japanese Ministry of Education the list of ky iku kanji education kanji a subset of j y kanji specifies the simple characters a child is to learn by the end of sixth grade Children continue to study another characters in junior high school covering in total j y kanji The official list of j y kanji has been revised several times but the total number of officially sanctioned characters has remained largely unchanged br As for kanji for personal names the circumstances are somewhat complicated J y kanji and jinmeiy kanji an appendix of additional characters for names are approved for registering personal names Names containing unapproved characters are denied registration However as with the list of j y kanji criteria for inclusion were often arbitrary and led to many common and popular characters being disapproved for use Under popular pressure and following a court decision holding the exclusion of common characters unlawful the list of jinmeiy kanji was substantially extended from in the year it was first decreed to in Furthermore families whose names are not on these lists were permitted to continue using the older forms br br br Hiragana br Hiragana are used for words without kanji representation for words no longer written in kanji for replacement of rare kanji that may be unfamiliar to intended readers and also following kanji to show conjugational endings Because of the way verbs and adjectives in Japanese are conjugated kanji alone cannot fully convey Japanese tense and mood as kanji cannot be subject to variation when written without losing their meaning For this reason hiragana are appended to kanji to show verb and adjective conjugations Hiragana used in this way are called okurigana Hiragana can also be written in a superscript called furigana above or beside a kanji to show the proper reading This is done to facilitate learning as well as to clarify particularly old or obscure or sometimes invented readings br br br Katakana br Katakana like hiragana constitute a syllabary katakana are primarily used to write foreign words plant and animal names and for emphasis For example Australia has been adapted as sutoraria and supermarket has been adapted and shortened into s p br br br Gender in the Japanese language br br Depending on the speakers gender different linguistic features might be used The typical lect used by females is called joseigo and the one used by males is called danseigo Joseigo and danseigo are different in various ways including first person pronouns such as watashi or atashi for women and boku for men and sentence final particles such as wa na no or kashira for joseigo or zo da or yo for danseigo In addition to these specific differences expressions and pitch can also be different For example joseigo is more gentle polite refined indirect modest and exclamatory and often accompanied by raised pitch br br br Kogal slang br In the s the traditional feminine speech patterns and stereotyped behaviors were challenged and a popular culture of naughty teenage girls emerged called kogyaru sometimes referenced in English language materials as kogal Their rebellious behaviors deviant language usage the
