The Game Boy Color GBC or CGB is an bit handheld game console manufactured by Nintendo which was released in Japan on October and to international markets that November It is the successor to the Game Boy and part of its product line Compared to the original the Game Boy Color features a color TFT screen rather than monochrome a processor that operates twice as fast and four times as much memory It retains backward compatibility with games initially developed for its predecessor However reviewers considered these improvements insufficient to justify Nintendo s releasing it as a separate product br The handheld is slightly thicker and taller and has a slightly smaller screen than the Game Boy Pocket its immediate predecessor although significantly smaller than the original Game Boy As with its predecessors the Game Boy Color has a custom bit processor made by Sharp The American English spelling of the system s name Game Boy Color remains consistent throughout the world br The Game Boy Color is part of the fifth generation of video game consoles The Game Boy and the Game Boy Color combined have sold million units worldwide making them the fourth best selling system of all time Its best selling games are Pok mon Gold and Silver which shipped million units worldwide br br br History br When the original Game Boy was first introduced in many questioned why Nintendo had chosen to develop a monochrome handheld considering competitors like the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear boasted color screens However Nintendo s gamble paid off The rivals color displays while visually impressive were criticized for their poor battery life and bulky size The Game Boy in contrast offered superior portability and longevity propelling it to immense popularity Publicly Nintendo pledged to develop a color Game Boy only when technology addressed the limitations of existing color handhelds br Internally however a team led by Satoru Okada who played a key role in the original Game Boy s design was already experimenting with color displays Their early s prototype codenamed Project Atlantis featured a color screen and a powerful bit processor from Sharp However the team wasn t satisfied with the outcome and shelved further development br Despite the lack of color consumer interest in the Game Boy remained strong In Nintendo released the slimmer Game Boy Pocket and the launch of the Pok mon series that same year further boosted sales However developers were starting to lose interest in the aging platform br The tide began to turn in October when news broke about Bandai s new handheld the WonderSwan Notably the project was led by Gunpei Yokoi the engineer who led the development of the Game Watch series and the original Game Boy Yokoi had left Nintendo in following the commercial failure of his final project the Virtual Boy His departure caused a stir with investors dumping Nintendo stock forcing a temporary halt on trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange Tragically Yokoi would never see the WonderSwan s release as he was killed in a roadside accident in br Faced with mounting pressure Okada revisited Project Atlantis However prioritizing speed to market over power he dropped the bit processor for a faster version of the existing Game Boy s bit processor that would allow for a quicker launch and maintain compatibility with the existing library of Game Boy games br The Game Boy Color was officially announced in March hitting store shelves in Japan in October of that year It received an international rollout throughout November reaching North America on the th Europe on the rd and Australasia on the th Launching at a price of US equivalent to in the Game Boy Color ultimately outsold the WonderSwan which went on sale in March br The Game Boy Color had a relatively short lifespan being on the market for only two and a half years before being succeeded by the Game Boy Advance in The successor finally brought the bit processing power envisioned in Project Atlantis Despite the new arrival the Game Boy Color remained in production serving as a budget friendly alternative The last units were reportedly sold by March br br br Hardware br br The Game Boy Color uses a custom system on a chip SoC integrating the CPU and other major components into a single package named the CPU CGB by Nintendo and manufactured by the Sharp Corporation While the CPU CGB was a new design for the Game Boy Color the technology inside was largely an evolution of the then ten year old DMG CPU SoC used inside the original Game Boy making the CPU CGB outdated when it was introduced in the late s br Within the CPU CGB the main processor is a Sharp SM a hybrid between two other bit processors the Intel and the Zilog Z The SM has the seven bit registers of the compared to on the Z but uses the Z s programming syntax and extra bit manipulation instructions and it also adds a few new instructions to optimize the processor for certain operations related to the way the hardware was arranged The Sharp SM also powered the original Game Boy where it operated at a clock rate of megahertz MHz However games on Game Boy Color exclusive cartridges could command the processor to operate in dual speed mode overclocking it to run twice as fast at MHz This gave developers the option to get more processing power out of the device while retaining backward compatibility for existing games br The CPU CGB also incorporates the Picture Processing Unit essentially a basic GPU that renders visuals using two separate kilobyte KB banks of Video RAM twice as much as the original Game Boy and relocated inside the SoC for faster access Games developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color could take full advantage of the additional memory to add more effects and display up to colors simultaneously out of a selection of colors When an Original Game Boy Game Pak is inserted into the device the additional memory is disabled However these monochrome games still benefit from enhanced color palettes br The display itself is a inch diagonal thin film transistor TFT color liquid crystal display LCD measuring millimeters in wide by millimeters in high The screen aspect ratio and resolution remain identical to the original Game Boy at pixels wide by pixels high in a format Like the original Game Boy and Game Boy Pocket before it and the Game Boy Advance after it the screen is passively reflective with a surface behind the screen that sends light back through the liquid crystal pixel elements to the viewer Because there is no backlight the device can be hard to use in dark environments br The SoC also contains a KB bootstrap ROM which is used to start up the device B of High RAM that can be accessed faster similar to a CPU cache and the Audio Processing Unit a programmable sound generator with four channels a pulse wave generation channel with frequency and volume variation a second pulse wave generation channel with only volume variation a wave channel than can reproduce any waveform recorded in RAM and a white noise channel with volume variation The motherboard of the Game Boy Color also contains a KB working RAM chip four times more than the KB on the original Game Boy br The Game Boy features a D pad directional pad four action buttons labeled A B SELECT and START and a sliding on off switch on the right side of the device The volume is adjusted by a potentiometer dial on the left side of the device br The left side also offers a Game Link Cable port for connecting to up to four Game Boy devices for multiplayer games or notably in Pok mon series games sharing files This port can also be used with a Game Boy Printer The port used on the Game Boy Color is of a smaller design first introduced on the Game Boy Pocket and requires an adapter to link with the original Game Boy While the original Game Boy could transfer data at kilobits per second kbit s the Game Boy color offered a high speed mode that could reach up to kbit s times faster The Game Boy Color also added an infrared communications port for wireless data transfer however the feature is only supported by a small number of games and the infrared port was not included on the Game Boy Advance line br br br Technical specifications br br br Cartridges br br Games are stored on cartridges called Game Boy Game Paks using read only memory ROM chips Initially due to the limitations of the bit architecture of the device ROM size was limited to KB However Nintendo overcame this limitation with a Memory Bank Controller MBC inside the cartridge This chip sits between the processor and the ROM chips The CPU can only access KB at a time but the MBC can switch between several banks of KB ROM Using this technology Nintendo created Game Boy Color games that used up to megabytes of ROM Game Paks could also provide additional functionality to the Game Boy system Some cartridges included up to KB of RAM to increase performance which could also be battery backed to save progress when the handheld was off real time clock chips could keep track of time even when the device was off and Rumble Pak cartridges added vibration feedback to enhance gameplay br The Game Boy Color has backward compatibility with all original Game Boy games and there were three main Game Pak cartridge types for the handheld br br Original Game Boy Game Pak Gray Case The classic Game Boy cartridges The Game Boy Color applies a limited color palette often dark green using four to ten colors to enhance games originally intended to be presented in four shades of gray Many games were programmed to call for a default color palette However for games without a default users could choose from different palettes using button combinations A dedicated palette option replicates the original Game Boy s grayscale experience br Color enhanced Game Boy Game Pak Black Case These cartridges can use the full color capabilities of the console displaying up to colors simultaneously out of a palette of while use up to colors out of a palette of while remaining compatible with the original Game Boy where they were presented in four shades of gray However this compatibility comes at the expense of not being able to utilize the handheld s increased processing speed and memory br Game Boy Color Game Pak Clear Case Designed specifically for the Game Boy Color these cartridges exploit the system s full potential They boast both the full color range colors simultaneously out of a palette of and benefit from the increased processing speed and memory of the Game Boy Color However because of this reliance on the newer hardware these games are incompatible with the older monochrome Game Boy models br br br Model colors br br Nintendo had seen success selling colored variations of the Play It Loud Game Boy and the Game Boy Pocket so the company released the Color in several case variations br The logo for Game Boy Color spells out the word COLOR in the five original colors in which the unit was manufactured Berry C Grape O Kiwi L Dandelion O and Teal R Another color released at the same time was Atomic Purple made of a translucent purple plastic Other colors were sold as limited editions or in specific countries br br br Games br br Due to its backward compatibility with Game Boy games the Game Boy Color s launched with a large playable library The system amassed a library of Game Boy Color games over a four year period While the majority of the games are Game Boy Color exclusive approximately of the games released are compatible with the original Game Boy Most Game Boy Color games released after are not compatible with the original Game Boy br Tetris for the original Game Boy is the best selling game compatible with Game Boy Color and Pok mon Gold and Silver are the best selling games developed primarily for it The best selling Game Boy Color exclusive game is Pok mon Crystal br The last Game Boy Color game ever released is the Japanese exclusive Doraemon no Study Boy Kanji Yomikaki Master on July The last game released in North America is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets released on November In Europe the last game released for the system is Hamtaro Ham Hams Unite on January br Beyond officially released games for the platform there is an active online community creating new games for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color through the use of tools like GB Studio One such example is Dragonhym originally Dragonborne which was available for release on a physical cartridge which will be playable on the Game Boy Color br br br Reception br br br Sales br The Game Boy and Game Boy Color were both commercially successful selling million units worldwide million in Japan million in the Americas and million in all other regions At the time of its discontinuation in the combined sales of all Game Boy variants made it the best selling game console of all time In later years its sales were surpassed by the Nintendo DS PlayStation and Nintendo Switch making it the fourth best selling console the second best selling handheld of all time as of Sales of the device were in part driven by the success of Pok mon Gold and Silver and Pok mon Crystal with combined sales of million units making them one of the best selling video games of all time br Sales of the Game Boy Color were strong at launch Nintendo of America reported a sale of one million units from launch to December and two million by July Retail chains in the United States reported unexpectedly high demand for the console with executives of FuncoLand reporting very pleasant and unpredicted sales and Electronics Boutique stating the entire Game Boy Color line just exploded including accessories upon release Faced with high worldwide demand and competitive retail pricing retailers such as CompUSA sold out of Game Boy Color stock in the weeks before the Christmas season br br br Critical reception br Reception of the Game Boy Color was positive with critics praising the addition of color and improved clarity of the display br Affiliated publications such as Total Game Boy praised the handheld for its bright colorful picture that can be viewed in direct light backward compatibility features preserving the vast catalogue of original Game Boy games and improved technical performance Computer and Video Games praised the Game Boy Color for making the Game Boy library of games look better than ever everything is crystal clear bright and in color Writing for GameSpot Chris Johnston stated that the display was crystal clear and free of motion blur stating that Tetris DX was the killer app of the launch titles on the platform br Milder reviews included those by Arcade who said that while that the colors were very impressive they were not as eyeball popping as you might have hoped for it s mostly seaweed greens rusty browns timid yellows and the like They concluded that nothing about the Game Boy Color is very radical but said the device was Game Boy as it always should have been Reviewers also pointed out other drawbacks including that the system was still using an bit architecture when competitors had moved onto bit handheld systems and that the backlit screen required that the user be in a well lit area br br br Legacy br Commentary on the legacy of the Game Boy Color has been shaped by the perception that the handheld was as an incremental and transitional upgrade of the Game Boy rather than a completely new device and had a relatively brief lifespan being supplanted by the Game Boy Advance after two years five months on the market br In a history of Nintendo author Jeff Ryan noted the Game Boy Color had a reputation as a legacy machine that found success mostly due to its backward compatibility as few wanted to lose all the Dr Mario and Pok mon cartridges they had amassed over the years Quoted in Retro Gamer Blitz Games Studios developer Bob Pape acknowledged that although backwards compatibility more or less defined the Game Boy Color the handheld ticked all the right boxes with regards to size battery life reliability and most importantly backwards compatibility br Positive assessments of the legacy of the Game Boy Color has also focused on the merits of its game library particularly for its third party and import titles Travis Fahs for IGN noted whilst the Game Boy Color s life was relatively brief it built up a small library of excellent games including Wario Land and Pok mon Gold and Silver and a unique and previously unheard of line of successful third party games including Dragon Warrior Monsters Metal Gear Solid and Yu Gi Oh Dark Duel Stories Ashley Day of Retro Gamer noted that the handheld had an overlooked status stating the Game Boy Color has an unfair reputation as the one Nintendo handheld with few worthwhile titles but this simply isn t the case returning to the Game Boy Color now reveals a wealth of great games that you never knew existed especially those available on import br br br See also br List of Game Boy accessories br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br br Official website at the Wayback
