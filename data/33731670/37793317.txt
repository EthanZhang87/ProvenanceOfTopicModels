Espresso is the codename of the bit central processing unit CPU used in Nintendo s Wii U video game console It was designed by IBM and was produced using a nm silicon on insulator process The Espresso chip resides together with a GPU from AMD on an MCM manufactured by Renesas It was revealed at E in June and released in November br br br Design br br IBM and Nintendo have revealed that the Espresso processor is a PowerPC based microprocessor with three cores on a single chip to reduce power consumption and increase speed The CPU and the graphics processor are placed on a single substrate as a multi chip module MCM to reduce complexity increase the communication speed between the chips further reduce power consumption and reduce cost and space required The two chips were assembled to the complete MCM by Renesas in Japan Espresso itself was manufactured by IBM in its mm plant in East Fishkill New York using nm SOI technology and embedded DRAM eDRAM for caches br While unverified by Nintendo hackers teardowns and unofficial informants have since revealed more information about the Espresso such as its name size and speed The microarchitecture seems to be quite similar to its predecessors the Broadway and Gekko i e PowerPC based but enhanced with larger and faster caches and multiprocessor support br Rumors that the Wii U CPU was derived from IBM s high end POWER server processor proved false as it would potentially increase the manufacturing and retail cost of the system and require a larger form factor Espresso shares some technology with POWER such as eDRAM and general instruction set similarities but those are superficial similarities br br br Specifications br br Out of order execution PowerPC based cores br nanometer process technology br IBM silicon on insulator SOI technology br Backward compatible with the Broadway and Gekko processors br The following specifications have not been officially confirmed by either Nintendo or IBM They have been obtained by reverse engineering by hacker Hector Martin alias marcan br br Broadway based core architecture br Three cores at GHz br Symmetric multiprocessing with MESI MERSI support br Each core can output up to instructions per clock using superscalar parallelism br bit integer unit br bit floating point or bit SIMD often found under the denomination paired singles br A total of MB of Level cache in an unusual configuration br Core KB core MB core KB br stage pipeline br stage pipeline FP br Execution Units per core EUs total br Die size mm mm mm br br br br br br Further reading br Wii U graphics power finally revealed br Nintendo exec denies Wii U processor is a little poor br First page of developer s user manual
