Super Mario Bros is a platform game developed and published in by Nintendo for the Famicom in Japan and for the Nintendo Entertainment System NES in North America It is the successor to the arcade game Mario Bros and the first game in the Super Mario series Following a US test market release for the NES it was converted to international arcades on the Nintendo VS System in early The NES version received a wide release in North America that year and in PAL regions in br Players control Mario or his brother Luigi in the multiplayer mode to explore the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from King Koopa later named Bowser They traverse side scrolling stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of power ups such as the Super Mushroom Fire Flower and Starman br The game was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as a grand culmination of the Famicom team s three years of game mechanics and programming drawing from their experiences working on Devil World and the side scrollers Excitebike and Kung Fu to advance their previous work on platforming athletic games such as Donkey Kong and Mario Bros The design of the first level World is a tutorial for platform gameplay br Super Mario Bros is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time and is particularly admired for its precise controls It has been re released on most Nintendo systems and is one of the bestselling games of all time with more than million copies sold worldwide It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the crash and helped popularize the side scrolling platform game genre Koji Kondo s soundtrack is one of the earliest and most popular in video games making music a centerpiece of game design and has since been considered one of the best video game soundtracks of all time as a result Mario has become prominent in popular culture and Super Mario Bros began a multimedia franchise including a long running game series an animated television series a Japanese anime feature film a live action feature film and an animated feature film br br br Gameplay br br The player controls Mario the titular protagonist of the series Mario s brother Luigi is controlled by the second player in multiplayer mode and assumes the same plot role and functionality as Mario The objective is to quickly explore the Mushroom Kingdom survive the main antagonist Bowser s forces and save Princess Toadstool It is a side scrolling platform game where the player moves to the right to reach the flagpole at the end of each level br The Mushroom Kingdom includes coins for Mario to collect and special bricks marked with a question mark which when hit from below by Mario may reveal more coins or a special item Other secret often invisible bricks may contain more coins or rare items If the player gains a Super Mushroom Mario grows to double his size and gains the ability to break bricks above him If Mario gets hit in this mode then instead of dying he turns back to regular Mario Players start with a certain number of lives and may gain extra lives by picking up green spotted up mushrooms hidden in bricks collecting coins defeating several enemies in a row with a Koopa shell or bouncing on enemies successively without touching the ground The player may also spawn hidden bricks with lives by collecting every coin in the previous world s third level or by warping there Mario loses a life if he takes damage while small falls in a bottomless pit or runs out of time The game ends when the player runs out of lives although holding the A button can be used on the game over screen to respawn from the first level of the world in which the player died br Mario s primary attack is jumping on top of enemies though many enemies have differing responses to this For example a Goomba will flatten and be defeated while a Koopa Troopa will temporarily retract into its shell allowing Mario to use it as a projectile These shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies though they can also bounce back against Mario which will hurt or kill him Other enemies such as underwater foes and enemies with spiked tops cannot be jumped on and damage the player instead Mario can also defeat enemies above him by jumping to hit the brick that the enemy is standing on Mario may also acquire the Fire flower from certain blocks that when picked up changes the color of Super Mario s outfit and allows him to throw fireballs A less common item is the Starman which often appears when Mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks This item grants Mario temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers br The game consists of eight worlds each with four sub levels or stages Underwater stages contain unique aquatic enemies Bonuses and secret areas include more coins or warp pipes that allow Mario to skip directly to later worlds The final stage of each world is in a fiery underground castle where Bowser is fought on a suspension bridge above lava the first seven of these Bowsers are actually minions disguised as him and the real Bowser is in the eighth world Bowser and his decoys are defeated by jumping over them or running under them while they are jumping and reaching the axe on the end of the bridge or with fireballs After completing the game once the player is rewarded with the ability to replay with increased difficulty such as all Goombas replaced with Buzzy Beetles enemies similar to Koopa Troopas who cannot be defeated using the Fire Flower br br br Plot br Following the events of Mario Bros the game is set in the fantasy land of the Mushroom Kingdom after Mario and Luigi had arrived through a clay pipe from New York City br In the Mushroom Kingdom a tribe of turtle like Koopa Troopas invade the kingdom and uses the magic of their king Bowser to turn the Mushroom People into inanimate objects such as bricks stones and horsehair plants Bowser and his army also kidnap Princess Toadstool of the Mushroom Kingdom the only one with the ability to reverse Bowser s spell After hearing the news the brothers set out to save the princess and free the kingdom from Bowser They fight Bowser s forces while traversing the Mushroom Kingdom After each defeat of a decoy Bowser the mushroom retainer proclaims Thank you Mario But our princess is in another castle Finally they reach Bowser s true stronghold where they defeat him by throwing fireballs or by dropping him into lava freeing the princess and saving the Mushroom Kingdom br br br Development br br Super Mario Bros was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka of the Nintendo Creative Department and largely programmed by Toshihiko Nakago of SRD Company Ltd which became a longtime Nintendo partner and later a wholly owned subsidiary The original Mario Bros released in is an arcade platformer that takes place on a single screen with a black background Miyamoto used the term athletic games to refer to what would later be known as platform games For Super Mario Bros Miyamoto wanted to create a more colorful athletic game with a scrolling screen and larger characters br Development was a culmination of their technical knowledge from working on the games Devil World Excitebike and Kung Fu along with their desire to further advance the platforming athletic game genre they had created with their earlier games The side scrolling gameplay of racing game Excitebike and beat em up game Kung Fu Master the latter ported by Miyamoto s team to the NES as Kung Fu were key steps towards Miyamoto s vision of an expansive side scrolling platformer in turn Kung Fu Master was an adaptation of the Jackie Chan film Wheels on Meals While working on Excitebike and Kung Fu he came up with the concept of a platformer that would have the player strategize while scrolling sideways over long distances have aboveground and underground levels and have colorful backgrounds rather than black backgrounds Super Mario Bros used the fast scrolling game engine Miyamoto s team had originally developed for Excitebike which allowed Mario to smoothly accelerate from a walk to a run rather than move at a constant speed like in earlier platformers br Miyamoto also wanted to create a game that would be the final exclamation point for the ROM cartridge format before the forthcoming Famicom Disk System was released Development for Super Mario Bros began in the fall of at the same time as The Legend of Zelda another Famicom game directed and designed by Miyamoto and released in Japan five months later and the games shared some elements for instance the fire bars that appear in the Mario castle levels began as objects in Zelda br To have a new game available for the end of year shopping season Nintendo aimed for simplicity In December the team created a prototype in which the player moved a x pixel rectangle around a single screen Tezuka suggested using Mario after seeing the sales figures of Mario Bros In February the team chose the name Super Mario Bros after implementing the Super Mushroom power up The game initially used a concept in which Mario or Luigi could fly a rocket ship while firing at enemies but this went unused the final game s sky based bonus stages are a remnant of this concept The team found it illogical that Mario was hurt by stomping on turtles in Mario Bros so decided that future Mario games would definitely have it so that you could jump on turtles all you want Miyamoto initially imagined Bowser as an ox inspired by the Ox King from the Toei Animation film Alakazam the Great However Tezuka decided he looked more like a turtle and they collaborated to create his final design br The development of Super Mario Bros is an early example of specialization in the video game industry made possible and necessary by the Famicom s arcade capable hardware Miyamoto designed the game world and led a team of seven programmers and artists who turned his ideas into code sprites music and sound effects Developers of previous hit games joined the team in February importing many special programming techniques features and design refinements such as these Donkey Kong s slopes lifts conveyor belts and ladders Donkey Kong Jr s ropes logs and springs and Mario Bros s enemy attacks enemy movement frozen platforms and POW Blocks br The team based the level design around a small Mario intending to later make his size bigger in the final version but they decided it would be fun to let Mario change his size via a power up The early level design was focused on teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from Goombas and would be beneficial to them so in World the first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released The use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by Japanese folktales in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms this also resulted in the game world being named the Mushroom Kingdom The team had Mario begin levels as small Mario to make obtaining a mushroom more gratifying Miyamoto explained When we made the prototype of the big Mario we did not feel he was big enough So we came up with the idea of showing the smaller Mario first who could be made bigger later in the game then players could see and feel that he was bigger Miyamoto denied rumors that developers implemented a small Mario after a bug caused only his upper half to appear Miyamoto said the shell kicking up trick was carefully tested but people turned out to be a lot better at pulling the trick off for ages on end than we thought Other features such as blocks containing multiple coins were inspired by programming glitches br Super Mario Bros was developed for a cartridge with kilobits KiB of program code and data and kilobits KiB of sprite and background graphics Due to this storage limitation the designers happily considered their aggressive search for space saving opportunities to be akin to their own fun television game show competition For instance clouds and bushes in the game s backgrounds use that same sprite recolored and background tiles are generated via an automatic algorithm Sound effects were also recycled the sound when Mario is damaged is the same as when he enters a pipe and Mario jumping on an enemy is the same sound as each stroke when swimming After completing the game the development team decided that they should introduce players with a simple easy to defeat enemy rather than beginning the game with Koopa Troopas By this point the project had nearly run out of memory so the designers created the Goombas by making a single static image and flipping it back and forth to save space while creating a convincing character animation After the addition of the game s music around bytes of open cartridge space remained Miyamoto used this remaining space to add a sprite of a crown into the game which would appear in the player s life counter as a reward for obtaining at least lives br br br World br br During the third generation of video game consoles tutorials on gameplay were rare Instead level design teaches players how a video game works The opening section of Super Mario Bros was therefore specifically designed in such a way that players would be forced to explore the mechanics of the game to be able to advance Rather than confront the newly oriented player with obstacles the first level of Super Mario Bros lays down the variety of in game hazards by means of repetition iteration and escalation In an interview with Eurogamer Miyamoto explained that he created World to contain everything a player needs to gradually and naturally understand what they re doing so that they can quickly understand how the game works According to Miyamoto once players understand the mechanics of the game they can play more freely and it becomes their game br br br Music br br Nintendo sound designer Koji Kondo created the six track score and all sound effects At the time he was composing video game music was mostly meant to attract attention not necessarily to enhance or conform to the game Kondo s work on Super Mario Bros was one of the major forces in the shift towards music becoming an integral and participatory part of video games Kondo had two specific goals for his music to convey an unambiguous sonic image of the game world and to enhance the emotional and physical experience of the gamer br The music of Super Mario Bros is coordinated with the onscreen animations of the various sprites which was one way which Kondo created a sense of greater immersion Kondo was not the first to do this in a video game for instance Space Invaders features a simple song that gets faster as the aliens speed up eliciting a sense of stress and impending doom which matches the increasing challenge of the game Unlike most games at the time for which composers were hired later in the process to add music to a nearly finished game Kondo was a part of the development team almost from the beginning of production working in tandem with the rest of the team to create the game s soundtrack Kondo s compositions were largely influenced by the game s gameplay intending for it to heighten the feeling of how the game controls br Before composition began a prototype of the game was presented to Kondo so that he could get an idea of Mario s general environment and revolve the music around it Kondo wrote the score with the help of a small piano to create appropriate melodies to fit the game s environments After the development of the game showed progress Kondo began to feel that his music did not quite fit the pace of the game so he changed it a bit by increasing the songs tempos The music was further adjusted based on the expectations of Nintendo s playtesters br Kondo later composed new music for the new Super Mario Bros snow desert and forest level themes that appeared in the level creator game Super Mario Maker br br br Release br Super Mario Bros was first released in Japan on Friday the th September for the Family Computer Famicom It was released later that year in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System NES Its exact North American release date is debated though most sources report it was released in October as a launch game when the
