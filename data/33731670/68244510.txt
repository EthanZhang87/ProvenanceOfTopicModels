id: 68244510
The Steam Deck is a handheld gaming computer developed by Valve and released on February The device uses Valve s Linux distribution SteamOS which incorporates the namesake Steam storefront SteamOS uses Valve s Proton compatibility layer allowing users to run Windows applications and games In addition to handheld use the Steam Deck can be connected to a Television or monitor through a docking station and be used like a desktop computer or home video game console In desktop mode users can install third party applications for Linux br br br History br Valve s Steam Machine series of gaming computers using Linux based SteamOS was introduced in which worked their way into the conception of the Steam Deck Valve quietly pulled back on it by April but stated they remained committed to providing some type of open hardware platform Steam Deck designer Scott Dalton said there was always kind of this classic chicken and egg problem with the Steam Machine as it required the adoption of Linux by both players and game developers to reach a critical interest in the machines to draw manufacturers in making them The lack of Linux game availability during the lifetime of Steam Machines led Valve to invest development into Proton a Linux compatibility layer to allow Windows based games to be run on Linux without modification Some of the early prototypes of Valve s Steam Controller also released in included a small LCD screen within the middle of the controller which could be programmed as a second screen alongside the game that the user was playing One idea from this prototype was to include the Steam Link a device capable of streaming game content from a computer running Steam to a different monitor here routing that output to the small LCD on the controller This was later considered by Valve a very early concept behind the Steam Deck Further their experience with trying to convince other manufacturers to produce Steam Machines led Valve to realize that it was better to develop all their hardware internally Dalton said More and more it just became kind of clear the more of this we are doing internally the more we can kind of make a complete package Rumors that Valve was working on a portable gaming unit had emerged in May based on updates made within the Steam code pointing towards a new SteamPal device and comments made by Gabe Newell related to Valve developing games for consoles Ars Technica had been able to confirm that new hardware was in development at Valve br Valve revealed the Steam Deck on July The Deck existing in three different models based on internal storage options was shipped starting in February in North America and Europe with other regions to follow throughout the year Valve s CEO Gabe Newell said of the Steam Deck s approach As a gamer this is a product I ve always wanted And as a game developer it s the mobile device I ve always wanted for our partners According to Newell they wanted to be very aggressive on the release and pricing strategy as they considered the mobile market as their primary competitor for the Deck However their focus was on the unit s performance Newell stated But the first thing was the performance and the experience that was the biggest and most fundamental constraint that was driving this Newell recognized that the base pricing was somewhat lower than expected and painful but necessary to meet the expectation of gamers who would want the Deck Newell continued that he believed this was a new product category of personal computer hardware that Valve and other computer manufacturers would continue to participate in if the Steam Deck proved successful and thus it was necessary to keep the unit s price point reasonable to demonstrate viability The openness of the system was also a key feature according to Newell as that is a defining superpower of the personal computer space over typical console systems Newell did not want to have any limitations on what the end user could do with the hardware such as installing alternate non Steam software on it br As of December Valve was pursuing improvements on the current Steam Deck design including an audio mixer per game power profiles and some other performance improvements as well as evaluating a second generation Steam Deck Valve was also considering bringing some of the Steam Deck technology into a new Steam Controller br Valve announced two new Deck models to be available for purchase in November both with OLED screens extended battery capacity and improved cooling features but otherwise no changes to internal components These models replace two of the existing models Hardware designers for Valve stated that they would have wanted to include OLED screens for the original launch models but at the time OLED screens of sufficient size and quality did not yet exist on the market and they would have had to delay release by to months if they had went that route Alongside the announcement of the OLED models Valve stated they are working towards a Steam Deck with overall system improvements including the CPU and GPU chips but these systems will likely not be ready for two to three years br br br Hardware br br br LCD models br The original Steam Deck was launched in February and included a custom AMD APU based on their Zen and RDNA architectures named Aerith after the Final Fantasy VII character Aerith Gainsborough The CPU runs a four core eight thread unit and the GPU runs on eight compute units with a total estimated performance of TFLOPS Both the CPU and GPU use variable timing frequencies with the CPU running between and GHz and the GPU between and GHz based on current processor needs Valve stated that the CPU has comparable performance to Ryzen desktop computer processors and the GPU performance to the Radeon RX series The Deck includes GB of LPDDR RAM in a quad channel configuration with a total bandwidth of GB s br br The Deck s main unit is designed for handheld use It includes a inch mm touchscreen LCD display with a pixel resolution with a fixed Hz refresh rate games are configured to use vertical synchronization where possible The unit s input set features two thumbsticks a directional pad ABXY buttons two shoulder buttons on each side of the unit four additional buttons on the rear of the unit as well as two trackpads under each thumbstick The thumbsticks and trackpads use capacitive sensing and the unit further includes a gyroscope to allow for more specialized controls on the handheld mode The unit also includes haptic feedback br The Deck supports Bluetooth connectivity for input devices including common game controllers and includes integrated WiFi network support to meet IEEE a b g n ac standards stereo sound out via a digital signal processor an integrated microphone and a headphone jack a watt hour battery which Valve estimates that for lighter use cases like game streaming smaller D games or web browsing can last between seven and eight hours Valve also estimated that by keeping frame rates to around frames per second FPS more intensive games such as Portal could be played for five to six hours The system s software includes an optional FPS limiter that balance a game s performance to optimize battery life At release Steam Decks were only manufactured in a black casing to reduce the complexity of production though Valve stated that they have considered introducing other case colors or themes in the future Valve partnered with iFixit to provide replacement parts for users br The unit shipped in three models based on internal storage options The base model includes a GB eMMC internal storage unit running over PCI Express x A mid tier model includes GB of storage through an NVMe SSD device while the high end unit includes a GB NVMe SSD storage unit with the latter two both shipping with drives that run PCI Express x All SKUs utilize the same M interface for internal storage Valve stated that the built in storage is not meant to be replaceable by end users though can be replaced as necessary for repair Additional storage space is available through a microSD card slot which also supports microSDXC and microSDHC formats br As Valve considered options for bringing a handheld device to market they set a priority that the device had to be able to play nearly the entirety of the Steam game catalogue and rejected possible hardware that moved away from the standard x based processing structure that would have been easier to implement in handheld form but would have limited what games would be available Only through recent discussions with AMD and their current product lines was Valve able to identify a technical approach that would meet the goal of a handheld device capable of playing all Steam games without overtaxing the processor unit The developers considered the Steam Deck to be future proof While the specifications are modest compared to high end gaming computers they felt that the performance was at a good place that would be acceptable for many years while still looking at newer software improvements such as the addition of AMD s FidelityFX Super Resolution FSR Though they do not have any current designs for a successor Valve stated that there would likely be future iterations of the hardware in years to come but the company expects the timing of releases to depend on the current state of processor technology and handheld device limitations rather than a regular upgrade cycle br br br OLED models br Two new models were released on November These models with GB and TB of internal storage come in to replace the previous top of the line LCD variant The GB and GB original units are now discontinued with the GB LCD version becoming the new base model The new model upgrades include a larger inches cm OLED Hz display Wi Fi E and Bluetooth support a battery with an estimated improvement in capacity and improved cooling The OLED deck includes a revised APU based on nm processor production named Sephiroth also based on the Final Fantasy VII character br In addition a limited edition of the TB model was released in North America exclusively which has translucent plastic casing and selected orange colored components br br br Dock unit br A dock unit was released on October The dock unit can be connected to an external power source to power the Deck and to an external monitor via either HDMI or DisplayPort protocols to route output from the Deck to that monitor Though limited by the processor speed the display output from the Deck via the dock can reach as high as k resolution at Hz or k resolution at Hz this resolution boost can also be achieved by attaching the Deck directly through a USB to HDMI adapter without the use of the docking station There is no other change in performance of the Steam Deck whether docked or when used in portable mode With SteamOS update the dock unit was also made to support variable refresh rate monitors The dock also supports Ethernet network connectivity and support for USB connections for controllers or other input devices The Deck can also work with any third party docking station that supports similar types of interfacing for portable devices External GPUs are not officially supported although testing via the M slot has demonstrated that eGPUs are capable of running when connected to the Deck br br br Software br br br Operating system br br Steam Deck runs SteamOS version based on the Arch Linux operating system While SteamOS had been previously developed for Steam Machines using Debian Linux Valve stated that they wanted to use a rolling upgrade approach for the Deck s system software a function Debian was not designed for but which is a characteristic of Arch Linux An application programming interface API specific for the Steam Deck is available to game developers allowing a game to specify certain settings if it is being run on a Steam Deck compared to a normal computer Within the Steam storefront developers can populate a special file depot for their game with lower resolution textures and other reduced elements to allow their game to perform better on the Steam Deck Steam automatically detects and downloads the appropriate files for the system whether on a computer or Steam Deck when the user installs the game br br br Interface br br The Steam client on the Deck features a revised interface and functions different from the desktop client Unlike Steam s Big Picture mode which was designed for use on television screens which was treated as a separate software branch within Valve the Deck version of the Steam client stays consistent with the desktop version adding functions and interface elements to make navigating through Steam easier with controller input and indicators typical for portable systems such as battery life and wireless connectivity Valve replaced the previous Big Picture mode in Steam with one based on the Steam Deck user interface in February The version of Steam on the Deck otherwise supports all other functions of Steam including user profiles and friends lists access to game communities cloud saving Steam Workshop support and the Remote Play feature Remote Play also allows the Steam Deck to be used as a controller for a game running on a computer providing additional control options beyond traditional keyboard and mouse or common controller systems The Steam software on the Deck also supports suspending a game in progress a feature considered by Valve to be core to the Deck Otherwise games that do not take advantage of the Steam Deck API have the handheld s controller input automatically converted for them For example the touch sensitive controllers on the Deck translate input appropriately for games that typically rely on keyboard and mouse controls Valve added to Steam s current approach to cloud saving with the introduction of Dynamic Cloud Sync in January Prior cloud functionality only synchronized game saves after the user has exited a game developers can enable Dynamic Cloud Sync to use cloud saving while the game is running making this feature more amenable for portable use on the Steam Deck br br br Games br The Deck displays compatible games from the Steam storefront Games developed for Linux run natively The SteamOS software includes support for Proton a compatibility layer that allows games developed for Windows to be played on the Linux based SteamOS According to ProtonDB a community run database that compiles information on game compatibility of Steam games within Linux using Proton several of Steam s more popular game releases were not yet compatible with Proton primarily due to anti circumvention and anti cheat controls or digital rights management DRM Valve stated they were working with vendors of these middleware solutions to improve Proton support while also encouraging Linux specific versions to be developed Epic Games Easy Anti Cheat one of the more popular anti cheat options for developers was made available for macOS and Linux systems in September which Epic stated that developers could easily transition for the Proton layer Valve worked with Epic over the end of to make the transition of Easy Anti Cheat to Proton simple for developers Another popular anti cheat solution BattlEye also affirmed their software was ready to work with the Proton layer and only required developers to opt in to enable it Valve stated that in testing games otherwise currently available on Linux or compatible with the Proton layer they had yet to find a game that failed to meet a minimum frames per second performance on the handheld a performance metric comparable to the consoles of the eighth generation The Proton layer includes support for AMD s upscaling technology FidelityFX Super Resolution FSR while Proton also supports Nvidia s DLSS upscaling solution it is not compatible with the Deck br Due to potential confusion on game compatibility Valve introduced a process in October by which they brought in additional staff to review games on Steam in order to make sure a game is fully playable on the Steam Deck Games that are confirmed to be compatible with the Steam Deck including those with Proton and any middleware DRM solutions that by default meet minimum performance specifications are marked as Verified Games that may require some user tinkering with settings such as having to use a system control to bring up the on screen keyboard are tagged as Playable Another category Unsupported are games that Valve has tested to not be fully compatible with the Steam Deck such as VR games or games using Windows specific codecs that have not yet been made compatible with Proton These ratings are to change over time as both the Steam Deck software improves as well as updates made by developers to games to improve compatibility with the Steam Deck software br Users download games onto the Steam Deck to store on either the internal storage or SD card each storage device treated as a separate Steam Library for games This allows SD cards with different Steam Libraries to be swapped in and out Valve is exploring the ability to pre load games on an SD card outside of the Deck such as through a personal computer The ability to download games onto the Steam Deck from a local network Steam installation was added in February While the Deck was designed for playing games on the Steam storefront desktop mode allows for installation of third party storefronts like Epic Games Store Ubisoft Connect or Origin It is possible to replace SteamOS with a different operating system entirely or set up multi booting It is also possible to use the built in browser for Xbox Cloud Gaming allowing those with Xbox Game Pass subscriptions access to that catalogue of games Newell stated that Valve would support Microsoft in bringing Xbox Game Pass to Steam and Steam Deck if they want that route With the system s open nature users have also been able to add homebrew emulators to run games that users own from other consoles or computer systems br br br Third party utilities br The operating software of the Steam Deck is open source allowing a range of third party software tools to be developed to bring additional utility to the device Examples include SteamOS plugin loader Decky emulation manager EmuDeck and the batocera linux distribution br br br Release br Pre orders for the Steam Deck were opened a day after its announcement Pre orders were limited to those with Steam accounts opened before June to prevent resellers from depleting stock and making the device more difficult to purchase First day pre order reservations through the Steam storefront briefly crashed the servers due to the demand By September development kits for the Steam Deck were shipping to developers For the planned release in Asian regions Valve worked with Komodo to help with local production localization and distribution support br The Steam Deck was released on February in North America and the European regions As part of the Steam Deck s launch Valve released Aperture Desk Job a spinoff game in the Portal series for free on March available to all Windows and Linux SteamOS users The game is designed to demonstrate the various features of the Steam Deck though is still playable with a controller for other systems To assist in developing and testing software for the Steam Deck Valve released SteamOS Devkit Client and Server under open source licenses Drivers for Windows are provided by Valve and AMD but Valve does not provide support for them During the first few days of release Newell himself directly delivered some of the first Steam Deck units to residents in the Seattle area br Due to its popularity some pre order purchasers were informed that later shipments of the GB model and GB NVMe models would be in Q and the GB NVMe model by Q Valve informed pre purchasers in November that due to the ongoing global chip shortage the device would fail to ship by December and instead would ship in February retaining the same order for delivery based on pre order placement br By June Valve stated they were able to double the number of Steam Decks shipping out each week helping to meet the initial reservations and by August Valve s production was outpacing expectations allowing them to send out Steam Decks to consumers that were originally anticipated to ship in the final quarter of the year Valve was able to fulfill all reservations by October opening the Steam Deck to purchase without reservation though Valve tentatively will return to a reservation system should demand be too high br In December the Steam Deck was officially released for sale in Asia br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br The initial reaction to the announcement of the Steam Deck was positive Epic Games Tim Sweeney and Xbox Game Studios Phil Spencer complimented Valve on the Steam Deck with Sweeney calling it an amazing move by Valve Spencer congratulated Valve on getting so many of us excited to be able to take our games with us wherever we decide to play br Many outlets compared the unit to that of the Nintendo Switch generally recognized as the first true hybrid video game console Valve stated that they did not really consider the Switch in designing the Deck as they tried to make all the decisions really in Steam Deck that targeted that audience and that served the customers that were already having a good time interacting with the games that are on that platform on our platform and that by happenstance came out with a device that was similar in function to the Switch The Verge stated that generally the Steam Deck was a more powerful machine compared to the Switch but that power came with a tradeoff in battery life which was greater with the Switch Further The Verge recognized that the specifications of the Deck were more comparable to the power of the consoles of the eighth generation like the Xbox One and PlayStation though using more recent compute micro and graphics architectures than that which powered those older systems Kotaku stated that while the Deck and Switch may be similar in concept the two were not competing devices due to their target demographics with the Switch aimed more at a broad audience machine while the Deck was geared towards more hardcore gamers Digital Foundry noted that while the Deck s hardware may be more powerful game developers only developing games for the Windows operating system are not necessarily able to get low level access to the CPU GPU as developers working on the Switch due to the Proton compatibility layer br One of the main criticisms of the Steam Deck highlighted by multiple reviewers has been its battery life Matt Hanson writing for TechRadar stated the battery life of the Steam Deck is pretty poor with it just about managing one and a half hours while playing God of War That s going to upset a lot of people who may have been planning on using the Steam Deck for long flights for example and that it certainly makes this portable gaming system feel less well portable Matt Miller of Game Informer called the device s battery life punishingly low Steve Hogarty wrote in The Independent that The battery life is by far the Steam deck s biggest weakness The handheld PC chugs through juice like it s going out of fashion with some graphically demanding games draining a full charge in as little as two hours of playtime Seth G Macy wrote for IGN in very similar terms saying Beyond that limitation the biggest most deflating issue I ve had has been battery life It s all over the place and probably the biggest reality check when it comes to realizing the dream of truly untethered PC gaming Richard Leadbetter of Eurogamer said he can t help but feel that elements like fan noise and battery life can only be resolved with a revised processor on a more efficient process node br br br Sales br The research firm Omdia reported that the Steam Deck sold million units in Their report estimated that the Steam Deck would pass million units sold since its launch sometime during Through and most of the Deck had been one of the most popular purchases on the Steam storefront Valve stated in November that they had sold multiple millions of the Steam Deck br br br See also br Asus ROG
