attempts to harness the power of the parasitic Metroid creatures br Metroid combines the platforming of Super Mario Bros and the exploration of The Legend of Zelda with a science fiction setting and an emphasis on nonlinear gameplay Most Metroid games are side scrolling while the D games use a first person perspective Players battle hostile alien enemies and obtain power ups as they progress through the game world The series is known for its isolated atmosphere featuring few non player characters br The first Metroid was developed by Nintendo R D and released on the Nintendo Entertainment

Castlevania Symphony of the Night the early Metroid games defined the Metroidvania subgenre inspiring other games with continuous explorable side scrolling levels Samus was one of the first prominent female video game characters br br br Gameplay br The Metroid series contains gameplay elements from shooter platformer adventure survival and sometimes first person games The series is notable for its non linear progression and solitary exploration format where the player only controls Samus Aran with few or no other characters to interact with The player gains items and power ups for Samus s cybernetic suit primarily through exploration and occasionally by defeating alien creatures through real time combat with the suit s arm cannon Many such upgrades enable further avenues of exploration A recurring upgrade is the Morph Ball which allows Samus to curl into a ball roll into tight places and plant bombs br The classic series consists of D side scrollers while the Metroid Prime series uses a first person perspective and first person shooter mechanics The Other M made use of a third person shooter format br The original Metroid was influenced by two other major Nintendo franchises Mario from which it borrowed extensive areas of platform jumping and The Legend of Zelda from which it borrowed non linear exploration Metroid differed in its atmosphere of solitude and foreboding Metroid was also one of the first video games to feature an exploration to the left as well as the right and backtracking to already explored areas to search for secret items and paths Since the late s the term Metroidvania has been applied to this format br br br Audio br The Metroid series has been noted and praised for its unique style of video game music Hirokazu Hip Tanaka composer of the original Metroid has said he wanted to make a score that made players feel like they were encountering a living creature and had no distinction between music and sound effects The only time the main Metroid theme was heard was after Mother Brain is defeated this is intended to give the player a catharsis At all other times no melodies are present in the game The composer of Super Metroid Kenji Yamamoto came up with some themes by humming to himself while riding his motorcycle to work He was asked to compose the music for Metroid Prime to reinforce the series continuity Metroid Prime s Dolby Pro Logic II surround sound was mixed by a member of Dolby br Developers from Retro Studios noted how the MB memory budget for all sound effects of a level in Metroid Prime was crucial in producing a quality soundtrack as each sound had to be of high quality to be included Yamamoto used heavy drums piano voiced chants clangs of pipes and electric guitar Metroid Prime Corruption took advantage of the increased RAM in the Wii allowing for higher quality audio samples Kenji Yamamoto who composed the music for Super Metroid and the Prime trilogy copied the musical design of the original Metroid in Metroid Prime by keeping the music and themes dark and scary until the very end when uplifting music is played during the credits br br br Plot br br br Setting br The Metroid franchise takes place in a science fiction setting where humanity is shown to be a part of a spacefaring sovereignty known as the Galactic Federation Other races are both a part of the Federation as well as close allies the most prolific being the Chozo an avian species possessing advanced technology and skills in bioengineering The mutual nemesis of the Federation and the Chozo are the Space Pirates a villainous interstellar cabal comprising multiple alien races of disreputable nature that all refuse to abide to the Galactic Federation s rule They are led by the dragon like warlord Ridley and plot to develop weapons of mass destruction from hazardous life forms and materials to destroy the Federation and secure galactic dominance br The eponymous Metroids are a species of predatory jellyfish like organisms that feed on an undetectable life energy found in all living creatures Biological weapons the Metroids were engineered by the Chozo to eradicate a parasitic shapeshifting virus known as the X that threatened their civilization While the Metroids succeeded in stopping the X they became a danger to the Chozo themselves when they developed the ability to evolve into different and far deadlier forms Most of the games center around the efforts of various organizations including the Space Pirates the Galactic Federation and rogue members of the Chozo race to weaponize the Metroids and the subsequent conflicts they cause br br br Story br br Metroid follows the adventures of the bounty hunter Samus Aran who battles the Space Pirates and the Metroids Samus was raised by the Chozo after her parents were killed by a Space Pirate raid led by Ridley She serves in the military of the Galactic Federation before departing and beginning work as a bounty hunter while facing the forces of Ridley and Mother Brain br In the original Metroid Samus travels to the planet Zebes to stop the Space Pirates from using the Metroids to create biological weapons She defeats the cybernetic lifeform Mother Brain as well as Ridley and his fellow Space Pirate leader Kraid br The Metroid Prime series is set between Metroid and Metroid II Return of Samus and chronicles Samus conflicts with a malignant radioactive substance named Phazon In Metroid Prime Samus travels to Tallon IV to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting a Phazon infused meteor that has poisoned the local ecosystem After

Metroid Prime Hunters which is unconnected to the Phazon storyline sees Samus respond to a distress call to the Alimbic Cluster Other bounty hunters respond to the call and after conflicting amongst themselves they all ultimately band together to fight against a creature named Gorea In Metroid Prime Echoes Samus explores the planet Aether which is suffering from a Phazon outbreak The Phazon has

Mother Brain in retaliation and escapes as Zebes explodes exterminating her old enemies for good br In Metroid Other M set after Super Metroid Samus investigates the Bottle Ship a derelict scientific research station with a Galactic Federation platoon led by her former commanding officer Adam Malkovich They team up against many bioweapons created by a Federation science group including clones of creatures Samus faced on Zebes like Ridley and the Metroids A revived Mother Brain now occupying a humanoid body supplied to her by the Federation takes control of the Metroids and attempts to unleash them upon the Federation but is stopped by Samus at the cost of Adam s life Afterward Samus encounters and kills the ethereal entity Phantoon and sets the Bottle Ship to self destruct In Metroid Fusion Samus accompanies a team of scientists to SR where she has her first encounter with the X parasites when the species reappears in the absence of the Metroids The X overruns a scientific research station in the planet s orbit assimilating and imitating many creatures being studied on board Samus is infected by one but is saved using a vaccine made from the baby Metroid s cells She discovers that the Federation has been cloning Metroids in secret and sets the space station on a collision with SR to destroy the X parasites Metroid Dread continues where Fusion left off with the Federation dispatching a squadron of advanced automatons known as E M M I to investigate the planet ZDR where X parasites have been sighted Samus is sent to the planet herself after contact is lost
