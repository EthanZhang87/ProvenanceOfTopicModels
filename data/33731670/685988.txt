Game Park was a South Korean company that was founded in and went bankrupt in March It is responsible for creating the GP and the never released XGP GamePark Holdings was founded by former employees of Game Park in br br br Foundation br Founded in in South Korea Game Park entered the industry using government money At the time games in Korea were only made for PCs and Arcade There was a law established after World War II that forbid importation of Japanese electronics Some clones of Japanese consoles such as the Sega Saturn cloned by Samsung and Nintendo cloned by Hyundai were holders of minor market shares In a place where most games ran on the PC a small place resided for video game consoles To make changes the South Korean government decided to fund a company that would create a console to compete against the monopolized Japanese market A contest was held and Game Park was the winning company Game Park was set to create the first portable video game system from Korea br The GP Game Park bit their first system was then being designed Several iterations of it were developed including a metallic look and a style issued from the original Game Boy design and a flat panel with a screen on the upper part and buttons on the lower part Those systems were shown at the Tokyo Game Show but failed to catch attention with their inferior hardware and games After five years of development Game Park opted for a more plastic look a lot like the Game Boy Advance Game Park s new handheld also had a major internal hardware upgrade making it more powerful than the GBA br br br Launch br The GP originally launched in November in Korea exclusively Game Park had opted for a narrow area market approach so they could better handle the production costs The result was small success in Korea br Game Park did make an error paying a large amount of money to port PlayStation games to their consoles The porting was handled by Korean developers which had never seen a PlayStation before because of its interdiction in Korea It was very difficult for them to import games and it ended up that only one ported game was made Princess Maker a simulation so complicated it was never translated One had to speak Japanese to play it well br Initially the GP launched with a inch screen buttons shoulder buttons function buttons and integrated speakers for stereo sound It is almost physically the same as the GBA except for a bigger screen higher quality speakers and more ergonomic handling br br br Surprising market br Though the GP was planned to be a gaming console its game selection was not sufficient in quality or quantity to truly compete against the Game Boy Advance One of its advantage was that in Korea no Japanese electronics were allowed the Game Boy Advance included On January however Korea finally allowed imports of Japanese electronics The system s success hinged on being an open source handheld attractive to independent developers and capable of supporting video and audio playback br br br GP Variants br br br GP FLU br br The GP FLU Front Lit Unit is a GP which has been modified to include a front light much like the Game Boy Advance SP The big difference however is that the GP FLU has exactly the same mold buttons etc as the GP unlike the completely redesigned Game Boy Advance SP This reduced the cost of the modification This system was released in Korea exclusively again in br The front light can be switched off to save battery power br br br GP BLU br The GP BLU standing for Back Lit Unit was another iteration of the GP the equivalent of the brighter GBA SP again having nothing changed in appearance except for a now back lit screen much better than the FLU The BLU gave players a very bright and colorful screen This unit was introduced in and later that year they even released it in Italy France United Kingdom and Spain br A problem is that without the back light the screen looks very dark and it s hard to see the image so the backlight must run continuously except when it s not necessary to look at the screen for example when using the console as an MP player br br br Imports br The system has been subject to much importation due largely to the fact the operating system on it features both Korean and English support even though it was exclusively sold in Korea for many years br br br Competition br In the Game Park line still was not released in Europe or North America br Team the developer of Worms offered to port their games directly on the GP for free Although most companies demanded financial support Team only asked for two GP units to test their games Game Park refused for currently unknown reasons br In July GP News a French news web site for the GP took a personal initiative to show and publicize the GP at the Japan Expo in France Game Park refused to fund the site which would have helped give the GP a publicity boost br At the Game Convention event in Germany in August the GP was announced with a European launch for Holiday Numerous distributors to sell the system as well as the first editors of European games to start development were contacted br The company in charge of distributing the GP Mitsui a well known company in Japan abandoned Game Park for a bigger company Sony Mitsui then was in charge of distributing the Sony PSP in Europe after having no communication from Game Park br br br Today br The GP knew a small success in Europe North America never saw the GP The GP was sold in the Americas through web stores but has become increasingly rare br In early there was an internal disagreement in Game Park about where to take the company Some former employees split off to form GamePark Holdings which successfully released the GP X handheld console in November and released the GP X Wiz in April br In the original Game Park officially announced the XGP the successor to their GP They also announced the XGP Mini a smaller version of the XGP with half the RAM Later on they announced the XGP Kids a redesign of the GP featuring the same hardware at a lower price for younger players br None of these consoles were actually released and in March Game Park filed for bankruptcy Gamepark s official website is currently unavailable and was previously replaced by a website for a shoe store before it was taken down br br br br br br External links br br
