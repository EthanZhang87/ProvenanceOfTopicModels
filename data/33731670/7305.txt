new game systems were based on General Instrument s Pong on a chip General Instrument had underestimated demand resulting in severe shortages However Coleco was one of the first to place an order and therefore one of the few companies to receive the full order Though dedicated game consoles did not last long on the market their early order enabled Coleco to break even br br br Late s handheld

Greenberg son of Leonard Greenberg and nephew of Arnold Greenberg left Microsoft where he had been working as a program developer at the time to assist in Coleco s entry into this market Coleco s strategy was to introduce the Coleco Adam home computer both as a stand alone system and as an expansion module to the ColecoVision The effort failed in part because Adams were often unreliable due to being released with fatal bugs and in part because the computer s release coincided with the home computer industry crashing Coleco withdrew from electronics early in br br br Cabbage Patch Kids br In
