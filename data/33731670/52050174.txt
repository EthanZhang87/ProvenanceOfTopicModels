classic Nintendo Entertainment System and Nintendo Famicom controllers available exclusively to individuals with an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription The Famicom variants were only available to Nintendo Switch Online members in Japan These variants were designed to be used specifically with the library of classic Nintendo titles available through the Nintendo Switch Online service as well as with select modern Switch titles Both are notable for heavily deviating from the normal Joy Con design instead being taller and more rectangular in shape having fewer buttons than standard Joy Con and in the case of the Famicom variants featuring a working microphone in the right controller br br Notes br br Not all colors or L R variants are available in all regions br br br Features br The feature set of the Joy Con was partially inspired by feedback from players using the Wii Remote according to Nintendo s Shinya Takahashi After releasing games that heavily used the Wii Remote with the Wii such as Wii Sports and Wii Fit players had asked for different design features such as having a smaller form factor or being able to be strapped to a part of the body Nintendo envisioned what benefits towards innovative design and gameplay could come from a smaller form factor which led to the idea of a console that could be portable controlled through these smaller controllers This became the fundamental principle of the Switch and directly into the Joy Con design br Both controllers contain a clickable analog stick four face buttons two top buttons two side buttons accessible when detached which become shoulder buttons when held horizontally and designated as SL and SR a or button a sync button and player indicator lights Joy Con L contains directional buttons a button top buttons designated as L and ZL and a screenshot button which enables the player to upload screenshots to social media In an update released on October the screenshot button is also able to record up to seconds of gameplay in select games when held down for a second Joy Con R contains A B X and Y buttons a button top buttons designated as R and ZR and a Home button br Each Joy Con contains an accelerometer and gyroscope which can be used for motion tracking Games can support using the Joy Con for pointing controls similar to the Wii Remote while detached without the need of a sensor bar Joy Con R contains an infrared depth tracking sensor which can read objects and motions held in front of it as an example of its functionality Nintendo stated that the sensor could distinguish between the hand shapes of rock paper scissors Joy Con R also contains a near field communication reader for use with Amiibo br The Joy Con contain a haptic feedback engine known as HD Rumble which was developed in partnership with Immersion Corporation Nintendo stated that the system could generate fine tactile feedback such as the sensation of individual ice cubes and water in a glass br br br Other platforms br It was discovered shortly after public release that Joy Con can connect to and be used with other Bluetooth enabled personal computers and mobile devices Official Joy Con support was also added to iPhones and iPads as part of the iOS and iPadOS updates respectively br br br Reception br br br Technical issues br Prior to the public release of Nintendo Switch various video gaming websites reported that the controllers most commonly the Joy Con L were susceptible to connection losses when used wirelessly It was initially unknown whether these problems were the result of an interference issue or caused by the pre launch software on review units A Nintendo spokesperson stated to Polygon that the company would continue to monitor the performance of Nintendo Switch hardware and software and make improvements when necessary The company posted guidance on its support website for minimizing Bluetooth signal interference including recommendations that the Switch console be placed away from other wireless enabled devices On March Nintendo confirmed that the interference issues were caused by a manufacturing variant in a small number of Joy Con from early production runs and that the company would allow owners to send in their affected Joy Con for repairs free of charge br On launch it was reported that the wrist strap attachments for the Joy Con were hard to detach from the controllers It was also reported that a wrist strap could easily be attached to the Joy Con incorrectly and become difficult to remove br One of the more common issues to be found with the Joy Con is joystick drift This issue occurs when dust or other small particles come in contact with the internal sensors of the analog stick A common remedy for this issue is to apply compressed air or contact cleaner under the rubber skirt of the joystick Nintendo repairs this issue for free if under warranty but the cost of repair for an out of warranty Joy Con could be over United States dollars according to many reports on the topic The high price of repair leads many to buy an entirely new Joy Con as they only cost slightly more than a repair a single being and a set of two In response to increased complaints and potential legal action for the drift issue Nintendo stated that they were aware of the frequent reports but did not offer immediate advice outside of contacting their technical support lines On July three days after the filing of a class action lawsuit an internal Nintendo memo was leaked the memo instructed the firm s customer service employees in North America to start offering repairs for drifting Joy Con controllers for free regardless of warranty status br Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa issued a public apology from the company for the drift problem as part of an investors meeting in June stating We apologize for any inconvenience caused to our customers regarding Joy Con controllers We are continuing to improve our products but could not comment further due to ongoing legal cases related to the controllers br With the release of the OLED revision of the Switch in October Nintendo said that the new Joy Con design should reduce the drift problem but they did not expect that they could ever eliminate the drift as it is an issue related to wear from long term usage The new design of the joysticks in the OLED Joy Con were made to reduce how much wear occurs to make them more durable but the company still anticipates drifting could still occur br br br Legal issues br br br Patent challenge br In August Los Angeles based tablet peripheral manufacturer Gamevice filed a lawsuit against Nintendo in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging that the design of the Joy Con controllers conflicts with its patent on the design for the Wikipad an Android based gaming device that also features a tablet with a detachable controller The lawsuit sought damages on existing Switch sales and banning further sales of the console The lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed by Gamevice on October br However in March Gamevice initiated a second patent infringement lawsuit on Nintendo related to a different set of patents Gamevice also sought action through the United States International Trade Commission related to patent infringement under Section of the Tariff Act of and was seeking to block imports of the Switch into the United States br br br Joy Con drift lawsuits br Two class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in July and September over the Joy Con drift issue The first suit alleges that Nintendo is well aware of the defect but does not disclose the defect and routinely refuses to repair the joysticks without charge the second suit alleges that the Joy Con controllers are defective It asserts claims for breach of warranty fraud and violations of numerous state consumer protection statutes The court refused to dismiss the suits and as of October are currently under arbitration hearings br Two additional class action lawsuits were filed in October and November in the United States respectively in the Northern California District Court and in the Western Washington District Court Both suits allege Nintendo of having defective manufacturing processes for the Joy Con even after the company apologized for the problem as the primary clients in both cases has purchased multiple Joy Con but found the drift occurred over time in each set purchased At least one of the lawsuits was dismissed in February as the judge ruled that the EULA for the Nintendo Switch required users to go through arbitration instead of lawsuits to resolve matters br The French consumer group UFC Que Choisir filed a lawsuit against Nintendo in September alleging that the Joy Con were designed with planned obsolescence intended to fail or break due to the drift issue and other factors The suit seeks to compel Nintendo to change its manufacturing process to improve the durability of the Joy Con br A consortium of nine European consumer organizations requested consumers inform them on Joy Con drift issues in December as they negotiated with Nintendo on how to resolve the matters in that region The organizations stated that they would plan legal action if they could not come to an agreement with Nintendo The European Consumer Organisation BEUC which represents consumers groups in the region also urged the European Commission to investigate the Joy Con drift issue in January
