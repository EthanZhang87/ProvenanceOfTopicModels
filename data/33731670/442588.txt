id: 442588
Mario Party is a party video game series featuring characters from the Mario franchise in which up to four local players or computer controlled characters called CPUs compete in a board game interspersed with minigames The games are currently developed by NDcube and published by Nintendo being previously developed by Hudson Soft The series is known for its party game elements including the often unpredictable multiplayer modes that allow play with up to four and sometimes eight human players or CPUs br After the development of Mario Party several of Hudson Soft s key designers left to work for Nintendo subsidiary NDcube developers of Wii Party Starting in with Mario Party NDcube has taken over development of the series from Hudson Soft The first instalment in the series on the Nintendo Switch Super Mario Party was released on October br The series received generally favorable reception in the beginning but as the series has progressed the reception has become more mixed The series holds the record for the longest running minigame series As of December Nintendo reported cumulative worldwide sales of million game copies in the Mario Party franchise br br br Gameplay br Over the course of the Mario Party series gameplay has changed to suit the technology of the hardware There are several game modes available in each of the games each of which provides its own rules and challenges br br br Party Mode br br Every game in the main series has a standard Party Mode in which up to four players play through a board trying to collect as many stars as possible In every turn each player rolls a die Dice Block and progresses on the board which usually has branching paths Coins are primarily earned by performing well in a minigame played at the end of each turn On most boards players earn stars by reaching a star space and purchasing a star for a certain amount of coins The star space appears randomly on one of several pre determined locations and moves every time a star is purchased usually occupying a blue space On some boards the star location is fixed br Every Mario Party game contains at least to minigames with a few different types Four player games are a free for all in which players compete individually In vs and vs minigames players compete as two groups cooperating to win even though they are still competing individually in the main game Some minigames in Mario Party are player co op even though it doesn t say it In most situations winners earn ten coins each br Battle minigames first appeared in Mario Party These games are like the four player games but instead of winners earning ten coins each each player contributes a randomly selected number of coins or all coins if the player falls short of the pot amount The winner of the minigame receives approximately of the pot the second place winner receives the other and a random player occasionally gets coins left over from rounding br Duel minigames debuted in Mario Party and were omitted in Mario Party although the story minigames are all duels but return again in Mario Party Duel games pit two players against each other In Party Mode one player initiates the duel wagering coins or even a star against another player The winner of the duel receives all coins or stars wagered Starting with Mario Party the player no longer chooses the wager in a duel rather the duel takes place and the prize to the winner if any is randomly determined br Bowser minigames are introduced in Mario Party in which players try to avoid being burned by Bowser s fire breath if they lose When this happens players must give up coins stars or items In Mario Party a single player version of the games were introduced and only one person can play br Mario Party introduced a new set of Bowser Jr related minigames In these minigames Bowser Jr challenges two players to compete in a minigame to battle him If they successfully defeat him both players will receive five Mini Stars If not then Bowser Jr will take five from each player br Mario Party also introduced a car mechanic In Mario Party and Mario Party every player navigates the board in a car rather than move independently of one another Mario Party has a lesser focus on strategy and its minigames do not impact the board game in ways that the previous Mario Party games did Critics heavily censured the car mechanic Destructoid noted An over reliance on random chance over strategy can quickly derail the experience when things go awry at the worst possible time The car mechanic was kept in Mario Party although Super Mario Party finally lets players move individually on the board again br In most Mario Party games at the end of a board game bonus stars can be awarded to players Three specific stars are awarded in the first six games All later games have six possible bonus stars but only three of those stars are awarded per game These stars add to the player s overall total If there s a tie in coins and stars then a Dice Block tiebreaker will determine the game s final ranking br br br Minigame modes br In addition to Party Mode every Mario Party has a minigame mode in which minigames are played without the board game Minigame modes vary from game to game but later games have many different variations In one such example from Mario Party each player tries to fill a board with as many spaces as possible in his or her colour by winning minigames in Mini Game Wars In Mario Party and onward there is one game in Minigame mode intended for single player br br br Playable characters br br br Available in all games br The following characters appear in all twelve console Mario Party games and except where noted all five handheld instalments br br Mario br Luigi br Princess Peach br Yoshi br Wario except Advance br The first four games also add Donkey Kong to this roster In Mario Party he is relegated to the Super Duel Mode and he was omitted from subsequent games as a playable character until Mario Party br br br Mario Party onwards br Princess Daisy except Advance br Waluigi except Advance br br br Mario Party onwards br Rosalina br The default sorting is by first appearance then by number of appearances For alphabetical order click on Character br A yellow tick Y means that the character is an unlockable character and is not unlocked from the start br br br Home console games br These characters were included or excluded in home console releases starting with Mario Party br br br Handheld console games br These characters were included or excluded in portable console releases starting with Mario Party DS br br br Games br br br Main series br br br Mario Party br br Mario Party is the first in the series It was released in and for the Nintendo Its roster of playable characters includes Mario Luigi Princess Peach Donkey Kong referred to as DK in game Yoshi and Wario It features minigames ten of which are single player only Mario Party s standard game mode Party Mode lets up to four players play on a board interspersed with minigames The game features eight different boards with varying difficulties It is hosted by Toad who guides the characters on their journeys throughout each board br In addition to the standard Party Mode the game also features a single player mode called Mini Game Island where the player s goal is to navigate an island and beat all minigames as supplied The player starts with four lives and loses a life every time they fail at a minigame Winning a minigame gives the player coins and collecting coins grants the player one additional life Mario Party also features Rumble Pak support which lets players know when their turn has started br Upon completing Mini Game Island a Bumper Ball Maze is awarded a single player minigame playable in the Mini Game House The player can unlock two additional Bumper Ball Mazes by completing all minigames in Mini Game Island and respectively setting new time records in the first two Bumper Ball Mazes br Mario Party received praise for its unique party and social elements however IGN criticized the slow pacing of the game and the lack of enjoyment when played alone GameSpot said The games that are enjoyable to play in multi player are nowhere near as good in the single player mode Really it s that multi player competitive spark of screaming at and or cheering for your friends that injects life into these often simple little games and without it they re just simple little games br br br Mario Party br br Mario Party is the sequel to Mario Party and was released in and for the Nintendo While Mario Party is similar to the original game it introduced a variety of new gameplay elements such as collectible items that players can buy from item shops and three new minigame types Battle Item and Duel Toad returns as the host in Mario Party The game also has more minigames than the original game with a total of minigames or if one counts the different courses in some of the minigames br Mario Party features the same characters as the original game with no additions however each character dresses according to the theme of the board Mario Party is the only Mario Party game where this occurs Mario Party does not reuse any of the original game s boards but does have references to them and reuses some of their gimmicks in the new boards br Mario Party features a mode called Mini Game Land where players can buy minigames that the player can play freely from a tree character called Woody br GameSpot praised Mario Party s minigames noting that they were a lot more fun than those of the first game IGN noted that the game is more of the same and said that the game might not be worth its price unless the buyer considers themselves a Mario Party fanatic IGN rated the game a out of further noting that the sequel was better than the original but that it did not offer enough new to warrant a higher score It recommended the game only to those who did not own the original br br br Mario Party br br Mario Party was released in and for the Nintendo It features the same cast of playable characters as the previous two games with the addition of Princess Daisy and Waluigi The most notable difference in this game compared to the previous two games in the series is that each player can hold up to three items instead of only one It also has minigames compared to Mario Party s br Mario Party s story revolves around a new character called the Millennium Star who replaces Toad as the host Like Mario Party the game features all new boards with some boards referencing the boards of the previous game and reusing their gimmicks Mario Party is also the first game in the series to feature a single player story campaign br The game s story mode features battle royal boards and duel boards where players fight one another for items called Star Stamps br Like Mario Party IGN criticized Mario Party for not having enough new content It also criticized the game s new story mode noting that the player was forced to watch computer controlled opponents for too long and too often even while they were playing minigames on their own It also noted that moving around the board in this mode quickly became tedious and boring The review author further asserted I think it d be better be classified as a tutorial mode GameSpot noted While pure innovation may not be king in the Mario Party world Hudson s dedication to solid addictive puzzle gaming that makes for a wholly enjoyable multiplayer experience is apparent br HonestGamers criticized the game s boards noting They re just not much fun It further explained Some of them are to be fair It also criticized the game s options and menus stating that it is difficult to even begin a new game Additionally it censured the game s down to the wire games stating it s almost impossible to keep stars you win unless you re guarding them very carefully It further explained that mostly a player s threat is not their human opponents but rather the computer controlled players describing how computer controlled opponents will quickly steal the player s stars after they get them br br br Mario Party br br Mario Party is the first game in the series to appear on a console other than the Nintendo Mario Party was released for the GameCube in Mario Party features the same roster of playable characters as Mario Party and does not feature any new playable characters It does however feature a new team battle system that allows players to team up in pairs in Party Mode the standard game mode of the series This game was the last game to feature Donkey Kong as a playable character up until Mario Party for the Wii U Instead of the Millennium Star Mario Party features multiple hosts including Toad and a Koopa Troopa The game also featured new minigames br Mario Party is the first Mario Party game to include side collectibles which are in the form of presents It also introduces the ability for players to create their own custom minigame packs Elements introduced in the previous game also return such as the ability for players to team up in Party Mode and the ability to hold up to three items at a time br Mario Party is also the first game in the series to feature boards fully rendered in D although the navigational board space layout remained D until Mario Party br As usual GameSpot praised the minigames of Mario Party It called the game arguably the most accomplished entry in the series yet while further noting While more accomplished gamers may find some of the minigames too simplistic this accessibility ensures that Mario s party is one that just about anyone can enjoy It also mentioned the improved graphics of the game while further noting that the character models of the game were more simplified compared to their counterparts in Super Smash Bros Melee released about a year before Mario Party Game Revolution also noted the game s improved visuals while explaining that they were not representative of what the GameCube can achieve and criticized the game s textures noting that they were not greatly detailed Game Revolution did however praise its happy music but criticized the minigames saying none really stand out IGN however praised the improved visuals of the game and noted Mario Party is exactly how you would envision it on GameCube all new mini games and better visuals IGN also called the game an absolute must rent if you have a few friends over for the weekend and definitely an everybody title br br br Mario Party br br Mario Party was released in for the GameCube It features the same playable character roster as the previous two instalments with the exclusion of Donkey Kong and addition of Toad Boo and Koopa Kid Rather than Mario Party s large number of hosts Mario Party features the Star Spirits known as the Star Guards in this game who first appeared in the Paper Mario for the Nintendo The game also features new minigames br One of the most major changes that Mario Party made to the series was replacing collectible items with capsules called orbs in later games which players receive from a capsule machine a talking robot vending machine that gives the player passing it a random capsule at no charge of coins on the board In addition to giving the player who uses it an advantage over the other players capsules can also allow the player to set up traps for other players by throwing them at a space in front of them These traps include forcing the player who lands on the capsule space to only be able to roll numbers from one to five on the Dice Block or forcing them to move ten spaces forward on the board br Mario Party also introduces a new mode Super Duel Mode This mode is a one versus one battle mode where two players face off against each other using custom assembled vehicles called machines in game In this mode players buy machine parts using points awarded by playing minigames in either Party Mode or Minigame Mode and build battle machines to use in different tournaments There are a total of different parts that can be used to customize a vehicle To unlock all the parts the player must play all the tournaments and beat certain opponents br IGN praised the multiplayer elements of the game as usual but criticized its spotty single player mode It called it the perfect drinking game for college dorms and at the same time a great game for kids to enjoy with their siblings It called Mario Party likely as good as mini game party games get br GameSpot criticized how the game s graphics had not been improved from the previous game in the series and said the boards are looking a little bland with some inconsistent texture quality It further noted The minigames while not terribly visually enticing tend to do their jobs well enough without slowdown or glaring visual faults It also criticized the voice work for while generally fitting the cheery tone of the game being largely recycled from Mario Party It also criticized its music that it noted was almost painfully cheery tunes that are basically riffs from a few classic Super Mario Bros themes GameSpot said that it was hard to recommend the game to owners of the previous game in the series but recommended it to casual fans who had not already played a Mario Party game br Eurogamer called the game a mixed bag criticizing its music slow pace and lack of originality It noted that the game can be a laugh if played with the right group but also noted there are far better things to do with your time your GameCube and such marvelously entertaining friends saying Western gamers are quite right to ignore this Gaming Trend praised the replay value of the game but criticized the repetitive nature of the game br br br Mario Party br br Mario Party was released in and for the GameCube It is the first game in the series to make use of the GameCube s microphone peripheral that was packaged with the game It features the same cast of playable characters as the previous game with the addition of Toadette although she has to be unlocked by buying her for thirty stars in the Star Bank a place in the game where one player can trade stars for prizes and other valuables including new difficulty levels and rare minigames Mario Party features two new characters as its hosts Brighton and Twila who depict the sun and the moon respectively It also featured new minigames This marked the last appearance of the autoplay function where the game plays itself in Party Mode br Mario Party is famous for its introduction of a day night cycle system implemented for boards and minigames This is a concept that had previously only been seen in Horror Land a board in Mario Party Mario Party is the first and only game in the series to feature a day night cycle system for all boards and minigames br IGN noted that the graphics sound and minigames of the game are just good enough further explaining But when put together Mario Party still manages to generate that glee of unexpectedly trouncing your opponent because you re the only one who knew that you used more capsules and thus deserve another star GameSpot noted The fundamental formula isn t so different but it s different enough that even if you ve played all five previous Mario Party games there s still something new for you It further criticized the game s graphics comparing it to Mario Power Tennis which was released a month before Mario Party It further criticized the board designs noting While the board designs are new they re no more inventive in design than what we ve seen before and they certainly don t look any better It further criticized the game and its developer noting we can t shake the feeling that Hudson will continue riding the same graphical technology for as long as it can still sell copies br br br Mario Party br br Mario Party was released in and for the GameCube It was the series last instalment on the GameCube The microphone integration returns from the previous game and the game introduces a new mode that allows up to players to play together It features the same roster of playable characters with the exclusion of Koopa Kid and the addition of Birdo and Dry Bones as unlockable characters Toadette is now unlocked from the start Rather than the Mario Party s Brighton and Twila Toadsworth who first appeared in the GameCube game Super Mario Sunshine is the host of Mario Party The game also features new minigames br Former IGN author Matt Casamassina wrote in a review for Mario Party Mario Party is still entertaining but I d be a liar if I wrote that I m not growing bored with new iterations of the same old formula He further noted To its credit the title delivers some fun new boards and mini games and the multiplayer experience is as robust and enjoyable as ever He then went on to criticize the game s single player mode But it in contrast dishes out a worthless single player mode marred by tediously slow computer controlled character interactions And the overall presentation of the story cut scenes and real time achievements is only passable He called the game a decent sequel to an aging franchise noting the only people that should truly be interested in it are those dedicated to multiplayer parties Everybody else can either make due with last year s version or avoid the series altogether br Former GameSpot writer Ryan Davis criticized the game s lack of originality as he usually does when reviewing Mario Party games but he commended the game s new eight player multiplayer mode noting The addition of eight player minigames is really the only new feature worth considering buying the game for as the rest of the changes are token gestures So it s otherwise the same old Mario Party all over again He further declared this compulsive level of sameness is counterbalanced by the fact that besides the Mario Party series there are not a lot of other games like this on the GameCube these days or anywhere else for that matter br In its review of the game Nintendo World Report praised its support for up to eight players and large number of minigames but censured its relatively small roster of playable characters poor microphone implementation and the long waiting times when playing with computer controlled opponents br br br Mario Party br br Mario Party was the first Mario Party game for the Wii released in and It was also the last home console game in the series to be developed by Hudson Soft before NDcube took over the games development starting from the next game in the series The game features new minigames most of which utilize the motion control capabilities of the Wii Remote br Mario Party features all the characters from the last game with the addition of Blooper and Hammer Bro Players can also play as their Mii character in certain modes The game features new items called candies which replace capsules or orbs from the last three games in the series These items are found throughout the boards and can be collected by players to aid themselves or hinder the progress of opponents Positive effects range from getting to roll two dice blocks instead of one to getting to move to another player s board space Other candies may let players steal stars from opponents or change the position of other player characters on the board br The game s story revolves around a ringmaster named MC Ballyhoo and his talking hat Big Top After inviting Mario and his friends to a carnival called the Star Carnival Ballyhoo promises that whoever wins is crowned the Superstar and receives a year s supply of candy This begins the board games br Mario Party takes use of the Wii Remote s motion control features allowing the player to wave it point and shoot and more during minigames In addition to the standard Party Mode the game also features a single player mode called Star Battle Arena where the player can compete with a computer controlled character on boards and in minigames br Mario Party sold nearly nine million copies making it the eleventh best selling Wii game Despite the impressive sales numbers IGN and GameSpot criticized the game s lack of originality IGN lambasted the game citing the game s few changes from the last games in the series slow pace lacklustre single player mode and loose attention to detail It finally noted In spite of our issues with the game people who loved Mario Party will probably enjoy Mario Party too but we ve chosen not to reward Nintendo with an undeserved high score for a copy paste sequel br Similarly GameSpot said that the game s developer Hudson Soft had gotten a little too comfortable with Mario Party being the only persistent minigame series for years It further noted The fact that there are more interesting minigame collections out there now like Rayman Raving Rabbids puts that laziness in stark relief and makes it more difficult to tolerate If you ve got the patience to dig past the skill free board game portions of Mario Party there are some genuinely inventive minigames to be played The point though is that you shouldn t have to dig at all GameSpot also criticized the game s lacklustre presentation noting its garish color palette and stomping blaring marching band soundtrack It explained that the visual fidelity of the game had not been improved in the move from the GameCube and further noted in some ways it actually looks worse now It criticized the game s aliasing and how the game would not fill a widescreen display during gameplay instead using black borders further describing It s awkward and it s borderline embarrassing that a Nintendo published Wii game doesn t have full widescreen support br Eurogamer noted the game s many obvious missed opportunities criticizing the limitation of the Mii character and how it could only be played in a few game modes Like GameSpot Eurogamer criticized the lack of widescreen support lack of originality and poor motion controls Additionally it criticized the game s single player mode calling it so utterly wretched it scarcely warrants discussion further noting To add insult to injury you have to go through it twice to unlock the mere two extra characters Finally Eurogamer said Fun could be had here but even with the most forgiving group of friends it s going to be short lived br br br Mario Party br br Mario Party was released in and for the Wii It was the first game in the series to be developed by NDcube instead of Hudson Soft who developed all the previous Mario Party games The game s playable character roster consists of the same characters as in the previous game with the exclusion of Toadette Boo Dry Bones Blooper and Hammer Bro and the addition of Koopa Troopa Shy Guy and Magikoopa named Kamek in the PAL version of the game The game features new minigames br Replacing MC Ballyhoo and Big Top as the hosts of the game is Yellow Toad who hosts the board games and Blue Toad who hosts the minigames A green Toad also appears near the end of board games to initiate an event similar to the Last Five Turns Event from past Mario Party games br Mario Party also introduces the Mini Stars and Mini Ztars Mini Stars are small white stars that the characters need to obtain in order to advance on each board Mini Ztars are the counterpart to Mini Stars being small dark and purple stars that cause a player to lose as many Mini Stars as the amount of Mini Ztars they collected br The most notable feature that Mario Party introduced to the series was the car mechanic In Mario Party and Mario Party every player navigates the board in a car rather than move independently of one another Mario Party has a lesser focus on strategy and its minigames do not impact the board game in ways that the previous Mario Party games did Critics heavily censured the car mechanic Destructoid noted An over reliance on random chance over strategy can quickly derail the experience when things go awry at the worst possible time br In an interview with Nintendo Life Shuichiro Nishiya a game redirector from NDcube said in relation to the car mechanic In past instalments everyone would move separately through the board As a result the actions of the other players often didn t affect you You could just look at the TV screen when it was your turn and during the minigames He further noted In Mario Party though players move together in a car so each player s action will affect the others meaning you ll need to keep an eye on the TV screen br In spite of the infamous car mechanic IGN called Mario Party the best Mario Party since the series reached its heights in the early GameCube days further noting But throughout its many generations Mario Party has carried a fatal flaw In spite of your proficiency at mini games or penchant for board game strategy the Mario Party series is dictated by the dice roll Randomness which Mario Party flaunts with a particularly annoying brand of euphoric abandon ultimately ruins what could be a very good game br GameSpot once again criticized the lack of originality It also criticized one problematic minigame where the motion controls were fussy and needlessly complicated It complimented the game s minigames noting that they make the game entertaining for a few hours and there s enough content to make it worth coming back for more however it noted that it is highly preferable to play with friends due to the game s focus on luck rather than strategy GameSpot also criticized the game s single player story campaign describing it as not very engaging It noted that each game lasts for too long and that it was unfortunate that the player is forced to beat the single player mode to unlock the game s sixth board and two of the twelve playable characters It finally called the game a decent package with a lot of content even if the Story mode is something you ll wish you could avoid It then went on to say It s colorful good looking and fun with others but after so many games the appeal just isn t going to last for many people There s no denying that what Mario Party does it largely does well it s just that it s largely been doing it well for nine console games and two handheld games Once you ve spent a few hours with mates seen all the different boards and played all the minigames there s very little incentive to return Much like that high school reunion it is fun for a night but you won t have any hesitation about moving on br br br Mario Party br br Mario Party was released in for the Wii U It was the only Mario Party game for the system and most of the playable characters from the previous game return although Birdo Koopa Troopa Shy Guy and Magikoopa are absent The game does however introduce Rosalina Spike and Bowser playable in the Bowser Party mode as playable characters for the first time in the series and additionally re introduces Donkey Kong who had not been in a Mario Party game since Mario Party and Toadette The game also introduced two new modes Bowser Mode and amiibo Party It also re introduces the car mechanic from the previous game where players navigate the board together in a car rather than move individually as seen in older games in the series br In Mario Party the game s standard board game mode is called Mario Party In this mode players compete to get the most Mini Stars as in previous games In the game s new Bowser Party mode one player controls Bowser using the primary controller for the Wii U the Wii U GamePad and up to four other players control Mario and his friends using Wii Remotes In this mode Mini Stars are replaced by hearts which serve as the players health points The goal of the player playing as Bowser is to deplete the health of the players in Team Mario while the goal of the other players is to reach the Super Star at the end of the board with at least one player with at least one heart remaining If Bowser catches up to Team Mario every player has to play a randomly selected Bowser Battle minigame where the hearts of players on Team Mario are lost if they are hit by Bowser s attacks If Team Mario s players lose all their hearts Bowser wins br The game also introduces the amiibo Party mode In this mode up to four players can scan the amiibo for a character and play as that character on small boards Players compete for the most stars which can be bought with coins Rather than traditional characters the players control amiibo figures of the characters whose amiibo they scanned If a player does not own an amiibo figure they play as a cardboard cutout as a character instead br GameSpot and TrustedReviews criticized Mario Party for being too similar to the previous games in the series GameSpot further criticized the game s lack of strategy and cited that the game has an annoying habit of stealing stars away from whoever is in the lead explaining that this makes the any effort the player has put into the minigames largely moot It was also censured for keeping the car mechanic from the previous game Den of Geek criticized the game s new Bowser Party mode calling it basically a sprint to the finish line with no depth or complexity and one that is typically over in a handful of uneventful turns It praised the fun minigames of the standard mode Mario Party but further criticized the game saying it never matters whether you actually win or lose in any of the game modes noting that most of what the game offers is already unlocked from the start It noted that the game lacks inspiration and stated that despite the fun minigames everything else feels incredibly deflated and Bowser Party comes across as gimmicky and mundane other modes are restricted by amiibo and controller types and a clear everyone s a winner mentality strips away any sense of challenge that could have been had here br IGN criticized the new amiibo Party mode describing The integration of amiibo amounts to little more than constantly tapping the figures to a sensor in the corner of the GamePad You tap to roll tap to stop random spinners tap to use items You tap the GamePad a lot It also criticized the minigames infrequency noting that in the standard game mode Mario Party the players only get to play a minigame if one of them lands on a minigame board space further noting that these spaces are rare on the boards It did however praise the Bowser Party mode calling it Mario Party s greatest achievement and one of the best uses of the Wii U GamePad yet br Eurogamer noted the game s prudent motion controls but called the Amiibo implementation decidedly mixed noting that the boards are far less dynamic further explaining it s the same board repurposed slightly depending on which compatible figures you own they look different but are otherwise functionally similar However like IGN Eurogamer praised the Bowser Party mode and called it the unlikely champion of the Wii U s various uses of the GamePad in games Finally it said This is at least in the upper echelons of the series a little short of the Hudson Soft heyday maybe but better than every entry since the fifth and certainly superior to the anemic eighth entry and the pointless handheld versions br br br Super Mario Party br br Super Mario Party was released in for the Nintendo Switch The game features the largest roster of playable characters in any Mario Party game featuring nearly every character from Mario Party minus Spike with the addition of Dry Bones Goomba Boo Koopa Troopa Hammer Bro Shy Guy Bowser Jr Diddy Kong Pom Pom and Monty Mole Additionally Bowser who had only previously been playable in Mario Party s Bowser Party and amiibo Party modes is now playable in the standard Party Mode br Super Mario Party s most notable change is the removal of the car mechanic In this game players navigate the board individually like in past Mario Party instalments The game also introduces a new mode called Toad s Rec Room where players can pair up two Nintendo Switch units to form a single connected board to play minigames on br Super Mario Party also introduces online multiplayer for the first time in the series While the standard board games are restricted to the game s standard Party Mode players are able to play the game s minigames with other players either locally or online independent of the board games in the game s new Online Mario thon mode In this mode players compete in five randomly selected minigames aiming to get the highest score It also features leaderboards and a ranking system as well as rewards that the players can receive for playing the mode br Some sources criticized the game s lack of an online board game mode although others still praised the lack of the infamous car mechanic and the focus on traditional Mario Party gameplay Nearly three years after release a late patch has made the board game mode available for online play for the first time in the series br br br Super Mario Party Jamboree br br A new Mario Party game was revealed during the June Nintendo Direct It will contain boards two of which are returning from previous games minigames and an online player mode It is scheduled to release on October br br br Handheld console games br br br Mario Party Advance br br Mario Party Advance was released for the Game Boy Advance in It was the first Mario Party game for a handheld console and was the only Mario Party game for the Game Boy Advance It features four playable characters Mario Luigi Princess Peach and Yoshi The hosts of the game are Tumble Toad Professor Elvin Gadd and Toadette Its antagonists are Bowser and three of his children Blue Koopa Kid Green Koopa Kid and Red Koopa Kid br Its standard mode is Shroom City in which the player takes control of one of the playable characters and travels around the city Shroom City completing quests and collecting minigames and Gaddgets to play in other modes br br br Mario Party DS br br Mario Party DS was released in for the Nintendo DS It was the first and only Mario Party game for the Nintendo DS It was also the last game in the series overall to be developed by Hudson Soft It featured minigames many of which took use of the Nintendo DS s touchscreen microphone and unique dual screen capabilities in addition to traditional style minigames using the D pad and buttons The game features Mario Luigi Peach Daisy Wario Waluigi Yoshi and Toad as playable characters br IGN noted that it was honestly very difficult to get excited for yet another Mario Party even though it s the first time it s been made for the Nintendo DS system It noted that Mario Party DS is a solid multiplayer mini game experience with a lot of the flaws of the previous versions It further explained It doesn t do anything truly special than create a bunch of touch screen and microphone centric minigames and even then we ve seen variations of them in other DS titles but it at least comes together as a better title than the last console Mario Party design GameSpot praised the large number of minigames and their quality noting Typically a collection like this made for the Nintendo DS will give you or minigames This one has more than Remarkably despite that lofty number there aren t many duds It criticized the single player mode but described the multiplayer aspect of the game as an outright blast br br br Mario Party Island Tour br br Mario Party Island Tour was the first Mario Party game for the Nintendo DS released in and It features minigames many of which utilize the DS s touch screen and dual screen capabilities as well as the system s other unique features It features Mario Luigi Princess Peach Princess Daisy Wario Waluigi Yoshi Boo Toad and Bowser Jr as playable characters It was the first Mario Party game to feature Bowser Jr as a playable character br IGN criticized Mario Party Island Tour for its mostly bland minigames additionally noting a handful are just bad If you ve played a Mario Party game before you ll recognize that a majority of the games are based around returning ideas IGN said It cited that some of the game s minigames used the Nintendo DS s touchscreen effectively but rated the game out of for its mostly boring minigames unfortunate system jerking motion control br GameSpot said that many of the minigames do a good job of taking advantage of the DS s unique features in their design but noted there are still some stinkers in the mix Strictly luck based minigames turn up in the rotation frequently and they re not any fun GameSpot said It also cited the game s sluggish controls that hamper your ability to move well Finally it said It s not a perfect party by any means but some good design considerations better than average variety and always enjoyable Mario thematics put Mario Party Island Tour a few notches above your average video game bash in a box It rated the game out of br Nintendo Life said that winning minigames is inconsequential in the grand scheme of things It called the game s visuals satisfactory getting the job done without doing anything to wow It finally noted The Mario Party series isn t changing much and when it does it doesn t seem to be for the better The pieces of Island Tour that work the best are the ones sticking to the form established early in the series fun accessible mini games that don t over complicate things It s the game boards that need better ideas and the less is more approach would suit future instalments better The focus on luck swapping places at random and specific to this instalment the short length all conspire to hamper what could easily have been a much more enjoyable experience There s still a ton of rowdy multiplayer fun to be had but it s unfortunate that a whole portion of the game is so hit or miss br br br Mario Party Star Rush br br Mario Party Star Rush was the second Mario Party game for the Nintendo DS Released in and the game was the first Mario Party game on a handheld console to be compatible with amiibo figures The game features Mario Luigi Princess Peach Princess Daisy Wario Waluigi Yoshi Toad Toadette Rosalina Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong as playable characters Blue Toad Yellow Toad Red Toad and Green Toad are also playable in the Toad Scramble mode the standard game mode of Star Rush The Additionally Bowser Bowser Jr and Boo can be played as by tapping their amiibo figures in the Mario Shuffle mode The only character that is not available in the Mario Shuffle mode is Toadette Mario Party Star Rush has a total of minigames br In the game s main mode Toad Scramble up to four players start out with a Toad where their colour corresponds to each player The goal of the mode is to amass the most stars players can retrieve stars by placing first in the boss minigames Players can battle bosses by landing on the space in front of them on the board and every time a boss minigame is completed a new boss appears on the board at a different spot Up to five bosses may appear on a board br In the Mario Shuffle mode two players race across a linear one way board to a goal as amiibo figures The red team s goal is to reach the very right of the board while the blue team s goal is to reach the left side Players roll two dice each and when a player crosses an opponent s amiibo figure the player knocks it back to the start of the board Players can land on spaces that either make their figure continue moving farther on the board or move backwards If players do not have an amiibo figure a cardboard cut out of a character is used instead A total amount of six characters can be used each split into two teams of three The first team who makes it across the board to their goal wins the game br Star Rush also features five other game modes Coinathlon Balloon Bash Rhythm Recital Challenge Tower and Boo s Block Party In Coinathlon up to four players collect as many coins as they can in a set of three sixty second coin designated minigames In Balloon Bash up to four players collect coins and stars while rolling the Dice Block on a small board with or turns and minigames In Rhythm Recital up to four players cooperate and play classic Mario tunes by timing touchscreen taps button presses correctly In Challenge Tower a single player mode the player climbs a tower with LED spaces on it trying to hit the right colours and avoid Amp enemies And finally in the Boo s Block Party mode a puzzle game players spin the sides of numbered blocks to match them up for points Star Rush also features the Character Museum which lets players view characters and their biographies similar to the trophy system in the Super Smash Bros games br IGN criticized Mario Party Star Rush criticizing the slow pacing of the gameplay saying but Mario Party Star Rush s modes all start slow and never find ways to pick up the pace It further criticized the board game modes for unfolding nearly the same way every time It also mentioned the luck factor of the game noting almost everything here hinges on luck and there are few opportunities for sneaky plays to employ smart strategies to shift its competitive games in your favor A lot of them boil down to roll the dice and try to make the best of what s available on the board However it praised the improvements to the sluggish gameplay of the previous Mario Party games and also praised the wacky spirit of the minigames It did however end its review with After a few trips through Mario Party Star Rush s modes you ll have seen nearly everything it has to offer br Nintendo Life noted that Star Rush s modes and minigames are decent noting There are some enjoyable highlights some decent alternatives and one or two outright duds overall the positive inclusions outweigh the weak points It mentioned that there are a limited number of minigames in the standard mode Toad Scramble but noted they re some of the stronger examples in the game and the heat of the battle is rather addictive It also noted that Balloon Bash is the best mode for playing the broadest variety of minigames It did however explain that the Mario Shuffle mode feels like an odd misstep but praised the Boo s Block Party mode Finally it explained Mario Party Star Rush may not excel in many ways but it addresses some complaints from past entries and delivers some harmless entertainment br br br Compilation games br br br Mario Party The Top br br Mario Party The Top was the third Mario Party game for the Nintendo DS released in Unlike traditional Mario Party games The Top is a compilation of remade minigames originally featured in the previous ten home console games in the series It features Mario Luigi Princess Peach Princess Daisy Wario Waluigi Yoshi and Rosalina as playable characters The Top has the most minigames out of all games in the Mario Party series br The main game mode of The Top is Minigames where players can play all minigames individually outside of a board Its second mode Minigame Island is a single player mode where Toad is the host After the player selects their character they can choose a computer controlled teammate for two versus two minigames The game s third mode is Minigame Match which serves as the game s only board game mode It plays similarly to Balloon Bash from the previous instalment Star Rush It is a multiplayer mode where players travel around a small board and roll a Dice Block that determines their movement on the board In this mode players need to pop Star Balloons across the board collecting stars is vital to winning the game The Top s next game mode Championship Battles is one hosted by Toadette and has players battling other players in random minigames from a minigame pack a concept first introduced in Mario Party Whichever player receives the best of three or five rounds wins the mode The Top s final mode Decathlon has players play either five or ten minigames against other players The player earns points depending on how well they played the minigame rather than whether they won and the score in the minigame converts to points to the overall score in the mode br At the beginning of its review Nintendo Life said Just because a game has a great concept doesn t mean the end product will be the same It explained that The Top is an incredible idea on paper and cited that it is a joy to see the classic minigames return but explained the rest of the package nevertheless delivers a lacklustre experience It called it a blast to play the returning minigames but criticized the small amount of content and the low replay value It noted that the game accomplished remastering classic minigames with great results and called the initial time spent playing the game an awesome walk through nostalgia lane but criticized the rest of the game as a rushed project and noted that it fails to live up to its full potential Similarly Polygon explained that The Top goes hard on the minigames and light on everything else It criticized the Minigame Island mode for feeling like a random obligatory grind It noted that The Top does a very good thing by giving us tons of minigames to play but criticized the structure board game aspect of the game br br br Mario Party Superstars br br On June Nintendo announced Mario Party Superstars for the Nintendo Switch It is a compilation of classic mini games and five game boards stretching all the way back to the first Mario Party on Nintendo all remade with HD graphics It includes full online compatibility for playing with both friends and strangers The game was released on October br br br Arcade games br In addition to the home console games arcade games were also developed and released exclusively in Japan They typically retain the

br br Controversies br br br Mario Party N br In the original Mario Party game for the Nintendo some minigames required players to rotate the controller s analogue stick as fast as they could including one in which the player is challenged to wind up Fly Guy at the minigame house Some players used the palms of their hands rather than their thumbs to rotate the analogue stick As a result they would often endure blisters In an act of contrition Nintendo gave away free gaming gloves to the victims of these blisters Some wore away the stick because it was not very durable The analogue stick rotation has no longer been used since Mario Party The exceptions are the mini game in Mario Party in which the player only needs to rotate it once and the mini game in Mario Party in which players throw Bowser in a manner similar to Super Mario and do not need to use the palm of their hand to move the analogue stick Mario Party Island Tour resumed using these types of minigames because players can spin the Nintendo DS analogue stick safely In Mario Party Superstars since the game utilizes analog sticks again a disclaimer is placed on the rules screen for the minigames Tug o War and Cast Aways warning players to not use their palms to turn the stick to avoid hand injury and stick damage A similar warning appears for the Nintendo Switch Online version of Mario Party when starting the game br br br Mario Party br In July Mario Party for Nintendo s Wii home console was withdrawn from stores in the United Kingdom shortly after its release date This was allegedly caused by Kamek using the word spastic Complaints were raised from consumers because the term is used to refer to an intellectually disabled person and is considered highly offensive in the United Kingdom In August Nintendo re released the game replacing spastic with the word erratic br br br Notes br br br
