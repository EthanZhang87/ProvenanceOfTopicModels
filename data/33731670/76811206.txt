Game Boy Game Pak is the brand name of the ROM cartridges used to store video game data for the Game Boy family of handheld video game consoles part of Nintendo s line of Game Pak cartridges Early Game Boy games were limited to kilobytes KB of read only memory ROM storage due to the system s bit architecture Nintendo later incorporated a memory bank controller into cartridges to allow for more storage by switching between ROM banks This change allowed Game Paks to reach megabytes MB of storage allowing for more complex games br In addition to ROM cartridges could also include random access memory RAM chips that could be used for increased performance or to save game progress A battery in the cartridge would keep the RAM powered when the Game Boy was off Later cartridges could also include real time clock functionality that could keep track of time even when the device was off or a Rumble Pak to add vibration feedback to enhance gameplay br Game Paks for the Game Boy Advance which uses a bit architecture could accommodate up to MB of game ROM The Game Boy Advance was the last major handheld device to use cartridges as its primary storage format Later systems like the Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS use game cards which are similar to SD cards br br br Background br br br Original and Color br br The Game Boy Game Pak cartridges store the game s code and data using ROM chips However the original Game Boy s bit architecture limited the CPU s access to just KB of ROM at a time restricting early games to this size br Nintendo overcame this limitation with a chip called the memory bank controller MBC placed within the cartridge A similar solution had been by previously used on the Nintendo Entertainment System Game Pak The MBC chip acts like a traffic controller switching between multiple banks of KB each Using this technology Nintendo was able to create cartridges that used up to MB of ROM vastly expanding game size and complexity br Some Game Boy cartridges included random access memory RAM to increase the device s performance and allow game progress to be saved This memory typically came in the form of an KB EEPROM chip a KB SRAM chip or later a KB flash memory chip SRAM chips required a battery to retain data when the Game Boy was powered off These batteries had a limited lifespan and needed to be desoldered for replacement The SRAM chips were later phased out in favor of the flash memory chips which can store data without the need for a battery Later revisions introduced even more functionality Real time clock capabilities kept track of time using a crystal oscillator Rumble Pak cartridges added vibration feedback to enhance gameplay br The standard cartridge measured centimeters in wide and centimeters in high However some games such as the Game Boy Camera boasted custom designed larger casings to accommodate special features On the original Game Boy a plastic tab slid across into a notch at the top of the cartridge when the console was powered on To save space this locking mechanism was removed from all subsequent devices The notch was not present on Game Boy Color Game Paks to prevent them from being used in the original Game Boy If these Game Boy Color Game Paks were inserted into a Game Boy Pocket or Light an error message would be shown on the screen br br br Advance br br The Game Boy Advance used a significantly shorter standard cartridge design at centimeters in high The top of the cartridge was wider at centimeters in wide to prevent insertion into older Game Boy devices but the bottom retained the same width of centimeters in br The Game Boy Advance Game Pak could accommodate up to MB of game ROM although special Game Boy Advance Video cartridges could hold MB of video on ROM br Cartridges could also include RAM however these were mostly used to save game progress and not to increase the device s performance This memory typically came in the form of an or KB EEPROM chip a or KB SRAM chip or later a KB or MB flash memory chip SRAM chips required a battery to retain data when the Game Boy was powered off These batteries had a limited lifespan and needed to be desoldered for replacement br Game Boy Advance cartridges included notches on the cartridge s corners When inserted into a Game Boy Advance these notches avoid pressing a switch called a shape detector within the slot allowing the device to boot into its native mode When an older Game Boy cartridge was inserted this switch would be pressed triggering the device to boot into its backward compatibility mode br The Nintendo DS retains backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance cartridges but not older Game Boy games To accomplish this the button was replaced with a solid piece of plastic preventing older Game Boy cartridges from fully inserting br br br Types br Excluding game specific variations there are four types of cartridges compatible with Game Boy systems br br br Original Game Boy Game Pak br br The original Game Boy Game Pak also known as class A or grey cartridges is compatible with all Game Boy systems excluding Game Boy Micro All original Game Boy games are of this type The games on these cartridges are programmed in monochrome using four shades of grey or green br When these games are played on the Game Boy Color and subsequent systems the device applies a limited color palette typically dark green using four to ten colors to enhance games originally intended to be presented in four shades of gray Many games were programmed to call for a default color palette However for games without a default users could choose from different palettes using button combinations A dedicated palette option replicates the original Game Boy s grayscale experience br Additionally a limited number of cartridges released between and feature enhancements compatible with the Super Game Boy br Although most original Game Boy Game Paks were encased in grey plastic some used special colors that match the game s theme including notably Pok mon Red Blue and Yellow and the Donkey Kong Land series which utilized yellow cartridges br br br Color enhanced Game Boy Game Pak br br The color enhanced Game Boy Game Pak also known as class B dual mode or black cartridges improved the gameplay experience on the Game Boy Color and subsequent systems while maintaining compatibility with older monochrome devices br These cartridges can use the full color capabilities of the Game Boy Color and subsequent systems displaying up to colors simultaneously out of a palette of while use up to colors out of a palette of while remaining compatible with the original Game Boy where they were presented in four shades of gray However this compatibility comes at the expense of not being able to utilize the handheld s increased processing speed and memory br Some color enhanced games like Wario Land II and The Legend of Zelda Link s Awakening DX were colorized re releases of originally monochrome games however Nintendo insisted that developers include gameplay enhancements beyond simply adding color to differentiate the games from their monochrome counterparts Some color enhanced cartridges also boasted features later seen in clear cartridges such as the Rumble Pak in Pok mon Pinball and infrared communications in Robopon Sun Star and Moon Versions br Although most color enhanced Game Boy Game Paks were encased in black plastic some used special colors that matched the game s theme including notably Pok mon Yellow and Pok mon Gold and Silver br br br Game Boy Color Game Pak br br The Game Boy Color Game Pak also known as class C or clear cartridges introduced unique features for players on the Game Boy Color and subsequent systems They boast a wider color range up to colors and benefit from the increased processing speed and memory introduced with the Game Boy Color Because of this reliance on the newer hardware these games are incompatible with the older monochrome Game Boy models br Certain cartridges also had additional features to enhance gameplay including rumble feedback utilized in Perfect Dark and tilt sensors employed in Kirby Tilt n Tumble br Most original Game Boy Game Paks were encased in translucent plastic but similar to previous generations some were released in special colors that match the game s theme like Pok mon Crystal br br br
