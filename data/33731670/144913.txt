The Bally Astrocade also known as Bally Arcade and initially as Bally ABA is a second generation home video game console and simple computer system designed by a team at Midway at that time the videogame division of Bally It was originally announced as the Bally Home Library Computer in October and initially made available for mail order in December But due to production delays the units were first released to stores in April and its branding changed to Bally Professional Arcade It was marketed only for a limited time before Bally decided to exit the market The rights were later picked up by a third party company who re released it and sold it until around The Astrocade is particularly notable for its very powerful graphics capabilities for the time of release and for the difficulty in accessing those capabilities br br br History br br br Nutting and Midway br In the late s Midway contracted Dave Nutting Associates to design a video display chip that could be used in all of their videogame systems from standup arcade games to a home computer system The system Nutting delivered was used in most of Midway s classic arcade games of the era including Gorf and Wizard of Wor The chipset supported what was at that time relatively high resolution of in four colours per line although to access this mode required memory that could be accessed at a faster rate than the common MHz dynamic RAM of the era br br br Console use br Originally referred to as the Bally Home Library Computer it was released in but available only through mail order Delays in the production meant none of the units actually shipped until and by this time the machine had been renamed the Bally Professional Arcade In this form it sold mostly at computer stores and had little retail exposure unlike the Atari VCS In Bally grew less interested in the arcade market and decided to sell off their Consumer Products Division including development and production of the game console br At about the same time a third party group had been unsuccessfully attempting to bring their own console design to market as the Astrovision A corporate buyer from Montgomery Ward who was in charge of the Bally system put the two groups in contact and a deal was eventually arranged In they re released the unit with the BASIC cartridge included for free this time known as the Bally Computer System with the name changing again in to Astrocade It sold under this name until the video game crash of and then disappeared around br Midway had long been planning to release an expansion system for the unit known as the ZGRASS The system was being developed by a group of computer artists at the University of Illinois at Chicago known as the Circle Graphics Habitat along with programmers at Nutting Midway felt that such a system in an external box would make the Astrocade more interesting to the market However it was still not ready for release when Bally sold off the division A small handful may have been produced as the ZGRASS after the machine was re released by Astrovision br The system combined into a single box would eventually be released as the Datamax UV Aimed at the home computer market while being designed the machine was now re targeted as a system for outputting high quality graphics to videotape These were offered for sale some time between and but it is unknown how many were built br br br Description br br The basic system was powered by a Zilog Z driving the display chip with a RAM buffer in between the two The display chip had two modes a low resolution mode at and a high resolution mode at both with bits per pixel for four colors This sort of color resolution was normally beyond the capabilities of RAM of the era which could not read out the data fast enough to keep up with the TV display The system used page mode addressing allowing them to read one line at a time at very high speed into a buffer inside the display chip The line could then be read out to the screen at a more leisurely rate while also interfering less with the CPU which was also trying to use the same memory br On the Astrocade the pins needed to use this trick were not connected Thus the Astrocade system was left with just the lower resolution mode In this mode the system used up bits bytes of memory to hold the screen Since the machine had only kiB bytes of RAM this left very little room for program functions such as keeping score and game options The rest of the program would have to be placed in ROM br The Astrocade used color registers or color indirection so the four colors could be picked from a palette of colors Color animation was possible by changing the values of the registers and using a horizontal blank interrupt they could be changed from line to line An additional set of four color registers could be swapped in at any point along the line allowing the creation of two screen halves split vertically Originally intended to allow creation of a score area on the side of the screen programmers also used this feature to emulate color modes br Unlike the VCS the Astrocade did not include hardware sprite support It did however include a blitter like system and software to drive it Memory above x was dedicated to the display and memory below that to the ROM If a program wrote to the ROM space normally impossible it is read only after all the video chip would take the data apply a function to it and then copy the result into the corresponding location in the RAM Which function to use was stored in a register in the display chip and included common instructions like XOR and bit shift This allowed the Astrocade to support any number of sprite like objects independent of hardware with the downside that it was up to the software to re draw them when they moved br The Astrocade was one of the early cartridge based systems using cartridges known as Videocades that were designed to be as close in size and shape as possible to a cassette tape The unit also included two games built into the ROM Gunfight and Checkmate along with the simple but useful Calculator and a doodle program called Scribbling Most cartridges included two games and when they were inserted the machine would reset and display a menu starting with the programs on the cartridge and then listing the four built in programs br The Astrocade featured a relatively complex input device incorporating several types of control mechanisms the controller was shaped as a pistol style grip with trigger switch on the front a small switch way joystick was placed on top of the grip and the shaft of the joystick connected to a potentiometer meaning that the stick could be rotated to double as a paddle controller br On the front of the unit was a key hex pad keyboard used for selecting games and options as well as operating the calculator On the back were a number of ports including connectors for power the controllers and an expansion port One oddity was that the top rear of the unit was empty and could be opened to store up to cartridges The system s ability to be upgraded from a video game console to personal computer along with its library of nearly games in are some reasons that made it more versatile than its main competitors and was listed by Jeff Rovin as one of the seven major video game suppliers br br br Astro BASIC br The Astrocade also included a BASIC programming language cartridge written by Jamie Fenton who expanded Li Chen Wang s Palo Alto Tiny BASIC First published as Bally BASIC in br Developing a BASIC interpreter on the system was difficult because the display alone used up almost all the available RAM The solution to this problem was to store the BASIC program code in the video RAM br This was accomplished by interleaving every bit of the program along with the display itself BASIC used all the even numbered bits and the display the odd numbered bits The interpreter would read out two bytes drop all the odd numbered bits and assemble the results into a single byte of code This was rendered invisible by setting two of the colors to be the same as the other two such that colors and would be the same white so the presence or lack of a bit for BASIC had no effect on the screen Additional memory was scavenged by using fewer lines vertically only instead of the full This managed to squeeze out bytes of RAM for BASIC programs The downside was that most of the graphics system s power was unavailable br Programs were entered via the calculator keypad with a plastic overlay displaying letters symbols and BASIC keywords These were selected through a set of colored shift keys For example typing WORD gold shift then the key would result in GOTO br A simple line editor was supported After typing the line number corresponding to an existing program each press of the PAUSE key would load the next character from memory br An Astro BASIC program that later became commercialized is Artillery Duel John Perkins wrote the game first and submitted it to The Arcadian fanzine from which it was adapted for the Astro BASIC manual Perkins subsequently developed the Astrocade cartridge of the game br br br

the start of the line was equivalent to REM in other BASIC implementations Certain commands were handled by the keypad instead of by keywords the RESET button was equivalent to NEW in other interpreters br The language supported integer variables A to Z and two pre defined arrays which was stored starting after the program ascending and which was stored from the top of memory descending The language lacked a DIM statement for dimensioning the arrays the size of which was determined by available memory SZ not used by the program listing bytes per item Ports were accessed via the array and memory was accessed via the array rather than using PEEK and POKE While the language lacked strings KP would provide the ASCII value of a key press which could be output to TV meaning that characters could be read in from the keyboard stored in an array and then output br The character display was lines of characters across The resolution for the graphic commands is x with X ranging from to and Y ranging from to br Music could be produced in four ways br br The PRINT command as a side effect produced a unique tone for each character or keyword displayed br The MU variable

has a noise generator which can be independent from the other square wave channels or it can add its value to the master oscillator that drives the square wave channels The master oscillator can be set to different frequencies which means that the frequency range can be changed for the square wave channels br Volume control Each channel has independent bit volume control br Miscellaneous features concerning sound There are hardware registers for vibrato with two bits for the vibrato speed and bits for vibrato depth This means that it wouldn t be necessary for vibrato to be done
