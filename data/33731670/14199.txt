id: 14199
A handheld game console or simply handheld console is a small portable self contained video game console with a built in screen game controls and speakers Handheld game consoles are smaller than home video game consoles and contain the console screen speakers and controls in one unit allowing players to carry them and play them at any time or place br In Mattel introduced the first handheld electronic game with the release of Auto Race Later several companies including Coleco and Milton Bradley made their own single game lightweight table top or handheld electronic game devices The first commercial successful handheld console was Merlin from which sold more than million units The first handheld game console with interchangeable cartridges is the Milton Bradley Microvision in br Nintendo is credited with popularizing the handheld console concept with the release of the Game Boy in and continues to dominate the handheld console market The first internet enabled handheld console and the first with a touchscreen was the Game com released by Tiger Electronics in The Nintendo DS released in introduced touchscreen controls and wireless online gaming to a wider audience becoming the best selling handheld console with over million units sold worldwide br br br History br br br Timeline br This table describes handheld games consoles by generation with over million sales No handheld achieved this prior to the fourth generation of game consoles This list does not include dedicated consoles such as LCD games and the Tamagotchi br br br Origins br br The origins of handheld game consoles are found in handheld and tabletop electronic game devices of the s and early s These electronic devices are capable of playing only a single game they fit in the palm of the hand or on a tabletop and they may make use of a variety of video displays such as LED VFD or LCD In handheld electronic games were described by Popular Electronics magazine as nonvideo electronic games and non TV games as distinct from devices that required use of a television screen Handheld electronic games in turn find their origins in the synthesis of previous handheld and tabletop electro mechanical devices such as Waco s Electronic Tic Tac Toe Cragstan s Periscope Firing Range and the emerging optoelectronic display driven calculator market of the early s This synthesis happened in when Mattel began work on a line of calculator sized sports games that became the world s first handheld electronic games The project began when Michael Katz Mattel s new product category marketing director told the engineers in the electronics group to design a game the size of a calculator using LED light emitting diode technology br br our big success was something that I conceptualized the first handheld game I asked the design group to see if they could come up with a game that was electronic that was the same size as a calculator br Michael Katz former marketing director Mattel Toys br br The result was the release of Auto Race Followed by Football later in the two games were so successful that according to Katz these simple electronic handheld games turned into a million category Mattel would later win the honor of being recognized by the industry for innovation in handheld game device displays Soon other manufacturers including Coleco Parker Brothers Milton Bradley Entex and Bandai began following up with their own tabletop and handheld electronic games br In the LCD based Microvision designed by Smith Engineering and distributed by Milton Bradley became the first handheld game console and the first to use interchangeable game cartridges The Microvision game Cosmic Hunter also introduced the concept of a directional pad on handheld gaming devices and is operated by using the thumb to manipulate the on screen character in any of four directions br In Gunpei Yokoi traveling on a bullet train saw a bored businessman playing with an LCD calculator by pressing the buttons Yokoi then thought of an idea for a watch that doubled as a miniature game machine for killing time Starting in Nintendo began to release a series of electronic games designed by Yokoi called the Game Watch games Taking advantage of the technology used in the credit card sized calculators that had appeared on the market Yokoi designed the series of LCD based games to include a digital time display in the corner of the screen For later more complicated Game Watch games Yokoi invented a cross shaped directional pad or D pad for control of on screen characters Yokoi also included his directional pad on the NES controllers and the cross shaped thumb controller soon became standard on game console controllers and ubiquitous across the video game industry since When Yokoi began designing Nintendo s first handheld game console he came up with a device that married the elements of his Game Watch devices and the Famicom console including both items D pad controller The result was the Nintendo Game Boy br In the Bandai LCD Solarpower was the first solar powered gaming device Some of its games such as the horror themed game Terror House features two LCD panels one stacked on the other for an early D effect In Takara Tomy s Tomytronic D simulates D by having two LCD panels that were lit by external light through a window on top of the device making it the first dedicated home video D hardware br br br Beginnings br The late s and early s saw the beginnings of the modern day handheld game console industry after the demise of the Microvision As backlit LCD game consoles with color graphics consume a lot of power they were not battery friendly like the non backlit original Game Boy whose monochrome graphics allowed longer battery life By this point rechargeable battery technology had not yet matured and so the more advanced game consoles of the time such as the Sega Game Gear and Atari Lynx did not have nearly as much success as the Game Boy br Even though third party rechargeable batteries were available for the battery hungry alternatives to the Game Boy these batteries employed a nickel cadmium process and had to be completely discharged before being recharged to ensure maximum efficiency lead acid batteries could be used with automobile circuit limiters cigarette lighter plug devices but the batteries had mediocre portability The later NiMH batteries which do not share this requirement for maximum efficiency were not released until the late s years after the Game Gear Atari Lynx and original Game Boy had been discontinued During the time when technologically superior handhelds had strict technical limitations batteries had a very low mAh rating since batteries with heavy power density were not yet available br Modern game systems such as the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable have rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries with proprietary shapes Other seventh generation consoles such as the GP X use standard alkaline batteries Because the mAh rating of alkaline batteries has increased since the s the power needed for handhelds like the GP X may be supplied by relatively few batteries br br br Game Boy br br Nintendo released the Game Boy on April September for the UK The design team headed by Gunpei Yokoi had also been responsible for the Game Watch system as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System games Metroid and Kid Icarus The Game Boy came under scrutiny by Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi saying that the monochrome screen was too small and the processing power was inadequate The design team had felt that low initial cost and battery economy were more important concerns and when compared to the Microvision the Game Boy was a huge leap forward br br Yokoi recognized that the Game Boy needed a killer app at least one game that would define the console and persuade customers to buy it In June Minoru Arakawa then CEO of Nintendo of America saw a demonstration of the game Tetris at a trade show Nintendo purchased the rights for the game and packaged it with the Game Boy system as a launch title It was almost an immediate hit By the end of the year more than a million units were sold in the US As of March the Game Boy and Game Boy Color combined to sell over million units worldwide br br br Atari Lynx br br In Epyx created the Handy Game a device that would become the Atari Lynx in It is the first color handheld console ever made as well as the first with a backlit screen It also features networking support with up to other players and advanced hardware that allows the zooming and scaling of sprites The Lynx can also be turned upside down to accommodate left handed players However all these features came at a very high price point which drove consumers to seek cheaper alternatives The Lynx is also very unwieldy consumes batteries very quickly and lacked the third party support enjoyed by its competitors Due to its high price short battery life production shortages a dearth of compelling games and Nintendo s aggressive marketing campaign and despite a redesign in the Lynx became a commercial failure Despite this companies like Telegames helped to keep the system alive long past its commercial relevance and when new owner Hasbro released the rights to develop for the public domain independent developers like Songbird have managed to release new commercial games for the system every year until s Winter Games br br br TurboExpress br br The TurboExpress is a portable version of the TurboGrafx released in for Its Japanese equivalent is the PC Engine GT br It is the most advanced handheld of its time and can play all the TurboGrafx s games which are on a small credit card sized media called HuCards It has a mm in screen the same as the original Game Boy but in a much higher resolution and can display sprites at once per scanline in colors Although the hardware can only handle simultaneous colors It has kilobytes of RAM The Turbo runs the HuC CPU at or MHz br br The optional TurboVision TV tuner includes RCA audio video input allowing users to use TurboExpress as a video monitor The TurboLink allowed two player play Falcon a flight simulator included a head to head dogfight mode that can only be accessed via TurboLink However very few TG games offered co op play modes especially designed with the TurboExpress in mind br br br Bitcorp Gamate br br The Bitcorp Gamate is one of the first handheld game systems created in response to the Nintendo Game Boy It was released in Asia in and distributed worldwide by br Like the Sega Game Gear it was horizontal in orientation and like the Game Boy required AA batteries Unlike many later Game Boy clones its internal components were professionally assembled no glop top chips Unfortunately the system s fatal flaw is its screen Even by the standards of the day its screen is rather difficult to use suffering from similar ghosting problems that were common complaints with the first generation Game Boys Likely because of this fact sales were quite poor and Bitcorp closed by However new games continued to be published for the Asian market possibly as late as The total number of games released for the system remains unknown br br Gamate games were designed for stereo sound but the console is only equipped with a mono speaker br br br Game Gear br br The Game Gear is the third color handheld console after the Lynx and the TurboExpress produced by Sega Released in Japan in and in North America and Europe in it is based on the Master System which gave Sega the ability to quickly create Game Gear games from its large library of games for the Master System While never reaching the level of success enjoyed by Nintendo the Game Gear proved to be a fairly durable competitor lasting longer than any other Game Boy rivals br While the Game Gear is most frequently seen in black or navy blue it was also released in a variety of additional colors red light blue yellow clear and violet All of these variations were released in small quantities and frequently only in the Asian market br br Following Sega s success with the Game Gear they began development on a successor during the early s which was intended to feature a touchscreen interface many years before the Nintendo DS However such a technology was very expensive at the time and the handheld itself was estimated to have cost around were it to be released Sega eventually chose to shelve the idea and instead release the Genesis Nomad a handheld version of the Genesis as the successor br br br Watara Supervision br br The Watara Supervision was released in in an attempt to compete with the Nintendo Game Boy The first model was designed very much like a Game Boy but it is grey in color and has a slightly larger screen The second model was made with a hinge across the center and can be bent slightly to provide greater comfort for the user While the system did enjoy a modest degree of success it never impacted the sales of Nintendo or Sega The Supervision was redesigned a final time as The Magnum Released in limited quantities it was roughly equivalent to the Game Boy Pocket It was available in three colors yellow green and grey Watara designed many of the games themselves but did receive some third party support most notably from Sachen br br A TV adapter was available in both PAL and NTSC formats that could transfer the Supervision s black and white palette to colors similar in some regards to the Super Game Boy from Nintendo br br br Hartung Game Master br br The Hartung Game Master is an obscure handheld released at an unknown point in the early s Its graphics fidelity was much lower than most of its contemporaries displaying just x pixels It was available in black white and purple and was frequently rebranded by its distributors such as Delplay Videojet and Systema br br The exact number of games released is not known but is likely around The system most frequently turns up in Europe and Australia br br br Late s br By this time the lack of significant development in Nintendo s product line began allowing more advanced systems such as the Neo Geo Pocket Color and the WonderSwan Color to be developed br br br Sega Nomad br br The Nomad was released in October in North America only The release was six years into the market span of the Genesis with an existing library of more than Genesis games According to former Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller the Nomad was not intended to be the Game Gear s replacement he believed that there was little planning from Sega of Japan for the new handheld Sega was supporting five different consoles Saturn Genesis Game Gear Pico and the Master System as well as the Sega CD and X add ons In Japan the Mega Drive had never been successful and the Saturn was more successful than Sony s PlayStation so Sega Enterprises CEO Hayao Nakayama decided to focus on the Saturn By the Nomad was being sold at less than a third of its original price br br br Game Boy Pocket br br The Game Boy Pocket is a redesigned version of the original Game Boy having the same features It was released in Notably this variation is smaller and lighter It comes in seven different colors red yellow green black clear silver blue and pink It has space for two AAA batteries which provide approximately hours of game play The screen was changed to a true black and white display rather than the pea soup monochromatic display of the original Game Boy Although like its predecessor the Game Boy Pocket has no backlight to allow play in a darkened area it did notably improve visibility and pixel response time mostly eliminating ghosting br br The first model of the Game Boy Pocket did not have an LED to show battery levels but the feature was added due to public demand The Game Boy Pocket was not a new software platform and played the same software as the original Game Boy model br br br Game com br br The Game com pronounced in TV commercials as game com not game dot com and not capitalized in marketing material is a handheld game console released by Tiger Electronics in September It featured many new ideas for handheld consoles and was aimed at an older target audience sporting PDA style features and functions such as a touch screen and stylus However Tiger hoped it would also challenge Nintendo s Game Boy and gain a following among younger gamers too Unlike other handheld game consoles the first game com consoles included two slots for game cartridges which would not happen again until the Tapwave Zodiac the DS and DS Lite and could be connected to a kbit s modem Later models had only a single cartridge slot br br br Game Boy Color br br The Game Boy Color also referred to as GBC or CGB is Nintendo s successor to the Game Boy and was released on October in Japan and in November of the same year in the United States It features a color screen and is slightly bigger than the Game Boy Pocket The processor is twice as fast as a Game Boy s and has twice as much memory It also had an infrared communications port for wireless linking which did not appear in later versions of the Game Boy such as the Game Boy Advance br The Game Boy Color was a response to pressure from game developers for a new system as they felt that the Game Boy even in its latest incarnation the Game Boy Pocket was insufficient The resulting product was backward compatible a first for a handheld console system and leveraged the large library of games and great installed base of the predecessor system This became a major feature of the Game Boy line since it allowed each new launch to begin with a significantly larger library than any of its competitors As of March the Game Boy and Game Boy Color combined to sell million units worldwide br br The console is capable of displaying up to different colors simultaneously on screen from its palette of and can add basic four color shading to games that had been developed for the original Game Boy It can also give the sprites and backgrounds separate colors for a total of more than four colors br br br Neo Geo Pocket Color br br The Neo Geo Pocket Color or NGPC was released in in Japan and later that year in the United States and Europe It is a bit color handheld game console designed by SNK the maker of the Neo Geo home console and arcade machine It came after SNK s original Neo Geo Pocket monochrome handheld which debuted in in Japan br In following SNK s purchase by Japanese Pachinko manufacturer Aruze the Neo Geo Pocket Color was dropped from both the US and European markets purportedly due to commercial failure br br The system seemed well on its way to being a success in the U S It was more successful than any Game Boy competitor since Sega s Game Gear but was hurt by several factors such as SNK s infamous lack of communication with third party developers and anticipation of the Game Boy Advance The decision to ship U S games in cardboard boxes in a cost cutting move rather than hard plastic cases that Japanese and European releases were shipped in may have also hurt US sales br br br Wonderswan Color br br The WonderSwan Color is a handheld game console designed by Bandai It was released on December in Japan Although the WonderSwan Color was slightly larger and heavier mm and g compared to the original WonderSwan the color version featured KB of RAM and a larger color LCD screen In addition the WonderSwan Color is compatible with the original WonderSwan library of games br br Prior to WonderSwan s release Nintendo had virtually a monopoly in the Japanese video game handheld market After the release of the WonderSwan Color Bandai took approximately of the market share in Japan partly due to its low price of yen approximately US Another reason for the WonderSwan s success in Japan was the fact that Bandai managed to get a deal with Square to port over the original Famicom Final Fantasy games with improved graphics and controls However with the popularity of the Game Boy Advance and the reconciliation between Square and Nintendo the WonderSwan Color and its successor the SwanCrystal quickly lost its competitive advantage br br br Early s br The s saw a major leap in innovation particularly in the second half with the release of the DS and PSP br br br Game Boy Advance br br In Nintendo released the Game Boy Advance GBA or AGB which added two shoulder buttons a larger screen and more computing power than the Game Boy Color br The design was revised two years later when the Game Boy Advance SP GBA SP a more compact version was released The SP features a clamshell design folding open and closed like a laptop computer as well as a frontlit color display and rechargeable battery Despite the smaller form factor the screen remained the same size as that of the original In the Game Boy Micro was released This revision sacrifices screen size and backwards compatibility with previous Game Boys for a dramatic reduction in total size and a brighter backlit screen A new SP model with a backlit screen was released in some regions around the same time br Along with the GameCube the GBA also introduced the concept of connectivity using a handheld system as a console controller A handful of games use this feature most notably Animal Crossing Pac Man Vs Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles The Legend of Zelda Four Swords Adventures The Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker Metroid Prime and Sonic Adventure Battle br br As of December the GBA GBA SP and the Game Boy Micro combined have sold million units worldwide br br br Game Park br br The original GP was released in by the South Korean company Game Park a few months after the launch of the Game Boy Advance It featured a bit CPU MHz processor MP and Divx player and e book reader SmartMedia cards were used for storage and could hold up to mb of anything downloaded through a USB cable from a PC The GP was redesigned in A front lit screen was added and the new version was called GP FLU Front Light Unit In summer another redesign the GP BLU was made and added a backlit screen This version of the handheld was planned for release outside South Korea in Europe and it was released for example in Spain VirginPlay was the distributor While not a commercial success on a level with mainstream handhelds only units were sold it ended up being used mainly as a platform for user made applications and emulators of other systems being popular with developers and more technically adept users br br br N Gage br br Nokia released the N Gage in It was designed as a combination MP player cellphone PDA radio and gaming device The system received much criticism alleging defects in its physical design and layout including its vertically oriented screen and requirement of removing the battery to change game cartridges The most well known of these was sidetalking or the act of placing the phone speaker and receiver on an edge of the device instead of one of the flat sides causing the user to appear as if they are speaking into a taco br The N Gage QD was later released to address the design flaws of the original However certain features available in the original N Gage including MP playback FM radio reception and USB connectivity were removed br br Second generation of N Gage

upgraded with a backlit screen with a distracting background transparency which can be removed by opening up the console A color model the GameKing apparently exists but was only made for a brief time and was difficult to purchase outside of Asia Whether intentionally or not the GameKing has the most primitive graphics of any handheld released since the Game Boy of br As many of the games have an old school simplicity the device has developed a small cult following The Gameking s speaker is quite loud and the cartridges sophisticated looping soundtracks sampled from other sources are seemingly at odds with its primitive graphics br br TimeTop made at least one additional device sometimes labeled as GameKing but while it seems to possess more advanced graphics is essentially an emulator that plays a handful of multi carts like the GB Station Light II Outside of Asia especially China however the Gameking remains relatively unheard of due to the enduring popularity of Japanese handhelds
