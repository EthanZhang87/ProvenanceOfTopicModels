id: 952151
The C Direct to TV called C DTV for short is a single chip implementation of the Commodore computer contained in a joystick modeled after the mid s Competition Pro joystick with built in games The design is similar to the Atari Classics in TV Game The circuitry of the C DTV was designed by Jeri Ellsworth a computer chip designer who had previously designed the C One br Tulip Computers which had acquired the Commodore brand name in licensed the rights to Ironstone Partners which cooperated with DC Studios and Mammoth Toys in the development and marketing of the unit Released in late QVC purchased the entire first production run of units and sold of them on the first day that they were offered br br br Versions br There exist multiple versions of the C DTV DTV NTSC television type comes with MB ROM It first appeared in late for the American Canadian market DTV called C D TV sometimes is a revised version for the European and world markets PAL television type and appeared in late The ROM has been replaced by flash memory in these devices However the DTV PAL version suffers from a manufacturing fault which results in poor colour rendering the resistors in the R R ladder DACs for both the chroma and the luma have been transposed In the DTV a problem with the blitter was fixed br br br Hardware specifications br br Core circuitry br ASIC running at MHz internally

the internal circuit board has exposed solder points for floppy drive and keyboard ports hardware modifications of the C DTV are relatively simple br Known hardware mods br br Keyboard connector br External joystick Port and br Floppy connector br Power unit connector br Fixing the palette problems of the PAL version to some degree this is possible in software by adjusting palette entries br S Video connector br User port br Original C casing and PS keyboard br Additional hardware br br Data transfer cable Parallel port or USB serial port via DTV ser to Joystick or user port br SD card interface III or MMC IEC br br br Limitations br The internal flash memory is accessible as device However software is not included to support write operations so high score saving is not possible Also flash devices used in the DTV are specified for a very limited number of write accesses only br When using the standard keyboard mod the F key does not work There is a workaround the Keyboard Twister br br br Software modding br The DTV contains software flashable memory A number of tools have been released to compile programs into DTV compatible flash images and load it onto the DTV People made their own game compilations adding popular sometimes DTV fixed games that were not in the original DTV added boot menus to make homebrew software development easier or enable new features for example transfer programs like DTVtrans for transferring data from PC to DTV RAM and vice versa via the PC parallel port or USB and the DTV joystick port br br br br br br External links br DTV
