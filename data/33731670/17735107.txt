Tegra is a system on a chip SoC series developed by Nvidia for mobile devices such as smartphones personal digital assistants and mobile Internet devices The Tegra integrates an ARM architecture central processing unit CPU graphics processing unit GPU northbridge southbridge and memory controller onto one package Early Tegra SoCs are designed as efficient multimedia processors The Tegra line evolved to emphasize performance for gaming and machine learning applications without sacrificing power efficiency before taking a drastic shift in direction towards platforms that provide vehicular automation with the applied Nvidia Drive brand name on reference boards and its semiconductors and with the Nvidia Jetson brand name for boards adequate for AI applications within e g robots or drones and for various smart high level automation purposes br br br History br The Tegra APX was announced on February The Tegra xx product line was revealed on June and the APX was announced in February The APX chips were designed for smartphones while the Tegra and chips were intended for smartbooks and mobile Internet devices MID br The first product to use the Tegra was Microsoft s Zune HD media player in September followed by the Samsung M Microsoft s Kin was the first cellular phone to use the Tegra however the phone did not have an app store so the Tegra s power did not provide much advantage In September Nvidia and Opera Software announced that they would produce a version of the Opera browser optimized for the Tegra on Windows Mobile and Windows CE At Mobile World Congress Nvidia introduced its port of Google s Android to the Tegra br On January Nvidia officially announced and demonstrated its next generation Tegra system on a chip the Nvidia Tegra at Consumer Electronics Show Nvidia primarily supports Android on Tegra but booting other ARM supporting operating systems is possible on devices where the bootloader is accessible Tegra support for the Ubuntu Linux distribution was also announced on the Nvidia developer forum br Nvidia announced the first quad core SoC at the February Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona Though the chip was codenamed Kal El it is now branded as Tegra Early benchmark results show impressive gains over Tegra and the chip was used in many of the tablets released in the second half of br In January Nvidia announced that Audi had selected the Tegra processor for its In Vehicle Infotainment systems and digital instruments display The processor will be integrated into Audi s entire line of vehicles worldwide
