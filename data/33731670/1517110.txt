The Gizmondo is a handheld gaming console developed by Tiger Telematics It was released in the UK Sweden and the U S starting in March Its first party games were developed in studios in Helsingborg Sweden and Manchester England Gizmondo Europe Ltd was based in London England and was a subsidiary of Florida based Tiger Telematics whose chairman Carl Freer led Gizmondo s development br Before its launch the Gizmondo had high expectations by some journalists due to its extensive feature set and it was aimed to compete against Nintendo and Sony it ended up as a major sales failure The company extravagantly spent millions on promotions such as a celebrity party at London s Park Lane Hotel and taking part at the Hours of Le Mans despite never making a profit Its American debut was delayed several times and a widescreen version was announced shortly before its release resulting in low sales With fewer than units sold the Gizmondo was named by GamePro as the worst selling handheld console in history br The Gizmondo was further overshadowed when Swedish press revealed criminal pasts of several executives causing their resignations including Tiger Telematics CEO Carl Freer Director of Gizmondo Europe Stefan Eriksson was involved in a Swedish criminal organisation the Uppsalamaffian the Uppsala mafia By February the company was forced into bankruptcy after amassing US million million debt and the Gizmondo stopped production Weeks thereafter Eriksson crashed a rare Ferrari Enzo driving at km h mph in California and was later jailed and subsequently deported for driving under the influence in connection with the crash and other criminal offenses br br br History br The Gizmondo device was originally called Gametraq Tiger Telematics first published on their website in October about the device being developed This came in response to Nokia s N Gage During December that year Gizmondo made its debut as a concept product at the Las Vegas CES in January and later appeared at the German CeBIT show in March The company and the console were renamed Gizmondo around April br br British Formula One driver Jenson Button appeared on magazine adverts for the Gizmondo and also had his own licensed video game for the device Chicane though it never released due to a dispute with Tiger Telematics and the developer of the game In London s Regent Street Tiger Telematics threw a party with several celebrities invited to promote the device Busta Rhymes Jodie Kidd and Pharrell Williams were among the celebrities invited of whom some performed There were also two television adverts that aired after release Also in an attempt to promote the console Gizmondo s executive Stefan Eriksson took part in the Hours of Le Mans race of in a Gizmondo sponsored Ferrari Modena GTC br The Gizmondo s problems were compounded by the involvement of Eriksson in Swedish organized crime and later for crashing a Ferrari Enzo in Malibu California which was apparently owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland He pleaded guilty to numerous criminal charges which led him to years in jail br In GameTrailers named it the worst console of all time br br br Widescreen Gizmondo br Tiger Telematics announced a new Gizmondo model for release in Q It was intended to have a larger widescreen screen and upgrades like Wi Fi TV out support an improved pixel resolution a megapixel camera and a MHz processor It also included tri band GSM technology effectively making it a mobile phone too It also featured new icons on the buttons The widescreen Gizmondo was announced just a few weeks before the U S launch of the Gizmondo possibly prompting some potential customers to not buy the Gizmondo and instead wait for the improved model in an example of the Osborne effect Tiger Telematics promised to show the device at CES in January however it never appeared there Shortly thereafter Tiger went bankrupt and thus the new Gizmondo was never released br br br Release br br br United

Power Nintendo s official magazine Plans to distribute the handheld through other retailers never materialized br br br Games br br The Gizmondo launched in the United Kingdom with only one game Trailblazer The console launched in the United States with a line up of eight titles including Trailblazer In addition to these eight six others were released in Europe only A further titles were known to have been in development for the system but all were canceled before their release due to Tiger Telematics bankruptcy Also all games released in North America were effectively launch titles

world movements in real time Additionally several games including Gizmondo Motocross Hockey Rage and Sticky Balls had bluetooth multiplayer features The accessibility to purchase Gizmondo games was limited In the United States games were only available through a small numbers of kiosks located in shopping malls across the country After Tiger Telematic s bankruptcy the Gizmondo and its games were left without any proper marketing or distribution br br br Smart Adds br The Smart Adds system was intended as a way for advertisers to subsidize part of the cost of the unit The apparent misspelling of the name was intentional and a trademark and company name were registered in the UK as Smart Adds though even Tiger Telematics occasionally slipped up and referred to it as Smart Ads in their publicity material A Smart Adds enabled Gizmondo cost less but would display advertisements on the Gizmondo s screen at random intervals when the user entered the home screen These advertisements would be downloaded via the device s GPRS data connection and would be targeted based on data inputted to the device A maximum of three ads would be shown per day Some ads would include special offers in the form of vouchers or barcodes and some would utilize the device s GPS system to direct users to the nearest store carrying the advertised product br However the Smart Adds service was never activated and users who paid the reduced price for a Smart Adds enabled device did not receive any advertisements through their device br br br Technical specifications br br br Successor br Former Gizmondo director Carl Freer announced to a Swedish newspaper in November his intentions for a new Gizmondo and said there were already games in place a manufacturing base in Shenzhen China and that

headed by Carl Freer and his Swedish partner Mikael Ljungman with development apparently proceeding according to the new schedule at least until September By December the console had still not appeared which Freer blamed on the difficult economic conditions The device was delayed to as a result The latest design prototype turned it into a smartphone running both Windows CE or Google Android
