The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics USSR commonly known as the Soviet Union was a transcontinental country that spanned much of Eurasia from to It was the largest country in the world by area extending across eleven time zones and sharing land borders with twelve countries br A successor state to the Russian Empire the country was nominally organized as a federal union of fifteen national republics the largest and most populous of which was the Russian SFSR in practice both its government and its economy were highly centralized until its final years It was the world s third most populous country and Europe s most populous country As a one party state governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union it was a flagship communist state Its capital as well as its largest city was Moscow Other highly urbanized centers were Leningrad Kiev Tashkent and Baku br The Soviet Union s roots lay in the October Revolution of which saw the Bolsheviks overthrow the Russian Provisional Government that formed earlier that year following the February Revolution that had dissolved the Russian Empire br The new government led by Vladimir Lenin established the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic RSFSR the world s first constitutionally socialist state The revolution was not accepted by all within the Russian Republic resulting in the Russian Civil War between the Bolsheviks and the anti communist Whites br As the war progressed in the Bolsheviks favor the RSFSR began to incorporate land acquired from the war into various puppet states which were merged into the Soviet Union in December Following Lenin s death in Joseph Stalin came to power inaugurating a period of rapid industrialization and forced collectivization that led to significant economic growth but also contributed to a famine between and that killed millions The forced labour camp system of the Gulag was also expanded in this period br During the late s Stalin conducted the Great Purge to remove actual and perceived opponents resulting in mass death imprisonment and deportation In the USSR and Nazi Germany signed a nonaggression pact despite their ideological incongruence nonetheless in Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the largest land invasion in history opening the Eastern Front of World War II br The Soviets played a decisive role in defeating the Axis powers in suffering an estimated million casualties which accounted for the majority of Allied losses In the aftermath of the war the Soviet Union consolidated the territory occupied by the Red Army forming various satellite states and undertook rapid economic development which cemented its status as a superpower br Following World War II ideological tensions with the United States eventually led to the Cold War The American led Western Bloc coalesced into NATO in prompting the Soviet Union to form its own military alliance commonly known as the Warsaw Pact in Neither side ever engaged in direct military confrontation and instead fought on an ideological basis and through proxy wars br In following Stalin s death the Soviet Union undertook a campaign of de Stalinization under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev which saw reversals and rejections of Stalinist policies This campaign caused tensions with Communist China br During the s the Soviet Union rapidly expanded its efforts in space exploration and took an early lead in the Space Race with the first artificial satellite the first human spaceflight the first space station and the first probe to land on another planet Venus The Cuban Missile Crisis of October was the closest the Cold War came to escalating into full scale nuclear war br The s saw a brief d tente in the Soviet Union s relationship with the United States but tensions emerged again following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in In the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev sought to reform the country through his policies of glasnost and perestroika In various countries of the Warsaw Pact overthrew their Soviet backed regimes and nationalist and separatist movements erupted across the entire Soviet Union br In amid efforts to reform and preserve the country as a renewed federation an attempted coup d tat against Gorbachev by hardline communists prompted the three most populous and economically developed republics Ukraine Russia and Belarus to secede from the Union On December Gorbachev officially recognized the dissolution of the Soviet Union Boris Yeltsin the leader of the RSFSR oversaw its reconstitution into the Russian Federation which became the Soviet Union s successor state all other republics emerged as fully independent post Soviet states br During its existence the Soviet Union produced many significant social and technological achievements and innovations It had the world s second largest economy and largest standing military An NPT designated state it wielded the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world As an Allied nation it was a founding member of the United Nations as well as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council Before its dissolution the USSR was one of the world s two superpowers through its hegemony in Eastern Europe global diplomatic and ideological influence particularly in the Global South military and economic strengths and scientific accomplishments br br br Etymology br br The word soviet is derived from the Russian word sovet Russian meaning council assembly advice ultimately deriving from the proto Slavic verbal stem of v t iti to inform related to Slavic v st news English wise The word sovietnik means councillor Some organizations in Russian history were called council Russian In the Russian Empire the State Council which functioned from to was referred to as a Council of Ministers br The Soviets as workers councils first appeared during the Russian Revolution Although they were quickly suppressed by the Imperial army after the February Revolution of workers and soldiers Soviets emerged throughout the country and shared power with the Russian Provisional Government The Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin demanded that all power be transferred to the Soviets and gained support from the workers and soldiers After the October Revolution in which the Bolsheviks seized power from the Provisional Government in the name of the Soviets Lenin proclaimed the formation of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic RSFSR br During the Georgian Affair of Lenin called for the Russian SFSR and other national Soviet republics to form a greater union which he initially named as the Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia Russian romanized Sojuz Sovjetskih Respublik Evropy i Azii Joseph Stalin initially resisted Lenin s proposal but ultimately accepted it and with Lenin s agreement he changed the name to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics USSR although all republics began as socialist soviet and did not change to the other order until In addition in the regional languages of several republics the word council or conciliar in the respective language was only quite late changed to an adaptation of the Russian soviet and never in others e g Ukrainian SSR br in the Latin alphabet SSSR is the abbreviation of the Russian language cognate of USSR as written in Cyrillic letters The Soviets used this abbreviation so frequently that audiences worldwide became familiar with its meaning After this the most common Russian initialization is transliteration Soyuz SSR which essentially translates to Union of SSRs in English In addition the Russian short form name transliteration Sovjetskij Sojuz which literally means Soviet Union is also commonly used but only in its unabbreviated form Since the start of the Great Patriotic War at the latest abbreviating the Russian name of the Soviet Union as has been taboo the reason being that as a Russian Cyrillic abbreviation is associated with the infamous Schutzstaffel of Nazi Germany just as SS is in English br In English language media the state was referred to as the Soviet Union or the USSR The Russian SFSR dominated the Soviet Union to such an extent that for most of the Soviet Union s existence it was commonly but incorrectly referred to as Russia According to historian Matthew White it was an open secret that the country s federal structure was window dressing for Russian dominance For that reason the people of the USSR were almost always called Russians not Soviets since everyone knew who really ran the show br br br History br br br Revolution and foundation br br Modern revolutionary activity in the Russian Empire began with the Decembrist revolt Although serfdom was abolished in it was done on terms unfavourable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries A parliament the State Duma was established in after the Russian Revolution of but Emperor Nicholas II resisted attempts to move from absolute to a constitutional monarchy Social unrest continued and was aggravated during World War I by military defeat and food shortages in major cities br A spontaneous popular demonstration in Petrograd on March demanding peace and bread culminated in the February Revolution and the abdication of Nicholas II and the imperial government The tsarist autocracy was replaced by the social democratic Russian Provisional Government which intended to conduct elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly and to continue fighting on the side of the Entente in World War I At the same time workers councils known in Russian as Soviets sprang up across the country and the most influential of them the Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies shared power with the Provisional Government Membership of the Bolshevik party had risen from members in February to members by September workers had passed a resolution in favour of the Bolshevik demand for the transfer of power to the Soviets br br The Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin pushed for communist revolution in the Soviets and on the streets adopting the slogan of All Power to the Soviets and urging the overthrow of the Provisional Government On November Bolshevik Red Guards stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd arresting the Provisional Government leaders and Lenin declared that all power was now transferred to the Soviets This event would later be officially known in Soviet bibliographies as the Great October Socialist Revolution Bolshevik figures such as Anatoly Lunacharsky Moisei Uritsky and Dmitry Manuilsky agreed that Lenin s influence on the Bolshevik party was decisive but the October insurrection was carried out according to Trotsky s not to Lenin s plan The initial stage of the October Revolution which involved the assault on Petrograd occurred largely without any human casualties br Lenin s government instituted a number of progressive measures such as universal education universal healthcare and equal rights for women Conversely the bloody Red Terror was initiated to shut down all opposition both perceived and real The terror also arose in response to a number of assassination attempts on Bolshevik senior leaders and organized insurrections against the Soviet government br br In December the Bolsheviks signed an armistice with the Central Powers though by February fighting had resumed In March the Soviets ended involvement in the war and signed the separate peace Treaty of Brest Litovsk br A long and bloody Civil War ensued between the Reds and the Whites starting in and ending in with the Reds victory It included foreign intervention the murder of the former Emperor and his family and the famine of which killed about five million people In March during a related war against Poland the Peace of Riga was signed splitting disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland and Soviet Russia Soviet Russia sought to re conquer all newly independent nations of the former Empire although their success was limited Estonia Finland Latvia and Lithuania all repelled Soviet invasions while Ukraine Belarus as a result of the Polish Soviet War Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia were occupied by the Red Army Additionally the forced requisition of food by the Soviet government led to substantial resistance of which the most notable was the Tambov Rebellion ultimately put down by the Red Army br br The Civil War had a devastating impact on the economy A black market emerged in Russia despite the threat of martial law against profiteering The ruble collapsed with barter increasingly replacing money as a medium of exchange and by heavy industry output had fallen to of levels of wages were paid with goods rather than money of locomotives were in need of repair and food requisitioning combined with the effects of seven years of war and a severe drought contributed to a famine that caused between and million deaths Coal production decreased from million tons to million tons while overall factory production also declined from million roubles to million roubles According to the noted historian David Christian the grain harvest was also slashed from million tons to million tons br br br Treaty on the Creation of the USSR br On December a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the Russian SFSR the Transcaucasian SFSR the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics These two documents were confirmed by the first Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by the heads of the delegations Mikhail Kalinin Mikhail Tskhakaya Mikhail Frunze Grigory Petrovsky and Alexander Chervyakov on December The formal proclamation was made from the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow br An intensive restructuring of the economy industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in A large part of this was done according to the Bolshevik Initial Decrees government documents signed by Vladimir Lenin One of the most prominent breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan which envisioned a major restructuring of the Soviet economy based on total electrification of Russia The plan became the prototype for subsequent Five Year Plans and was fulfilled by After the economic policy of War communism during the Russian Civil War as a prelude to fully developing socialism in the country the Soviet government permitted some private enterprise to coexist alongside nationalized industry in the s and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax br br From its creation the government in the Soviet Union was based on the one party rule of the Communist Party Bolsheviks The stated purpose was to prevent the return of capitalist exploitation and that the principles of democratic centralism would be the most effective in representing the people s will in a practical manner The debate over the future of the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after Lenin s death in Initially Lenin was to be replaced by a troika consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of the Ukrainian SSR Lev Kamenev of the Russian SFSR and Joseph Stalin of the Transcaucasian SFSR br In February the USSR was recognized by the United Kingdom The same year a Soviet Constitution was approved legitimizing the December union br According to Archie Brown the constitution was never an accurate guide to political reality in the USSR For example the fact that the Party played the leading role in making and enforcing policy was not mentioned in it until The USSR was a federative entity of many constituent republics each with its own political and administrative entities However the term Soviet Russia formally applicable only to the Russian Federative Socialist Republic was often applied to the entire country by non Soviet writers due to its domination by the Russian SFSR br br br Stalin era br br On April Stalin was named the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Lenin had appointed Stalin the head of the Workers and Peasants Inspectorate which gave Stalin considerable power By gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and outmaneuvering his rivals within the party Stalin became the undisputed leader of the country and by the end of the s established a totalitarian rule In October Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky were expelled from the Central Committee and forced into exile br In Stalin introduced the first five year plan for building a socialist economy In place of the internationalism expressed by Lenin throughout the revolution it aimed to build Socialism in One Country In industry the state assumed control over all existing enterprises and undertook an intensive program of industrialization In agriculture rather than adhering to the lead by example policy advocated by Lenin forced collectivization of farms was implemented all over the country br Famines ensued as a result causing deaths estimated at three to seven million surviving kulaks wealthy or middle class peasants were persecuted and many were sent to Gulags to do forced labor Social upheaval continued in the mid s Despite the turmoil of the mid to late s the country developed a robust industrial economy in the years preceding World War II br br Closer cooperation between the USSR and the West developed in the early s From to the country participated in the World Disarmament Conference In diplomatic relations between the United States and the USSR were established when in November the newly elected President of the United States Franklin D Roosevelt chose to recognize Stalin s Communist government formally and negotiated a new trade agreement between the two countries In September the country joined the League of Nations After the Spanish Civil War broke out in the USSR actively supported the Republican forces against the Nationalists who were supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany br In December Stalin unveiled a new constitution that was praised by supporters around the world as the most democratic constitution imaginable though there was some skepticism American historian J Arch Getty concludes Many who lauded Stalin s Soviet Union as the most democratic country on earth lived to regret their words After all the Soviet Constitution of was adopted on the eve of the Great Terror of the late s the thoroughly democratic elections to the first Supreme Soviet permitted only uncontested candidates and took place at the height of the savage violence in The civil rights personal freedoms and democratic forms promised in the Stalin constitution were trampled almost immediately and remained dead letters until long after Stalin s death br br Stalin s Great Purge resulted in the detainment or execution of many Old Bolsheviks who had participated in the October Revolution According to declassified Soviet archives the NKVD arrested more than one and a half million people in and of whom were shot Over those two years there were an average of over one thousand executions a day Scholars estimate the total death toll for the Great Purge including fatalities attributed to prison conditions to be roughly million br In after attempts to form a military alliance with Britain and France against Germany failed the Soviet Union made a dramatic shift towards Nazi Germany Almost a year after Britain and France had concluded the Munich Agreement with Germany the Soviet Union made agreements with Germany as well both militarily and economically during extensive talks Unlike the case of Britain and France the Soviet Union s agreement with Germany the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact signed on August included a secret protocol that paved the way for the Soviet invasion of Eastern European states and occupation of their territories The pact made possible the Soviet occupation of Lithuania Latvia Estonia Bessarabia northern Bukovina and eastern Poland br br On September Germany invaded Poland and on the th the Soviet Union invaded Poland as well On October Poland fell and part of the Soviet occupation zone was then handed over to Germany br On October the Soviet Union and Lithuania signed an agreement whereby the Soviet Union transferred Polish sovereignty over the Vilna region to Lithuania and on October the boundary between the Soviet occupation zone and the new territory of Lithuania was officially demarcated br On November the Soviet Union annexed Western Ukraine followed by Western Belarus on the nd br In late November unable to coerce the Republic of Finland by diplomatic means into moving its border kilometres mi back from Leningrad Stalin ordered the invasion of Finland On December the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations for invading Finland In the east the Soviet military won several decisive victories during border clashes with the Empire of Japan in and However in April the USSR signed the Soviet Japanese Neutrality Pact with Japan which the Soviets would unilaterally break in recognizing the territorial integrity of Manchukuo a Japanese puppet state The pact ensured Japan would not enter the war against the USSR on the side of Germany later br br br World War II br br Germany broke the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact and invaded the Soviet Union on June starting what is known in Russia and some other post Soviet states as the Great Patriotic War The Red Army stopped the seemingly invincible German Army at the Battle of Moscow The Battle of Stalingrad which lasted from late to early dealt a severe blow to Germany from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war After Stalingrad Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany surrendered in The German Army suffered of its military deaths in the Eastern Front Harry Hopkins a close foreign policy advisor to Franklin D Roosevelt spoke on August of the USSR s decisive role in the war saying that While in Sicily the forces of Great Britain and the United States are being opposed by German divisions the Russian front is receiving attention of approximately German divisions Up to million soldiers served in the Red Army during World War II million of which were non Slavic minorities br br The USSR suffered greatly in the war losing around million people modern Russian sources put the number at million This includes million military deaths The majority of the losses were ethnic Russians followed by ethnic Ukrainians Approximately million Soviet POWs died of starvation mistreatment or executions in just eight months of More than million people were killed in Belarus during the three years of German occupation almost a quarter of the region s population including around Jews in the Holocaust in Belarus During the war the country together with the United States the United Kingdom and China were considered the Big Four Allied powers and later became the Four Policemen that formed the basis of the United Nations Security Council It emerged as a superpower in the post war period Once denied diplomatic recognition by the Western world the USSR had official relations with practically every country by the late s A member of the United Nations at its foundation in the country became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council which gave it the right to veto any of its resolutions br The USSR in fulfillment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference broke the Soviet Japanese Neutrality Pact in April which Japan had been honoring despite their alliance with Germany and invaded Manchukuo and other Japan controlled territories on August This conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory contributing to the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War II br Soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories especially in Germany The wartime rapes were followed by decades of silence According to historian Antony Beevor whose books were banned in from some Russian schools and colleges NKVD Soviet secret police files have revealed that the leadership knew what was happening but did little to stop it It was often rear echelon units who committed the rapes According to professor Oleg Rzheshevsky Red Army officers and many privates were punished for committing atrocities The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands and possibly as many as two million br br The Soviet Union was greatly assisted in its wartime effort by the United States via Lend Lease In total the U S deliveries to the USSR through Lend Lease amounted to billion in materials over jeeps and trucks armored vehicles including tanks about of which were M Lees and M Shermans aircraft of which were Bell P Airacobras were Douglas A Havocs and were Bell P Kingcobras and million tons of food As Soviet soldiers were bearing the brunt of the war Roosevelt s advisor Harry Hopkins felt that American aid to the Soviets would hasten the war s conclusion br Roughly million tons of military equipment vehicles industrial supplies and food were shipped from the Western Hemisphere to the USSR coming from the US For comparison a total of million tons landed in Europe to supply American forces from January to May It has been estimated that American deliveries to the USSR through the Persian Corridor alone were sufficient by US Army standards to maintain sixty combat divisions in the line br br br Cold War br br During the immediate post war period the Soviet Union rebuilt and expanded its economy while maintaining its strictly centralized control It took effective control over most of the countries of Eastern Europe except Yugoslavia and later Albania turning them into satellite states The USSR bound its satellite states in a military alliance the Warsaw Pact in and an economic organization Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or Comecon a counterpart to the European Economic Community EEC from to Although nominally a defensive alliance the Warsaw Pact s primary function was to safeguard the Soviet Union s hegemony over its Eastern European satellites with the Pact s only direct military actions having been the invasions of its own member states to keep them from breaking away The USSR concentrated on its own recovery seizing and transferring most of Germany s industrial plants and it exacted war reparations from East Germany Hungary Romania and Bulgaria using Soviet dominated joint enterprises It also instituted trading arrangements deliberately designed to favour the country Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states and they followed orders from the Kremlin Historian Mark Kramer concludes The net outflow of resources from eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately billion to billion in the first decade after World War II an amount roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the Marshall Plan Later the Comecon supplied aid to the eventually victorious Chinese Communist Party and its influence grew elsewhere in the world Fearing its ambitions the Soviet Union s wartime allies the United Kingdom and the United States became its enemies In the ensuing Cold War the two sides clashed indirectly in proxy wars br br br De Stalinization and Khrushchev Thaw br br Stalin died on March Without a mutually agreeable successor the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika headed by Georgy Malenkov This did not last however and Nikita Khrushchev eventually won the ensuing power struggle by the mid s In he denounced Joseph Stalin and proceeded to ease controls over the party and society This was known as de Stalinization br Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defence of its western borders in case of another major invasion such as the German invasion of For this reason the USSR sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states dependent upon and subservient to its leadership As a result Soviet military forces were used to suppress an anti communist uprising in Hungary in br In the late s a confrontation with China regarding the Soviet rapprochement with the West and what Mao Zedong perceived as Khrushchev s revisionism led to the Sino Soviet split This resulted in a break throughout the global Marxist Leninist movement with the governments in Albania Cambodia and Somalia choosing to ally with China br br During this period of the late s and early s the USSR continued to realize scientific and technological exploits in the Space Race rivaling the United States launching the first artificial satellite Sputnik in a living dog named Laika in the first human being Yuri Gagarin in the first woman in space Valentina Tereshkova in Alexei Leonov the first person to walk in space in the first soft landing on the Moon by spacecraft Luna in and the first Moon rovers Lunokhod and Lunokhod br Khrushchev initiated The Thaw a complex shift in political cultural and economic life in the country This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods allowing a dramatic rise in living standards while maintaining high levels of economic growth Censorship was relaxed as well Khrushchev s reforms in agriculture and administration however were generally unproductive In he precipitated a crisis with the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba An agreement was made with the United States to remove nuclear missiles from both Cuba and Turkey concluding the crisis This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige resulting in his removal from power in br br br Era of Stagnation br br Following the ousting of Khrushchev another period of collective leadership ensued consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early s as the preeminent Soviet leader br In the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to crush the Prague Spring reforms In the aftermath Brezhnev justified the invasion and previous military interventions as well as any potential military interventions in the future by introducing the Brezhnev Doctrine which proclaimed any threat to Soviet rule in a Warsaw Pact state as a threat to all Warsaw Pact states therefore justifying military intervention br Brezhnev presided throughout d tente with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control SALT I SALT II Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty while at the same time building up Soviet military might br In October the third Soviet Constitution was unanimously adopted The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev s death in was one of aversion to change The long period of Brezhnev s rule had come to be dubbed one of standstill with an ageing and ossified top political leadership This period is also known as the Era of Stagnation a period of adverse economic political and social effects in the country which began during the rule of Brezhnev and continued under his successors Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko br In late the Soviet Union s military intervened in the ongoing civil war in neighboring Afghanistan effectively ending a d tente with the West br br br Perestroika and Glasnost br br Two developments dominated the decade that followed the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union s economic and political structures and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process Kenneth S Deffeyes argued in Beyond Oil that the Reagan administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil and resulted in the depletion of the country s hard currency reserves br br Brezhnev s next two successors transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition did not last long Yuri Andropov was years old and Konstantin Chernenko when they assumed power both died in less than two years In an attempt to avoid a third short lived leader in the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev In addition to the failing economy the prolonged war in Afghanistan led to increased public dissatisfaction with the Communist government Also the Chernobyl disaster in added motive force to Gorbachev s reforms He made significant changes in the economy and party leadership called perestroika His policy of glasnost freed public access to information after decades of heavy government censorship Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War In the USSR abandoned its war in Afghanistan and began to withdraw its forces In the following year Gorbachev refused to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet satellite states which paved the way for the Revolutions of In particular the standstill of the Soviet Union at the Pan European Picnic in August then set a peaceful chain reaction in motion at the end of which the Eastern Bloc collapsed With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and with East and West Germany pursuing re unification the Iron Curtain between the West and Soviet occupied regions came down br At the same time the Soviet republics started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories citing the freedom to secede in Article of the USSR constitution On April a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the War of Laws In the Russian SFSR convened a newly elected Congress of People s Deputies Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman On June the Congress declared Russia s sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the Soviet laws After a landslide victory of S j dis in Lithuania that country declared its independence restored on March citing the illegality of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states Soviet forces attempted to halt the secession by crushing popular demonstrations in Lithuania Bloody Sunday and Latvia The Barricades as a result of which numerous civilians were killed or wounded However these actions only bolstered international support for the secessionists br br A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on March in nine republics the remainder having boycotted the vote with the majority of the population in those republics voting for preservation of the Union in the form of a new federation The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost In the summer of the New Union Treaty which would have turned the country into a much looser Union was agreed upon by eight republics The signing of the treaty however was interrupted by the August Coup an attempted coup d tat by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev s reforms and reassert the central government s control over the republics After the coup collapsed Russian president Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions while Gorbachev s power was effectively ended The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics In August Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence following Lithuania s example Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August and soon afterwards the party s activities were indefinitely suspended effectively ending its rule By the fall Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside Moscow and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin who had been elected President of Russia in July br br br Dissolution and aftermath br br The remaining republics continued discussing new increasingly looser models of the Union However by December all except Russia and Kazakhstan had formally declared independence During this time Yeltsin took over what remained of the Soviet government including the Moscow Kremlin The final blow was struck on December when Ukraine the second most powerful republic voted overwhelmingly for independence Ukraine s secession ended any realistic chance of the country staying together even on a limited scale br On December the presidents of Russia Ukraine and Belarus formerly Byelorussia signed the Belavezha Accords which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States CIS in its place While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this on December the representatives of all Soviet republics except Georgia signed the Alma Ata Protocol which confirmed the accords On December Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR declaring the office extinct He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin That night the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time and the Russian tricolour was raised in its place br The following day the Supreme Soviet the highest governmental body voted both itself and the country out of existence This is generally recognized as marking the official final dissolution of the Soviet Union as a functioning state and the end of the Cold War The Soviet Army initially remained under overall CIS command but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states The few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased to function by the end of br Following the dissolution Russia was internationally recognized as the USSR s legal successor on the international stage To that end Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed Soviet overseas properties as its own Under the Lisbon Protocol Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics Since then the Russian Federation has assumed the Soviet Union s rights and obligations and is widely viewed as the USSR s successor state Ukraine has refused to recognize exclusive Russian claims to succession of the USSR and claimed such status for Ukraine as well which was codified in Articles and of its law On Legal Succession of Ukraine Since its independence in Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against Russia in foreign courts seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was owned by the USSR br In summing up the international ramifications of these events Vladislav Zubok stated The collapse of the Soviet empire was an event of epochal geopolitical military ideological and economic significance Before the dissolution the country had maintained its status as one of the world s two superpowers for four decades after World War II through its hegemony in Eastern Europe military strength economic strength and scientific research especially in space technology and weaponry br br br Post Soviet states br br The analysis of the succession of states for the post Soviet states is complex The Russian Federation is widely seen as the legal continuator state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties inheriting the full Soviet nuclear arsenal and also inherited the Soviet Union s UN membership with its permanent seat on the Security Council br Of the two other co founding states of the USSR at the time of the dissolution Ukraine was the only one that had passed laws similar to Russia claiming it is a state successor of both the Ukrainian SSR and the USSR Soviet treaties laid groundwork for Ukraine s future foreign agreements as well as leading to the country agreeing to undertake of debts of the Soviet Union for which it was going to receive its share of the USSR s foreign property Russia s position as the only continuation of the USSR that became widely accepted in the West as well as constant pressure from the Western countries allowed Russia to inherit Soviet state property abroad and conceal information about it Due to that Ukraine never ratified zero option agreement that Russian Federation had signed with other former Soviet republics as it denied disclosing of information about Soviet Gold Reserves and its Diamond Fund The dispute over former Soviet property and assets between the two former republics is still ongoing br br The conflict is unsolvable We can continue to poke Kiev handouts in the calculation of solve the problem only it won t be solved Going to a trial is also pointless for a number of European countries this is a political issue and they will make a decision clearly in whose favor What to do in this situation is an open question Search for non trivial solutions But we must remember that in with the filing of the then Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk litigation with Russia resumed in countries br Similar situation occurred with restitution of cultural property Although on February Russia and other former Soviet republics signed agreement On the return of cultural and historic property to the origin states in Minsk it was halted by the Russian State Duma that eventually passed Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation which made restitution currently impossible effectively barring the return of looted cultural heritage by Soviet troops during the Second World War to its original owners br br Estonia Latvia and Lithuania consider themselves as revivals of the three independent countries that existed prior to their occupation and annexation by the Soviet Union in They maintain that the process by which they were incorporated into the Soviet Union violated both international law and their own law and that in they were reasserting an independence that still legally existed br Nearly all of the post Soviet states suffered deep and prolonged recessions after shock therapy with poverty increasing more than tenfold In a study by the economist Steven Rosefielde he calculated that there were million premature deaths in Russia from to which he partly blames on the shock therapy that came with the Washington Consensus br In The Guardian published an analysis of the former Soviet countries twenty years after the fall of the USSR They found that GDP fell as much as percent in the s in some republics as capital flight industrial collapse hyperinflation and tax avoidance took their toll but that there was a rebound in the s and by some economies were five times as big as they were in Life expectancy has grown since in some of the countries but fallen in others likewise some held free and fair elections while others remained authoritarian br There are additionally three states that claim independence from the other internationally recognized post Soviet states but possess limited international recognition Abkhazia South Ossetia and Transnistria Donetsk and Luhansk were independent until they were annexed into Russia The Armenian separatist movement of the Republic of Artsakh Chechen separatist movement of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria the Gagauz separatist movement of the Gagauz Republic and the Talysh separatist movement of the Talysh Mughan Autonomous Republic are other such cases which have already been resolved br br br Geography br br With an area of square kilometres sq mi the Soviet Union was the world s largest country a status that is retained by the Russian Federation Covering a sixth of Earth s land surface its size was comparable to that of North America Two other successor states Kazakhstan and Ukraine rank among the top countries by land area and the largest country entirely in Europe respectively The European portion accounted for a quarter of the country s area and was the cultural and economic center The eastern part in Asia extended to the Pacific Ocean to the east and Afghanistan to the south and except some areas in Central Asia was much less populous It spanned over kilometres mi east to west across time zones and over kilometres mi north to south It had five climate zones tundra taiga steppes desert and mountains br The USSR like Russia had the world s longest border measuring over kilometres mi or circumferences of Earth Two thirds of it was a coastline The country bordered Afghanistan the People s Republic of China Czechoslovakia Finland Hungary Iran Mongolia North Korea Norway Poland Romania and Turkey from to The Bering Strait separated the USSR from the United States br The country s highest mountain was Communism Peak now Ismoil Somoni Peak in Tajikistan at metres ft The USSR also included most of the world s largest lakes the Caspian Sea shared with Iran and Lake Baikal the world s largest by volume and deepest freshwater lake that is also an internal body of water in Russia br Neighbouring countries were aware of the high levels of pollution in the Soviet Union but after the dissolution of the Soviet Union it was discovered that its environmental problems were greater than what the Soviet authorities admitted The Soviet Union was the world s second largest producer of harmful emissions In total emissions in the Soviet Union were about of those in the United States But since the Soviet GNP was only of that of the United States this means that the Soviet Union generated times more pollution than the United States per unit of GNP br The Soviet Chernobyl disaster in was the first major accident at a civilian nuclear power plant Unparalleled in the world it resulted in a large number of radioactive isotopes being released into the atmosphere Radioactive doses were scattered relatively far Although long term effects of the accident were unknown new cases of thyroid cancer which resulted from the accident s contamination were reported at the time of the accident but this led to a relatively low number of deaths WHO data Another major radioactive accident was the Kyshtym disaster br The Kola Peninsula was one of the places with major problems Around the industrial cities of Monchegorsk and Norilsk where nickel for example is mined all forests have been destroyed by contamination while the northern and other parts of Russia have been affected by emissions During the s people in the West were also interested in the radioactive hazards of nuclear facilities decommissioned nuclear submarines and the processing of nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel It was also known in the early s that the USSR had transported radioactive material to the Barents Sea and Kara Sea which was later confirmed by the Russian parliament The crash of the K Kursk submarine in in the west further raised concerns In the past there were accidents involving submarines K K a K K K and K Komsomolets br br br Government and politics br br There were three power hierarchies in the Soviet Union the legislature represented by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union the government represented by the Council of Ministers and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union CPSU the only legal party and the final policymaker in the country br br br Communist Party br br At the top of the Communist Party was the Central Committee elected at Party Congresses and Conferences In turn the Central Committee voted for a Politburo called the Presidium between and Secretariat and the general secretary First Secretary from to the de facto highest office in the Soviet Union Depending on the degree of power consolidation it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary who always was one of the Politburo members that effectively led the party and the country except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after They were not controlled by the general party membership as the key principle of the party organization was democratic centralism demanding strict subordination to higher bodies and elections went uncontested endorsing the candidates proposed from above br The Communist Party maintained its dominance over the state mainly through its control over the system of appointments All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU Of the party heads themselves Stalin and Khrushchev were Premiers Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the mostly ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet the nominal head of state The institutions at lower levels were overseen and at times supplanted by primary party organizations br However in practice the degree of control the party was able to exercise over the state bureaucracy particularly after the death of Stalin was far from total with the bureaucracy pursuing different interests that were at times in conflict with the party nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom although factions were officially banned br br br Government br br The Supreme Soviet successor of the Congress of Soviets was nominally the highest state body for most of the Soviet history at first acting as a rubber stamp institution approving and implementing all decisions made by the party However its powers and functions were extended in the late s s and s including the creation of new state commissions and committees It gained additional powers relating to the approval of the Five Year Plans and the government budget The Supreme Soviet elected a Presidium successor of the Central Executive Committee to wield its power between plenary sessions ordinarily held twice a year and appointed the Supreme Court the Procurator General and the Council of Ministers known before as the Council of People s Commissars headed by the Chairman Premier and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society State and party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central institutions although the Russian SFSR unlike the other constituent republics for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU being ruled directly by the union wide party until Local authorities were organized likewise into party committees local Soviets and executive committees While the state system was nominally federal the party was unitary br The state security police the KGB and its predecessor agencies played an important role in Soviet politics It was instrumental in the Red Terror and Great Purge but was brought under strict party control after Stalin s death Under Yuri Andropov the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party state structure culminating in the anti corruption campaign targeting high ranking party officials in the late s and early s br br br Separation of power and reform br br The constitution which was promulgated in and did not limit state power No formal separation of powers existed between the Party Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers that represented executive and legislative branches of the government The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed Bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin and Stalin as well as after Khrushchev s dismissal itself due to a decision by both the Politburo and the Central Committee All leaders of the Communist Party before Gorbachev died in office except Georgy Malenkov and Khrushchev both dismissed from the party leadership amid internal struggle within the party br Between and facing considerable opposition Mikhail Gorbachev enacted reforms shifting power away from the highest bodies of the party and making the Supreme Soviet less dependent on them The Congress of People s Deputies was established the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held in March the first in Soviet history The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet which became a full time parliament and much stronger than before For the first time since the s it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and Council of Ministers In Gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the President of the Soviet Union concentrated power in his executive office independent of the party and subordinated the government now renamed the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR to himself br Tensions grew between the Union wide authorities under Gorbachev reformists led in Russia by Boris Yeltsin and controlling the newly elected Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and communist hardliners On August a group of hardliners staged a coup attempt The coup failed and the State Council of the Soviet Union became the highest organ of state power in the period of transition Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary only remaining President for the final months of the existence of the USSR br br br Judicial system br br The judiciary was not independent of the other branches of government The Supreme Court supervised the lower courts People s Court and applied the law as established by the constitution or as interpreted by the Supreme Soviet The Constitutional Oversight Committee reviewed the constitutionality of laws and acts The Soviet Union used the inquisitorial system of Roman law where the judge procurator and defence attorney collaborate to establish the truth br br br Human rights br br Human rights in the Soviet Union were severely limited The Soviet Union was a totalitarian state from until and a one party state until Freedom of speech was suppressed and dissent was punished Independent political activities were not tolerated whether these involved participation in free labor unions private corporations independent churches or opposition political parties The freedom of movement within and especially outside the country was limited The state restricted rights of citizens to private property br The Soviet conception of human rights was very different from international law According to Soviet legal theory it is the government who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted against the individual The Soviet state was considered as the source of human rights Therefore the Soviet legal system regarded law as an arm of politics and courts as agencies of the government Extensive extrajudicial powers were given to the Soviet secret police agencies The Soviet government in practice significantly curbed the rule of law civil liberties protection of law freedom of movement and guarantees of property which were considered as examples of bourgeois morality by Soviet law theorists such as Andrey Vyshinsky According to Vladimir Lenin the purpose of socialist courts was not to eliminate terror but to substantiate it and legitimize it in principle br The Soviet Union signed legally binding human rights documents such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in but they were neither widely known or accessible to people living under Communist rule nor were they taken seriously by the Communist authorities br br br Foreign relations br br During his rule Stalin always made the final policy decisions Otherwise Soviet foreign policy was set by the commission on the Foreign Policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or by the party s highest body the Politburo Operations were handled by the separate Ministry of Foreign Affairs It was known as the People s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs or Narkomindel until The most influential spokesmen were Georgy Chicherin Maxim Litvinov Vyacheslav Molotov Andrey Vyshinsky and Andrei Gromyko Intellectuals were based in the Moscow State Institute of International Relations br br Comintern or Communist International was an international communist organization based in the Kremlin that advocated world communism The Comintern intended to struggle by all available means including armed force for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the state It was abolished as a conciliatory measure toward Britain and the United States br Comecon the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance Russian Sovet Ekonomicheskoy Vzaimopomoshchi SEV was an economic organization from to under Soviet control that comprised the countries of the Eastern Bloc along with several communist states elsewhere in the world Moscow was concerned about the Marshall Plan and Comecon was meant to prevent countries in the Soviets sphere of influence from moving towards that of the Americans and Southeast Asia Comecon was the Eastern Bloc s reply to the formation in Western Europe of the Organization for European Economic Co Operation OEEC br The Warsaw Pact was a collective defence alliance formed in among the USSR and its satellite states in Eastern Europe during the Cold War The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Comecon the regional economic organization for the socialist states of Central and Eastern Europe The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO Although nominally a defensive alliance the Pact s primary function was to safeguard the Soviet Union s hegemony over its Eastern European satellites with the Pact s only direct military actions having been the invasions of its own member states to keep them from breaking away br The Cominform informally the Communist Information Bureau and officially the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers Parties was the first official agency of the international Marxist Leninist movement since the dissolution of the Comintern in Its role was to coordinate actions between Marxist Leninist parties under Soviet direction Stalin used it to order Western European communist parties to abandon their exclusively parliamentarian line and instead concentrate on politically impeding the operations of the Marshall Plan the U S program of rebuilding Europe after the war and developing its economy It also coordinated international aid to Marxist Leninist insurgents during the Greek Civil War in It expelled Yugoslavia in after Josip Broz Tito insisted on an independent program Its newspaper For a Lasting Peace for a People s Democracy promoted Stalin s positions The Cominform s concentration on Europe meant a deemphasis on world revolution in Soviet foreign policy By enunciating a uniform ideology it allowed the constituent parties to focus on personalities rather than issues br br br Early policies br br The Marxist Leninist leadership of the Soviet Union intensely debated foreign policy issues and changed directions several times Even after Stalin assumed dictatorial control in the late s there were debates and he frequently changed positions br During the country s early period it was assumed that Communist revolutions would break out soon in every major industrial country and it was the Russian responsibility to assist them The Comintern was the weapon of choice A few revolutions did break out but they were quickly suppressed the longest lasting one was in Hungary the Hungarian Soviet Republic lasted only from March to August The Russian Bolsheviks were in no position to give any help br By Lenin Trotsky and Stalin realized that capitalism had stabilized itself in Europe and there would not be any widespread revolutions anytime soon It became the duty of the Russian Bolsheviks to protect what they had in Russia and avoid military confrontations that might destroy their bridgehead Russia was now a pariah state along with Germany The two came to terms in with the Treaty of Rapallo that settled long standing grievances At the same time the two countries secretly set up training programs for the illegal German army and air force operations at hidden camps in the USSR br Moscow eventually stopped threatening other states and instead worked to open peaceful relationships in terms of trade and diplomatic recognition The United Kingdom dismissed the warnings of Winston Churchill and a few others about a continuing Marxist Leninist threat and opened trade relations and de facto diplomatic recognition in There was hope for a settlement of the pre war Tsarist debts but it was repeatedly postponed Formal recognition came when the new Labour Party came to power in All the other countries followed suit in opening trade relations Henry Ford opened large scale business relations with the Soviets in the late s hoping that it would lead to long term peace Finally in the United States officially recognized the USSR a decision backed by the public opinion and especially by US business interests that expected an opening of a new profitable market br In the late s and early s Stalin ordered Marxist Leninist parties across the world to strongly oppose non Marxist political parties labor unions or other organizations on the left which they labelled social fascists In the usage of the Soviet Union and of the Comintern and its affiliated parties in this period the epithet fascist was used to describe capitalist society in general and virtually any anti Soviet or anti Stalinist activity or opinion Stalin reversed himself in with the Popular Front program that called on all Marxist parties to join with all anti Fascist political labor and organizational forces that were opposed to fascism especially of the Nazi variety br The rapid growth of power in Nazi Germany encouraged both Paris and Moscow to form a military alliance and the Franco Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance was signed in May A firm believer in collective security Stalin s foreign minister Maxim Litvinov worked very hard to form a closer relationship with France and Britain br In half a year after the Munich Agreement the USSR attempted to form an anti Nazi alliance with France and Britain Adolf Hitler proposed a better deal which would give the USSR control over much of Eastern Europe through the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact In September Germany invaded Poland and the USSR also invaded later that month resulting in the partition of Poland In response Britain and France declared war on Germany marking the beginning of World War II br br br World War II br br Up until his death in Joseph Stalin controlled all foreign relations of the Soviet Union during the interwar period Despite the increasing build up of Germany s war machine and the outbreak of the Second Sino Japanese War the Soviet Union did not cooperate with any other nation choosing to follow its own path However after Operation Barbarossa the Soviet Union s priorities changed Despite previous conflict with the United Kingdom Vyacheslav Molotov dropped his post war border demands br br br Cold War br br The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc which began following World War II in The term cold war is used because there was no large scale fighting directly between the two superpowers but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as psychological warfare propaganda campaigns espionage far reaching embargoes rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race br br br Administrative divisions br br Constitutionally the USSR was a federation of constituent Union Republics which were either unitary states such as Ukraine or Byelorussia SSRs or federations such as Russia or Transcaucasia SFSRs all four being the founding republics who signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR in December In during the national delimitation in Central Asia Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were formed from parts of Russia s Turkestan ASSR and two Soviet dependencies the Khorezm and Bukharan PSPs In Tajikistan was split off from the Uzbekistan SSR With the constitution of the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved resulting in its constituent republics of Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan being elevated to Union Republics while Kazakhstan and Kirghizia were split off from the Russian SFSR resulting in the same status In August Moldavia was formed from parts of Ukraine and Soviet occupied Bessarabia and Ukrainian SSR Estonia Latvia and Lithuania were also annexed by the Soviet Union and turned into SSRs which was not recognized by most of the international community and was considered an illegal occupation After the Soviet invasion of Finland the Karelo Finnish SSR was formed on annexed territory as a Union Republic in March and then incorporated into Russia as the Karelian ASSR in Between July and September there were union republics see map below br While nominally a union of equals in practice the Soviet Union was dominated by Russians The domination was so absolute that for most of its existence the country was commonly but incorrectly referred to as Russia While the Russian SFSR was technically only one republic within the larger union it was by far the largest both in terms of population and area most powerful and most highly developed The Russian SFSR was also the industrial center of the Soviet Union Historian Matthew White wrote that it was an open secret that the country s federal structure was window dressing for Russian dominance For that reason the people of the USSR were usually called Russians not Soviets since everyone knew who really ran the show br br br Military br br Under the Military Law of September the Soviet Armed Forces consisted of the Land Forces the Air Force the Navy Joint State Political Directorate OGPU and the Internal Troops The OGPU later became independent and in joined the NKVD secret police and so its internal troops were under the joint leadership of the defense and internal commissariats After World War II Strategic Missile Forces Air Defense Forces and National Civil Defense Forces were formed which ranked first third and sixth in the official Soviet system of importance ground forces were second Air Force fourth and Navy fifth br The army had the greatest political influence In there served two million soldiers divided between motorized and armored divisions Until the early s the Soviet navy was a rather small military branch but after the Caribbean crisis under the leadership of Sergei Gorshkov it expanded significantly It became known for battlecruisers and submarines In there served men The Soviet Air Force focused on a fleet of strategic bombers and during war situation was to eradicate enemy infrastructure and nuclear capacity The air force also had a number of fighters and tactical bombers to support the army in the war Strategic missile forces had more than intercontinental ballistic missiles ICBMs deployed between bases and command centers br In the post war period the Soviet Army was directly involved in several military operations abroad These included the suppression of the uprising in East Germany Hungarian revolution and the invasion of Czechoslovakia The Soviet Union also participated in the war in Afghanistan between and br In the Soviet Union general conscription applied meaning all able bodied males aged and older were drafted in the armed forces br br br Economy br br The Soviet Union adopted a command economy whereby production and distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of war communism which involved the nationalization of industry centralized distribution of output coercive or forced requisition of agricultural production and attempts to eliminate money circulation private enterprises and free trade The barrier troops were also used to enforce Bolshevik control over food supplies in areas controlled by the Red Army a role which soon earned them the hatred of the Russian civilian population After the severe economic collapse Lenin replaced war communism by the New Economic Policy NEP in legalizing free trade and private ownership of small businesses The economy steadily recovered as a result br After a long debate among the members of the Politburo about the course of economic development by upon gaining control of the country Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning starting forced collectivization of agriculture and enacting draconian labor legislation Resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization which significantly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the s The primary motivation for industrialization was preparation for war mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalist world As a result the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II The war caused extensive devastation of the Soviet economy and infrastructure which required massive reconstruction br br By the early s the Soviet economy had become relatively self sufficient for most of the period until the creation of Comecon only a tiny share of domestic products was traded internationally After the creation of the Eastern Bloc external trade rose rapidly However the influence of the world economy on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the s During the arms race of the Cold War the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry At the same time the USSR became the largest arms exporter to the Third World A portion of Soviet resources during the Cold War were allocated in aid to the Soviet aligned states The Soviet Union s military budget in the s was gigantic forming of the entire federal budget and accounting to of the USSR s GDP in the s br br From the s until its dissolution in late the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged The economy was formally directed by central planning carried out by Gosplan and organized in five year plans However in practice the plans were highly aggregated and provisional subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors All critical economic decisions were taken by the political leadership Allocated resources and plan targets were usually denominated in rubles rather than in physical goods Credit was discouraged but widespread The final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized unplanned contracting Although in theory prices were legally set from above in practice they were often negotiated and informal horizontal links e g between producer factories were widespread br A number of basic services were state funded such as education and health care In the manufacturing sector heavy industry and defence were prioritized over consumer goods Consumer goods particularly outside large cities were often scarce of poor quality and limited variety Under the command economy consumers had almost no influence on production and the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices A massive unplanned second economy grew up at low levels alongside the planned one providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not The legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of br br Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely by most accounts the economy continued to expand until the mid s During the s and s it had comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West However after the growth while still positive steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital stock the rate of capital increase was only surpassed by Japan br br Overall the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union between and was slightly above the world average based on countries A study published in the American Journal of Public Health claimed that citing World Bank data the Soviet model provided a better quality of life and human development than market economies at the same level of economic development in most cases According to Stanley Fischer and William Easterly growth could have been faster By their calculation per capita income in should have been twice higher than it was considering the amount of investment education and population The authors attribute this poor performance to the low productivity of capital Steven Rosefielde states that the standard of living declined due to Stalin s despotism While there was a brief improvement after his death it lapsed into stagnation br In Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of perestroika His policies relaxed state control over enterprises but did not replace it by market incentives resulting in a sharp decline in output The economy already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues started to collapse Prices were still fixed and the property was still largely state owned until after the country s dissolution For most of the period after World War II until its collapse Soviet GDP PPP was the second largest in the world and third during the second half of the s although on a per capita basis it was behind that of First World countries Compared to countries with similar per capita GDP in the Soviet Union experienced significant growth br In the country had a Human Development Index of placing it in the high category of human development It was the third highest in the Eastern Bloc behind Czechoslovakia and East Germany and the th in the world of countries br br br Energy br br The need for fuel declined in the Soviet Union from the s to the s both per ruble of gross social product and per ruble of industrial product At the start this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between and From and it grew even slower only David Wilson a historian believed that the gas industry would account for of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR s collapse The USSR in theory would have continued to have an economic growth rate of during the s because of Soviet energy fields However the energy sector faced many difficulties among them the country s high military expenditure and hostile relations with the First World br In the Soviet Union had a pipeline network of kilometres mi for crude oil and another kilometres mi for natural gas Petroleum and petroleum based products natural gas metals wood agricultural products and a variety of manufactured goods primarily machinery arms and military equipment were exported In the s and s the USSR heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn hard currency At its peak in it was the largest producer and second largest exporter of crude oil surpassed only by Saudi Arabia br br br Science and technology br br The Soviet Union placed great emphasis on science and technology within its economy however the most remarkable Soviet successes in technology such as producing the world s first space satellite typically were the responsibility of the military Lenin believed that the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was upon its founding Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenin s belief by developing massive networks research and development organizations In the early s the Soviets awarded of chemistry PhDs to women compared to only in the United States By Soviet scientists were among the world s best trained specialists in several areas such as Energy physics selected areas of medicine mathematics welding and military technologies Due to rigid state planning and bureaucracy the Soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry biology and computers when compared to the First World The Soviet government opposed and persecuted geneticists in favour of Lysenkoism a pseudoscience rejected by the scientific community in the Soviet Union and abroad but supported by Stalin s inner circles Implemented in the USSR and China it resulted in reduced crop yields and is widely believed to have contributed to the Great Chinese Famine The Soviet Union also had more scientists and engineers relative to the world population than any other major country due to the strong levels of state support for scientific developments by the s br Under the Reagan administration Project Socrates determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the US was using In the case of the US economic prioritization was being used for indigenous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors In contrast the USSR was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and use of the worldwide technology to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage However technology based planning was executed in a centralized government centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility This was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform br br br Space program br br At the end of the s the USSR constructed the first satellite Sputnik which marked the beginning of the Space Race a competition to achieve superior spaceflight capability with the United States This was followed by other successful satellites most notably Sputnik where test dogs were sent to space On April the USSR launched Vostok which carried Yuri Gagarin making him the first human to ever be launched into space and complete a space journey The first plans for space shuttles and orbital stations were drawn up in Soviet design offices but personal disputes between designers and management prevented their development br In terms of the Luna program the USSR only had automated spacecraft launches with no crewed spacecraft passing on the Moon part of Space Race which was won by the Americans The Soviet public s reaction to the American moon landing was mixed The Soviet government limited the release of information about it which affected the reaction A portion of the populace did not give it attention and another portion was angered br In the s specific proposals for the design of a space shuttle emerged but shortcomings especially in the electronics industry rapid overheating of electronics postponed it till the end of the s The first shuttle the Buran flew in but without a human crew Another Ptichka endured prolonged construction and was canceled in For their launch into space there is today an unused superpower rocket Energia which is the most powerful in the world br In the late s the Soviet Union built the Mir orbital station It was built on the construction of Salyut stations and its only role was civilian grade research tasks Mir was the only orbital station in operation from to Gradually other modules were added to it including American modules However the station deteriorated rapidly after a fire on board so in it was decided to bring it into the atmosphere where it burned down br br br Transport br br Transport was a vital component of the country s economy The economic centralization of the late s and s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale most notably the establishment of Aeroflot an aviation enterprise The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land water and air However due to inadequate maintenance much of the road water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward compared to the First World br Soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world it was also better developed than most of its Western counterparts By the late s and early s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burdens from the railways and to improve the Soviet government budget The street network and automotive industry remained underdeveloped and dirt roads were common outside major cities Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had By the early to mid s the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones Meanwhile the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction The underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport br Despite improvements several aspects of the transport sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure lack of investment corruption and bad decision making Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services br The Soviet merchant navy was one of the largest in the world br br br Demographics br br Excess deaths throughout World War I and the Russian Civil War including the famine of that was triggered by Lenin s war communism policies amounted to a combined total of million some million in the s and more than million in The postwar Soviet population was to million smaller than it would have been if pre war demographic growth had continued According to Catherine Merridale reasonable estimate would place the total number of excess deaths for the whole period somewhere around million br The birth rate of the USSR decreased from per thousand in to in mainly due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages The mortality rate demonstrated a gradual decrease as well from per thousand in to in In general the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union and in some cases even increased in the post World War II period a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics Soviet Europe moved towards sub replacement fertility while Soviet Central Asia continued to exhibit population growth well above replacement level fertility br The late s and the s witnessed a reversal of the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR and was especially notable among men of working age but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country An analysis of the official data from the late s showed that after worsening in the late s and the early s adult mortality began to improve again The infant mortality rate increased from in to in Some researchers regarded the rise as mostly real a consequence of worsening health conditions and services The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials and the Soviet government stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late s when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real causes br br br Urbanism br br The Soviet Union imposed heavy control on city growth preventing some cities from reaching their full potential while promoting others br For the entirety of its existence the most populous cities were Moscow and Leningrad both in Russian SFSR with the third far place taken by Kiev Ukrainian SSR At its inception the Top was completed by Kharkov Ukrainian SSR and Baku Azerbaijan SSR but by the end of the century Tashkent Uzbek SSR which had assumed the position of capital of Soviet Central Asia had risen to fourth place Another city worth mentioning is Minsk Byelorussian SSR which saw rapid growth during the th century rising from the nd most populous in the union to the th br br br Women and fertility br br Under Lenin the state made explicit commitments to promote the equality of men and women Many early Russian feminists and ordinary Russian working women actively participated in the Revolution and many more were affected by the events of that period and the new policies Beginning in October Lenin s government liberalized divorce and abortion laws decriminalized homosexuality re criminalized in permitted cohabitation and ushered in a host of reforms However without birth control the new system produced many broken marriages as well as countless out of wedlock children The epidemic of divorces and extramarital affairs created social hardships when Soviet leaders wanted people to concentrate their efforts on growing the economy Giving women control over their fertility also led to a precipitous decline in the birth rate perceived as a threat to their country s military power By Stalin reversed most of the liberal laws ushering in a pronatalist era that lasted for decades br By Russia became the first great power to grant women the right to vote After heavy casualties in World War I and II women outnumbered men in Russia by a ratio This contributed to the larger role women played in Russian society compared to other great powers at the time br br br Education br br Anatoly Lunacharsky became the first People s Commissar for Education of Soviet Russia In the beginning the Soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the elimination of illiteracy All left handed children were forced to write with their right hand in the Soviet school system Literate people were automatically hired as teachers For a short period quality was sacrificed for quantity By Stalin could announce that illiteracy had been eliminated Throughout the s social mobility rose sharply which has been attributed to reforms in education In the aftermath of World War II the country s educational system expanded dramatically which had a tremendous effect In the s nearly all children had access to education the only exception being those living in remote areas Nikita Khrushchev tried to make education more accessible making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society Education also became important in giving rise to the New Man Citizens directly entering the workforce had the constitutional right to a job and to free vocational training br The education system was highly centralized and universally accessible to all citizens with affirmative action for applicants from nations associated with cultural backwardness However as part of a general antisemitic policy an unofficial Jewish quota was applied in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting Jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations The Brezhnev era also introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local Komsomol party secretary According to statistics from the number of higher education students per the population of was for the USSR compared to for the US br br br Nationalities and ethnic groups br br The Soviet Union was an ethnically diverse country with more than distinct ethnic groups The total population of the country was estimated at million in According to a estimate the majority of the population were Russians followed by Ukrainians and Uzbeks Overall in the ethnic demography of the country showed that was East Slavic was Turkic were Armenians were Balts were Finnic were Tajik were Georgian were Moldovan and were of other various ethnic groups br All citizens of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation The ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen by the child s parents If the parents did not agree the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father Partly due to Soviet policies some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones such as the Mingrelians of Georgia who were classified with the linguistically related Georgians Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated while others were brought in by force Russians Belarusians and Ukrainians who were all East Slavic and Orthodox shared close cultural ethnic and religious ties while other groups did not With multiple nationalities living in the same territory ethnic antagonisms developed over the years br Members of various ethnicities participated in legislative bodies Organs of power like the Politburo the Secretariat of the Central Committee etc were formally ethnically neutral but in reality ethnic Russians were overrepresented although there were also non Russian leaders in the Soviet leadership such as Joseph Stalin Grigory Zinoviev Nikolai Podgorny or Andrei

health conditions were significantly behind those of developed countries As Lenin later noted Either the lice will defeat socialism or socialism will defeat the lice The Soviet health care system was conceived by the People s Commissariat for Health in Under the Semashko model health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge a revolutionary concept at the time Article of the Soviet Constitution gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR Before Leonid Brezhnev became general secretary the Soviet healthcare system was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists This changed however from Brezhnev s accession and Mikhail Gorbachev s tenure as leader during which the health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision Minister of Health Yevgeniy Chazov during the th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union while highlighting such successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world recognized the system s areas for improvement and felt that billions of rubles were squandered br After the revolution life expectancy for all age groups went up This statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system These improvements continued into the s when statistics indicated that the life expectancy briefly surpassed that of the United States Life expectancy started to decline in the s possibly because of alcohol abuse At the same time infant mortality began to rise After the government stopped publishing statistics on the matter This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was the highest while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union br br br Dentistry br Soviet dental technology and dental health were considered notoriously bad In the average year old had to cavities fillings or missing teeth Toothpaste was often not available and toothbrushes did not conform to standards of modern dentistry br br br Language br br Under Lenin the government gave small language groups their own writing systems The development of these writing systems was highly successful even though some flaws were detected During the later days of the USSR countries with the same multilingual situation implemented similar policies A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed dialectally greatly from each other When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication it would attain official language status There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system therefore their speakers were forced to have a second language There are examples where the government retreated from this policy most notably under Stalin where education was discontinued in languages that were not widespread These languages were then assimilated into another language mostly Russian During World War II some minority languages were banned and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy br As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Union s many languages Russian de facto functioned as an official language as the language of interethnic communication Russian but only assumed the de jure status as the official national language in br br br Religion br br Christianity and Islam had the highest number of adherents among the religious citizens Eastern Christianity predominated among Christians with Russia s traditional Russian Orthodox Church being the largest Christian denomination About of the Soviet Union s Muslims were Sunnis with Shias being concentrated in the Azerbaijan SSR Smaller groups included Roman Catholics Jews Buddhists and a variety of Protestant denominations especially Baptists and Lutherans br Religious influence had been strong in the Russian Empire The Russian Orthodox Church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out official state functions The immediate period following the establishment of the Soviet state included a struggle against the Orthodox Church which the revolutionaries considered an ally of the former ruling classes br In Soviet law the freedom to hold religious services was constitutionally guaranteed although the ruling Communist Party regarded religion as incompatible with the Marxist spirit of scientific materialism In practice the Soviet system subscribed to a narrow interpretation of this right and in fact used a range of official measures to discourage religion and curb the activities of religious groups br The Council of People s Commissars decree establishing the Russian SFSR as a secular state also decreed that the teaching of religion in all places where subjects of general instruction are taught is forbidden Citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately Among further restrictions those adopted in included express prohibitions on a range of church activities including meetings for organized Bible study Both Christian and non Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the s and s By as many as of the churches synagogues and mosques that had been operating in were closed the majority of them were demolished or re purposed for state needs with little concern for their historic and cultural value br More than Orthodox priests were shot in alone Only a twelfth of the Russian Orthodox Church s priests were left functioning in their parishes by In the period between and the number of Orthodox Churches in Russia fell from to less than br The Soviet Union was officially a secular state but a government sponsored program of forced conversion to atheism was conducted under the doctrine of state atheism The government targeted religions based on state interests and while most organized religions were never outlawed religious property was confiscated believers were harassed and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools In the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the propaganda campaign Accordingly although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the formal structures and mass media and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions teachers state bureaucrats soldiers to be openly religious While persecution accelerated following Stalin s rise to power a revival of Orthodoxy was fostered by the government during World War II and the Soviet authorities sought to control the Russian Orthodox Church rather than liquidate it During the first five years of Soviet power the Bolsheviks executed Russian Orthodox bishops and over Russian Orthodox priests Many others were imprisoned or exiled Believers were harassed and persecuted Most seminaries were closed and the publication of most religious material was prohibited By only churches remained open out of about in existence before World War I br Convinced that religious anti Sovietism had become a thing of the past and with the looming threat of war the Stalin administration began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late s Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during World War II Amid other accommodations to religious faith after the German invasion churches were reopened Radio Moscow began broadcasting a religious hour and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Sergius of Moscow was held in Stalin had the support of the majority of the religious people in the USSR even through the late s The general tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths br Under Nikita Khrushchev the state leadership clashed with the churches in a period when atheism was emphasized in the educational curriculum and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views During this period the number of churches fell from to from to and the number of synagogues dropped from to The number of working mosques also declined falling from to within a decade br Religious institutions remained monitored by the Soviet government but churches synagogues temples and mosques were all given more leeway in the Brezhnev era Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the government again warmed to the point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch Alexy I with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in recorded of the Soviet population as active religious believers br br br Culture br br The culture of the Soviet Union passed through several stages during the USSR s existence During the first decade following the revolution there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people On the other hand hundreds of intellectuals writers and artists were exiled or executed and their work banned such as Nikolay Gumilyov who was shot for alleged conspiracy against the Bolsheviks and Yevgeny Zamyatin br The government encouraged a variety of trends In art and literature numerous schools some traditional and others radically experimental proliferated Communist writers Maxim Gorky and Vladimir Mayakovsky were active during this time As a means of influencing a largely illiterate society films received encouragement from the state and much of director Sergei Eisenstein s best work dates from this period br During Stalin s rule the Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government imposed style of socialist realism with all other trends being severely repressed with rare exceptions such as Mikhail Bulgakov s works Many writers were imprisoned and killed br Following the Khrushchev Thaw censorship was diminished During this time a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed characterized by conformist public life and an intense focus on personal life Greater experimentation in art forms was again permissible resulting in the production of more sophisticated and subtly critical work The government loosened its emphasis on socialist realism thus for instance many protagonists of the novels of author Yury Trifonov concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism Underground dissident literature known as samizdat developed during this late period In architecture the Khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style of Stalin s epoch In music in response to the increasing popularity of forms of popular music like jazz in the West many jazz orchestras were permitted throughout the USSR notably the Melodiya Ensemble named after the principle record label in the USSR br In the second half of the s Gorbachev s policies of perestroika and glasnost significantly expanded freedom of expression throughout the country in the media and the press br br br Sport br br In summer of in Moscow was established the Proletarian Sports Society Dynamo as a sports organization of Soviet secret police Cheka br On July the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party Bolsheviks adopted a statement About the party s tasks in sphere of physical culture In the statement was determined the role of physical culture in Soviet society and the party s tasks in political leadership of physical culture movement in the country br The Soviet Olympic Committee formed on April and the IOC recognized the new body in its th session In the same year when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement The Summer Olympics in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes The Soviet Union was the biggest rival to the United States at the Summer Olympics winning six of its nine appearances at the games and also topping the medal tally at the Winter Olympics six times The Soviet Union s Olympics success has been attributed to its large investment in sports to demonstrate its superpower image and political influence on a global stage br The Soviet Union national ice hockey team won nearly every world championship and Olympic tournament between and and never failed to medal in any International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF tournament in which they competed br Soviet Olympic team was notorious for skirting the edge of amateur rules All Soviet athletes held some nominal jobs but were in fact state sponsored and trained full time According to many experts that gave the Soviet Union a huge advantage over the United States and other Western countries whose athletes were students or real amateurs Indeed the Soviet Union monopolized the top place in the medal standings after and until its collapse placed second only once in the Winter games after another Eastern bloc nation the GDR Amateur rules were relaxed only in the late s and were almost completely abolished in the s after the fall of the USSR br According to British journalist Andrew Jennings a KGB colonel stated that the agency s officers had posed as anti doping authorities from the International Olympic Committee IOC to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were rescued with these tremendous efforts Documents obtained in revealed the Soviet Union s plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles Dated prior to the country s decision to boycott the Games the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program along with suggestions for further enhancements br br br Legacy br br The legacy of the USSR remains a controversial topic The socio economic nature of communist states such as the USSR especially under Stalin has also been much debated varyingly being labelled a form of bureaucratic collectivism state capitalism state socialism or a totally unique mode of production br The USSR implemented a broad range of policies over a long period of time with a large amount of conflicting policies being implemented by different leaders Some have a positive view of it whilst others are critical towards the country calling it a repressive oligarchy The opinions on the USSR are complex and have changed over time with different generations having different views on the matter as well as on Soviet policies corresponding to separate time periods during its history br br Western academicians published various analyses of the post Soviet states development claiming that the dissolution was followed by a severe drop in economic and social conditions in these countries including a rapid increase in poverty crime corruption unemployment homelessness rates of disease infant mortality and domestic violence as well as demographic losses income inequality and the rise of an oligarchical class along with decreases in calorie intake life expectancy adult literacy and income Between and and the Gini ratio increased by an average of points for all former Soviet republics According to Western analysis the economic shocks that accompanied wholesale privatization were associated with sharp increases in mortality Russia Kazakhstan Latvia Lithuania and Estonia saw a tripling of unemployment and a increase in male death rates between and and in the following decades only five or six of the post communist states are on a path to joining the wealthy capitalist West while most are falling behind some to such an extent that it will take over fifty years to catch up to where they were before the fall of the Soviet Bloc However virtually all the former Soviet republics were able to turn their economies around and increase GDP to multiple times what it was under the USSR though with large wealth disparities and many post soviet economies described as oligarchic br Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union annual polling by the Levada Center has shown that over of Russia s population regretted this event with the only exception to this being in the year when support for the Soviet Union dipped below percent A poll showed that of Russians regretted the fall of the Soviet Union setting a year record and the majority of these regretting opinions came from people older than In polls conducted by the Levada Center found that of Russians agreed that the Soviet era was the greatest era in their country s history br According to the New Russia Barometer NRB polls by the Centre for the Study of Public Policy of Russian respondents reported a positive impression of the Soviet Union in This increased to about of NRB respondents in dropping slightly to in Throughout the s an average of of NRB respondents supported the restoration of the Soviet Union br In a poll a record of Russians indicated they had a mostly very favourable view of Joseph Stalin In Armenia of respondents said the USSR collapse did good while said it did harm In Kyrgyzstan of respondents said the collapse of the USSR did good while said it did harm In a Rating Sociological Group poll of Ukrainian respondents had a positive opinion of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev who ruled the Soviet Union from to while viewing Lenin Stalin and Gorbachev very negatively A poll conducted by the Levada Center found that of Russians prefer the USSR s political system while prefer the current political system and would prefer a Western democracy A further of people polled preferred the Soviet system of central planning while prefer a market based system According to the Levada Center s polls the primary reasons cited for Soviet nostalgia are the advantages of the shared economic union between the Soviet republics including perceived financial stability This was referenced by up to of respondents in At least also lamented the loss of the Soviet Union s global political superpower status About cited the loss of social trust and capital The remainder of the respondents cited a mix of reasons ranging from practical travel difficulties to a sense of national displacement br The period of World War II is still known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War The war became a topic of great importance in cinema literature history lessons at school the mass media and the arts As a result of the massive losses suffered by the military and civilians during the conflict Victory Day celebrated on May is still one of the most important and emotional dates in Russia Catherine Wanner asserts that Victory Day commemorations are a vehicle for Soviet nostalgia as they kept alive a mythology of Soviet grandeur of solidarity among the Sovietskii narod and of a sense of self as citizen of a superpower state br Russian Victory Day parades are organized annually in most cities with the central military parade taking place in Moscow just as during the Soviet times Additionally the recently introduced Immortal Regiment on May sees millions of Russians carry the portraits of their relatives who fought in the war Russia also retains other Soviet holidays such as the Defender of the Fatherland Day February International Women s Day March and International Workers Day br br br In the former Soviet republics br br In some post Soviet republics there is a more negative view of the USSR although there is no unanimity on the matter In large part due to the Holodomor ethnic Ukrainians have a negative view of the Soviet Union Russian speaking Ukrainians of Ukraine s southern and eastern regions have a more positive view of the USSR In some countries with internal conflict there is also nostalgia for the USSR especially for refugees of the post Soviet conflicts who have been forced to flee their homes and have been displaced The many Russian enclaves in the former USSR republics such as Transnistria have in a general a positive remembrance of it br br br By the political left br br The left s view of the USSR is complex While some leftists regard the USSR as an example of state capitalism or that it was an oligarchical state other leftists admire Vladimir Lenin and the Russian Revolution Council communists generally view the USSR as failing to create class consciousness turning into a corrupt state in which the elite controlled society br Trotskyists believe that the ascendancy of the Stalinist bureaucracy ensured a degenerated or deformed workers state where the capitalist elite have been replaced by an unaccountable bureaucratic elite and there is no true democracy or workers control of industry In particular American Trotskyist David North noted that the generation of bureaucrats that rose to power under Stalin s tutelage presided over the stagnation and breakdown of the Soviet Union br Many anti Stalinist leftists such as anarchists are extremely critical of Soviet authoritarianism and repression Much of the criticism it receives is centered around massacres in the Soviet Union the centralized hierarchy present in the USSR and mass political repression as well as violence towards government critics and political dissidents such as other leftists Critics also point towards its failure to implement any substantial worker cooperatives or implementing worker liberation as well as corruption and the Soviet authoritarian nature br Anarchists are also critical of the country labeling the Soviet system as red fascism Factors contributing to the anarchist animosity towards the USSR included the Soviet destruction of the Makhnovist movement after an initial alliance the suppression of the anarchist Kronstadt rebellion and the defeat of the rival anarchist factions by the Soviet supported Communist faction during the Spanish Civil War br Maoists also have a mixed opinion on the USSR viewing it negatively during the Sino Soviet Split and denouncing it as revisionist and reverted to capitalism The Chinese government in articulated its criticism of the USSR s system and promoted China s ideological line as an alternative br After the dissolution of the Soviet Union the Japanese Communist Party JCP released a press statement titled We welcome the end of a party which embodied the historical evil of great power chauvinism and hegemonism br Noam Chomsky called the collapse of the Soviet Union a small victory for socialism not only because of the fall of one of the most anti socialist states in the world where working people had fewer rights than in the West but also because it freed the term socialism from the burden of being associated in the propaganda systems of East and West with Soviet tyranny for the East in order to benefit from the aura of authentic socialism for the West in order to demonize the concept br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br Bibliography br br br External links br br Wikimedia Atlas of the Soviet Union br Impressions
