vaguely circular plane whose oceans perpetually spill off the edge of the world into what is seemingly an endless abyss The first two installments Golden Sun and The Lost Age center around two groups of magically attuned adepts who are alternately charged with achieving and preventing the release of the potentially destructive power of Alchemy on the world The force of Alchemy was prevalent in Weyard s ancient past allowing for the development of great civilizations but this eventually caused worldwide conflict that subsided only after it was sealed away The keys to unlocking Alchemy four magic jewels called the Elemental Stars have been hidden within the mountain shrine Mt Aleph guarded by the town of Vale at the mountain s base over time The third installment Dark Dawn chronicles the events of Weyard thirty years following the return of Alchemy and the struggles the world s inhabitants face while adapting to their new reality br br br Gameplay br br In the Golden Sun games players control a cast of characters as they journey through a fantasy world interact with other characters battle monsters acquire magic spells and equipment and take part in a narrative Much of the time spent outside of battle takes place in dungeons caves and other locales which generally require the player to find items that grant their bearer new forms of Psynergy or magical spells to solve puzzles To complete these puzzles players must either push pillars to construct negotiable paths between elevated areas climb up and rappel down cliffs or obtain a special item to progress through the story and game world Outside of these dungeons and locales the player traverses through a world map and navigates between forests rivers mountain ranges seas and oceans br A key element in in game exploration is the use of Psynergy spells which are used both in battle and solving puzzles Some Psynergy is only used in combat or in overworld and non battle scenarios However there are Psynergy that can be used in both situations for example the Whirlwind spell can be used to damage enemies in battle and out of battle to clear away overgrown foliage that blocks the player s path The player gains more Psynergy spells as the game progresses both through leveling up and obtaining special Psynergy bestowing items With each utility Psynergy spell the party gains access to more locations and secrets in the game world br In battle Golden Sun games contain both random monster encounters featuring randomly selected enemies and compulsory battles involving set enemies which advance the story When a battle begins a separate screen is brought up where the player s party and enemy party face off on opposing sides During a battle the characters and the background rotate to give a pseudo D effect Players can attack enemies directly using various weapons and offensive Psynergy spells or by summoning Djinn powerful otherworldly entities that enhance an attached character s hit points Psynergy points and other statistics as well as determining what Psynergy they can perform Djinn can be set to standby where players forfeit stat enhancements to unleash a powerful one time attack that summons an elemental monster to inflict damage on all enemies br br br Plot br br br Golden Sun and The Lost Age br br Three years prior to the start of the game s main story Saturos and Menardi raid Mt Aleph intending to steal the Elemental Stars but fail to solve the riddles guarding them and are driven away by the mountain s trap a magically generated thunderstorm and rock slide br Three years later Isaac Garet and Jenna join Kraden on his research trip to Mt Aleph and manage to solve the shrine s puzzles and retrieve the Elemental Stars They are ambushed by Saturos and Menardi along with Felix a previous resident of Vale who was kidnapped during the storms three years earlier They kidnap Jenna and Kraden and take three of the four Elemental Stars then depart to light the four lighthouses and release Alchemy on the world Isaac s party is joined by two other young Adepts Ivan and Mia and together they pursue Saturos party in a journey that spans two continents culminating in

remaining lighthouses that he failed to light Joined by new companions Sheba and Piers Felix and his party embark on a new expedition while pursued by Isaac s party Eventually Felix s party is able to access the legendary secluded Atlantis like society of Lemuria located far out in the ocean After convening with Lemuria s ancient king Hydros they learn of Alchemy s true nature it is the sustenance of Weyard s life force and its absence has caused the world s continents to decrease in size and parts of the world to collapse into the abyss Armed with this new information Felix manages to persuade Isaac and his party to join them and together they fulfill the goal of releasing Alchemy and preventing Weyard s eventual decay br br br Dark Dawn br br Thirty years after Isaac and his party of Adepts return the power of Alchemy to Weyard continents have shifted new countries have emerged and new species have appeared However Psynergy Vortexes which suck the elemental Psynergy from both the land and the power wielding Adepts are appearing all over Weyard The original games heroes descendants Matthew Karis Rief and Tyrell set out to solve the mystery of the vortexes while facing a world adapting to the constant presence of Psynergy br The game begins with Tyrell accidentally crashing one of Ivan s inventions a Soarwing and Isaac sending him out along with Matthew and Karis to retrieve a feather of the mountain roc to build a new one After meeting up with Kraden Rief and Nowell they are ambushed by Blados Chalis and Arcanus and the party is separated As Matthew s party travels across Weyard to reunite with Kraden and Nowell they encounter a deadly eclipse heralded by the lighting of Luna Tower causing suffering and destruction across the world They manage to activate an ancient machine called the Apollo s Lens to end the eclipse and return home to discover a large Psynergy Vortex lurking ominously near their home br br br Development br br br Conception br br The Golden Sun games were created by the Takahashi Brothers consisting of Hiroyuki Takahashi and Shugo Takahashi and produced by Camelot Software Planning According to co creator Shugo Takahashi the series was conceived as a way for Nintendo to compete against Sony s PlayStation console which dominated the role playing game market at the time As a handheld title Golden Sun was originally planned as a single game but due to both the hardware limitations of putting the entire game on a single Game Boy Advance cartridge and the developers own desire for what they wanted to do with the game it was expanded to become two successive games Golden Sun and Golden Sun The Lost Age The Takahashi Brothers had previously designed Shining Force III where the story involved playing through the perspectives of both the good side and the bad side of the characters Thinking that it was an effective way of conveying the full story of a fictional game world they incorporated elements of this storytelling methodology into the two game setup of the Golden Sun series having the player control the good guys in Golden Sun and members of the antagonistic party in The Lost Age br br br History br Originally Camelot planned to create a single title instead of a series and in the extremely early stages of their project they had created a game design document for the one Golden Sun game to be on the Nintendo console When it became apparent the N was to be superseded by the GameCube Camelot shifted their focus to making a game on the handheld Game Boy Advance br Golden Sun games generally have longer development cycles than their peer games on similar consoles due to the series complex gameplay mechanisms and storylines Golden Sun the first game in the series underwent a development cycle of between twelve and eighteen months by Camelot Software Planning which is considered a long period of time for the development of a handheld video game and was described as a testament to the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game It was shown in early playable form at the Nintendo Space World Expo in Japan in August North American previewers received the game a few weeks before the release and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld br The Lost Age was first revealed to Japan in early with the magazine Famitsu being the first publication to review the game The Lost Age was highly anticipated it topped IGN s list of Game Boy Advance Most Wanted games for The North American version of the game was playable at Electronic Entertainment Expo and IGN noted that the opening of the game did away with the slow opening sequence of Golden Sun introducing the characters in between the action GameSpot previewed a localized copy of The Lost Age in February and noted that the game built on its predecessor s graphics engine with the environments in the game featuring rich detail with little touches such as birds that fly off as you approach br Golden Sun Dark Dawn was first revealed and introduced at the Nintendo E conference by Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aim as a series that went dark six years ago but has since been revisited and polished up for the Nintendo DS The game received a larger development team than previous installments giving the team luxuries such as visiting UNESCO World Heritage Sites for inspiration br In an interview with Nintendo Gamer in June series producer Hiroyuki Takahashi spoke about the possibility of a fourth Golden Sun game A big reason for us making RPGs comes from the requests from all the people who have enjoyed our RPGs in the past Perhaps if there are enough Nintendo users asking for another game in the Golden Sun series then this will naturally lead to the development of such a game br On January it was announced that Golden Sun and The Lost Age would be added to Nintendo Switch Online on January br br br Music br The series original music was composed by Motoi Sakuraba and his score for the first game in his series was his first attempt at composing music for the Game Boy Advance The new technology offered by the console encouraged Sakuraba to attempt new styles resulting in subtle rock influences in the series music The collection of orchestral pieces that Sakuraba contributed to the series include an overworld theme several battle themes that play during fight sequences and a variety of individual themes for the games various towns and other locales Sakuraba returned to score both The Lost Age and Dark Dawn with the latter released on a new platform with updated hardware According to Sakuraba the sound design for Dark Dawn was different and he preferred the music in the first two games He has also expressed a desire for an official soundtrack release of the series music br Sakuraba also contributed songs to two games in the Super Smash Bros franchise among which two were adapted from his works in The Lost Age and Dark Dawn br br br In other media br br br Manga br The characters from the first Golden Sun game also appear in a self published doujinshi manga titled Golden Sun Koma Gag Battle drawn by various artists and published by Kobunsha It was released four months after the first game came out and is not officially sanctioned by Camelot As a result the manga was only released in Japan br br br Super Smash Bros series br br Elements from the Golden Sun games have appeared in other games Isaac the main protagonist of the original game is an unlockable Assist Trophy in Super Smash Bros Brawl When he is summoned during battle Isaac uses Psynergy to conjure a large hand three times in succession to shove the player s opponents off the stage If enemies attempt to evade his attack Isaac will turn in sync to attack a selected opponent In addition a medley of music from The Lost Age was selected to be on Brawl s soundtrack The game s sequel Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U did not feature Isaac as an Assist Trophy but its music featured The Lost Age medley as well as the world map theme from Dark Dawn Super Smash Bros Ultimate brings back Isaac as an Assist Trophy and introduces a costume inspired by him for the Mii Swordfighter The game also features characters from all three titles as spirits including the adult Isaac from Dark Dawn

and million respectively with European sales contributing and By the end of two years after its release Dark Dawn only sold units in Japan br The series was met with many positive reviews Reviewers praised the series vibrant graphics high quality sound and varied refined RPG gameplay with particular optimism on the Djinn based gameplay system and Battle aspect despite the fact that the original two games were limited to the bit cartridge GamePro raved that Golden Sun was A huge fantastic creative and wickedly fun RPG that doesn t seem to care that it s just on a GBA while they praised that The Lost Age s eye popping magic effects are beautiful even by console standards IGN meanwhile praised the plot s intricate structure saying that it has been so tightly integrated into every ounce of the adventure such a rich and deep plot that it s almost easy to get lost if you re not paying attention UP praised Dark Dawn as being a huge step forward in terms of pacing and graphics compared to the previous games br Critics complained that the combat system lacked smart combat if an enemy is killed before other party members attack it those members switch to defense instead of intelligently attacking the remaining enemies They also took issue to the long opening sequences in both games that alienated new players and confused them by swamping them with new characters UP faulted Camelot for being unwilling to trim its fat and noted that all three games in the series tend to ramble on anytime dialogue boxes start to show up Its heroes and villains have an uncanny knack for saying incredibly simple things with about three or four times the words they actually need to convey those ideas Game Informer noted that the difficulty of Dark Dawn was greatly dumbed down compared to previous installments and complained that characters level up at blazing speeds while the Djinn make even the longest boss battles a cakewalk br In Golden Sun won the Nintendo Power Award for best Game Boy Advance game of the year Golden Sun was ranked and The Lost Age was ranked on IGN s Readers Choice Top games ever In Golden Sun was named th best Game Boy Advance game of all time in IGN s feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance s long lifespan and its Game of the Month for April due to its amazing graphics and sound presentation as well as a quest that lasts for more than thirty
