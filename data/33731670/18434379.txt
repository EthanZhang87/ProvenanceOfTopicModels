The Wii MotionPlus Wii is an expansion device for the Wii Remote the primary game controller for the Wii The device allows more complex motion to be interpreted than the Wii Remote can do alone Both the Wii and its successor the Wii U support the Wii MotionPlus accessory in games br The accessory was first released in June A later hardware revision of the Wii Remote the Wii Remote Plus was later released with the Wii MotionPlus technology built in br br br History br The Wii MotionPlus was announced by Nintendo in a press release on July and revealed the next day at a press conference at the E Media Business Summit It was released in June On May Nintendo announced that starting May the company would include its Wii Sports Resort game and MotionPlus controller with new consoles with no price increase br br br Development br The Wii MotionPlus was developed by Nintendo in collaboration with game development tool company AiLive The sensor used is an InvenSense IDG or IDG in later units designed in accordance to Nintendo s specification with a high dynamic range high mechanical shock tolerance high temperature and humidity resistance and small physical size br The Wii MotionPlus was conceived soon after the completion of the initial Wii Remote design to address developer demand for more capable motion sensing but was only announced after the sensors could be purchased in sufficient volume at a reasonable price During a developer round table discussion at E Wii Sports Resort producer Katsuya Eguchi discussed the potential influence of the Wii MotionPlus on the Wii s existing market stating that Nintendo was looking at whether the MotionPlus capability will be built into the Wii Remote in the future or kept as an attachment we only use for certain software Nintendo ultimately chose the former by releasing the Wii Remote Plus in late br br br Colors and variants br From June to August Club Nintendo in Japan held a contest wherein members who purchased and registered a copy of Wii Sports Resort would be entered into a draw to win a sky blue Wii MotionPlus in one of blue controller sets In November a black Wii MotionPlus was released to coincide with the release of the black Wii console Bundles containing a black Wii Remote and MotionPlus attachment were also released In North America non white Wii Remotes are bundled with a MotionPlus of matching color for black Wii Remotes and a white MotionPlus unit with a translucent jacket for blue and pink Wii Remotes In a Nintendo Conference the Wii Remote Plus was announced which places the function of the MotionPlus into a regular sized Wii remote It would be the same as the Wii Remote but the curved text Wii MotionPlus INSIDE is added below the Wii logo br br br Technology and features br The device incorporates a dual axis tuning fork gyroscope and a single axis gyroscope which can determine rotational motion The information captured by the angular rate sensor can then be used to distinguish true linear motion from the accelerometer readings This allows for the capture of more complex movements than possible with the Wii Remote alone To ensure that it functions properly the MotionPlus can be calibrated before or during gameplay by placing the Wii Remote facedown so that the B Button is facing up on a flat surface and keeping it motionless for at most seconds until an on screen notification indicates that calibration is complete br The Wii MotionPlus features a pass through External Extension Connector allowing other expansions such as the Nunchuk or Classic Controller to be used simultaneously with the device Because the Wii MotionPlus extends the length of the Wii Remote making it impossible to clip the Nunchuk s connector hook to the wrist strap the MotionPlus dongle features a tethered socket cap that can be snapped onto the connector hook to secure it from abrupt movement should it be forcibly disconnected The attachment has a color coded mechanical slide switch for locking the clip release When attached to the original non MotionPlus Wii Remote the add on unit extends the length of the controller body by approximately in cm Each Wii MotionPlus includes a longer version of the Wii Remote Jacket to accommodate the added length and according to Nintendo the Wii MotionPlus is unsafe to use without it However the newer Wii Remote Plus eliminates the need for such elongated jackets by integrating the MotionPlus technology into the Remote itself br The device is only used by games that have been specifically developed to use its functionality The title screens of these games also provide an option to access a series of instructional videos created by Nintendo to help players learn how to attach and remove the accessory recalibrate it connect external controllers to it or otherwise disconnect them It can remain attached to the Wii Remote when playing games that do not support it without causing any problems but it will not enhance gameplay The add on version of the device is incompatible with any Wii Remote accessories that snugly encase the Remote itself such as the Wii Wheel the Wii Zapper guitar controllers for Guitar Hero and Rock Band games and NHL Slapshot s hockey stick accessory br br br Wii Remote Plus br br In September rumors were circulating of a Wii Remote with Wii MotionPlus already built in after the upcoming FlingSmash was revealed to be bundled with Wii Remote Plus Nintendo initially declined to comment but later announced the device on September confirming it to be a Wii Remote with MotionPlus built in allowing players to use peripherals like the Wii Zapper and Wii Wheel without having to remove Wii MotionPlus from the Wii Remote It competes with the Kinect and the PlayStation Move with PlayStation Eye motion controllers for the Xbox and the PlayStation home consoles respectively Nintendo later announced that the remote would be available in white black blue and pink It was
