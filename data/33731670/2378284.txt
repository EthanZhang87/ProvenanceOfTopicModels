Nintendo Research Development No Department commonly abbreviated as Nintendo R D and formerly known as Nintendo Research Development Department before splitting in was a division of Nintendo and is its oldest development team Its creation coincided with Nintendo s entry into the video game industry and the original R D was headed by Gunpei Yokoi The developer has created several notable Nintendo series such as Metroid Mario Bros and Donkey Kong br R D developed the hugely successful Game Boy line which was released in They developed some of the line s most popular games such as Super Mario Land and created the character of Wario br Team Shikamaru was a small club within Nintendo R D that was composed of Makoto Kano Yoshio Sakamoto and Toru Osawa The group was responsible for designing characters and coming up with scripts for several games including Metroid Kid Icarus Famicom Detective Club Trade Battle Card Hero and several others br After Yokoi s resignation in this group was led by Takehiro Izushi In Satoru Iwata restructured the Nintendo R D team Many of the staff members were later reassigned to the Nintendo SPD team which in turn merged with Nintendo EAD in to form Nintendo Entertainment Planning Development br br br History br br br Background br In Nintendo still primarily a hanafuda card manufacturer hired Gunpei Yokoi a newly graduated electronics engineer Yokoi was assigned to the manufacturing division to work on the assembly line machines used to manufacture its cards In the following year Hiroshi Yamauchi president of Nintendo at the time during a visit to the factory Yokoi was working at took notice of a toy an extending arm that Yokoi had made for his own amusement during his spare time As Yamauchi was looking to diversify the company s business far beyond its primary card business Yokoi was ordered to develop the toy into a proper mass market product for the holiday rush The toy was launched as Ultra Hand and it was a huge success selling over million units during its lifetime Following that Yokoi was assigned to work on other toys including the Ten Billion Barrel puzzle a miniature remote controlled vacuum cleaner called the Chiritori a baseball throwing machine called the Ultra Machine and a Love Tester br br br s Creation and first electronic games br Sometime before Nintendo created its first electronics development team the Research Development department from Nintendo s manufacturing division assigning Gunpei Yokoi as its general manager By the department had approximately developers In the manufacturing division split its single research development department into two renaming it to Research Development No R D and creating the Nintendo Research Development No R D department After the split Yokoi remained general manager of R D br br br Game Watch br br In the late s Yokoi saw a bored Japanese salaryman playing with a calculator on the Shinkansen high speed train This was the inspiration for the creation of the Game Watch series a line of handheld electronic games with each system featuring a single game to be played on an LCD screen in addition to a clock an alarm or both Regardless it was confirmed that Yokoi was inspired by calculators to develop the line even using calculator integrated circuits in the systems and button cells to power them Although Nintendo competitors Mattel and Tomy had already produced portable games they were mostly bulky systems with low resolution LED displays and uninspiring gameplay Yokoi exploited the cheapness of LCDs producing cheap and light systems starting in He would later call this principle Lateral Thinking of Withered Technology using seasoned technology in radical ways a principle that echoed throughout Nintendo until the present day br In Game Watch Ball was the first release of the Game Watch Silver series called after its metallic face plate Sales weren t reportedly astonishing but they were enough to persuade Nintendo to continue developing new titles The series saw a total of systems all released during that year In Game Watch Manhole debuted the Gold series which was fundamentally the same system with a golden face plate It saw only titles which were also released during the same year In mid Game Watch Parachute was released debuting the Wide Screen series sporting a larger display The series saw a total of titles released until early br The limitations of the LCD display prompted Yokoi and his team to introduce the Multi Screen series with the release of Game Watch Oil Panic in mid adding another screen to potentially double the amount of gameplay each title could offer The next title of the series was Game Watch Donkey Kong a port of the hugely successful Donkey Kong arcade game Unable to use a joystick like the original game as it would reduce the system s portability Yokoi began researching for solutions Early Game Watch systems had a button for each action such as moving left and right or jumping However for the new system the team introduced the cross directional pad D pad a flat four way directional control with one button on each point The design was patented and later earned a Technology Engineering Emmy Award in From then on all major video game consoles since have had a D pad of some shape on their controllers until the Nintendo Switch in br br br Game Boy br br When the department started working on a successor to the Game Watch series Yokoi envisioned a simple and cheap system with interchangeable game cartridges Development of the system however suffered from disagreements in direction with assistant director Satoru Okada arguing for a more powerful system with third party development and long term support from Nintendo emulating the successful business model that Nintendo R D had achieved with the Nintendo Entertainment System while Yokoi planned for a much cheaper less powerful device with a shorter life span similar to its predecessor During an interview Okada compared the initial project to the Microvision Eventually Yokoi agreed to Okada s plan and the project would be known as the Game Boy br br br Virtual Boy br br In Nintendo partnered with Massachusetts based Reflection Technology Inc who had developed a D stereoscopic head tracking prototype called the Private Eye Gunpei Yokoi saw this as a unique technology that competitors would find difficult to emulate Additionally the resulting game console was intended to enhance Nintendo s reputation as an innovator and to encourage more creativity in games Code naming the project VR Nintendo entered into an exclusive agreement with Reflection Technology to license the technology for its displays br Spending four years in development and eventually building a dedicated manufacturing plant in China Nintendo worked to turn its VR vision into an affordable and health conscious console design Yokoi retained RTI s choice of red LED because it was the cheapest and because unlike a totally backlit LCD its perfect blackness could achieve a more immersive sense of infinite depth RTI and Nintendo said a color LCD system would have been prohibitively expensive retailing for more than US A color LCD system was also said to have caused jumpy images in tests With ongoing concerns about motion sickness the risk of developing lazy eye conditions in young children and Japan s new Product Liability Act of Nintendo eliminated the head tracking functionality and converted its headmounted goggle design into a stationary heavy precision steel shielded tabletop form factor conformant to the recommendation of the Schepens Eye Research Institute br According to David Sheff s book Game Over the increasingly reticent Yokoi never actually intended for the increasingly downscaled console to be released in its final form However Nintendo pushed the Virtual Boy to market so that it could focus development resources on the Nintendo br br br Game Boy successor br br In the department started developing a successor to the Game Boy under the code name Atlantis Despite its predecessors having a monochrome display the R D team had already experimented with color displays from as early as The Atlantis prototype consisted of an handheld with a bit ARM CPU a larger color display and four face buttons It was reported that the system was supposed to release in late br Meanwhile the department was also working on a revision of the Game Boy The system would require fewer batteries providing approximately hours of gameplay and was also equipped with a DC connector which could be used to power the system The screen was also changed to a true black and white display rather than the green tinted monochrome display of the original Game Boy and had an improved pixel response time mostly eliminating the ghosting effect It finally released as the Game Boy Pocket on July in Japan on September in North America and in Europe during the following year Although it had no power LED initially it was soon added to later editions due public demand br Following the commercial success of the Game Boy Pocket the Atlantis system was delayed by a year to late Nonetheless the system was eventually cancelled due to concerns of it being too big having a drastically decreased battery life to approximately hour as LCD color displays required a back light at the time and being too expensive to manufacture Although it was shelved the project would later considerably speed up the development of the Game Boy Color in by the Nintendo Research Engineering department br br br Gunpei Yokoi s departure and hardware team spin off br On August long time department general manager Gunpei Yokoi left Nintendo to form his own company Koto Laboratory Despite speculation that he had left Nintendo due to the commercial failure of the Virtual Boy a year prior Yokoi clarified that he d long wished to become independent Yokoi and his new company eventually worked on the WonderSwan handheld for Bandai before his tragic death in in a traffic accident In order to fill Yokoi s vacancy long time Nintendo engineer Takehiro Izushi was appointed as the new general manager of the department Additionally the department s hardware team was spun off into a new development department called Nintendo Research Engineering and led by Satoru Okada The software development team however remained at R D This new department would be responsible for continuing the Game Boy s legacy becoming the source of every major Nintendo handheld game console until its closure in br Following Yokoi s departure and no longer having a dedicated hardware development team the department focused instead on developing games for other Nintendo developed consoles It was responsible for the re releases of its Game Watch classics in the Game Watch Gallery series for both the Game Boy and Game Boy Color starting in It also developed sequels to its Wario Land classic in the form of Wario Land II released in and Wario Land in both for the Game Boy Color and Wario Land for the Game Boy Advance released a year later The department was also responsible for creating the Wario spin off series with WarioWare Inc Mega Microgames released in for the Game Boy Advance After an year hiatus R D introduced a new installment in its Metroid series Metroid Fusion released in In R D s last project was launched Metroid Zero Mission a remake of the original game br br br Absorbed into Nintendo Software Planning Development br In the department along with Nintendo Research Development was absorbed into the newly created Nintendo Software Planning Development division Then Nintendo president Satoru Iwata created and appointed himself as general manager of the new division to focus on co producing and supervising second party development thus relieving the Entertainment Analysis Development division EAD and its general manager Shigeru Miyamoto to focus on first party projects Although that was the division s primary focus it went on to develop some video games titles internally br In former general manager of the R D department Takehiro Izushi retired from
