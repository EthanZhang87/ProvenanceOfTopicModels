Chronicles series uses a real time action based battle system where the player manually moves a character in real time and party members will auto attack when enemies enter their attack radius Manually input attacks called Arts may also be performed but in a limited fashion Battle Arts are only available after a cool down period that occurs after every use while character specific Talent Arts only become available after enough auto attacks are executed Both party members and enemies have a finite number of health points and attacks deplete this value Combat is won when all enemies lose their HP but the game is lost if the player s character loses all their HP and has no means of being revived Health may be restored by the player by using healing Arts in battle or the player may let characters HP regenerate automatically outside of battle Winning battles earns the player experience points which allows the characters to grow stronger by leveling up and learning new Arts Arts for each character must be set by the player on their respective set up called a Battle Palette outside of battles br Another defining aspect of the Xenoblade Chronicles games is exploration In each
