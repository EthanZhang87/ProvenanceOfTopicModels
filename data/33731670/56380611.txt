making configuration changes on the Win as opposed to other portable devices As far as performance he noted that integrated graphics leave a lot to be desired and that newer games will still have stutter and mediocre frame rates But that older games are generally fine He did note an increase in emulation performance testing games like Star Fox Assault in Dolphin and Grand Theft Auto III in
