electronic minigame that doubled as a watch for killing time The visuals and LCD design were conducted by Makoto Kano although he was also present in the original handheld s hardware production At the time there were only a handful of designers so work wasn t equally balanced and multiple people worked on numerous different tasks According to Kano he designed the system shell and its color the packaging and the stick figure silhouettes br The games were designed around everyday tasks which is why the titles had simple concepts such as cooking The game and its looks were designed on a blackboard by the development team and Masao Yamamoto drew up the ideas in a notebook He gave the visuals to Kano for polishing where he recalled how he would say The rest is up to you After he would redraw the designs it then became clear whether or not they would continue with the project They would then create a model of how the game would function using plastic and wheat bulbs about the size of an A sheet of paper to test the smoothness of the visuals Yokoi was very keen on making character movement natural which the designers dubbed the Yokoi standard Yamamoto and Takehiro Izushi worked on the software afterwards br The first handheld released was Ball in the spiritual introduction to Mr Game Watch Kano s enjoyment of visual design for the handhelds were increased with the introduction of a new line of Game Watch devices the Wide Screen variants In a interview on Iwata Asks Kano said that he modelled the octopus character for the title Octupus after Hatchan the Octopus

in his list of forgotten Nintendo characters stating that he is a classic character from the younger days of Nintendo Michael Derosa of Screen Rant listed Mr Game Watch as a character that should be added in Mario Kart stating that a D character in the magical D Mario Kart world would offer the type of visual contrast that gamers love br In Super Smash Bros Masahiro Sakurai described Mr Game Watch along with Duck Hunt as fighters that fall outside of people s typical expectations and explained further that without such characters the roster might only have typical hero heroine type fighters in the lineup which would be probably not very interesting IGN noted that Mr Game Watch became weirder as it maintains his unique D nature in an otherwise D world As a result several magazines have criticized the character for being annoying and included at the game despite being not a realistic character or one of the Nintendo icons In Super Smash Bros for Wii U it was considered as low tier or one of the weakest characters available for selection In Enrique Maister Hern ndez Sol s became the first professional Super Smash Bros player to garner successful tournament results while using Mr Game Watch before it he remained an unranked position in the Panda Global Rankings charts until eventually ranking th place globally In Super Smash Bros Ultimate while Mr Game Watch was still considered low tier at the time of Maister s win the Smash community eventually realized that the character had become significantly stronger He began receiving criticism toward the character and himself with people blaming his success for the character he chose and not his skill pointing out abilities of his that were too powerful or too fast to react to Maister commented on the backlash and acknowledged the character s criticism due to his faults However he struggled with negativity and threats directed towards him personally and it has been chosen to lower how much time he spent on social media br br br Controversy br br In the Game Watch title Fire Attack the player controls a cowboy defending his fort from an onslaught of Native Americans attempting to burn the fort down In

a stick figure silhouette whenever he would perform an action represented from a Game Watch title he would also assume the cosmetics of the character in question and look like them then returning to his default look when the action is complete With this came the return of his Native American counterpart which is referenced in one of his attacks After a Nintendo Direct that showcased the character he was used in gameplay during a Japanese livestream where the attack was used and visible for about half a second br Later claims were made on Twitter and an online message board that the character represented a racist Native American stereotype These claims were later echoed elsewhere online Nintendo took action by removing the feather headband on his head and responded with the following statement to Eurogamer br br Nintendo has been planning to distribute an update for Super Smash Bros Ultimate that removes the feather from the silhouette of Mr Game Watch The original game on which
