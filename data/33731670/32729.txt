The Vectrex is a vector display based home video game console the only one ever designed and released for the home market that was developed by Smith Engineering and manufactured and sold by General Consumer Electronics It was first released for the North America market in November and then Europe and Japan in Originally produced by General Consumer Electronics it was later licensed to Milton Bradley after they acquired the company Bandai released the system in Japan br The Vectrex in contrast to other video game systems at the time did not need to be hooked up to a television set it had an integrated vertically orientated monochrome CRT monitor A detachable wired control pad could be folded into the lower base of the console Games came with translucent color overlays to place over the screen Optional peripherals included a pair of D goggles known as the D Imager and a light pen for drawing directly on the screen The Asteroids inspired Mine Storm was built into the system br The console was conceived by John Ross of Smith Engineering in late as a handheld called the Mini Arcade As development progressed it morphed into a tabletop system that was manufactured by General Consumer Electronics Strong initial sales caused General Consumer Electronics to be acquired by Milton Bradley however just mere months later the Vectrex would succumb as a victim of the video game crash of and was discontinued in early br Despite its commercial failure the Vectrex was praised for its software library unique graphical capabilities and built in monitor Several publications lauded it as one of the best consoles available at the time The Vectrex was the first console to have a D based peripheral A color handheld version of the Vectrex was conceived in the late s but was shelved because of its manufacturing cost and the success of the Nintendo Game Boy br br br History br The Vectrex was conceived by John Ross of Smith Engineering in late He Mike Purvis Tom Sloper and Steve Marking had gone to Electro Mavin a surplus warehouse in Los Angeles They found a inch cathode ray tube CRT and wondered if a small electronic game could be made of it A demonstration of a vector drawing cathode ray tube display was made by connecting the deflection yoke in a standard television to the channels of a stereo amplifier fed with music program material An auxiliary yoke was used to keep the raster television s horizontal fly back high voltage system running The demo led to a system originally conceived as a handheld called the Mini Arcade but as Smith Engineering shopped the idea around to developers it evolved into a tabletop with nine inch screen br The system was licensed to General Consumer Electronics in After a brief hardware and software development period the Vectrex was unveiled on June at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago It was publicly released in November at a retail price of US just in time for the holidays The launch sales were strong enough that Milton Bradley bought out General Consumer Electronics in early br br Milton Bradley s greater resources allowed the Vectrex to be released in parts of Europe by mid and through a co branding agreement with Bandai in Japan as well However the video game crash of turned Milton Bradley s support of the Vectrex into a costly mistake even despite reducing its price by and then later in desperation to sell units In February after losing million on the Vectrex Milton Bradley announced the discontinuation of the console and cancelled development of new games The company s entire inventory of consoles and accessories was sold off to mass market discount houses where they were liquidated at a fraction of the console s introductory price By May Milton Bradley merged with Hasbro and after market support ended br Prior to the Vectrex s discontinuation a successor console with a color screen had been planned After the rights reverted to Smith Engineering the company made plans to revive the Vectrex as a handheld but the imminent arrival of Nintendo s Game Boy put an end to those plans In the mid s Jay Smith then head of Smith Engineering allowed new hardware and software development on a fee and royalty free basis Smith has also allowed duplication of the original Vectrex software on a not for profit basis to allow Vectrex owners to obtain the original titles at low cost or for free br br br Technical specifications br br br Circuit board br CPU Motorola A MHz br RAM KB two bit chips br ROM KB one bit chip br Cartridge ROM KB br MOS Versatile Interface Adapter

computer runs the game s computer code watches the user s inputs runs the sound generator and controls the vector generator to make the screen drawings The vector generator is an all analog design using two integrators X and Y The computer sets the integration rates using a digital to analog converter The computer controls the integration time by momentarily closing electronic analog switches within the operational amplifier based integrator circuits Voltage ramps are produced that the monitor uses to steer the electron beam over the face of the phosphor screen of the cathode ray tube Another signal is generated that controls the brightness of the line br The cathode ray tube is a Samsung model RB monochrome unit measuring inches displaying a picture of mm diagonal it is an off the shelf picture tube manufactured for small black white television sets The brightness of the CRT is controlled using a circular knob on the back of the display A vector CRT display such as the one in the Vectrex does not require a special tube and differs from standard raster based television sets only in the control circuits Rather than use sawtooth waves to direct the internal electron beam in a raster pattern computer controlled integrators feed linear amplifiers to drive the deflection yoke This yoke has similar if not identical inductances unlike a TV deflection yoke The yoke uses a standard TV core The high voltage transformer also uses a standard core and bobbin There is special circuitry to turn off the electron beam if the vector generator stops or fails This prevents burning of the screen s phosphors This design is a great deal smaller than the electronics found in the free standing full sized Asteroids arcade machine br During development for a short period of time the possibility of using the processor was considered but later its performance was considered insufficient br Early units have a very audible buzzing from the built in speaker that reacts to the graphics generated on screen This is due to improper production grounding of signal lines of the low level audio circuitry and was eventually resolved in later production models A ground loop had been created by a grounding strap added in production to meet U S Federal Communications Commission signal radiation requirements This idiosyncrasy has become a familiar characteristic of the machine br br br Peripherals br br The D Imager invented by John Ross turns the D black and white images drawn by the Vectrex into a color D experience The imager works by spinning a disk in front of the viewer s eyes The disk is black for degrees and in some cases has degree wedges of transparent red green and blue filters The user looks through this to the Vectrex screen The Vectrex synchronizes the rotation of the disk to the software frame rate as it draws screens with the right eye covered the left eye red image then green and then the blue image is drawn and then while the left eye is covered by the black degree sector the right eye red green and then the blue image is drawn Only one eye will see the Vectrex screen and its associated images or colors at any one time while the other will be blocked by the degree mask The prototype was made in the plastic casework of a Viewmaster The disc spins freely and is driven by a motor The Vectrex software generates its own frame rate and compares it to an index signal from the glasses once per revolution Score is kept of how many wheel rotations are early compared to the software frame rate and how many are late The software tries to keep these two trends equal by adjusting the power being delivered to the motor that spins the filter and mask wheel Pulse Width Modulation PWM is used to control the motor speed the ratio of the on time versus the off time of a rapid stream of power pulses to the motor In this way the software synchronizes the wheel rotation to the software s frame rate or drawing time for the combined and repeating group of up to evolving images br A single object that does not lie on the plane of the monitor i e in front of or into the monitor is drawn at least twice to provide information for each eye The distance between the duplicate images and the angles from which they are drawn will determine where the object will appear to be in D space The D illusion is also enhanced by adjusting the brightness of the object dimming objects in the background Spinning the disk at a high enough speed will fool the viewer s eyes brain into thinking that the multiple images it is seeing are two different views of the same object due to the persistence of vision This creates the impression of D and color br The same D effect is in fact possible with raster or film projection images and the shutter glasses used in some D theaters and virtual reality theme park rides work on the same principle br The light pen allows the user to draw to create images and to indicate on the screen It has a photo detector that can see the bright spot of the vector drawing display monitor when it goes by under the light pen s position where it is being held to the screen The photo detector feeds internal pulse catching circuits that tell the Vectrex and its software of the event The prototype was made in the plastic casework of a Marks A Lot felt tipped marker pen The Vectrex draws a spider web like search pattern to track the pen s location The software changes the pattern size as the pen changes motions and velocity in an attempt keep a continuous lock on the pen s position The Vectrex light pen was invented by John Ross br br br Screen overlays br br In order to enhance the display visuals of the Vectrex every commercially released game included its own unique translucent plastic screen overlay that accompanied the cartridge a concept first seen with the Magnavox Odyssey as well as some early arcade machines Instead of physically touching the CRT screen four tabs on the Vectrex console securely held them in place in front of it with a small gap between the actual screen and the overlay Made up of one to three colors for the play field area these overlays simulate simple color graphics on an otherwise black and white screen helped reduced glare flicker and gave the appearance of a flat screen They also allowed changes in brightness intensity of vector graphics to be more visually distinctive In some cases game designers created pseudo color cycling effects for a sense of movement by using alternating colored patterns In addition to players score areas some overlays also contained additional artwork and patterns to add to the game s play field Across the bottom of each overlay are game specific joystick and button functions as a guide for the player Each overlay also displayed the title and logo of each game along with a colored border or design to add cosmetic flair to the Vectrex much like an arcade machine with its marquee or side art Overlays were not required but added to the experience in terms of the visual look of game graphics and the overall display appearance of the console br br br Software br br Some of the Vectrex s library consisted of ports of arcade hits most of them brought to the console through a licensing deal with Cinematronics br The liquor company Old Mr Boston gave out a limited number of customized Clean Sweep cartridges with a Mr Boston sticker on the box The overlay was the regular Clean Sweep overlay with the Mr Boston name logo and copyright info running up either side The game itself had custom text and the player controlled a top hat rather than a vacuum Clean Sweep was written by Richard Moszkowski br br br Reception br Byte in called Vectrex one of the greatest game machines we have seen this year Vectrex is a good bet to score big with the consumer The magazine praised the screen stating that it almost has to be seen to be believed imagine playing games at home or in the office using vector graphics with three dimensional rotation and zoom and noted that It is unusual and refreshing to see a product appearing on the market with its software ready to run David H Ahl stated in Creative Computing Video Arcade Games in that Vector graphics really do make a difference and the strong line up of games helps immensely br br br Legacy br Since late there has been a Usenet community of hobbyists writing games for ParaJVE a Vectrex emulator Its emulation is also a compound of MESS included in MAME so RetroArch too via libretro DVE lr vex Vecx with a Wii version called VectrexWii Schematics for a Vectrex Multicart cartridge is available allowing several games to be packed on one cartridge There are also several people manufacturing and selling newly made games some complete as cartridges with packing and overlays in the style of the original commercially released games others with varying degrees of packaging br New hardware has also been developed for the Vectrex in recent years including a light pen that addressed the limitation of the original version by including buttons that replace the second controller required on the original version and a daughterboard that addresses the well known buzz in the system s audio bypassing the original audio circuitry on the power board in favor of a module installed elsewhere within the cabinet br br br See also br Microvision br C NES TV br
