GameKing is a brand of handheld game consoles designed and developed by Timetop and manufactured by Guangzhou Panyu Gaoming Electronics Co Ltd also known as GZ Daidaixing Tec Electronics Co Ltd in for the Hong Kong consumer market The brand has three consoles the GameKing I the GameKing II and the GameKing III A fourth console the Handy Game was produced by Timetop and shares some branding but otherwise has little to do with the GameKing franchise br br br GameKing I GM br The original GameKing console is an bit handheld game console released in September It is based on a C CPU running at MHz br It is fashioned to look like Nintendo s Game Boy Advance and comes in a wide array of vivid pastel colours either opaque or transparent and uses two AAA size batteries br The console has above average sound circuitry capable of multi channel music and digital sound playback but a comparably low quality non backlit grayscale LCD screen only supporting four shades of grey and having a very low x pixels resolution br Games can be compared to some of the earlier built in cell phone games pre Java games while their playing speed scrolling etc and audio is far superior multi channel music and digitized samples and voices are quite common in GameKing games br The GameKing GM was released in Italy by Giocattoli Linea Paggio br br br Audio hardware br br It is unclear whether the machine uses a traditional programmable sound generator or relies only on digital samples for music and sound effects Many of its games have soundtracks consisting of short audio samples with a sampling rate of kHz as opposed to games on other systems such as the Game Boy where sound is generated by a custom programmable sound generator br br br Video hardware br According to Brian Provinciano s reverse engineering of the GameKing most GameKing games heavily rely on bitmap rather than tile based rendering of the screen e g most levels in its platform and shoot em up games are in reality large colour bitmaps instead of using the most common method of graphic tiles and tile maps like in most other game consoles and arcade games This was probably done for economic reasons the CPU alone can handle all graphics easily at that resolution and easy development of the games apart from the objectively low resolution of the screen While such a scheme seems to work it has the disadvantage of using cartridge space inefficiently so that e g most platform games are limited to three levels br br br GameKing II br br br GM br The GameKing II GM released in October on the other hand is fashioned to look like Sony s PlayStation Portable comes in more sober colors either black grey white or aqua and although not shown on the packaging yellow ones do also exist and uses AAA size batteries of which only are used to actually power up the GameKing s hardware while the third one serves to power up both its built in audio amplifier a bit more powerful than the one on the original GameKing and its backlit LCD screen which can be turned on and off at will depending on external lighting conditions thus saving power The unit can still work with batteries only with no sound and no backlighting available br Also the GameKing II has a fixed color background picture for its LCD screen only visible when the backlighting is switched on This is probably to give the false impression of having a colour LCD screen as implied on its box The picture may vary between various GameKing models however it has a mostly negative effect on screen readability when the backlighting is turned on This background picture can also be removed or replaced simply by opening the machine and removing the small plastic transparency behind the LCD Removing it makes using the backlighting much more effective br This model would also be the last in the Gameking line to have the text in stamped above the screen br br br GM br The GM was released in and sports an original design which does not borrow much from previous models Even though it is sequenced later than the other consoles in the Gameking line and therefore one would expect more advanced hardware it is in fact a redesigned Gameking II with the back light removed notice however that the box for the GM and GM both show exactly the same false color screen shot despite the two machines vastly different capabilities It is not known why Timetop chose to release the GM in this fashion although renderings exist that show this design was intended at some point to be a full color model It was available in charcoal blue and green br br br GK I vs GK II br The two models are fully hardware compatible can use the same games cartridges both have volume and contrast controls and use the same LCD screen Also they both have an external DC power supply mm minijack plug however the plug is not labeled as such and its function is only slightly hinted at in the units manuals The GameKing requires V DC while the GameKing requires V DC with the peculiarity of needing to keep at least one battery in the unit in order to have sound and backlighting br br br GameKing GameKing II games br The console has a small selection of known games being built in and in carts although games were said to be available by TimeTop Most games are clones of famous NES C or Atari titles with heavily dropped graphics The games come in cartridges resembling the original Game Boy ones with a typical size of KB although in cartridges are available containing normal GameKing games plus a selection menu and have a maximum size of KB br Both the GameKing and GameKing II come with three built in games br br Drifter a Wonder Boy Adventure Island clone Which seems to use music from Castlevania III Dracula s Curse br a clone br Miner or Mine Battle a Bomberman clone Which seems to use music taken from the now defunct Flash game Spybot The Nightfall Incident br Here follows an incomplete list of known games br Please note that many GameKing games use the same program altering only graphics to create new games e g and are essentially the same game with minor differences Also many games have major inconsistencies between the box manual and in game title E g Lanneret becomes Hawk in the game title Feichuan becomes Shenzhou Liuhao in the game br or Carlo Adventure Legend becomes Caro in game br br Carlo Adventure Legend a Super Mario Bros clone br Soldier a Contra Gryzor clone br Happy Killer and Happy Ball both Lode Runner clones br F a Formula One racing game resembling Pole Position br Super Motor essentially like F with motorcycles instead of cars br Notes The two previous titles are the only motor or sports games available on the GameKing br br essentially the same game as the built in br Popper essentially the same game as the built in Miner br Hawk or Lanneret a Choplifter clone br Dino Adventure essentially Carlo Adventure Legend with different graphics br Duckman a Darkwing Duck clone br Ares Feichuan are all classic arcade shooters probably using the same engine as and with different graphics br Penguin an Antarctic Adventure Tux Racer clone br Street Hero a Double Dragon clone br Trojan Legend a Mega Man clone br Seatercel a Tiger Heli clone br Star Wars a Macross based clone allowing the player to choose all three shapeshifting Fighter Gerwalk Battroid configurations br Nagual a Kung Fu Master clone

br Dracula Zone or Surf Eidolon A Silver Surfer clone br Pocket Tank a Rambo Front Line clone with a tank br Warrior a Front Line clone without the tank br Clever Hawk a Star Force like game but not the same game as Star Ghazi br Valliant a robot space fighting game clone unknown The sprites are pretty large br Metal Deform a platform game with shooting elements and a jetpack clone unknown br Three Battles an Ikari Warriors like game br Lightsword a shooter that puts you on foot and then into a flying robot shooter form clone unknown br Risker a game similar to Spy Hunter in mechanics br Catman another platform game with weapons but with large sprites br Armada an arcade shooter clone unknown br Brains a Moai kun clone br Games are generally sold in separate cartridges but there are in cartridges holding distinct games Later games seem to be only available in this manner Also each in pack comes numbered and higher numbers seem to provide games that are more refined in presentation br Some of these games found in in cartridges are br br Cyclon Action br Might br CarMan br Spectask br Captain Which seems to use music from Mega Man X br Seaguard br Whirlybird br Happy Garden br Airhero br Magician br Explorer br Farer br Seabedwar br Sortie br Phantom Fighter br br br GameKing III br br br GM br TimeTop quietly released a third GameKing machine called the GameKing III or GM sometime in While early advertisements showed the GameKing III with the same false color background picture as the GameKing I and II which indicated that the system was black and white like the previous GameKing models the GM is full colour Another distinction of the GM is that unlike its predecessors the Gameking I and II which were promoted and marketed worldwide the Gameking III was not distributed outside of Asia making it much less common than the earlier models In many websites initially reported the device as coming soon and it is not known why Timetop eventually decided to offer only a limited release br The resolution doesn t seem enhanced compared to an original GameKing and classic GameKing cartridges are automatically colorized while games especially developed for it allegedly make use of the full color palette which for the moment remains unknown The site claimed a total of carts for this system If the built in game is included titles are known as of br A new design for the GKIII was placed in April at the Timetop site and later removed see GM below br br br GM br br A second design for the Gameking III also exists which combines elements from the GM with the GM The Button design and layout is from the GM design with the A button being distinctly larger than the B button but the overall form is obviously inspired from Sony s PSP design Several colors are shown on the back of the box green and orange for example however only two colors a black edition and a white edition are confirmed to exist br br br GameKing III games br GameKing III machines have a built in game br br Galaxy Crisis br At the moment the only known game carts for the GameKing III are br br Adventure br Urgent Action br Diamond br Panzer br Fly Car br Blaze Plane br br Hermic Battle br Vagrant br br br Handy Game GM br br A distinct Timetop console exists which uses NES compatible hardware rather than the proprietary hardware of the other Gameking consoles and also has an integrated TV output While early mockups indicated this handheld was considered part of the Gameking line Timetop eventually removed the gameking branding from this edition prior to its release replacing it with Timetop LTPS Handy Game ironically handy game was the working title EPYX coined in for what would become the Atari Lynx The console comes with built in games and is also able to accept cartridges however their size and connectors are different from and incompatible with previous Gameking consoles The game selection includes games typically found on NES clones like Pooyan or Dig Dug as well as graphic ROM hacks of famous NES games for example using Blue s Journey graphics with Adventure Island br The GM was available in a large variety of colors with some faceplaces containing very elaborate designs Colors included silver black green yellow and pink br br br HandyGame GM games br The NES clone version of the GameKing III has its own selection of games most of them being pirated or unlicensed NES games or variations These come multi carts with combinations such as in in and in etc No HandyGame carts are compatible with any previous model br br br
