video br An MP music player is included in the system s applications and allows the creation of custom playlists using drag and dropping of files MP music files can be played from either SD slot or the internal memory of the device MP files can also be used as alarms along with conventional Palm OS alarms br Photos JPEG or PNG format could be downloaded to the device using the Palm Desktop software or loaded onto SD cards and could be shared and made into a slideshow with background music on the device br The bundled video player on the device Kinoma would only play videos in a proprietary format converted using the Kinoma Producer software which supported conversion of MPEG MPEG QuickTime AVI and DivX The software however was limited in its conversion abilities enticing users to pay for the full version It has been suggested that this difficulty in converting video for the device diminished the Zodiac s success Several aftermarket DivX and XviD players have been developed such as the TCPMP and at the time of bankruptcy Tapwave were working on an update to supply MPEG hardware decoding br Device design br Due to the metal construction of the Zodiac the device was seen to be more solid than other PDAs However on some models the adhesive on the shoulder buttons failed and occasionally the screen was scratched by the screen cover when grit entered Furthermore due to the insecure clip holding the stylus they could be knocked loose and potentially lost Some alternative cases solved this problem with their own stylus holder br Compatibility br The Zodiac is a Palm OS compatible device and most software compatible with Palm OS runs without issue In particular most Palm OS compatible games play on the Zodiac Tapwave also provided proprietary APIs to allow developers to take advantage of the Zodiac s graphics and sound hardware A great deal of freeware and shareware games and emulators are therefore available For example there are versions of Doom Quake Hexen Hexen II and Heretic as well as versions of emulators such as UAE ScummVM and LJZ LJP a multi system emulator There have also been attempts to emulate PlayStation games onto the Zodiac the most successful emulator being PPSX It is however nowhere near completion and many games are not playable yet br Battery br The device has a total battery life of about hours when using video backlight screen and CPU intensive tasks and while running as a dedicated audio player it is closer to hours The original battery was a mAh Li Ion third party replacements with mAh capacity are still available
