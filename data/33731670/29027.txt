The Game Gear is an bit fourth generation handheld game console released by Sega on October in Japan in April throughout North America and Europe and during in Australia The Game Gear primarily competed with Nintendo s Game Boy the Atari Lynx and NEC s TurboExpress It shares much of its hardware with the Master System and can play Master System games through the use of an adapter Sega positioned the Game Gear which had a full color backlit screen with a landscape format as a technologically superior handheld to the Game Boy br Though the Game Gear was rushed to market its unique game library and price point gave it an edge over the Atari Lynx and TurboExpress However due to its short battery life lack of original games and weak support from Sega the Game Gear was unable to surpass the Game Boy selling million units by March The Game Gear was discontinued in It was re released as a budget system by Majesco Entertainment in under license from Sega this continued until about br Reception of the Game Gear was mixed with praise for its full color backlit screen and processing power criticisms over its large size and short battery life and questions over the quality of its game library br br br History br Developed as codename Project Mercury the Game Gear was launched in Japan on October in North America and Europe in and in Australia in Originally retailing at in Japan US equivalent to in in North America and in the United Kingdom the Game Gear was developed to compete with the Game Boy which Nintendo had released in The decision to make a handheld console was made by Sega s CEO Hayao Nakayama and the name was chosen by newly appointed Sega of America CEO Michael Katz Both Sega s chairman Isao Okawa and cofounder David Rosen approved of the name The console had been designed as a portable version of the Master System with more powerful features than the Game Boy including a full color screen instead of monochromatic According to former Sega console hardware research and development head Hideki Sato Sega saw the Game Boy s black and white screen as a challenge to make our own color handheld system br To improve upon the design of its competition Sega modeled the Game Gear with a similar shape to a Genesis controller intending the curved surfaces and greater length more comfortable to hold than the Game Boy The console s mass was carefully considered from the beginning of the development aiming for a total mass between that of the Game Boy and the Atari Lynx another full color screen competing product Game Gear can use the Master Gear adaptor to play games from the similar Master System The original Game Gear pack in game is Columns which is similar to Tetris which was bundled with the Game Boy launch br br With a late start into the handheld console market Sega rushed to get the Game Gear into stores quickly having lagged behind Nintendo in sales without a handheld on the market As one method of doing so Sega based the Game Gear hardware on the Master System with a much larger color palette compared to the Master System s colors Part of the intention was easy conversion of Master System games The Game Gear s technological superiority over Game Boy means that Game Boy can run for more than hours on four AA batteries and the Game Gear runs for three to five hours on six AA batteries Its quick launch in Japan sold units in its first two days within a month and more than back orders According to Sega of America marketing director Robert Botch there is clearly a need for a quality portable system that provides features other systems have failed to deliver This means easy to view full color graphics and exciting quality games that appeal to all ages br br br Release and marketing br Before the Game Gear s launch in the bit Genesis had been successfully marketed as a more mature option for players and this was repeated against the Game Boy Sega s marketing in Japan did not take this perspective instead opting for advertisements with Japanese women featuring the handheld but Sega s worldwide advertising prominently positioned the Game Gear as the cooler console than the Game Boy br In North America marketing for the Game Gear includes side by side comparisons against the Game Boy and liken Game Boy players to the obese and uneducated Most of those advertisements feature the Sega Scream with a person yelling the name One Sega advertisement in early features the quote If you were color blind and had an IQ of less than then you wouldn t mind which portable you had Such advertising drew outrage from Nintendo who sought to have protests organized against Sega for insulting disabled persons Sega of America president Tom Kalinske responded that Nintendo should spend more time improving their products and marketing rather than working on behind the scenes coercive activities Ultimately this debate would have little impact on sales for the Game Gear br Europe and Australia were the last regions to receive the Game Gear Due to delays some importers paid up to Upon launch in Europe video game distributor Virgin Mastertronic unveiled the price as positioning it as being more expensive than the Game Boy but less expensive than the also full color Atari Lynx Marketing in the United Kingdom includes the slogan To be this good takes Sega and advertisements with a biker In the United Kingdom the Game Gear had a share of the handheld market in January increasing to by December br br br Decline br Sega reduced support for the Game Gear in favor of home consoles The successful Genesis yielded two major peripherals the Sega CD and the X Sega s new bit Saturn console was launched in Though selling million units by March including million in Japan the Game Gear was never able to match the success of its main rival the Game Boy with ten times the sales Game Gear s late sales were further hurt by Nintendo s release of the smaller Game Boy Pocket running on two AAA batteries br Plans for a bit fifth generation direct successor to the Game Gear were made and canceled leaving only the Genesis Nomad a portable version of the Genesis Moreover the Nomad was intended to supplement the Game Gear rather than replace it in press coverage leading up to the Nomad s release Sega representatives said the company was not discontinuing the Game Gear in favor of the Nomad and that We believe the two can co exist Though the Nomad had been released in Sega did not officially end support for the Game Gear until in Japan and worldwide br Though the system was originally discontinued in third party developer Majesco Entertainment released a version of the Game Gear at US equivalent to in with games in the year New games were released such as a port of Super Battletank This machine is compatible with all previous Game Gear games but incompatible with the TV Tuner and some Master System adaptors The system and its repressed games were likely sold throughout and but were likely discontinued the following year Over ten years later on March Nintendo announced that its DS Virtual Console service on the Nintendo eShop would feature Game Gear games br br br Technical specifications br br The Game Gear was designed to be played horizontally It contains an bit MHz Zilog Z CPU the same as the Master System Its screen measures inches mm diagonally and is able to display up to simultaneous colors from a total palette of with a frame rate of Hz with non square pixels The screen is backlit for low light using a small CCFL tube Powered by six AA batteries its approximate battery life is to hours To lengthen this and reduce consumer cost Sega released two types of external rechargeable battery packs The system contains KB of RAM and an additional KB of video RAM Its sound chip is a Texas Instruments SN PSG like the Master System except with stereo sound via headphones Game Gear is mm in wide mm in high and mm in deep br Accessories include a TV Tuner with a whip antenna for the cartridge slot to become a handheld television Released at equivalent to US the add on was expensive but unique for collectors and contributed to the system s popularity The Super Wide Gear magnifies the screen The Car Gear adapter plugs into cigarette lighters to power the system while traveling and the Gear to Gear Cable VS Cable in Japan establishes a data connection between two Game Gear systems using the same multiplayer game Master Gear enables the Game Gear to play Master System games br Game Gear model variations include several colors including a blue sports variation in North America bundled with World Series Baseball or The Lion King A white version was bundled with a TV tuner Other versions include a red Coca Cola theme bundled with Coca Cola Kid and the Kids Gear Japan only variation for children br br br Game library br br Over total Game Gear games were released although only six launch games Prices for game cartridges initially ranged from to The casings are molded black plastic with a rounded front to aid in removal Games include Sonic the Hedgehog The GG Shinobi Space Harrier and Land of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse which was considered the best game for the system by GamesRadar Later games include franchises that had originated on the successful bit Genesis and much of the Game Gear s library is Master System ports Because of the landscape orientation of the Game Gear s screen and the similarities to Master System hardware it was easy for developers to port Master System games to the Game Gear br Because of Nintendo s control over the console video game market few third party developers were available to create games for Sega s systems This contributed to the many ports from Master System Likewise because of this much of the Game Gear library is unique among handhelds pulling sales away from the Atari Lynx and NEC TurboExpress and helping to establish the Game Gear s market position However the Game Boy s library is over individual games Several Game Gear games were released years later on the Nintendo DS s Virtual Console service on the Nintendo eShop The emulator for the Virtual Console releases was handled by M br br br Game Gear Micro br On June as part of its th anniversary Sega revealed the Game Gear Micro retroconsole The Micro was released in Japan on October through Japanese storefronts in four different versions varying in color and the game selection with each containing four separate Game Gear games Each unit otherwise is the same size measuring mm mm mm in in in with a mm in display and is powered by AAA batteries or through a separate USB charger Each unit also includes a headphone jack A magnifying accessory modeled after the original system s Big Window accessory was included with preorders A special version of the device published by M and licensed by Sega was being shipped with a limited edition of Aleste Collection in December This version includes a newly developed Game Gear title G G Aleste as well as four other Aleste titles br br br Reception br Game Gear surpassed the Atari Lynx and NEC TurboExpress but lagged far behind the Game Boy in the handheld marketplace Retrospective reception to the Game Gear is mixed In GamePro listed the Game Gear as th on its list of the Worst Selling Handhelds of All Time and criticized aspects of the implementation of its technology but also stated that the Game Gear could be considered a commercial success at nearly million units sold According to GamePro reviewer Blake Snow Unlike the Game Boy the Game Gear rocked the landscape holding position making it less cramped for human beings with two hands to hold And even though the Game Gear could be considered a success its bulky frame relative high price constant consumption of AA batteries and a lack of appealing games ultimately kept Sega from releasing a true successor In speaking with Famitsu DC for its November issue Sato stated that the Game Gear achieved significant handheld console market share but that Nintendo s Game Boy was such a runaway success and had gobbled up so much of the market that our success was still seen as a failure which I think is a shame br GamesRadar offered some praise for the system and its library stating With its bit processor and bright color screen it was basically the Sega Master System in your hands How many batteries did we suck dry playing Sonic Madden and Road Rash on the bus or in the car or in the dark when we were supposed to be sleeping You couldn t do that on a Game Boy By contrast IGN reviewer Levi Buchanan stated the Game Gear s biggest fault was its game library when compared to the Game Boy stating the software was completely lacking compared to its chief rival which was bathed in quality games It didn t matter that the Game Gear was more powerful The color screen did not reverse any fortunes Content and innovation beat out technology a formula that Nintendo is using right now with the continued ascendance of the DS and Wii Buchanan praised some of the library Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games and fun is resilient against time Retro Gamer praised Sega s accomplishment in surviving against the competition of Nintendo in the handheld console market with the Game Gear noting that for all the handhelds that have gone up against the might of Nintendo and ultimately lost out Sega s Game Gear managed to last the longest only outdone in sales by the Sony PSP For its fans it will remain a piece of classic gaming hardware whose legacy lives on forever br br br See also br br Watara Supervision br Gamate br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br br Game Gear Micro official website Japanese
