id: 3921614
In the history of video games the first generation era refers to the video games video game consoles and handheld video game consoles available from to Notable consoles of the first generation include the Odyssey series excluding the Magnavox Odyssey the Atari Home Pong the Coleco Telstar series and the Color TV Game series The generation ended with the Computer TV Game in and its following discontinuation in but many manufacturers had left the market prior due to the market decline in the year of and the start of the second generation of video game consoles br Most of the games developed during this generation were hard wired into the consoles and unlike later generations most were not contained on removable media that the user could switch between Consoles often came with accessories and cartridges that could alter the way the game played to enhance the gameplay experience as graphical capabilities consisted of simple geometry such as dots lines or blocks that would occupy only a single screen First generation consoles were not capable of displaying more than two colours until later in the generation and audio capabilities were limited with some consoles having no sound at all br In two major developments influenced the future of the home video game market In June Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney founded Atari which would go on to be one of the most well known video game companies and play a vital role in the early generations of consoles In September Magnavox an established electronics company released the Odyssey Inspired by the Odyssey s ping pong game Atari would soon go on to market the game Pong in both arcade and home versions Nintendo a well established Japanese company that made a number of different products entered the video game console market for the first time in with its Color TV Game series br br br Overview br br br History br In Ralph Baer conceived the idea of an interactive television while designing a television set for Loral in the Bronx New York Baer did not pursue the idea but it returned to him in August when he was the Chief Engineer and manager of the Equipment Design Division at Sanders Associates By December he and a technician created a prototype that allowed a player to move a line across the screen After a demonstration to the company s director of research and development some funding was allotted and the project was made official Baer spent the next few months designing further prototypes and in February assigned technician Bill Harrison to begin building the project Harrison spent the next few months in between other projects building out successive modifications to the prototype Baer meanwhile collaborated with engineer Bill Rusch on the design of the console including developing the basis of many games for the system By May the first game was developed and by June multiple games were completed for what was then a second prototype box This included a game where players controlled dots chasing each other and a light gun shooter game with a plastic rifle By August Baer and Harrison had completed a third prototype machine but Baer felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system to make up for this he added Bill Rusch who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console to the project He soon proved his value to the team by coming up with a way to display three dots on the screen at once rather than the previous two and proposing the development of a ping pong game br br As Sanders was a military contractor and not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics the team approached several cable television industry companies to produce the console but were unable to find a buyer By January the team had produced the seventh prototype nicknamed the Brown Box After a Sanders patent attorney recommended approaching television manufacturers they found interest first at RCA and finally at Magnavox who entered negotiations in July and signed an agreement in January Magnavox designed the exterior of the machine and re engineered some of the internals with consultation from Baer and Harrison they removed the ability to display color reduced the number of controller types and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console s circuitry when plugged into the console Magnavox named the console the Magnavox Odyssey and announced the system s launch date for September br In the late s Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar at Stanford University Spacewar is a mainframe game developed by a group of students and employees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Bushnell had worked at an amusement park and felt that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular The high price of computers capable of running the game however meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible By however minicomputers were beginning to come down in price He and his office mate Ted Dabney agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game By the end of November the pair had abandoned the project as untenable as economically feasible computers were not powerful enough Dabney soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it and from there Syzygy Engineering came up with the idea of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead Computer Space the first commercial arcade video game was released by the pair as Syzygy Engineering through Nutting Associates at the end of and after its release they incorporated as Atari in the following year and began designing more games Bushnell saw a demonstration of the Odyssey console playing its Table Tennis game in early and assigned their first employee Allan Alcorn to produce an arcade table tennis game The result Pong was the first major arcade video game success and inspired a large number of arcade and dedicated console versions and clones including Atari s Home Pong in br br br Technology br The first generation of consoles did not contain a microprocessor and were based on custom codeless state machine computers consisting of discrete logic TTL circuits comprising each element of the game itself Over the generation technology steadily improved and later consoles of the generation moved the bulk of the circuitry to custom integrated circuits such as Atari s custom Pong chips and General Instruments AY series br Graphical capabilities were limited throughout the generation often supported with physical accessories and screen overlays but saw some improvement towards the end of the generation While the Odyssey could only display square dots in black and white as the generation progressed consoles started being able to display color as well as more complex shapes and text Early consoles such as the Odyssey and TV Tennis Electrotennis required players to keep track of scores manually but later many introduced score counters on the display to assist players in score tracking Audio capabilities were slow to improve over the generation starting with the Odyssey which had no audio and later moving on to consoles which had buzzers that could produce a small range of beeps and buzzes br br br Market saturation and the end of the generation br In General Instruments produced a series of affordable integrated chips that allowed companies to simplify console production and lower costs Due to this many companies had entered the home console market by the late s A significant number released consoles that were essentially clones of Atari s Home Pong and many were poorly made and rushed to market causing the home console market to saturate The demand for the chip was so high that General Instruments could not supply enough to satisfy all the orders it was receiving causing problems for some smaller companies Coleco received their order early on allowing them to build up strong production capabilities and have success with their Telstar range br The start of the second generation and the next major advancement in home console technology began in with the release of the Fairchild Channel F The technology behind the first generation quickly became obsolete as consumers had the ability to purchase new games for second generation consoles instead of having to purchase new systems when they wanted new content as with the dedicated consoles of the first generation In comparison to the limited game library for each dedicated console the Atari VCS launched with Combat a cartridge containing games As people transitioned to the newer systems some companies were left with surplus stock and were selling at a loss The combination of market saturation and the start of the second generation caused many companies to leave the market completely These events became known as the video game crash of as sales of second generation consoles were only modest for the next few years until the arrival of the killer app the home port of Space Invaders for the Atari VCS in br br br Home systems br br There were hundreds of home video game consoles known to have existed in the first generation of video games This section lists the most notable br br br Odyssey series br br In Magnavox released the world s first home video game console the Magnavox Odyssey It came packaged with board game paraphernalia such as cards paper money and dice to enhance the games It had features that became industry standard in subsequent generations such as detachable controllers light gun accessories and interchangeable game media xvii While no game data was stored on the circuit cards as they would be in future consoles they could be used to select one of the twelve games built onto the hardware Magnavox licensed its video game patents to other companies for a fee and prosecuted companies who released consoles without a licensing agreement br It was with the Odyssey that Nintendo first became involved in the home video game market According to Martin Picard in the International Journal of Computer Game Research in Nintendo had even before the marketing of the first home console in the United States an alliance with the American pioneer Magnavox to develop and produce optoelectronic guns for the Odyssey since it was similar to what Nintendo was able to offer in the Japanese toy market in the s br In North American Philips purchased Magnavox and released a series of eight Odyssey consoles in North America from to All of them were dedicated consoles and each subsequent release was an improvement over the previous adding features such as additional game variations on screen displays and player controlled handicaps such as smaller paddle sizes and variable ball speed Three Odyssey series consoles were also released in Europe with similar features from to br br br TV Tennis Electrotennis br br On September several months before the release of Home Pong in North America Epoch released Japan s first home console the TV Tennis Electrotennis The technology was licensed from Magnavox and it contained a single ball and paddle style game that resembled Pong but without an onscreen score display The game controls were contained within the base unit and it connected to a television set through an ultra high frequency UHF antenna as opposed to being directly connected which was unique to the console at the time Compared to popular consoles of the generation it performed poorly with an approximate units sold br br br Atari Home Pong br br In late Atari released a home version of their popular arcade game Pong It had been in development since under the lead of Allan Alcorn and Harold Lee By the end of Atari had become a major company in the home console market due to Home Pong Following Pong s success Magnavox filed suit against Atari for infringement on its technology patents and ended up settling out of court with Atari becoming a licensee of Magnavox br Home video games achieved widespread popularity with the release of a home version of Pong and its success sparked hundreds of clones including the Coleco Telstar which went on to be a success in its own right with over a dozen models br br br Coleco Telstar series br br Starting in Coleco released a series of fourteen dedicated consoles up until when they suffered a significant loss due to the combination of dock workers strike preventing it from shipping the final product in time for the holidays and the start of the second generation The series featured a number of different styles of ball games and external accessories to enhance gameplay such as the Telstar Arcade which had a unique triangular design that came with a light gun and steering wheel attached to the casing The series was marketed at a lower price than its competitors and sold well with over a million sales br br br Color TV Game series br br In the late s Nintendo released a series of five consoles for the Japanese market The first of the series and the first console created by Nintendo the Color TV Game was released in and contained six ball and paddle games The last the Computer TV Game was a port of Nintendo s first arcade game Computer Othello The third console in the series the Color TV Game Racing was the first project of Shigeru Miyamoto who would go on to become the creator of some of the most well known video game franchises br br br Comparison br br br Notes br br br Handheld systems br br All of the handheld systems from the first generation are dedicated consoles and started late into the first generation It was not until the second generation and the release of the Microvision that players could purchase games separately for the systems The early dedicated handheld consoles were eventually eclipsed in popularity by programmable video games which became popular in the fourth generation with the introduction of the Game Gear br br One notable example is the Mattel handheld game series which were released from to The first to be released were Mattel Auto Race and Mattel Football while some of the latter models like the Mattel Speed Freak and the Mattel Competition Football handhelds are closer to the end of the first generation They were followed by other titles based on sports and some licensed properties such as Battlestar Galactica Each game had basic controls a simple LED interface and a buzzer for sound The series was popular sold well and at times was difficult to find due to high demand br In the same year Coleco began to release handheld consoles after the end of the Telstar home console series They released Electronic Quarterback which expanded on the popular American football style games by adding new features Alongside Mattel Football it became the other popular sports game of the period br br br See also br br s in video games br Home
