The Magnavox Odyssey stylized as Magnavox Odyssey also known as Philips Odyssey is a second generation home video game console that was released in It was sold in Europe as the Philips Videopac G in Brazil and Peru as the Philips Odyssey and in Japan as Odyssey odessei The Odyssey was one of the five major home consoles prior to the video game market crash along with Atari Atari Intellivision and ColecoVision br In the early s Magnavox pioneered the home video game industry by successfully bringing the first home console to market the Odyssey which was quickly followed by a number of later models each with a few technological improvements see Magnavox Odyssey series In Magnavox now a subsidiary of North American Philips decided to release an all new successor Odyssey br In the video game website IGN named the Odyssey the st greatest video game console out of its list of br br br Design br br The original Odyssey had a number of removable circuit cards that switched between the built in games With the Odyssey each game could be a unique experience with its own foreground graphics gameplay scoring and music some Odyssey games were later re released for the G with added background and updated foreground graphics that the Odyssey was not capable of displaying The potential was enormous as an unlimited number of games could be individually purchased a game player could purchase a library of video games tailored to their own interest Unlike any other system at that time the Odyssey included a full alphanumeric membrane keyboard which was to be used for educational games selecting options or programming Magnavox released a cartridge called Computer Intro with the intent of teaching simple computer programming br The Odyssey used the standard joystick design of the s and early s the original console had a moderately sized silver controller held in one hand with a square housing for its eight direction stick that was manipulated with the other hand Later releases had a similar black controller with an pointed star shaped housing for its eight direction joystick In the upper corner of the joystick was a single Action button silver on the original controllers and red on the black controllers The games graphics and packaging were designed by Ron Bradford and Steve Lehner br During the time of Odyssey s manufacturing some came with controllers that could be plugged and unplugged from the back of the unit via their DB connector while others had their controllers hardwired into the rear of the base unit itself br One of the strongest points of the system was its speech synthesis unit which was released as an add on for speech music and sound effects enhancement The area that the Odyssey may be best remembered for was its pioneering fusion of board and video games The Master Strategy Series The first game released was Quest for the Rings with gameplay somewhat similar to Dungeons Dragons and a storyline reminiscent of J R R Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings Later two other games were released in this series Conquest of the World and The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt each with its own gameboard br Its graphics and few color choices compared to its biggest competitors at the time the Atari Mattel s Intellivision and the Bally Astrocade were its weakest point Of these systems the Odyssey was listed by Jeff Rovin as being the third in total of sales and one of the seven major video game suppliers br br br Market life br br br United States br The console sold moderately well in the U S Prior to the nationwide release of the Mattel Intellivision in the console video game market was dominated by the competition between the Odyssey and Atari It remained one of the three primary consoles from to mid though a distant third behind the Atari and Mattel Intellivision br To sell would be customers on its resemblance to a home computer the Odyssey was marketed with phrases such as The Ultimate Computer Video Game System Sync Sound Action True Reality Synthesization On Screen Digital Readouts and a serious educational tool on the packaging for the console and its game cartridges All games aside from Showdown in AD produced by Magnavox Philips ended with an exclamation point such as K C Munchkin and Killer Bees br No third party game appeared for the Odyssey in the United States until Imagic s Demon Attack in The lack of third party support kept the number of new games very limited but the success of the Philips Videopac G overseas led to two other companies producing games for it Parker Brothers released Popeye Frogger Q bert and Super Cobra while Imagic also released Atlantis br br br Europe br br In Europe the Odyssey did very well on the market The console was most widely known as the Philips Videopac G or just the Videopac although branded variants were released in some areas of Europe under the names Philips Videopac C Radiola Jet Schneider and Siera G Philips used their own name rather than Magnavox s for European marketing A rare model the Philips Videopac G was only released in Europe it had a built in black and white monitor Videopac game cartridges are mostly compatible with American Odyssey units although some games have color differences and a few are completely incompatible such as Frogger on the European console being unable to show the second half of the playing field and Chess on the American model as the extra hardware module could not work with the console A number of additional games were released in Europe that never came out in the U S br br br Brazil br In Brazil the console was released simply as Philips Odyssey since the original Odyssey had had only a limited release by a local company Planil Com rcio under license The Odyssey became much more popular in Brazil than it ever was in the U S tournaments were even held for popular games like K C s Krazy Chase Come Come in Brazil Titles of games were translated into Portuguese sometimes creating a new story like Pick axe Pete that became Didi na Mina Encantada Didi in the Enchanted Mine referring to Renato Arag o s comedy character and was one of the most famous Odyssey games in Brazil br br br Japan br The Odyssey was released in Japan in December by K ton Trading Toitarii Enterprise a division of DINGU company under the name odessei Japanese versions of the Odyssey and its games consisted of the American boxes with katakana stickers on them and cheaply printed black and white Japanese manuals The initial price for the console was which is approximately US equivalent to about in It was apparently not very successful Japanese Odyssey items are now very difficult to find br br br Games br br br Technical specifications br CPU br Intel bit microcontroller

speech synthesis and enhanced sound effects Unlike Intellivoice games compatible with The Voice did not require it Danny Goodman of Creative Computing Video Arcade Games predicted that eliminates any incentive to buy the voice module br Chess Module the Odyssey did not have enough memory and computing power for a decent implementation of chess on its own so the C chess module contained a secondary NSC CPU with its own extra memory to run the chess program Gambiet br Videopac Jopac compatible only Microsoft Basic The rare C Home Computer Module made available in by Philips was a costly extension for the newer Videopac and Jopac consoles only It went with a thick A manual and required an optional external tape recorder to save the programs This module was the sole valuable justification of the presence of a so called keyboard which was supposedly designed to look like a hybrid educational toy as read in header lines describing earlier this family of pluri purpose consoles even in the TV commercials that echoed the slogan written on these brand new machines Video Computer Unfortunately this late niche concept even limited to learning game code contrary to the more professional packaging could not resist at all the already overwhelming market of the real bit home computers where the Atari shared the same look in surprisingly The latter was advertised itself The affordable home computer that s easy to use even for people who ve never used a computer before This expensive module is not to be confused with the cheap cartridge Computer Intro br br br Emulation br An open
