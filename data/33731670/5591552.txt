The Game Boy is a handheld game console developed by Nintendo launched in the Japanese home market on April followed by North America and Europe later that year Following the success of the Game Watch single game handhelds Nintendo developed the Game Boy to be more like a portable console with interchangeable cartridges The concept proved highly successful and the Game Boy became a cultural icon of the s br The Game Boy was designed by the Nintendo Research Development team led by Gunpei Yokoi and Satoru Okada The device features a dot matrix display a directional pad four game buttons a single speaker and uses Game Pak cartridges The two toned gray design with black blue and dark magenta accents sported softly rounded corners except for the bottom right which was curved At launch it was sold either as a standalone unit or bundled with games like Super Mario Land and Tetris br Despite mixed reviews criticizing its monochrome graphics and larger size compared to competitors like the Sega Game Gear Atari Lynx and NEC TurboExpress the Game Boy rapidly outsold them all An estimated million units of the Game Boy and its successor the Game Boy Color have been sold worldwide making it the fourth best selling console ever The Game Boy received several redesigns during its lifespan including the smaller Game Boy Pocket and the backlit Game Boy Light Sales of Game Boy variants continued until br br br Development br The Game Boy was designed by the team at Nintendo Research Development R D which had previously developed the Game Watch handhelds and video games including Mario Bros and Donkey Kong However early in the process deep disagreements arose between Gunpei Yokoi the R D division director and Satoru Okada the assistant director Yokoi s original vision was for a simpler device akin to an advanced Game Watch while Okada strongly advocated for a more powerful device with interchangeable cartridges like a portable version of the successful Nintendo Entertainment System NES Their differing visions for the project led to frequent clashes heated meetings and high tensions with Okada ultimately convincing Yokoi of his vision br The team was encouraged to pursue the project by Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi However within Nintendo many were skeptical that such a device would be feasible Some employees even gave the project the derogatory nickname DameGame dame meaning hopeless in Japanese br The codename for this nascent project was Dot Matrix Game DMG reflecting its intended display technology a stark contrast to the Game Watch series which had segmented LCDs pre printed with an overlay limiting each model to only play one game The initials DMG came to be featured on the final product s model number DMG br Initially a Ricoh manufactured CPU similar to the one used in the NES was considered for compatibility However due to resource constraints amid the ongoing development of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System the Game Boy team chose a less powerful CPU from the Sharp Corporation br Sharp initially showed reluctance to engage in the project particularly for the LCD technology which was a critical component The team considered buying displays from the Citizen Watch Company which was already using LCD screens to build portable TVs However talks continued with Sharp with Yokoi and Okada showing the company a Game Boy mockup After seeing the device and wanting to keep Nintendo as a client Sharp offered competitive pricing and secured the contract Sharp originally proposed a twisted nematic TN display but after seeing a prototype Game Boy Yamauchi rejected the TN technology as too hard to see Sharp then suggested super twisted nematic STN technology which had better viewing angles and contrast but was more expensive To reduce cost the team reduced the screen size however it was too late in the development process to shrink the console s overall size br Within R D Yokoi had long promoted lateral thinking with withered technology a design philosophy which eschewed cutting edge technology in favor of using mature technologies which tended to be more affordable and reliable in innovative ways As a result of this philosophy to keep costs low and extend battery life the Game Boy was designed without a backlight and used a simple grayscale screen despite potential concerns about visibility and the lack of color The approach was ultimately vindicated as rival units with full color backlit screens were panned for their dismal battery life making the Game Boy more appealing to consumers br In the early s Okada had worked on an electronic game from Nintendo called Computer Mah jong Yakuman that allowed cable communication between two devices he thought it would be possible to implement a similar feature in the Game Boy Despite concerns within the team that the feature would be too difficult to use and thus a waste of resources Okada pushed forward and developed the Game Link Cable technology himself This effort led to the creation of the battle and trade gameplay features in the Pok mon series first released in br A prototype Game Boy was unveiled in and later exhibited at multiple industry trade shows The device incorporated a key design element developed by Yokoi and his team at R D for its Game Watch predecessor the directional control pad often referred to as the D pad Yokoi had recognized that traditional joysticks might hinder the portability of handheld devices As a result he designed the D pad a flat controller that extends just slightly beyond the device s casing A similar layout had been used on the NES making it easier for owners to transition to the handheld Yamauchi estimated that the console would achieve sales exceeding million units in its initial three years a claim that was regarded as bold at the time br Nintendo s philosophy centered on the belief that the appeal of a gaming system was primarily determined by the quality of its games With this in mind Okada pushed to make development tools available for third party developers a shortcoming of the launch of the NES R D also developed Super Mario Land a portable adaptation of the Super Mario Bros game intending it to be the flagship title for the Game Boy However Henk Rogers brought the Soviet Union made game Tetris to the attention of Nintendo of America Despite its simple graphics and lack of a well known brand Tetris s suitability for a handheld platform convinced Nintendo president Minoru Arakawa to port and bundle it with the Game Boy As a result Tetris was bundled with the Game Boy in every region except Japan on its release br The Game Boy launched in the Japanese market in April followed by North America in July and Europe in September of the following year backed by a million marketing effort Sales of the Game Boy and its successor variants including the Game Boy Color continued until March br br br Hardware br br The Game Boy uses a custom system on a chip SoC to house most of the components named the DMG CPU by Nintendo and the LR by its manufacturer the Sharp Corporation br Within the DMG CPU the main processor is a Sharp SM a hybrid between two other bit processors the Intel and the Zilog Z The SM has the seven bit registers of the compared to on the Z but uses the Z s programming syntax and extra bit manipulation instructions it also adds a few new instructions to optimize the processor for certain operations related to the way the hardware was arranged The Sharp SM operates at a clock rate of MHz br The DMG CPU also incorporates the Picture Processing Unit essentially a basic GPU that renders visuals using an KB bank of Video RAM located on the motherboard The display itself is a inch diagonal reflective super twisted nematic STN monochrome liquid crystal display LCD measuring millimeters in wide by millimeters in high The screen can render four shades with a resolution of pixels wide by pixels high in a aspect ratio br The SoC also contains a B bootstrap ROM which is used to start up the device B of High RAM that can be accessed faster similar to a CPU cache and the Audio Processing Unit a programmable sound generator with four channels a pulse wave generation channel with frequency and volume variation a second pulse wave generation channel with only volume variation a wave channel than can reproduce any waveform recorded in RAM and a white noise channel with volume variation The motherboard also contains a KB working RAM chip br The Game Boy features a D pad directional pad four buttons labeled A B SELECT and START and a sliding power switch with a cartridge lock to prevent removal The volume and contrast are adjusted by dials on either side The original Game Boy was powered internally by four AA batteries For extended use an optional AC adapter or rechargeable battery pack can be connected via a coaxial power connector on the left side The Game Boy has a single monaural speaker and a mm stereo headphone jack The right side offers a Game Link Cable port for connecting to another Game Boy for two player games or notably in Pok mon sharing files This port can also be used with a Game Boy Printer br br br Technical specifications br br br Revisions br br The Game Boy continued to experience strong sales well into the s as popular games continued to increase interest in the handheld This commercial success was something of a double edged sword for Nintendo the device was seen as aged but the company was unwilling to abandon it Instead the company embarked on a series of improvements to the Game Boy in an effort to keep the console relevant br br br Play It Loud br The first revision to the Game Boy came on March when Nintendo released several special edition Game Boy models with colored cases advertising them in the Play It Loud campaign known in Japan as Game Boy Bros Play It Loud units were manufactured in red yellow green blue black white and clear transparent The Play It Loud s screens also have a darker border than the normal Game Boy br br br Game Boy Pocket br br A major revision to the Game Boy came in with the introduction of the Game Boy Pocket a slimmed down unit that required just two smaller AAA batteries albeit at the expense of providing just hours of gameplay The other major change was that the screen was changed to an film compensated super twisted nematic FSTN LCD This film compensation layer produced a true black and white display rather than the green hues of the original Game Boy The Pocket also has a smaller Game Link Cable port which requires an adapter to link with the original Game Boy This smaller port design would be used on all subsequent Game Boy models Internally the Game Boy Pocket had a new SoC the Nintendo CPU MGB an improved version of the DMG CPU A major change was that the device s KB of Video RAM was moved from the motherboard to the SoC for faster access br The Game Boy Pocket was released in Japan on July and in North America on September for US equivalent to in The Game Boy Pocket revitalized hardware sales and its release was ultimately well timed as it coincided with the release of the first Pok mon game which catapulted the Game Boy into uncharted realms of commercial triumph Reviewers praised the device s small size and said that the screen s visibility and pixel response time had been improved mostly eliminating ghosting However other reviewers were dismissive of the device with the Los Angeles Times saying Nintendo was repacking the same old black and white stuff and selling it as new br The first version came only in silver and did not have a power LED A revision in early added a power LED different case colors black green red yellow gold metal and clear and dropped the price to US equivalent to in By mid just months before the Game Boy Color went on sale prices had fallen to US equivalent to in br br br Game Boy Light br br The Game Boy Light was released on April and was only available in Japan Like the Game Boy Pocket the system was priced at equivalent to in The Game Boy Light is slightly bigger than the Game Boy Pocket and features an electroluminescent backlight allowing it to be played in low light conditions It uses two AA batteries which give it approximately gameplay hours with the backlight on and with it off It was available in two standard colors gold and silver br br br Games br br More than games were released for the Game Boy excluding cancelled and unlicensed games Additionally more than games developed for the Game Boy Color were backward compatible with the monochrome Game Boy models br Games are stored on cartridges called the Game Boy Game Pak using read only memory ROM chips Initially due to the limitations of the bit architecture of the device ROM size was limited to KB However Nintendo overcame this limitation with a Memory Bank Controller MBC inside the cartridge This chip sits between the processor and the ROM chips The CPU can only access KB at a time but the MBC can switch between several banks of KB ROM Using this technology Nintendo created Game Boy games that used up to megabyte of ROM Game Paks could also provide additional functionality to the Game Boy system Some cartridges included up to KB of RAM to increase performance which could also be battery backed to save progress when the handheld was off real time clock chips could keep track of time even when the device was off and Rumble Pak cartridges added vibration feedback to enhance gameplay br The top selling franchise for the Game Boy were Pok mon Red Blue and Yellow the first installments of the Pok mon video game series which sold more than million copies The best selling single game was Tetris with more than million copies shipped it was a pack in game included with the purchase of many original Game Boy devices br br br Launch titles br When the Game Boy was released in Japan in April alongside four launch titles Alleyway a Breakout clone Baseball a port of the NES game Super Mario Land an adaptation of the Mario franchise for the handheld format and Yakuman a Mahjong game When the console was introduced in North America two more launch titles were added Tetris and Tennis another NES game port while Yakuman was never released outside of Japan br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br Though it was less technically advanced than the Sega Game Gear Atari Lynx NEC TurboExpress and other competitors notably by not supporting color the Game Boy s lower price along with longer battery life made it a success In its first two weeks in Japan from its release on April the entire stock of units was sold a few months later on July units were sold on its first release day It sold one million units in the United States within weeks More than million units of the Game Boy and Game Boy Color combined have been sold worldwide with million units in Japan million in the Americas and million in other regions By Japanese fiscal year before Game Boy Color s release in late million units of the Game Boy had been sold worldwide At a March press conference in San Francisco Nintendo vice president of marketing Peter Main answered queries about when Nintendo was coming out with a color handheld system by stating that sales of the Game Boy were strong enough that it had decided to hold off on developing a successor handheld for the near future br In Nintendo of America announced that of Game Boy players were female which was higher than the percentage of female players for both the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System In the Game Boy was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame years after its introduction br The console received mixed reviews from critics In a year end review a team of four Electronic Gaming Monthly editors gave the Game Boy scores of and The reviewer who contributed the panned the system due to its black and white display and motion blur while his three co reviewers praised its long battery life and strong games library as well as the sleek conveniently sized design of the new Game Boy Pocket model br br br Sales br The Game Boy Game Boy Pocket and Game Boy Color were commercially successful selling a combined million units worldwide million in Japan million in the Americas and million in all other regions At the time of its discontinuation in the combined sales of the Game Boy made it the best selling game console of all time In later years its sales were surpassed by the Nintendo DS
