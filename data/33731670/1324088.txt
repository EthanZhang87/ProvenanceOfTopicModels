come from the planet Koppai and are similar to the Hocotatians Pikmin features a customizable character who is part of an interplanetary rescue team assisted by Oatchi a space dog with exclusive abilities br Pikmin are directed to perform several tasks with the primary one being the retrieval of items integral to the mission of each game The player must direct the Pikmin to overcome obstacles and PNF s fauna Because individual Pikmin are small and weak against most predators and some are best suited for certain tasks it is the responsibility of the player to direct the Pikmin appropriately to ensure successful retrievals of any items avoid any hazards and quickly tend to any obstacles and predators Game time is divided into individual days each of which consists of approximately minutes in which the player is encouraged to accomplish as much as possible before sunset br Pikmin appear in a variety of colors which signify the Pikmin s abilities and resistance to environmental hazards The number of Pikmin and their abilities have shifted throughout the franchise with the first Pikmin game featuring three colors Red Yellow and Blue Red Pikmin are immune to fire Blue Pikmin can move through the water thanks to their gills and Yellow Pikmin can be thrown higher than other Pikmin and can carry bomb rocks br In Pikmin Yellow Pikmin have lost their ability to carry bomb rocks in exchange for being immune to electrical hazards and White and Purple Pikmin are introduced White Pikmin are the fastest resistant to poisonous gases capable of poisoning enemies and capable of spotting objects buried underground In comparison Purple Pikmin are significantly stronger and heavier than the other types which makes them excellent at inflicting damage and carrying heavy items due to their stunning shockwave br Pikmin introduced two more types the silver colored Rock Pikmin and the pink colored bee inspired Winged Pikmin Rock Pikmin can break crystalline materials cannot be crushed or impaled and inflict the most damage out of all Pikmin types when thrown In comparison Winged Pikmin can fly freely and can fly high which enables them to recover elevated items and attack airborne enemies with ease In addition to making each type capable of carrying bomb rocks Pikmin also adjusted the abilities of Yellow Blue White and Purple Pikmin Yellow Pikmin are tied with Rock Pikmin for the fastest digging speed Blue Pikmin are capable of swimming White Pikmin are tied with Winged Pikmin for the lowest attack strength and slowest digging speed Purple Pikmin are tied with Red Pikmin for second highest attack strength and second fastest digging speed while removing their stunning ability br Pikmin introduced two other types Ice Pikmin which can work during the day like most Pikmin and Glow Pikmin which operate at night and uses their glowing effect to light the way on nighttime maps as a first in the series Ice Pikmin can freeze enemies and bodies of water and are invulnerable to being frozen at the cost of having low attack power They can freeze enemies by attacking them enough or by being eaten similarly to White Pikmin They float on bodies of water when the water isn t frozen Glow Pikmin are immune to all the elements of fire water electricity and poison and can stun enemies when a group is charged together However they cannot be used during the day and require an item to be used to get them in cave areas Pikmin readjusted the previous Pikmin types again Bomb rocks are no longer carried by the Pikmin Instead they are items the player can acquire and use at their discretion Rock Pikmin can now be crushed on hard surfaces and when taking elemental damage They also cannot dig fast like Yellow Pikmin who dig even faster than ever before Purple Pikmin s attack strength is the same as in Pikmin but their shockwave stun returns and gives them extra damage upon impact br Outside of coloration all types of Pikmin share the same method of indicating their strength and swiftness the stalk atop their heads will sport either a leaf bud or flower which develops when Pikmin are fed nectar or left planted in the ground for a certain amount of time By extension all types of Pikmin are stored in their respective motherships referred to as Onions for safety after sunset as they are vulnerable to nocturnal predators The Onions play a vital role in Pikmin reproduction when any food such as prey or pellets is delivered to an Onion it propagates seeds which grow and are plucked from the ground as fully developed Pikmin An Onion serves as an incubator for all Pikmin of its respective color housing the Pikmin The Onions travel alongside Olimar as he flies to different locations on the planet br br br Plot br br br Characters br br br

parasitic species of Pikmin that infect Bulborbs the most common enemy found within the Pikmin series and take control of them These Pikmin are found exclusively within certain cave systems in the game usually as a pack of up to juvenile Bulbmin and a single adult Bulbmin While the adult forms of these Pikmin are hostile towards Olimar the juvenile Bulbmin will follow Olimar like regular Pikmin once the adult is killed They are immune to most hazards save explosions being eaten being crushed and bottomless pits and will not follow Olimar when he leaves the cave they are found in The only way to keep them is if they are transformed into other Pikmin species by Candypop Buds br Pikmin introduced two new species of Pikmin Rock Pikmin and Winged Pikmin The gray colored Rock Pikmin look like small rocks and can smash through glass crystals ice and the carapaces of large creatures These Pikmin can also survive crushing attacks from boulders and enemies and are invulnerable to piercing

gameplay had emerged a shorter more focused challenge that encourages resource management and multitasking with an ultimate time limit seen in Pikmin and Pikmin and a longer experience featuring the collection of treasures within dangerous underground caves that focus more on the aspect of resource management without time limits in Pikmin In Pikmin the team aimed to appease fans of both gameplay types by trying to mix both styles into one as well as make a highly approachable and accessible game considering the series relative lack of success in reaching general audiences Additionally the
