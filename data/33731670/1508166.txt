The WaveBird Wireless Controller stylized as WAVEBIRD commonly abbreviated as WaveBird or WaveBird controller is a radio frequency based wireless controller manufactured by Nintendo for use with the GameCube home video game console Its name is a reference to Dolphin the GameCube s codename during development The WaveBird was available for purchase separately as well as in bundles with either Metroid Prime or Mario Party which were exclusive to Kmart in the US br br br Development br Nintendo had attempted to create a reliable wireless controller since the development of the Famicom Its first attempt was for the Advanced Video System AVS the precursor to the Nintendo Entertainment System NES which included two wireless controllers but was never released br Nintendo later developed an infrared IR adapter called the NES Satellite for the NES Released in it used infrared to extend the length of up to four wired controllers which would plug into the base of the unit rather than the console The base could then be positioned anywhere within a certain range of the NES without the need for a cable However the extension base still needed a direct line of sight with the NES console line of sight is a significant limitation of IR technology requiring a clear space between an IR port and controller br Radio Frequency controllers were not possible in the late s as the early digital RF links were bulky and used too much power to be useful in battery powered devices However advancements in integrated circuits made radio controllers for game consoles commercially viable only a decade later The WaveBird released in solved previous usability problems of wireless controllers by relying on radio frequency communication instead of infrared allowing the controller to be used anywhere within meters feet of the console Although Nintendo only certifies the WaveBird to work within this meters feet range tests have proven that they may work as far as meters feet on all different channels This controller would become the first modern wireless gaming controller leading to the proliferation of wireless console gaming controllers for subsequent gaming generations starting with the seventh generation s Wii Remote Wii DualShock controller PlayStation and the Xbox controller Xbox br br br Design br The WaveBird Wireless Controller was designed and sold by Nintendo Unlike most wireless controllers of its era it relies on RF technology first used in gaming with Atari s CX joysticks instead of infrared line of sight signal transmission and the controller s radio transceiver operates at GHz The range of the WaveBird controller is officially meters feet but some users have reported ranges of meters ft The WaveBird includes a small receiver unit which must be plugged into the controller port of the GameCube Made of the same gray colored plastic as the standard WaveBird it features a channel selection wheel and an LED to indicate when a signal is received Up to sixteen WaveBird controllers may be used in the same area if each is set to a different channel br The WaveBird Wireless Controller maintains the same overall aesthetic design as the standard GameCube controller The components analog sticks buttons and triggers and layout remain the same while adding wireless functionality and space for two standard AA batteries It is somewhat larger and heavier than a standard GameCube controller with a channel selector dial an on off switch and an orange LED power indicator on the face of the controller in place of the gap between the D pad and the C stick Functionally the only feature the WaveBird controller lacks compared to the standard controller is the rumble feature the motors of which would reduce battery life br br br Colors br The WaveBird Wireless Controller was available in most regions only in light gray and platinum colors In Japan two limited edition WaveBird models were released through Club Nintendo Special Edition Gundam Char s Customized Color WaveBirds two toned red with the Neo Zeon logo to coincide with the Japan only GameCube release of Mobile Suit Gundam Gundam vs Z Gundam and a Club Nintendo WaveBird white top with light blue bottom and Club Nintendo logo br br br Use on subsequent consoles br br Like all GameCube controllers the WaveBird Wireless Controller is compatible with the original Wii model RVL for use with GameCube and Virtual Console titles as well as certain Wii games and WiiWare titles Since the launch of the Wii the WaveBird has seen increased popularity due to its ability to control these games wirelessly br Following speculation that Nintendo might re release the WaveBird due to the popularity of its use on the Wii a Nintendo representative confirmed that there were no plans to offer WaveBirds in stores again Although the representative stated that original GameCube controllers would be available directly from Nintendo there is no listing for the WaveBird br In November Nintendo released a GameCube controller adapter for use with the Wii U alongside the release of Super Smash Bros for Wii U In shortly after the announcement of Super Smash Bros Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch the company added support for the Wii U GameCube controller adapter for the newer hybrid console br br br Legal issues br Anascape Ltd a Texas based firm filed a lawsuit against Nintendo for patent infringements regarding Nintendo s controllers A July verdict found that a ban would be issued preventing Nintendo from selling several controllers including the WaveBird in the United States Nintendo was free to continue selling the WaveBird pending an appeal to the U S Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit On April Nintendo won the appeal and the previous court decision was reversed br br br See also br GameCube controller br br br
