The GameCube is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo It was released in Japan on September in North America on November in Europe on May and in Australia on May It is the successor to the Nintendo As a sixth generation console the GameCube primarily competed with Sony s PlayStation and Microsoft s Xbox br Nintendo began developing the GameCube in after entering a partnership with ArtX to design a graphics processing unit The console was formally announced under the codename Dolphin the following year and was released in as the GameCube It is Nintendo s first console to use its own optical discs instead of ROM cartridges supplemented by writable memory cards for saved games Unlike its competitors it is solely focused on gaming and does not play mass media like DVD or CD br The console supports limited online gaming for a few games via a GameCube broadband or modem adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable for exclusive in game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller The GameCube supports e Reader cards to unlock special features in a few games The Game Boy Player add on runs Game Boy Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance cartridge games br Reception of the GameCube was mixed It was praised for its controller and high quality games library but was criticized for its lack of multimedia features and lack of third party support compared to its competitors Premier games include Super Mario Sunshine Super Smash Bros Melee Star Fox Adventures Metroid Prime Mario Kart Double Dash Pikmin The Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker Animal Crossing and Luigi s Mansion Nintendo sold million GameCube units worldwide much fewer than anticipated and discontinued it in It was succeeded by the Wii in late br br br History br br br Background br In graphics hardware design company ArtX was launched with twenty engineers who had previously worked at SGI ArtX was led by Wei Yen who had been SGI s head of Nintendo Operations and of Project Reality which from to had scaled down SGI s supercomputer design to become the Nintendo br br br Development br In May ArtX entered into a partnership with Nintendo to undertake the complete design of the system logic and graphics processor codenamed Flipper for Nintendo s sixth generation video game console The console went through a series of codenames including N Star Cube and Nintendo Advance On May Nintendo publicly announced the console during a press conference giving it the codename Dolphin and positioning it as the successor to the Nintendo This announcement also revealed strategic partnerships with IBM for the creation of Dolphin s PowerPC based CPU codenamed Gekko and with Panasonic Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd for the development of its DVD drive and other Dolphin based devices Following this announcement Nintendo began providing development kits to game developers including Rare and Retro Studios br In April ArtX was acquired by ATI whereupon the Flipper graphics processor design had already been mostly completed by ArtX and was not overtly influenced by ATI In total ArtX cofounder Greg Buchner recalled that their portion of the console s hardware design timeline had arced from inception in to completion in Of the ArtX acquisition an ATI spokesperson said ATI now becomes a major supplier to the game console market via Nintendo The Dolphin platform is reputed to be king of the hill in terms of graphics and video performance with bit architecture br The console was announced as the GameCube at a press conference in Japan on August abbreviated as both NGC and GC in Japan and GCN in Europe and North America Nintendo unveiled its software lineup for the console at E focusing on fifteen launch games including Luigi s Mansion and Star Wars Rogue Squadron II Rogue Leader Several games originally scheduled to launch with the console were delayed It is also the first Nintendo home console since the Famicom not to have a Mario launch game br Long before the console s launch Nintendo had developed and patented an early prototype of motion controls for the GameCube with which developer Factor had experimented for its launch games Greg Thomas Sega of America s VP of Development said What does worry me is Dolphin s sensory controllers which are rumored to include microphones and headphone jacks because there s an example of someone thinking about something different These motion control concepts would not be deployed to consumers for several years until the Wii Remote br Prior to the GameCube s release Nintendo focused resources on the launch of the Game Boy Advance a handheld game console and successor to the original Game Boy and Game Boy Color As a result several games originally destined for the Nintendo console were postponed to become early releases on the GameCube Concurrently Nintendo was developing GameCube software provisioning future connectivity with the Game Boy Advance Certain games such as The Legend of Zelda Four Swords Adventures and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles can use the handheld as a secondary screen and controller when connected to the console via a link cable br Nintendo began its marketing campaign with the catchphrase The Nintendo Difference at its E reveal The goal was to distinguish itself from the competition as an entertainment company Later advertisements have the slogan Born to Play and game ads feature a rotating cube animation that morphs into a GameCube logo and end with a voice whispering GameCube On May the console s launch price of US was announced lower than that of the PlayStation and Xbox Nintendo spent million marketing the GameCube br In September leaked documents included Nintendo s plans for a GameCube model that would be both portable with a built in display and dockable to a TV similar to its later console the Nintendo Switch Other leaks suggest plans for a GameCube successor codenamed Tako with HD graphics and slots for SD and memory cards apparently resulting from a partnership with ATI and scheduled for release in br br br Release br br The GameCube was launched in Japan on September Approximately units were shipped in time to retailers The console was scheduled to launch two months later in North America on November but the date was pushed back in an effort to increase the number of available units The console eventually launched in North America on November with over units shipped to the region Other regions followed suit the following year beginning with Europe in the second quarter of br On April veteran third party Nintendo console developer Factor announced its D audio software development kit titled MusyX In collaboration with Dolby Laboratories MusyX provides motion based surround sound encoded as Dolby Pro Logic II br br br Market share br Throughout the mid s GameCube hardware sales remained far behind its direct competitor the PlayStation and slightly behind the Xbox though there were brief periods when the console would outsell both The console s family friendly appeal and lack of support from certain third party developers skewed the GameCube toward a younger market which was a minority of the gaming population during the sixth generation Many third party games popular with teenagers or adults such as the blockbuster Grand Theft Auto series and several key first person shooters skipped the GameCube entirely in favor of the PlayStation and Xbox However many gaming journalists and analysts noted that Nintendo s primary focus on younger audiences and its family friendly image was the biggest advantage and disadvantage at a time when video games were aimed at more mature audiences Nintendo was successful with games aimed at a more mature audience br As of June the GameCube had a market share tying with the Xbox in sales but far below the of the PlayStation However despite slow sales and tough competition Nintendo s position improved by and The American market share for the GameCube had gone up from to in one year alone due to price cuts and high quality games One article stated that by early the GameCube had market share in America By Christmas of Nintendo of America s president George Harrison reported that the company s price cuts down to just under quadrupled sales in the American market GameCube s profitability never reached that of the PlayStation or Game Boy Advance However it was more profitable than the Xbox br GameCube s first two years had slow sales and struggles and by and vastly improved to a share of the hardware market in Europe Due to price drops which saved it in the American markets and high quality games from various developers such as Pok mon Colosseum and Resident Evil the GameCube improved to put Xbox down to third place The top three European countries for GameCube success included the UK France and Germany and modestly in Spain and Italy Though falling behind the PlayStation in Europe the GameCube was successful and profitable there br br br Discontinuation br Nintendo launched the Wii the home console successor to the GameCube on November in North America and in December in other regions In February Nintendo announced that it had ceased first party support for the GameCube and that the console had been discontinued as it was shifting its manufacturing and development efforts towards the Wii and Nintendo DS GameCube controllers game discs and certain accessories continued to be supported via the Wii s backward compatibility although this feature was removed in later iterations of the Wii console The final game officially released on the GameCube was Madden NFL on August Several games originally developed for the GameCube were either reworked for a Wii release such as Super Paper Mario or released on both consoles such as the Wii launch game The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess br GameCube controllers continued to be supported via backward compatibility on Nintendo s next consoles the Wii U and Nintendo Switch with the GameCube controller adapter in s Super Smash Bros for Wii U and s Super Smash Bros Ultimate br br br Hardware br br Howard Cheng technical director of Nintendo technology development said the company s goal was to select a simple RISC architecture to help speed the development of games by making it easier on software developers IGN reported that the system was designed from the get go to attract third party developers by offering more power at a cheaper price Nintendo s design document for the console specifies that cost is of utmost importance followed by space Hardware partner ArtX s Vice President Greg Buchner stated that their guiding thought on the console s hardware design was to target the developers rather than the players and to look into a crystal ball and discern what s going to allow the Miyamoto sans of the world to develop the best games br br Initiating the GameCube s design in Nintendo partnered with ArtX then acquired by ATI Technologies during development for the system logic and the GPU and with IBM for the CPU IBM designed a bit PowerPC based processor with custom architectural extensions for the next generation console known as Gekko which runs at MHz and features a floating point unit FPU capable of a total throughput of GFLOPS and a peak of GFLOPS Described as an extension of the IBM PowerPC architecture the Gekko CPU is based on the PowerPC CXe with IBM s m CMOS technology which features copper interconnects Codenamed Flipper the GPU runs at MHz and in addition to graphics manages other tasks through its audio and input output I O processors br The GameCube is Nintendo s first console to not use primarily cartridge media following the Famicom Data Recorder Famicom Disk System SNES CD and DD which represent past explorations of complementary storage technologies The GameCube introduced a proprietary miniDVD optical disc format for up to GB of data It was designed by Matsushita Electric Industrial now Panasonic Corporation with a proprietary copy protection scheme unlike the Content Scramble System CSS in standard DVDs The size is sufficient for most games although a few multi platform games require an extra disc higher video compression or removal of content By comparison the PlayStation and Xbox use CDs and DVDs up to GB br br Like its predecessor the Nintendo GameCube models were produced in several different color motifs The system launched in Indigo the primary color shown in advertising and on the logo and in Jet Black One year later Nintendo released a Platinum limited edition GameCube which uses a silver color scheme for both the console and controller A Spice orange colored console was eventually released only in Japan though that scheme is only on controllers released in other countries br Nintendo developed stereoscopic D technology for the GameCube supported by one launch game Luigi s Mansion However the feature never reached production D televisions were not widespread and it was deemed that compatible displays and crystals for the add on accessories would be too cost prohibitive for the consumer Two audio Easter eggs can be invoked when the power is activated with the Z button on the Player controller held down or with four controllers connected and holding down the Z buttons br br The GameCube features two memory card ports for saving game data Nintendo released three memory card options Memory Card in gray KB Memory Card in black MB and Memory Card in white MB These are often advertised in megabits instead Mb Mb and Mb respectively Memory cards with larger capacities were released by third party manufacturers br br br Controller br br Nintendo learned from its experiences both positive and negative with the Nintendo s three handled controller design and chose a two handled handlebar design for the GameCube The shape was popularized by Sony s PlayStation controller released in and its follow up DualShock series in with vibration feedback and two analog sticks to improve the D experience Nintendo and Microsoft designed similar features in the controllers for their sixth generation consoles but instead of having the analog sticks in parallel they are staggered by swapping the positions of the directional pad d pad and left analog stick The GameCube controller features a total of eight buttons two analog sticks a d pad and a rumble motor The primary analog stick is on the left with the d pad located below and closer to the center On the right are four buttons a large green A button in the center a smaller red B button to the left an X button to the right and a Y button at the top Below and to the inside is a yellow C analog stick which often serves a variety of in game functions such as controlling the camera angle The Start Pause button is located in the middle and the rumble motor is encased within the center of the controller br On the top are two pressure sensitive trigger buttons marked L and R Each essentially provides two functions one analog and one digital As the trigger is depressed it emits an increasing analog signal Once fully depressed the trigger clicks with a digital signal that a game can use for a separate function There is also a purple digital button on the right side marked Z br The A button has a uniquely prominent size and placement having been the primary action button in past Nintendo controller designs The rubberized analog stick within the overall button orientation addresses Nintendo thumb pain br In Nintendo introduced the WaveBird Wireless Controller the first wireless gamepad developed by a first party console manufacturer The RF based wireless controller is similar in design to the standard controller It communicates with the GameCube with a wireless receiver dongle Powered by two AA batteries it lacks vibration br br br Compatibility br The GameCube uses GameCube Game Discs and the Game Boy Player accessory runs Game Pak cartridges for the Game Boy Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance The original version of the GameCube s successor the Wii supports backward compatibility with GameCube controllers memory cards and games but not the Game Boy Player or other hardware attachments However later revisions of the Wii including the Family Edition released in and the Wii Mini released in do not support any GameCube hardware or software br br br Panasonic Q br br The Panasonic Q is a hybrid version of the GameCube with a standard DVD player developed by Panasonic in a strategic alliance with Nintendo to develop the optical drive for the original GameCube hardware Its stainless steel case is completely revised with a DVD sized front loading tray a backlit LCD screen with playback controls and a carrying handle like the GameCube Announced by Panasonic on October it was released exclusively in Japan on December at a suggested retail price of however low sales resulted in Panasonic announcing the discontinuation of the Q on December The Q supports CDs DVDs and GameCube discs but there is virtually no integration between the GameCube and DVD player modes br br br Games br br In its lifespan from to Nintendo licensed over GameCube games Nintendo bolstered the console s popularity by creating new franchises such as Pikmin and Animal Crossing and renewing some that had skipped the Nintendo such as with Metroid Prime Longer standing franchises include the critically acclaimed The Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker and Super Mario Sunshine and the GameCube s best selling game Super Smash Bros Melee at million copies worldwide Other Nintendo games are successors to Nintendo games such as F Zero GX Mario Golf Toadstool Tour Mario Kart Double Dash Mario Party and Mario Power Tennis and Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door Though committed to its software library Nintendo was still criticized for not releasing enough launch window games and by the release of Luigi s Mansion instead of a D Mario game br Nintendo had struggled with its family friendly image during the late s and most of the s However during this period it released more video games for a mature audience with mostly successful results While the video game industry was focusing on more mature audiences and online connections Nintendo regained older players who had gravitated to the PlayStation and Xbox during the early s Some games aimed at older audiences were critically and financially successful more than on Dreamcast and less than on PlayStation and Xbox Such examples include The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess Super Smash Bros Melee Resident Evil Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes Killer Star Wars Rogue Squadron II Rogue Leader Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Resident Evil Metroid Prime Metroid Prime II Echoes Soul Calibur II Resident Evil Zero F Zero GX Star Fox Adventures and Star Fox Assault One of the most well known GameCube games for mature audiences is Eternal Darkness Sanity s Requiem which underperformed financially but garnered critical acclaim and is now regarded as a cult classic br The GameCube is Nintendo s first home console with a system menu activated by powering on without a valid game disc or by holding down the A button while one is loaded br br br Third party support br br Early in Nintendo s history the company had achieved considerable success with third party developer support on the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES Competition from the Sega Genesis and Sony PlayStation in the s changed the market s landscape and reduced Nintendo s ability to obtain exclusive third party support on the Nintendo The Nintendo Game Pak cartridge format increased the cost to manufacture software as opposed to the cheaper higher capacity optical discs on PlayStation br With the GameCube Nintendo intended to reverse the trend as evidenced by the number of third party games available at launch The new optical disc format increased game storage capacity significantly and reduced production costs Successful exclusives include Star Wars Rogue Squadron II Rogue Leader from Factor Resident Evil from Capcom and Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes from Konami Sega discontinued its Dreamcast console to become a third party developer porting Dreamcast games such as Crazy Taxi and Sonic Adventure and developing new franchises such as Super Monkey Ball Longtime Nintendo partner Rare which had developed GoldenEye Perfect Dark Banjo Kazooie Conker s Bad Fur Day and the Donkey Kong Country series released Star Fox Adventures for GameCube its final Nintendo game before acquisition by Microsoft in Several third party developers were contracted to work on new games for Nintendo franchises including Star Fox Assault which became a Player s Choice re release Donkey Konga by Namco and Wario World from Treasure Capcom had announced games for the system dubbed the Capcom Five in br Third party GameCube support was some of the most extensive of any Nintendo console predating the Wii Some third party developers such as Midway Namco Activision Konami Ubisoft THQ Disney Interactive Studios Humongous Entertainment Electronic Arts and EA Sports continued to release GameCube games into One of the biggest third party GameCube developers was Sega which had quit the console hardware market to become a third party game developer after the failure of the Dreamcast It partnered with long time rival Nintendo and with Microsoft and Sony to recuperate profits lost from the Dreamcast Sega was a successful third party developer since the early s mostly those for the family market such as Super Monkey Ball Phantasy Star Online Sonic Adventure Sonic Adventure Battle and Sonic Heroes br br br Online gaming br br Nintendo s GameCube did not put heavy focus on online games earlier in the console s life Only eight GameCube games support network connectivity five with Internet support and three with local area network LAN support The only Internet capable games released in western territories are three role playing games RPGs in Sega s Phantasy Star series Phantasy Star Online Episode I II Phantasy Star Online Episode I II Plus and Phantasy Star Online Episode III C A R D Revolution The official servers were decommissioned in but players can still connect to fan maintained private servers Japan received two additional games with Internet capabilities a cooperative RPG Homeland and a baseball game with downloadable content Jikky Powerful Pro Yaky Lastly three racing games have LAN multiplayer modes Avalanche Kirby Air Ride and Mario Kart Double Dash Those can be forced over the Internet with third party PC software capable of tunneling the GameCube s network traffic br Online play requires an official broadband or modem adapter because the GameCube lacks out of the box network capabilities Nintendo never commissioned any Internet services for GameCube but allowed other publishers to manage custom online experiences br br br Reception br The GameCube received mixed reviews following its launch PC Magazine praised the overall hardware design and quality of games available at launch CNET gave an average review rating noting that though the console lacks a few features offered by its competition it is relatively inexpensive has a great controller design and launched a decent lineup of games In later reviews criticism mounted against the console often centering on its overall look and feel describing it as toy ish With poor sales figures and the associated financial harm to Nintendo a Time International article called the GameCube an unmitigated disaster br Retrospectively Joystiq compared the GameCube s launch window to its successor the Wii noting that the GameCube s lack of games resulted in a subpar launch and the console s limited selection of online games damaged its market share in the long run Time International concluded that the system had low sales figures because it lacked technical innovations br br br Sales br In Japan between and GameCube consoles were sold during the first three days of its sale out of an initial shipment of units During its launch weekend million worth of GameCube products were sold in North America The console was sold out in several stores faster than initial sales of both of its competitors the Xbox and the PlayStation Nintendo reported that the most popular launch game is Luigi s Mansion with more sales at its launch than Super Mario had Other popular games include Star Wars Rogue Squadron II Rogue Leader and Wave Race Blue Storm By early December units had been sold in the US br Nintendo predicted million GameCube units by but only sold million GameCube units worldwide during its lifespan placing it slightly behind the Xbox s million though it did manage to outsell the Xbox in Japan and well behind the PlayStation s million Its sales exceeded that of the Xbox in Japan The GameCube s predecessor the Nintendo also outperformed it at nearly million units It also exceeded the Dreamcast which yielded million units In September IGN ranked the GameCube th in its list of best gaming consoles of all time placing it behind all three of its sixth generation competitors the PlayStation rd the Dreamcast th and the Xbox th As of March million GameCube units had been sold worldwide behind Nintendo s initial goal of million consoles Two Ars Technica articles from showed that Nintendo had officially sold million GameCube consoles worldwide and one article from Seeking Alpha shows that the GameCube sold million consoles worldwide Many of Nintendo s own first party games such as Super Smash Bros Melee Pok mon Colosseum and Mario Kart Double Dash had strong sales though this did not typically benefit third party developers or directly drive sales of their games However at the same time these first party games and second party and third party games elevated the GameCube br Sales of many cross platform games such as sports franchises released by Electronic Arts were far below their PlayStation and Xbox counterparts eventually prompting some developers to scale back or completely cease support for the GameCube Exceptions include Sega s family friendly Sonic Adventure and Super Monkey Ball which reportedly yielded more sales on GameCube than most of the company s games on the PlayStation and Xbox In June Acclaim Entertainment CEO Rod Cousens said that the company would no longer support the GameCube and criticized it as a system that don t deliver profits Acclaim would later rescind his claims by saying the company would elevate support for the system This decision was made unclear after the company filed for bankruptcy in August In September Eidos Interactive announced to end support for the GameCube as the publisher was losing money from developing for Nintendo s console This led to several games in development being canceled for the system Eidos s CEO Mike McGravey would say that the GameCube was a declining business However after the company s purchase by the SCi Entertainment Group in Eidos resumed development for the system and released Lego Star Wars The Video Game and Tomb Raider Legend Several third party games originally intended to be GameCube exclusives most notably Capcom s Viewtiful Joe and Resident Evil were eventually ported to other systems in an attempt to maximize profits following lackluster sales of the original GameCube versions br In March now defunct UK retailer Dixons removed all GameCube consoles accessories and games from its stores That same month another UK retailer Argos cut the price of the GameCube in their stores to which was more than cheaper than Nintendo s SRP for the console at the time However in October of that year they did eventually restock their supply of consoles after a price drop was ordered which caused the console sales to outpace the PlayStation for a week br With sales sagging and millions of unsold consoles in stock Nintendo halted GameCube production for the first nine months of to reduce surplus units Sales rebounded slightly after a price drop to US on September and the release of The Legend of Zelda Collector s Edition bundle A demo disc the GameCube Preview Disc was also released in a bundle in Beginning with this period GameCube sales continued to be steady particularly in Japan but the GameCube remained in third place in worldwide sales during the sixth generation era because of weaker sales performance elsewhere though its fortunes would change for the better in America and Europe br Iwata forecasted to investors that the company would sell million GameCube units worldwide by March but by the end of it had only sold million fewer than half However it had the highest attach rate of any Nintendo console at and was profitable even more than Xbox with higher sales rates br br br Legacy br Many games that debuted on the GameCube including the Pikmin series Chibi Robo Metroid Prime and Luigi s Mansion became popular and profitable Nintendo franchises or subseries br GameCube controllers have limited support on Wii U and Switch to play Super Smash Bros for Wii U and Super Smash Bros Ultimate respectively via a USB adapter br Regarding concerns about the correlation between violence and video games a study by Iowa State University found that certain games like Super Mario Sunshine and Chibi Robo which were GameCube exclusives would help players learn positive skills about helping others empathy and cooperation The game Super Monkey Ball which was a GameCube exclusive could help surgeons perform laparoscopic surgery better than surgeons who do not play video games br GamesRadar ranked it th on their list of The best video game consoles and hardware of all
