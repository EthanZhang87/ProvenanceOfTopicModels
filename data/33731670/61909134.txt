id: 61909134
The ninth generation of video game consoles began in November with the releases of Microsoft s Xbox Series X and Series S console family and Sony s PlayStation br Compared to the eighth gen Xbox One and PlayStation the new consoles add faster computation and graphics processors support for real time ray tracing graphics output for K resolution and in some cases K resolution with rendering speeds targeting frames per second FPS or higher Internally both console families introduced new internal solid state drive SSD systems to be used as high throughput memory and storage systems for games to reduce or eliminate loading times and support in game streaming The Xbox Series S and the PlayStation Digital Edition lack an optical drive while retaining support for online distribution and storing games on external USB devices br Despite much weaker processing power and already previously competing with eighth generation consoles the Nintendo Switch has also been noted as a competitor to ninth generation consoles particularly with the introduction of the OLED Model revision in Alongside the Switch new handheld personal computer devices such as the Steam Deck introduced means to play Linux games as well as most Windows games through Proton on the go further expanding hardware competition in the generation br br br Background br The duration from the eighth generation until the start of the ninth was one of the longest in history having started in with the release of Nintendo s Wii U Past generations typically had five year windows as a result of Moore s law but Microsoft and Sony instead launched mid console redesigns the Xbox One X and PlayStation Pro Microsoft also launched a monthly console lease program with the option to buy or upgrade Some analysts believed these factors signaled the first major shift away from the idea of console generations because the potential technical gains of new hardware had become nominal br Microsoft and Sony had announced their new consoles in for release by the end of prior to the COVID pandemic When the pandemic struck in March it impacted both marketing and production of the consoles The cancelled E had been planned as a major venue to premiere the consoles and instead both Microsoft and Sony turned to online showcases to highlight the systems and launch games Both companies acknowledged that the pandemic had strained their production supplies due to hardware manufacturing slowdowns starting in March but would not impact their console release windows and they set consumer expectations that console supplies would likely be limited in the launch window and would slowly become more relaxed as the pandemic waned This created a wave of scalping through online stores which was countered by manufacturers and vendors The ongoing global chip shortage continued to affect console shipments through the end of with Sony warning of lower production numbers during the final calendar quarter of the year and into this also affected Nintendo s Switch console production rates and Valve s plans to release the portable Steam Deck handheld gaming computer in br br br Home consoles br br br PlayStation br br The PlayStation was developed by Sony as the successor to the PlayStation and was first released on November The primary goal of the PlayStation s development was to reduce loading times in games particularly those that use in game streaming such as when the player moves across an open world Sony developed a custom solid state drive SSD architecture based on a channel GB SSD along with a fast software decompression method that enables an input output speed of up to to GB s In most early development tests this virtually eliminated loading screens and masking loading times for open world games The main system is backed by an AMD Zen system on a chip running at a variable frequency capped at GHz and a RDNA GPU also running at a variable frequency capped at GHz The GPU has a total potential processing power of teraflops The system comes with GB of memory br The PlayStation was launched with two models The base model includes an optical disc reader for most disc formats including Blu ray UHD Blu ray and retail PlayStation games A cheaper Digital model lacks the disc reader but otherwise is equivalent to the base model Both models support expanded memory options to store games and other data onto external drives thus allowing players to obtain and store games through online distribution via the PlayStation Store The PlayStation has mostly complete backward compatibility with PlayStation games with only a limited number of games not currently supported on the console while the PlayStation Now cloud service is available for users to play games from the older PlayStation consoles br Mid generation revision of both PlayStation models were announced in late both unofficially considered the PlayStation Slim The units are to replace the two original PlayStation models both will have a slimmer design as well as TB of internal storage and additional USB ports The more expensive model includes an optical disc drive while the second model the Digital Edition will not ship with a drive though an drive expansion kit will be available to users br br br Xbox Series X and Series S br br The Xbox Series X S is the successor to the Xbox One and was released on November in select regions Microsoft followed the Xbox One s dual console models a high end line the Series X comparable to the Xbox One X and a cheaper model the Series S comparable to the Xbox One S The performance goal for the Xbox Series X was about four times that of the Xbox One X but without sacrificing game development for the lower end Xbox Series S br Both the Xbox Series X and Series S use an AMD Zen CPU and an RDNA GPU but with different frequencies and compute units The Series S has lower frequencies with reduced performance and the Series X has graphics performance estimated at teraflops compared to the Series S s teraflops Microsoft developed a Velocity Architecture which includes an internal SSD system TB on the Series X GB on the Series S used for storing games and new DirectX interfaces with improved input output and in game texture streaming and rendering The Series X includes an optical disc reader supporting Blu ray and UHD media which is absent in the Series S Both consoles support external game storage media and online distribution via Xbox Live Full backward compatibility was announced for all Xbox One games including previously supported Xbox and Xbox games but excluding Kinect games Microsoft encouraged third party developers and publishers to use its Smart Delivery approach to give Xbox One games free performance upgrade patches for Xbox Series X S br br br Comparison br br br Related platforms br br br Nintendo Switch br br Despite being a holdover from the eighth generation the Nintendo Switch has been positioned by sources as a primary competitor to other ninth generation consoles due to its continued hardware and software support as of The financial failure of Nintendo s first eighth gen console the Wii U resulted in the Switch s relatively late release in the eighth generation being released in March An OLED Model revision was released on October introducing an updated design and improved display though it did not introduce any performance improvements Additionally commercial performance of Switch exclusive titles have remained high during the ninth generation with Pok mon Scarlet and Violet and The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom both achieving million units sold in its first three days after release br br br Steam Deck and handheld gaming PCs br br On February Valve released the Steam Deck a handheld gaming PC that runs SteamOS a Linux distribution developed by Valve The Deck includes Valve s own Proton compatibility layer allowing nearly all Windows based games to run on the Deck without modification The handheld also allows users to install Windows or other software on the device The Steam Deck was the first handheld to use an RDNA GPU which is also used on both the home consoles of the ninth generation The handheld was well received by many outlets with an overall praising of its extensive game compatibility and portability A previous Linux based handheld gaming computer the Pandora had been released during the seventh generation with the DragonBox Pyra still in development br The success of the Steam Deck led to the growth of the handheld gaming PC market and to the creation of direct competitors such as the Asus ROG Ally Lenovo Legion Go MSI Claw A M and the Ayaneo running Microsoft Windows This had previously been explored by the GPD Win and GPD Win through to the current GPD Win Max br br br Cloud gaming platforms br Cloud gaming has become part of the gaming landscape with Stadia and Amazon Luna being introduced in November and October respectively As well as GeForce Now coming out of its four years of beta in February None of these systems have had any financial breakthrough as home video game consoles but they are viable for multi platform ninth generation games Google having failed to find a large player base shut down Stadia on January br Cloud gaming has also been used by Microsoft as part of its gaming subscription service Xbox Game Pass This gave Microsoft a head start in what analysts expected to be a major complementary service supplementing the unprofitable console business and appealing to more entry level players with better accessibility at a lower price Microsoft s Phil Spencer said that they believed that they could not compete on the console hardware space as much as Sony or Nintendo and shifted their strategy towards Xbox Game Pass and cloud gaming Sony in turn revamped its PlayStation Plus subscription in mid by merging in PlayStation Now its cloud based service for games of past PlayStation generations as a feature in a higher subscription tier br The continued growth of cloud gaming services has inspired the development of handhelds like the Logitech G CLOUD Gaming Handheld and Razer Edge which advertise cloud streaming as a key selling point br br br Virtual reality headsets br The ninth generation continued the trend of virtual reality The previous generation mainly consisted of VR accessories made for mobile games such as Google s Cardboard Daydream and Samsung s Gear VR or computers HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift This generation has started to offer standalone headsets dedicated to virtual reality games The Meta Quest Pro was released in Additions in included the PlayStation VR a PS accessory serving as a successor to s PlayStation VR and the Meta Quest also saw Apple s entry into the market
