A motorboat speedboat or powerboat is a boat that is exclusively powered by an engine br Some motorboats are fitted with inboard engines others have an outboard motor installed on the rear containing the internal combustion engine the gearbox and the propeller in one portable unit An inboard outboard contains a hybrid of an inboard and an outboard where the internal combustion engine is installed inside the boat and the gearbox and propeller are outside br There are two configurations of an inboard V drive and direct drive A direct drive has the powerplant mounted near the middle of the boat with the propeller shaft straight out the back where a V drive has the powerplant mounted in the back of the boat facing backwards having the shaft go towards the front of the boat then making a V towards the rear br br br Overview br A motorboat is a small craft with one or more engines for propulsion Motorboats are commonly used for work recreation sport or racing br Boat engines vary in shape size and type These include inboard outboard integrating the engine gearbox and propeller in one portable unit mounted in the rear and inboard outboard or sterndrive which mounts the engine inboard and the rest outboard br Fuel types include gasoline diesel gas turbine rotary combustion or steam br High performance speedboats can reach speeds of over knots Their high speed and performance can be attributed to their hull technology and engine With a more powerful and heavier engine an appropriate hull shape is needed High performance boats include yachts HSIC high speed interceptor craft and racing powerboats br A V type hull helps a boat cut through the water A deep V hull helps keep the boat s bow down at low speeds improving visibility V hulls also improve a boat s speed and maneuvering capabilities They stabilize a boat in rough conditions br br br History br br br Invention br br Although the screw propeller had been added to an engine steam engine as early as the th century in Birmingham England by James Watt boats powered by a petrol engine only came about in the later part of the th century with the invention of the internal combustion engine br The earliest boat to be powered by a petrol engine was tested on the Neckar River by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in when they tested their new longcase clock engine It had been constructed in the former greenhouse converted into a workshop in Daimler s back yard The first public display took place on the Waldsee in Cannstatt today a suburb of Stuttgart at the end of that year The engine of this boat had a single cylinder of horse power Daimler s second launch in had a second cylinder positioned at an angle of degrees to the first one and was known as the V type br The first successful motor boat was designed by the Priestman Brothers in Hull England under the direction of William Dent Priestman The company began trials of their first motorboat in The engine was powered with kerosene and used an innovative high tension high voltage ignition system The company was the first to begin large scale production of the motor boat and by Priestman s boats were successfully being used for towing goods along canals br Another early pioneer was Mr J D Roots who in fitted a launch with an internal combustion engine and operated a ferry service between Richmond and Wandsworth along the River Thames during the seasons of and br br The eminent inventor Frederick William Lanchester recognized the potential of the motorboat and over the following years in collaboration with his brother George perfected the modern motorboat or powerboat Working in the garden of their home in Olton Warwickshire they designed and built a river flat bottomed launch with an advanced high revving engine that drove via a stern paddle wheel in In he produced a second engine similar in design to his previous one but running on benzene at r p m The engine drove a reversible propeller An important part of his new engine was the revolutionary carburettor for mixing the fuel and air correctly His invention was known as a wick carburetor because fuel was drawn into a series of wicks from where it was vaporized He patented this invention in br The Daimler Company began production of motor boats in from its manufacturing base in Coventry The engines had two cylinders and the explosive charge of petroleum and air was ignited by compression into a heated platinum tube The engine gave about six horse power The petrol was fed by air pressure to a large surface carburettor and also an auxiliary tank which supplied the burners for heating the ignition tubes Reversal of the propeller was effected by means of two bevel friction wheels which engaged with two larger bevel friction wheels the intermediate shaft being temporarily disconnected for this purpose It was not until that a safer apparatus for igniting the fuel with an electric spark was used in motor boats br br br Expansion br br Interest in fast motorboats grew rapidly in the early years of the th century The Marine Motor Association was formed in as an offshoot of the Royal Automobile Club Motor Boat Yachting was the first magazine to address technical developments in the field and was brought out by Temple Press London from Large manufacturing companies including Napier Son and Thornycroft began producing motorboats br br br Early racing br The first motorboating competition was established by Alfred Charles William Harmsworth in The Harmsworth Cup was envisioned as a contest between nations rather than between boats or individuals The boats were originally to be designed and built entirely by residents of the country represented using materials and units built wholly within that country br The first competition held in July at Cork Harbour in Ireland and officiated by the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland and the Royal Victoria Yacht Club was a very primitive affair with many boats failing even to start The competition was won by Dorothy Levitt in a Napier launch designed to the specifications of Selwyn Edge This motorboat was the first proper motorboat designed for high speed She set the world s first water speed record when she achieved mph km h in a foot m steel hulled horsepower Napier speedboat fitted with a three blade propeller As both the owner and entrant of the boat S F Edge was engraved on the trophy as the winner br br An article in the Cork Constitution on July reported A large number of spectators viewed the first mile from the promenade of the Yacht Club and at Cork several thousand people collected at both sides of the river to see the finishes Levitt was then commanded to the Royal yacht of King Edward VII where he congratulated her on her pluck and skill and they discussed the performance of the motorboat and its potential for British government despatch work br France won the race in and the boat Napier II set a new world water speed record for a mile at almost knots km h winning the race in br The acknowledged genius of motor boat design in America was the naval architect John L Hacker His pioneering work including the invention of the V hull and the use of dedicated petrol engines revolutionized boat design from as early as when he founded the Hacker Boat Co In Hacker designed the Kitty Hawk the first successful step hydroplane which exceeded the then unthinkable speed of mph km h and was at that time the fastest boat in the world The Harmsworth Cup was first won by Americans in The US and England traded it back and forth until From to Americans had an unbroken winning streak Gar Wood won this race eight times as a driver and nine times as an owner between and br br br Hull type br From a design point of view a boat s hull type reflects its use and the waters it will be used it These include displacement hulls vee bottom hulls modified vee bottom hulls deep vee hulls and trim tabs for vee bottom hulls The three main hull materials are wood reinforced fiberglass and metal Wood hulls may be made of planks or plywood Fiberglass hulls are reinforced with balsa wood Metal hulls are either aluminum or steel br Some gross configurations of motorboats include skiff day cruiser bow rider pilothouse and cabin cruiser These vary by such considerations as size whether they have a deck cabin head is sail helm
