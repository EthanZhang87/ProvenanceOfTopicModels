Birmingham BUR ming m is a city and metropolitan borough in the metropolitan county of West Midlands in England It is the second largest city in Britain commonly referred to as the second city of the United Kingdom with a population of million in the city proper Birmingham borders the Black Country to its west and together with the city of Wolverhampton and towns including Dudley and Solihull forms the West Midlands conurbation The wider metropolitan area has a population of million making it the largest outside of London br Located in the West Midlands region of England approximately miles km from London Birmingham is considered to be the social cultural financial and commercial centre of the Midlands It is just west of the traditional centre point of England at Meriden and is the most inland major city in the country and lying north of the Cotswolds and east of the Shropshire Hills Distinctively Birmingham only has small rivers flowing through it mainly the River Tame and its tributaries River Rea and River Cole one of the closest main rivers is the Severn approximately miles km west of the city centre The city does however have numerous canals collectively named the Birmingham Canal Navigations br Historically a market town in Warwickshire in the medieval period Birmingham grew during the th century during the Midlands Enlightenment and during the Industrial Revolution which saw advances in science technology and economic development producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society By it was being hailed as the first manufacturing town in the world Birmingham s distinctive economic profile with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation this provided an economic base for prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the th century The Watt steam engine was invented in Birmingham br The resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of political radicalism which under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy From the summer of to the spring of Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz The damage done to the city s infrastructure in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners led to extensive urban regeneration in subsequent decades br Birmingham s economy is now dominated by the service sector The city is a major international commercial centre and an important transport retail events and conference hub Its metropolitan economy is the second largest in the United Kingdom with a GDP of bn Its five universities including the University of Birmingham make it the largest centre of higher education in the country outside London Birmingham s major cultural institutions the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra Birmingham Royal Ballet Birmingham Repertory Theatre Library of Birmingham and Barber Institute of Fine Arts enjoy international reputations and the city has vibrant and influential grassroots art music literary and culinary scenes Birmingham was the host city for the Commonwealth Games In Birmingham was the third most visited city in the UK by people from foreign nations br br br Toponymy br The name Birmingham comes from the Old English Beormingah m meaning the home or settlement of the Beormingas a tribe or clan whose name means Beorma s people and which may have formed an early unit of Anglo Saxon administration Beorma after whom the tribe was named could have been its leader at the time of the Anglo Saxon settlement a shared ancestor or a mythical tribal figurehead Place names ending in ingah m are characteristic of primary settlements established during the early phases of Anglo Saxon colonisation of an area suggesting that Birmingham was probably in existence by the early th century at the latest Surrounding settlements with names ending in t n farm l ah woodland clearing wor enclosure and field open ground are likely to be secondary settlements created by the later expansion of the Anglo Saxon population in some cases possibly on earlier British sites br br br History br br br Pre history and medieval br There is evidence of early human activity in the Birmingham area dating back to around BC with Stone Age artefacts suggesting seasonal settlements overnight hunting parties and woodland activities such as tree felling The many burnt mounds that can still be seen around the city indicate that modern humans first intensively settled and cultivated the area during the Bronze Age when a substantial but short lived influx of population occurred between BC and BC possibly caused by conflict or immigration in the surrounding area During the st century Roman conquest of Britain the forested country of the Birmingham Plateau formed a barrier to the advancing Roman legions who built the large Metchley Fort in the area of modern day Edgbaston in AD and made it the focus of a network of Roman roads Birmingham was then later established by the Beormingas around the th or th century as a small settlement in the then heavily forested Arden region in Mercia br The development of Birmingham into a significant urban and commercial centre began in when the Lord of the Manor Peter de Bermingham obtained a charter to hold a market at his castle and followed this with the creation of a planned market town and seigneurial borough within his demesne or manorial estate around the site that became the Bull Ring This established Birmingham as the primary commercial centre for the Birmingham Plateau at a time when the area s economy was expanding rapidly with population growth nationally leading to the clearance cultivation and settlement of previously marginal land Within a century of the charter Birmingham had grown into a prosperous urban centre of merchants and craftsmen By it was the third largest town in Warwickshire a position it would retain for the next years br br br Early modern br The principal governing institutions of medieval Birmingham including the Guild of the Holy Cross and the lordship of the de Birmingham family collapsed between and leaving the town with an unusually high degree of social and economic freedom and initiating a period of transition and growth By Birmingham s population had increased fifteen fold and the town was the fifth largest in England and Wales br The importance of the manufacture of iron goods to Birmingham s economy was recognised as early as and grew rapidly as the century progressed Equally significant was the town s emerging role as a centre for the iron merchants who organised finance supplied raw materials and traded and marketed the industry s products By the s Birmingham formed the commercial hub of a network of forges and furnaces stretching from South Wales to Cheshire and its merchants were selling finished manufactured goods as far afield as the West Indies These trading links gave Birmingham s metalworkers access to much wider markets allowing them to diversify away from lower skilled trades producing basic goods for local sale towards a broader range of specialist higher skilled and more lucrative activities br br By the time of the English Civil War Birmingham s booming economy its expanding population and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak The town s reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the s br The th century saw this tradition of free thinking and collaboration blossom into the cultural phenomenon now known as the Midlands Enlightenment The town developed into a notable centre of literary musical artistic and theatrical activity and its leading citizens particularly the members of the Lunar Society of Birmingham became influential participants in the circulation of philosophical and scientific ideas among Europe s intellectual elite The close relationship between Enlightenment Birmingham s leading thinkers and its major manufacturers in men like Matthew Boulton and James Keir they were often in fact the same people made it particularly important for the exchange of knowledge between pure science and the practical world of manufacturing and technology This created a chain reaction of innovation forming a pivotal link between the earlier scientific revolution and the Industrial Revolution that would follow br br br Industrial Revolution br br Birmingham s explosive industrial expansion started earlier than that of the textile manufacturing towns of the North of England and was driven by different factors Instead of the economies of scale of a low paid unskilled workforce producing a single bulk commodity such as cotton or wool in large mechanised units of production Birmingham s industrial development was built on the adaptability and creativity of a highly paid workforce with a strong division of labour practising a broad variety of skilled specialist trades and producing a constantly diversifying range of products in a highly entrepreneurial economy of small often self owned workshops This led to exceptional levels of inventiveness between and the core years of the Industrial Revolution Birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other British town or city br The demand for capital to feed rapid economic expansion also saw Birmingham grow into a major financial centre with extensive international connections Lloyds Bank was founded in the town in and Ketley s Building Society the world s first building society in By the West Midlands had more banking offices per head than any other region in Britain including London br br Innovation in th century Birmingham often took the form of incremental series of small scale improvements to existing products or processes but also included major developments that lay at the heart of the emergence of industrial society In the Birmingham trained Abraham Darby I moved to Coalbrookdale in Shropshire and built the first blast furnace to successfully smelt iron ore with coke transforming the quality volume and scale on which it was possible to produce cast iron In Lewis Paul and John Wyatt invented roller spinning the one novel idea of the first importance in the development of the mechanised cotton industry In they opened the world s first cotton mill in Birmingham s Upper Priory In John Roebuck invented the lead chamber process enabling the large scale manufacture of sulphuric acid and in James Keir developed a process for the bulk manufacture of alkali together marking the birth of the modern chemical industry In Matthew Boulton opened the Soho Manufactory pioneering the combination and mechanisation under one roof of previously separate manufacturing activities through a system known as rational manufacture As the largest manufacturing unit in Europe this came to symbolise the emergence of the factory system br Most significant however was the development in of the industrial steam engine by James Watt and Matthew Boulton Freeing for the first time the manufacturing capacity of human society from the limited availability of hand water and animal power this was arguably the pivotal moment of the entire industrial revolution and a key factor in the worldwide increases in productivity over the following century br br br Regency and Victorian br br Birmingham rose to national political prominence in the campaign for political reform in the early th century with Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham Political Union bringing the country to the brink of civil war during the Days of May that preceded the passing of the Great Reform Act in The Union s meetings on Newhall Hill in and were the largest political assemblies Britain had ever seen Lord Durham who drafted the Act wrote that the country owed Reform to Birmingham and its salvation from revolution This reputation for having shaken the fabric of privilege to its base in led John Bright to make Birmingham the platform for his successful campaign for the Second Reform Act of which extended voting rights to the urban working class br The original Charter of Incorporation dated October was received in Birmingham on November then read in the Town Hall on November with elections for the first Birmingham Town Council being held on December Sixteen Aldermen and Councillors were elected and the Borough was divided into wards William Scholefield became the first Mayor and William Redfern was appointed as Town Clerk Birmingham Town Police were established the following year br Birmingham s tradition of innovation continued into the th century Birmingham was the terminus for both of the world s first two long distance railway lines the mile km Grand Junction Railway of and the mile km London and Birmingham Railway of Birmingham schoolteacher Rowland Hill invented the postage stamp and created the first modern universal postal system in Alexander Parkes invented the first human made plastic in the Jewellery Quarter in br By the s the country s extensive canal system had been constructed giving greater access to natural resources and fuel for industries During the Victorian era the population of Birmingham grew rapidly to well over half a million and Birmingham became the second largest population centre in England Birmingham was granted city status in by Queen Victoria Joseph Chamberlain mayor of Birmingham and later an MP and his son Neville Chamberlain who was Lord Mayor of Birmingham and later the British Prime Minister are two of the most well known political figures who have lived in Birmingham The city established its own university in br br br th century and contemporary br br The city suffered heavy bomb damage during World War II s Birmingham Blitz The city was also the scene of two scientific discoveries that were to prove critical to the outcome of the war Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls first described how a practical nuclear weapon could be constructed in the Frisch Peierls memorandum of the same year that the cavity magnetron the key component of radar and later of microwave ovens was invented by John Randall and Henry Boot Details of these two discoveries together with an outline of the first jet engine invented by Frank Whittle in nearby Rugby were taken to the United States by the Tizard Mission in September in a single black box later described by an official American historian as the most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores br The city was extensively redeveloped during the s and s This included the construction of large tower block estates such as Castle Vale The Bull Ring was reconstructed and New Street station was redeveloped In the decades following World War II the ethnic makeup of Birmingham changed significantly as it received waves of immigration from the Commonwealth of Nations and beyond The city s population peaked in at residents br br people were killed and were injured in a series of bomb attacks in thought to be carried out by the Provisional IRA The bombings were the worst terror attacks in England up until the London bombings and consisted of bombs being planted in two pubs in central Birmingham Six men were convicted who became known later as the Birmingham Six and sentenced to life imprisonment who were acquitted after years by the Court of Appeal The convictions are now considered one of the worst British miscarriages of justice in recent times The true perpetrators of the attacks are yet to be arrested br br Birmingham remained by far Britain s most prosperous provincial city as late as the s with household incomes exceeding even those of London and the South East but its economic diversity and capacity for regeneration declined in the decades that followed World War II as Central Government sought to restrict the city s growth and disperse industry and population to the stagnating areas of Wales and Northern England These measures hindered the natural self regeneration of businesses in Birmingham leaving it top heavy with the old and infirm and the city became increasingly dependent on the motor industry The recession of the early s saw Birmingham s economy collapse with unprecedented levels of unemployment and outbreaks of social unrest in inner city districts br Since the turn of the st century many parts of Birmingham have been transformed with the redevelopment of the Bullring Shopping Centre the construction of the new Library of Birmingham the largest public library in Europe and the regeneration of old industrial areas such as Brindleyplace The Mailbox and the International Convention Centre as well as the rationalisation of the Inner Ring Road In Birmingham hosted the th G summit The city successfully hosted the Commonwealth Games br On September Birmingham city council issued a Section notice to say that it could not meet its financial commitments Effectively this meant the council was bankrupt A major
