A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes but generally smaller than a ship which is distinguished by its larger size or capacity its shape or its ability to carry boats br Small boats are typically used on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes or in protected coastal areas However some boats such as whaleboats were intended for offshore use In modern naval terms a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship br Boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose available materials or local traditions Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation fishing and sport Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats pontoon boats and sailboats House boats may be used for vacationing or long term residence Lighters are used to move cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore Lifeboats have rescue and safety functions br Boats can be propelled by manpower e g rowboats and paddle boats wind e g sailboats and inboard outboard motors including gasoline diesel and electric br br br History br br br Differentiation from other prehistoric watercraft br The earliest watercraft are considered to have been rafts These would have been used for voyages such as the settlement of Australia sometime between and years ago br A boat differs from a raft by obtaining its buoyancy by having most of its structure exclude water with a waterproof layer e g the planks of a wooden hull the hide covering or tarred canvas of a currach In contrast a raft is buoyant because it joins together components that are themselves buoyant for example logs bamboo poles bundles of reeds floats such as inflated hides sealed pottery containers or in a modern context empty oil drums The key difference between a raft and a boat is that the former is a flow through structure with waves able to pass up through it Consequently except for short river crossings a raft is not a practical means of transport in colder regions of the world as the users would be at risk of hypothermia Today that climatic limitation restricts rafts to between north and south with in the past similar boundaries that have moved as the world s climate has varied br br br Types br The earliest boats may have been either dugouts or hide boats The oldest recovered boat in the world the Pesse canoe found in the Netherlands is a dugout made from the hollowed tree trunk of a Pinus sylvestris that was constructed somewhere between and BC This canoe is exhibited in the Drents Museum in Assen Netherlands Other very old dugout boats have also been recovered Hide boats made from covering a framework with animal skins could be equally as old as logboats but such a structure is much less likely to survive in an archaeological context ch Northern Europe br Plank built boats are considered in most cases to have developed from the logboat There are examples of logboats that have been expanded by deforming the hull under the influence of heat by raising up the sides with added planks or by splitting down the middle and adding a central plank to make it wider Some of these methods have been in quite recent use there is no simple developmental sequence The earliest known plank built boats are from the Nile dating to the third millennium BC Outside Egypt the next earliest are from England The Ferriby boats are dated to the early part of the second millennium BC and the end of the third millennium ch Northern Europe Mediterranean Region Plank built boats require a level of woodworking technology that was first available in the neolithic with more complex versions only becoming achievable in the Bronze Age br br br Types br br Boats can be categorized by their means of propulsion These divide into br br Unpowered This involves drifting with the tide or a river current br Powered by the crew members on board using oars paddles or a punting pole or quant br Powered by sail br Towed either by humans or animals from a river or canal bank or in very shallow water by walking on the sea or river bed or by another vessel br Powered by machinery such as internal combustion engines steam engines or by batteries and an electric motor Any one vessel may use more than one of these methods at different times or in combination br A number of large vessels are usually referred to as boats Submarines are a prime example Other types of large vessels which are traditionally called boats include Great Lakes freighters riverboats and ferryboats Though large enough to carry their own boats and heavy cargo these vessels are designed for operation on inland or protected coastal waters br br br Terminology br br The hull is the main and in some cases only structural component of a boat It provides both capacity and buoyancy The keel is a boat s backbone a lengthwise structural member to which the perpendicular frames are fixed On some boats a deck covers the hull in part or whole While a ship often has several decks a boat is unlikely to have more than one Above the deck are often lifelines connected to stanchions bulwarks perhaps topped by gunnels or some combination of the two A cabin may protrude above the deck forward aft along the centerline or cover much of the length of the boat Vertical structures dividing the internal spaces are known as bulkheads br The forward end of a boat is called the bow the aft end the stern Facing forward the right side is referred to as starboard and the left side as port br br br Building materials br br Until the mid th century most boats were made of natural materials primarily wood although bark and animal skins were also used Early boats include the birch bark canoe the animal hide covered kayak and coracle and the dugout canoe made from a single log br By the mid th century some boats had been built with iron or steel frames but still planked in wood In ferro cement boat construction was patented by the French who coined the name ferciment This is a system by which a steel or iron wire framework is built in the shape of a boat s hull and covered over with cement Reinforced with bulkheads and other internal structures it is strong but heavy easily repaired and if sealed properly will not leak or corrode br As the forests of Britain and Europe continued to be over harvested to supply the keels of larger wooden boats and the Bessemer process patented in cheapened the cost of steel steel ships and boats began to be more common By the s boats built entirely of steel from frames to plating were seen replacing wooden boats in many industrial uses and fishing fleets Private recreational boats of steel remain uncommon In WH Mullins produced steel boats of galvanized iron and by became the world s largest producer of pleasure boats br Mullins also offered boats in aluminum from through and once again in the s but it was not until the mid th century that aluminium gained widespread popularity Though much more expensive than steel aluminum alloys exist that do not corrode in salt water allowing a similar load carrying capacity to steel at much less weight br Around the mid s boats made of fiberglass aka glass fiber became popular especially for recreational boats Fiberglass is also known as GRP glass reinforced plastic in the UK and FRP for fiber reinforced plastic in the US Fiberglass boats are strong and do not rust corrode or rot Instead they are susceptible to structural degradation from sunlight and extremes in temperature over their lifespan Fiberglass structures can be made stiffer with sandwich panels where the fiberglass encloses a lightweight core such as balsa or foam br Cold molding is a modern construction method using wood as the structural component In one cold molding process very thin strips of wood are layered over a form Each layer is coated with resin followed by another directionally alternating layer laid on top Subsequent layers may be stapled or otherwise mechanically fastened to the previous or weighted or vacuum bagged to provide compression and stabilization until the resin sets An alternative process uses thin sheets of plywood shaped over a disposable male mold and coated with epoxy br br br Propulsion br br The most common means of boat propulsion are as follows br br Engine br Inboard motor br Stern drive Inboard outboard br Outboard motor br Paddle wheel br Water jet jetboat personal water craft br Fan hovercraft air boat br Man rowing paddling setting pole etc br Wind sailing br br br Buoyancy br br A boat displaces its weight in water regardless whether it is made of wood steel fiberglass or even concrete If weight is added to the boat the volume of the hull drawn below the waterline will increase to keep the balance above and below the surface equal Boats have a natural or designed level of buoyancy Exceeding it will cause the boat first to ride lower in the water second to take on water more readily than when properly loaded and ultimately if overloaded by any combination of structure cargo and water sink br As commercial vessels must be correctly loaded to be safe and as the sea becomes less buoyant in brackish areas such as the Baltic the Plimsoll line was introduced to prevent overloading br br br European Union classification br Since all new leisure boats and barges built in Europe between m and m must comply with the EU s Recreational Craft Directive RCD The Directive establishes four categories that permit the allowable wind and wave conditions for vessels in each class br br Class A the boat may safely navigate any waters br Class B the boat is limited to offshore navigation Winds up to Force waves up to metres br Class C the boat is limited to inshore coastal navigation Winds up to Force waves up to metres br Class D the boat is limited to rivers canals and small lakes Winds up to Force waves up to metres br Europe is the main producer of recreational boats the second production in the world is located in Poland European brands are known all over the world in fact these are the brands that created RCD and set the standard for shipyards around the world br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br
