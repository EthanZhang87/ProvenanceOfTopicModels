Cork Harbour Irish Cuan Chorca is a natural harbour and river estuary at the mouth of the River Lee in County Cork Ireland It is one of several which lay claim to the title of second largest natural harbour in the world by navigational area after Port Jackson Sydney Other contenders include Halifax Harbour in Canada Trincomalee Harbour in Sri Lanka and Poole Harbour in England br The harbour has been a working port and a strategic defensive hub for centuries and it has been one of Ireland s major employment hubs since the early s Traditional heavy industries have waned since the late th century with the likes of the closure of Irish Steel in Haulbowline and shipbuilding at Verolme It still has strategic significance in energy generation shipping refining and pharmaceuticals development br br br Geography br The main tributary to the harbour is the River Lee which after flowing through Cork city passes through the upper harbour Lough Mahon in the northwest before passing to the west of Great Island with the main channel emerging into the lower harbour past Haulbowline Island br For conservation and navigation purposes the harbour is often separated into Upper Cork Harbour following the River Lee from Cork city to the towns of Passage West and Monkstown and Lower Cork Harbour separated from the upper harbour by Great Island br The depth of the harbour has been measured at between fathoms m and fathoms m br br br Islands br Cork Harbour contains a number of islands of various sizes some of which are connected to the mainland by bridges Islands which are or have been inhabited include br br Great Island The largest island in Cork Harbour which includes the town of Cobh br Fota Island Containing Fota Wildlife Park Fota House and the Fota Island Resort Hotel and golf course br Little Island A residential and industrial area br Haulbowline Island Headquarters of the Irish Naval Service and former home of the Cork Water Club br Spike Island Former prison island br Harper s Island Site of the Harper s Island Wetland Centre br Hop Island Site of an equestrian centre br Weir Island br Brick Island br Corkbeg Island Site of Whitegate oil refinery br Brown Island br Rocky Island Once housed a magazine building for the Royal Navy Used by Irish Steel for storage until and now home to The Island Crematorium br br br Settlements br Cork city is located slightly upstream on the River Lee on the northwest corner of Cork Harbour Several of the city s suburbs including Blackrock Mahon Douglas Passage West and Rochestown lie on Lough Mahon or the Douglas Estuary both of which are parts of Upper Cork Harbour br The Lower Harbour has a number of towns around its shores Passage West Monkstown Ringaskiddy and the smaller village of Raffeen are found on the western shore On the southwestern shore is Crosshaven Great Island which forms the northern shore of the lower harbour houses the town of Cobh As of Cobh had a population of about The eastern shore is less densely populated but has two villages Whitegate and Aghada both home to power plants br The village of Ballinacurra is on the northeastern spur of the harbour known as the Ballynacorra River Due to the recent expansion of the town of Midleton Ballinacurra has effectively become a suburb of Midleton so it could also be said that Midleton lies on Cork Harbour br br br Military br Cork Harbour hosts the headquarters of the Irish Naval Service Prior to the transfer of the treaty ports in Cork Harbour was an important base for the British Royal Navy br br Some of the first coastal defence fortifications built in Cork Harbour date to the th century and were primarily intended to protect the approaches to Cork city In the th century fortifications were built on and opposite Haulbowline Island to protect the anchorage in Cobh including Cove Fort Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle were built at opposite sides of the harbour entrance during the period of the American War of Independence br br The harbour s military significance increased during the Napoleonic Wars when the naval establishment in Kinsale was transferred to Cork Harbour The harbour became an important anchorage which could be used to guard the entrance to the English Channel and maintain the blockade of France At this time the naval dockyard on Haulbowline Island was constructed as well as a fort on Spike Island later to become Fort Westmoreland and a number of Martello Towers and other fortifications were added or improved around the harbour br The fortifications were developed throughout the th century and a further fort Fort Templebreedy was added to the south of Fort Camden at the beginning of the th century br At the time of Irish independence Cork Harbour was included along with Berehaven and Lough Swilly in a list of British naval establishments that would remain under the control of the Royal Navy although the naval dockyard on Haulbowline Island was handed over to the Irish Free State in br br Although the Royal Navy appreciated the location of Cork Harbour particularly for submarines which had a significantly shorter range in the s maintenance of the fortifications became an issue after Ireland became independent The political uncertainty over the future of the treaty ports meant that the British government was not inclined to invest in their upgrade Also at the time of their construction nobody had considered the possibility of air attack and as they were unable to expand there was no possibility of adding adequate air cover Finally if the Irish Free State was hostile during any conflict the treaty ports would have to be supplied by sea rather than land wasting resources In March the British government announced that the treaty ports would be handed over unconditionally and on July the defences at Cork Harbour were handed over to the Irish military authorities at a ceremony attended by Taoiseach amon de Valera br Since being handed over to the Irish military most of the military installations have ceased to be used for military purposes Fort Carlisle was renamed Fort Davis and is used by the Defence Forces for training but is in a somewhat neglected state Fort Camden became officially known as Fort Meagher and while no longer in military use has been subject to renovation by local volunteers and enthusiasts and can be visited by the public on certain days The fort was officially renamed as of July as Camden Fort Meagher to account for both its British military and Irish military history Locally the two forts are sometimes known as Camden and Carlisle rather than their official titles Fort Westmoreland became Fort Mitchell Spike Island prison and has since ceased use for military or prison purposes Spike was gifted to Cork County Council by the State and has been renovated as a tourist attraction by council workers and volunteers under the supervision of archaeologists The fortifications on Haulbowline Island however have been maintained and are now the headquarters of the Irish Naval Service br br br Industry br Cork Harbour is one of the most important industrial areas in Ireland While several traditional industries such as shipbuilding at Verolme Dockyards steel making on Haulbowline Island and fertiliser manufacturing at IFI Irish Fertiliser Industries have ceased in recent years they have been replaced with newer industries and Cork Harbour is now significant within the pharmaceutical industry Large international firms such as Pfizer Novartis GlaxoSmithKline and Janssen Pharmaceutica a subsidiary of Johnson Johnson are significant employers in the region There has however been some concern since the post Irish economic downturn as several of the pharmaceutical companies in Cork have shed jobs notably Pfizer which announced the loss of jobs in June There are in excess of other pharmaceutical firms operating in the Cork Harbour area The main centres of the pharmaceutical industry are Little Island and Ringaskiddy Ireland s only oil refinery Whitegate refinery is located on the southeastern shore together with the adjacent Whitegate power station br br br Marine activity br br br Commercial br br Historically the navigation and port facilities of the harbour were managed by the Cork Harbour Commissioners Founded in the Cork Harbour Commissioners were reorganised as the Port of Cork Company in br br Vessels up to tonnes deadweight DWT are capable of coming through the harbour entrance As the shipping channels get shallower the farther inland one travels access becomes constricted and only vessels up to DWT can sail above Cobh br The Port of Cork provides pilotage and towage facilities for vessels entering Cork Harbour All vessels accessing the quays in Cork city must be piloted and all vessels exceeding metres in length must be piloted once they pass within nautical miles km of the harbour entrance at a point marked by the Spit Bank Lighthouse which is the landmark boundary for compulsory pilotage br The Port of Cork has berthing facilities at Cork city Tivoli Cobh and Ringaskiddy The facilities in Cork city are primarily used for grain and oil transport Tivoli downstream of the older city quays provides container handling facilities for oil livestock and ore and a roll on roll off Ro Ro ramp Prior to the opening of Ringaskiddy Ferry Port car ferries sailed from here now the Ro Ro ramp is used by companies importing cars into Ireland In addition to the ferry terminal which provides a service to Roscoff in France Ringaskiddy has a deep water port br The Port of Cork company is a commercial semi state company responsible for the commercial running of the harbour as well as responsibility for navigation and berthage in the port In the port had a turnover of million and made pre tax profits of million This was down from a turnover of million and profits of million in Container traffic increased by in when teus were handled at the Tivoli container facility however this was down from a peak of TEUs in The figure saw the port at full capacity and the Port drew up plans for a new container facility capable of handling up to teus per annum at Ringaskiddy This was the subject of objections and after an oral planning hearing was held in the Irish planning board Bord Pleanala rejected the plan due to inadequate rail and road links at the location br Permission was later granted and work started on the new port br There has been an increase in cruise ship visits to Cork Harbour in the early st century with such ships visiting the port in The majority of these cruise ships berth at Cobh s Deepwater Quay Historically Cobh under its former name Queenstown was one of the principal ports through which flowed the stream of emigrants stemming from the Great Famine in the s br There are also a number of private berths around the harbour with several centred on Whitegate Passage West Rushbrooke Ringaskiddy and Haulbowline br br br Recreational br The Royal Cork Yacht Club claimed as the world s oldest was founded as The Water Club on Haulbowline Island in the s When the British Navy took over Haulbowline in the club moved to Cobh where their original clubhouse built in the s still stands In the s the club moved to Crosshaven There are also boatyards at Crosshaven and two other marinas There is another marina on Great Island opposite East Ferry while Monkstown and Blackrock are used for boating canoeing windsurfing and jet skiing A number of rowing clubs have facilities on the part of the River Lee between Cork city and Blackrock br br br See also br The Emergency br Plan W br Joseph Wheeler for further information on th century shipbuilding in Cork br br
