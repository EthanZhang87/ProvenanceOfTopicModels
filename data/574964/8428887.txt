Dorothy Elizabeth Levitt born Elizabeth Levi January May was a British racing driver and journalist She was the first British woman racing driver holder of the world s first water speed record the women s world land speed record holder and an author She was a pioneer of female independence and female motoring and taught Queen Alexandra and the Royal Princesses how to drive In she established the record for the longest drive achieved by a lady driver by driving a De Dion Bouton from London to Liverpool and back over two days receiving the soubriquets in the press of the Fastest Girl on Earth and the Champion Lady Motorist of the World br Levitt s book The Woman and the Car A Chatty Little Handbook for all Women who Motor or Who Want to Motor recommended that women should carry a little hand mirror in a convenient place when driving so they may hold the mirror aloft from time to time in order to see behind while driving in traffic She also advised women travelling alone to carry a handgun her recommendation was an automatic Colt as in her opinion its relative lack of recoil made it particularly suitable for women br Levitt s court case against a GPO van driver who had hit her car was another landmark the first legal case in England won by the driver of a self propelled vehicle br br br Background br Levitt was born Elizabeth Levi in Hackney on January She was the daughter of Jacob Levi a prosperous jeweller tea dealer and Commission Agent of Colvestone Crescent Hackney Dorothy s mother was born Julia Raphael in Aldgate on October or possibly and married Jacob Levi in March Jacob died in and Julia in Levitt had two sisters Lilly March April and Elsie Ruby or Levitt or Levit had been adopted as the anglicized family surname by Her family was of Sephardi Jewish descent br Scant information is available about Levitt s life except indications that she was an experienced horse rider She described remaining astride a galloping horse while it negotiated jumps in a steeplechase as easier than retaining a seat in a car being driven at speed In she was employed as a secretary at the Napier Son works in Vine Street Lambeth where she was engaged initially on a temporary basis The Napier engineering company had been purchased by Montague Napier from the executors of his father s estate After undertaking work for Selwyn Edge on his Panhard et Levassor racing car Napiers diversified to manufacturing cars in At this time the British motor industry was only beginning to develop even the suggestion of motor races on public roads caused an outcry with hill climbs and speed tests having to be undertaken on private land br When or how Levitt met Edge is unclear as several versions and nuances are reported and both she and Edge appear to have been orientated towards self publicity Napier cars were driven by Edge in motor races and he piloted one to win the Gordon Bennett Cup a race from Paris to Austria while competing there he noticed the influence Camille du Gast s participation had in drawing media attention to French racing cars One suggestion was that Edge was seeking an English version of du Gast to enhance the sale of British cars Jean Williams British sports historian hypothesises it may also have been to initiate a similar strategy to that employed by Kodak to infer even women could manage it Edge noticed Levitt who was described by author Jean Francois Bouzanquet as a beautiful secretary with long legs and eyes like pools working in the Napier office and promoted her to become his personal assistant as she fulfilled almost all of his criteria for a suitable woman to attract extra publicity for the company br Later newspaper accounts paint a romantic history for Levitt by reporting that when she was twenty her parents moved to the countryside and tried to arrange a marriage for her Unhappy about their choice of prospective husband she absconded While her parents searched fruitlessly for her she became acquainted with Edge who advised her to develop a career br Edge s influence on her career was enormous having recognised her spirit he instigated her career in motoring arranged her training in Paris provided her cars in order to promote his dealerships and supplied her motor boats She is presumed to have also been his mistress for a time br br br Pioneer feminist and female motorist br The turn of the th century saw a transition from the more austere Victorian era towards the dynamics of Edwardian times transport methods were beginning to change yet there remained little opportunity for men to race motors so women driving was almost unheard of Levitt had to be taught to drive and Leslie Callingham a young salesman employed by Napiers was instructed to undertake the task during his day off work Fortunately Levitt was a fast learner as Callingham disliked her intensely and was affronted at having to teach a woman to drive Cars were entered in official trials to accumulate performance information for possible buyers only the company driver and an official were permitted in the vehicle The driver was required to undertake any necessary maintenance during the proceedings so Edge had to ensure Levitt was also proficient in mechanics In later interviews Levitt described how after Edge advised her to make a career in automobiles he arranged a six month apprenticeship to a French automobile maker in Paris where she learned all aspects of building and driving cars On her return to London she began teaching women how to drive reportedly teaching Queen Alexandra the Royal Princesses Louise Victoria and Maud other ladies of nobility and female American tourists br br br br br Levitt s introductory experience competing in a motor race took place in April the first English woman driver ever to do so She did not feature among the prize winners but determined that she would improve Edge was the British agent for Gladiator vehicles and that was the marque driven by Levitt during the first year of her career In May she piloted the hp version in the four hundred mile Glasgow to London non stop run losing only six points out of a possible maximum of the points reduction was due to having to stop to address a problem with the vehicle tyres Her vehicle was a non starter in the Sun Rise Hill Climb near Edge Hill Warwickshire on July so on that occasion she accompanied Edge in his vehicle as official passenger Levitt became the first British woman to take part in a speed competition when she made her d but in speed races at the Southport Speed Trials where she won the class for cars priced between and in her four seater Gladiator The heats were held on Friday October and the finals on the Saturday when she covered the flying kilometre in a time of one minute forty five seconds At a time when purchasing cars was only within the reach of the aristocracy and the upper middle classes and women were expected to remain at home tending to their husband s needs British society was astonished a woman working in a secretarial capacity was competing in a sport commonly believed to be a male discipline br Typically Edwardian women interested or involved in any mechanical disciplines were perceived to be masculine in outlook temperament and style who would also dress in utilitarian male type clothing When du Gast competed in the Paris to Madrid road race her face was almost entirely obscured by a mask and she wore a hat that featured ear flaps her coat was leather and double breasted and she was assumed to be male until her voice revealed her gender Levitt however raced dressed in flattering feminine outfits complete with co ordinating hat and veil a loose lightweight coat which became popularly known as a dust coat afforded overall protection to her fashionable clothes br Both Levitt s book and newspaper column in The Graphic described her atypical lifestyle for the Edwardian era an independent privileged bachelor girl living with friends in the West End of London and waited on by two servants br In the vernacular of the s Levitt was a scorcher a motorist who delighted in exceeding the speed limit and who therefore came to the attention of the police On November she was summonsed to appear at Marlborough Street Assizes for speeding in Hyde Park According to the reported statement by the police she was said to have driven at a terrific pace and when stopped reportedly said that she would like to drive over every policeman and wished she had run over the sergeant and killed him Although she did not appear personally the magistrate Mr Denman fined her with s costs The other six motoring defendants that day were only fined plus costs In November Levitt and her friend Hena Frankton claimed damages against a GPO van driver who had hit their car In two discrete cases they received compensation of each This was celebrated as the first legal case in England which was won by the driver of a self propelled vehicle br br br br During Levitt suffered some ill health and spent time convalescing in Madeira br In September Levitt drove an officially entered horse power De Dion car in the Hereford mile km Light Car Trial entirely alone without mechanics Her diary records that she did everything myself Had non stop for five days Only mechanical problems on the final day which she repaired herself prevented her from winning a gold medal br The Times of September reported br br It is satisfactory to note that no cars disappeared from the list although one of the De Dions the one driven by Miss Dorothy Levitt which had up to Saturday afternoon run without any loss of marks came to a standstill owing to a needle valve in the carburetter sic which regulates the flow of petrol getting loose and consequently closing The trouble took more than the official minutes to locate with the result that not only did the car lose its chance of any non stop award but the fellow to it was also cut out as similar cars have to run as a team This was hard on both drivers after a week s work br In October she won two medals at the Southport Speed Trials Blackpool driving a horse power Napier or hp Touring cars second place behind Leon Bollee Syndicate hp L on Bolll e br According to a November interview with the Penny Illustrated Paper Levitt balanced the fearful excitement of automobile racing by quietly going fishing and described trout fishing as her favourite sport She also described poker as her favourite game and claimed significant expertise at roulette Outlining her most wonderful secret system with which she is going this winter to attempt to break the bank at Monte Carlo br Levitt was noted for her ever present yappy black Pomeranian dog called Dodo A gift from Mademoiselle Marie Cornelle around he had been smuggled into England by being drugged and then hidden in the repair box of an automobile br Levitt sometimes mixed at the highest social levels such that her appearances were reported in advance in the Court Circulars of The Times To wit her attendance at Major General Sir Alfred Turner s Salon reception at the Picadilly Hotel on July br br In the book The car and British society class gender and motoring Sean O Connell described Levitt as arguably the best known of the early women drivers in an age when male prejudices against women drivers were typified by a item in Autocar that opined the hope that the controlling of motor cars will be wrested from the hands of these would be men Thus in the preface to the first edition of her book The Woman and the Car A chatty little handbook for all women who motor or who want to motor the editor C Byng Hall stated that br br The public in its mind s eye no doubt figures this motor champion as a big strapping Amazon Dorothy Levitt is exactly or almost so the direct opposite of such a picture She is the most girlish of womanly women br She was described as slight in nature shy and shrinking almost timid Her book went on to state that there might be pleasure in being whisked around the country by your friends and relatives or chauffeur but the real intense pleasure only comes when you drive your own car br br br Motor yachting br br In July possibly the th Levitt won the inaugural British International Harmsworth Trophy for motor boats defeating the French entry Trefle A Quatre The event was officiated by the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland and the Royal Victoria Yacht Club and took place at the Royal Cork Yacht Club at Cork Harbour in Ireland Levitt set the world s first Water Speed Record when she achieved mph km h in a foot m steel hulled horsepower Napier speedboat fitted with a blade propeller Selwyn Edge was both the owner and entrant of the boat and thus S F Edge is engraved on the trophy as the winner The third crew member Campbell Muir may also have taken the controls An article in the Cork Constitution on July reported A large number of spectators viewed the first mile from the promenade of the Yacht Club and at Cork several thousand people collected at both sides of the river to see the finishes br On August Levitt drove the Napier motor boat at Cowes and won the race She was then commanded to the Royal yacht Albert Victoria by King Edward VII where he congratulated her on her pluck and skill and they discussed among other things the performance of the boat and its potential for British government despatch work br Later in August she went to Trouville France and won the Gaston Menier Cup This was reported as a very competitive race against the world s cracks and she won what was described as the five mile world s championship of the sea and the prize br In October she returned to Trouville with the Napier motor boat and won the Championship of the Seas The French government like King Edward VII saw the merit of the design so went ahead and bought the boat for br br br Sporting motoring br br br br br In February Levitt established the record for the longest drive achieved by a lady driver She drove an horse power De Dion Bouton from London to Liverpool and back in two days without the aid of a mechanic but accompanied by an official observer her pet Pomeranian dog Dodo plus a revolver On March she departed from the De Dion showroom in Great Marlborough Street London at reached Coventry at miles km and

records that she Beat a great many professional drivers Drove at rate of miles in Daily Mail Cup br She also drove a hp kW development of the Napier K at the Blackpool Speed Trials br Her success and skills meant that she was offered a works drive in a French Mors in the inaugural RAC Tourist Trophy Race on the Isle of Man but she was prohibited from accepting by Selwyn Edge to protect the reputation of his Napier marque Ironically the mile km event was won by Mr J S Napier in his Arrol Johnson car ahead of competitors br br br br The highlight of Levitt s year was at the Blackpool

Penny Illustrated Paper that was headlined The Sensational Adventures of Miss Dorothy Levitt Champion Lady Motorist of the World In the article she described her career and spoke of the sensations of travelling at the awful pace of world record speeds br br Wonderful One can hardly describe one s sensations There is a feeling of flying through space I never think of the danger That sort of thing won t do But I know it is omnipresent The slightest touch of the hand and the car swerves and swerves are usually fatal But I am a good gambler and always willing to take the chance In going that pace the hardest thing is to keep in the car Half the time the wheels don t touch the ground at all and when they do touch you must be prepared to take the shock and lurch else out you will go It is far harder work to sit in the car than to ride a galloping horse over the jumps in a steeplechase When I made the records I was in the car alone I prefer it br br br br br In the newly opened Brooklands
