An electric boat is a powered watercraft driven by electric motors which are powered by either on board battery packs solar panels or generators br While a significant majority of water vessels are powered by diesel engines with sail power and gasoline engines also popular boats powered by electricity have been used for over years Electric boats were very popular from the s until the s when the internal combustion engine became dominant Since the energy crises of the s interest in this quiet and potentially renewable marine energy source has been increasing steadily especially as more efficient solar cells have become available for the first time making possible motorboats with a theoretically infinite cruise range like sailboats The first practical solar boat was probably constructed in in England The first electric sailboat to complete a round the world tour including a transit of the Panama Canal using only green technologies is EcoSailingProject br One of the main benefit of shift to electric from fossil fuelled boats apart from environmental benefit is the low cost of operation This can be understood if we assess the cost of mechanical energy from different sources diesel engine grid energy stored in battery to motors adding solar to the grid energy stored in battery to motors The spread between the diesel engine and the other two is dependent on fuel cost and grid cost in the respective region but in a place like India this could be factor or ten br br br History br br br Early br An early electric boat was developed by the German inventor Moritz von Jacobi in in St Petersburg Russia It was a foot m boat which carried passengers at miles per hour km h It was successfully demonstrated to Emperor Nicholas I of Russia on the Neva River br br br Golden Age br br It took more than years of battery and motor development before the electric boat became a practical proposition This method of propulsion enjoyed something of a golden age from about to when gasoline powered outboard motors became the dominant method Gustave Trouv a French electrical engineer patented a small electric motor in He initially suggested that the motor could power a set of paddle wheels to propel boats on the water and later argued for the use of a propeller br An Austrian migr to Britain Anthony Reckenzaun was instrumental in the development of the first practical electric boats While working as an engineer for the Electrical Power Storage Company he undertook much original and pioneering work on various forms of electric traction In he designed the first significant electric launch driven by storage batteries and named the boat Electricity The boat had a steel hull and was over seven metres long The batteries and electric equipment were hidden from view beneath the seating area increasing the space available for the accommodation of passengers The boats were used for leisure excursions up and down the River Thames and provided a very smooth clean and quiet trip The boat could run for six hours and operate at an average speed of miles per hour br Moritz Immisch established his company in in partnership with William Keppel th Earl of Albemarle specializing in the application of electric motors to transportation The company employed Magnus Volk as a manager in the development of their electric launch department After months of experimental work starting in with a randan skiff the firm commissioned the construction of hulls which they equipped with electrical apparatus The world s first fleet of electric launches for hire with a chain of electrical charging stations was established along the River Thames in the s An pleasure map of the Thames shows eight charging stations for electric launches between Kew Strand on the Green and Reading Caversham The company built its headquarters on the island called Platt s Eyot br From until just before the First World War the boating season and regattas saw the silent electric boats plying their way up and downstream br The company s electric launches were widely used by the rich as a conveyance along the river Grand ships were constructed of teak or mahogany and furnished luxuriously with stained glass windows silk curtains and velvet cushions William Sargeant was commissioned by Immisch s company to build the Mary Gordon in for Leeds City Council for use on the Roundhay Park Lake the boat still survives and is currently being restored This foot long luxury pleasure craft could carry up to passengers in comfort Launches were exported elsewhere they were used in the Lake District and all over the world br In the Chicago World Fair launches developed from Anthony Reckenzaun s work carried more than a million passengers Electric boats had an early period of popularity between around and before the emergence of the internal combustion engine drove them out of most applications br Most of the electric boats of this era were small passenger boats on non tidal waters at a time when the only power alternative was steam br br br Decline br With the advent of the gasoline powered outboard motor the use of electric power on boats declined from the s However in a few situations the use of electric boats has persisted from the early th century to the present day One of these is on the K nigssee lake near Berchtesgaden in south eastern Germany Here the lake is considered so environmentally sensitive that steam and motor boats have been prohibited since Instead the Bayerische Seenschifffahrt company and its predecessors have operated a fleet of electric launches to provide a public passenger service on the lake br The first electrically powered submarines were built in the s such as the Spanish Peral submarine launched in Since then electric power has been used almost exclusively for the powering of submarines underwater traditionally by batteries although diesel was used for directly powering the propeller while on the surface until the development of diesel electric transmission by the US Navy in in which the propeller was always powered by an electric motor energy coming from batteries while submerged or diesel generator while surfaced br The use of combined fuel and electric propulsion combined diesel electric or gas or CODLOG has gradually been extended over the years to the extent that some modern liners such as the Queen Mary use only electric motors for the actual propulsion powered by diesel and gas turbine engines The advantages include being able to run the fuel engines at an optimal speed at all times and being able to mount the electric motor in a pod which may be rotated by for increased manoeuvrability Note that this is not actually an electric boat but rather a variant of diesel electric or turbine electric propulsion similar to the diesel or electric propulsion used on submarines since WWI br br br Renaissance br br The use of electricity alone to power boats stagnated apart from their outboard use as trolling motors until the Duffy Electric Boat Company of California started mass producing small electric craft in It was not until that the Electric Boat Association was formed and solar powered boats started to emerge To reduce friction and increase range some boats use hydrofoils The eWolf tugboat that launched in March has a megawatt hour main propulsion battery and two electric drives and is more powerful than the diesel tugboats at the port br br br Components br The main components of the drive system of any electrically powered boat are similar in all cases and similar to the options available for any electric vehicle br br br Charger br Electric energy has to be obtained for the battery bank from some source like the sun br br A mains charger allows the boat to be charged from shore side power when available Shore based power stations are subject to much stricter environmental controls than the average marine diesel or outboard motor By purchasing green electricity it is possible to operate electric boats using sustainable or renewable energy For large vessels an onshore battery may be necessary to provide more short term power than the grid can supply br br Solar panels can be built into the boat in reasonable areas in the deck cabin roof or as awnings Some solar panels or photovoltaic arrays can be flexible enough to fit to slightly curved surfaces and can be ordered in unusual shapes and sizes Nonetheless the heavier rigid mono crystalline types are more efficient in terms of energy output per square meter The efficiency of solar panels rapidly decreases when they are not pointed directly at the sun so some way of tilting the arrays while under way is very advantageous br Towed generators are common on long distance cruising yachts and can generate a lot of power when travelling under sail If an electric boat has sails as well and will be used in deep water deeper than about m or ft then a towed generator can help build up battery charge while sailing there is no point in trailing such a generator while under electric propulsion as the extra drag from the generator would waste more electricity than it generates Some electric power systems use the free wheeling drive propeller to generate charge through the drive motor when sailing but this system including the design of the propeller and any gearing cannot be optimised for both functions It may be better locked off or feathered while the towed generator s more efficient turbine gathers energy br Wind turbines are common on cruising yachts and can be very well suited to electric boats There are safety considerations regarding the spinning blades especially in a strong wind It is important that the boat is big enough that the turbine can be mounted out of the way of all passengers and crew under all circumstances including when alongside a dock a bank or a pier It is also important that the boat is big enough and stable enough that the top hamper created by the turbine on its pole or mast does not compromise its stability in a strong wind or gale Large enough wind generators could produce a completely wind powered electric boat No such boats are yet known although a few mechanical wind turbine powered boats exist br In hybrid electric boats if a boat has an internal combustion engine anyway then its alternator will provide significant charge when it is running Two schemes are in use the combustion engine and the electric motor are both coupled to the drive parallel hybrid or the combustion engine drives a generator only for charging the storage batteries series hybrid br In all cases a charge regulator is needed This ensures that the batteries are charged at their maximum safe rate when power is available without overheating or internal damage and that they are not overcharged when nearing full charge br An alternative to charging is changing batteries while in port It offers the benefit of removing the need to wait for the recharging to complete before sailing This approach has the potential to allow ships and ferries with tight schedules to be electrified as charging can be done in port with no time limitations br br br Battery bank br br There have been significant technical advances in battery technology in recent years and more are to be expected in the future br br Lead acid batteries were still the most viable option until the advent of larger lithium ion batteries mass produced for electric cars from approximately onwards Deep cycle traction batteries are the obvious choice They are heavy and bulky but not much more so than the diesel engine tanks and fittings that they may replace They need to be securely mounted low down and centrally situated in the boat It is essential that they cannot move around under any circumstances Care must be taken that there is no risk of the strong acid being spilled in the event of a capsize as this could be very dangerous Venting of explosive hydrogen and oxygen gases is also necessary Typical lead acid batteries must be kept topped up with distilled water br Valve regulated lead acid batteries VRLA usually known as sealed lead acid gel or AGM batteries minimize the risk of spillage and gases are only vented when the batteries are overcharged These batteries require minimal maintenance as they cannot and usually do not need to be refilled with water br Nickel metal hydride lithium ion and other battery types are becoming available but are still expensive These are the kind of batteries currently common in rechargeable hand tools like drills and screwdrivers but they are relatively new to this environment They require different charge controllers to those that suit lead acid types br Lithium ion in this case usually means lithium iron phosphate batteries which although are heavier than other lithium ion is safer for marine application They are expensive but in applications which need reliability and ruggedness like ferries which run most of the day hours day this is the best option It has a much longer life to years life cycle br Fuel cells or flow batteries may provide significant advantages in years to come Today however they are still expensive and require specialist equipment and knowledge br Among the various battery chemistry the choice between a fast charging LTO NMC etc versus slow charging LFP is decided by economic analysis considering Capital expenditure CAPEX Operating expense OPEX Total cost of Ownership TCO It is observed that for higher energy need because of high speed or large weight with intermitted charging is an area where fast charging batteries become more economical br The size of the battery bank determines the range of the boat under electric power The speed at which the boat is motored also affects range a lower speed can make a big difference to the energy required to move a hull Other factors that affect range include sea state currents windage and any charge that can be reclaimed while under way for example by solar panels in full sun A wind turbine in a good wind will help and motor sailing in any wind could do so even more br br br Speed controller br To make the boat usable and manoeuvrable a simple to operate forward stop backwards speed controller is needed This must be efficient i e it must not get hot and waste energy at any speed and it must be able to stand the full current that could conceivably flow under any full load condition One of the most common types of speed controllers uses pulse width modulation PWM PWM controllers send high frequency pulses of power to the motor s As more power is needed the pulses become longer in duration br br br Electric motor br br A wide variety of electric motor technologies are in use Traditional field wound DC motors were and still are used Today many boats use lightweight permanent magnet DC motors The advantage of both types is that while the speed can be controlled electronically this is not a requirement Some boats use AC motors or permanent magnet brushless motors The advantages of these are the lack of commutators which can wear out or fail and the often lower currents allowing thinner cables the disadvantages are the total reliance on the required electronic controllers and the usually high voltages which require a high standard of insulation br br br Drive train br Traditional boats use an inboard motor powering a propeller through a propeller shaft complete with bearings and seals Often a gear reduction is incorporated in order to be able to use a larger more efficient propeller This can be a traditional gear box coaxial planetary gears or a transmission with belts or chains Because of the inevitable loss associated with gearing many drives eliminate it by using slow high torque motors The electric motor can be encapsulated into a pod with the propeller and fixed outside the hull saildrive or on an outboard fixture outboard motor br br br Types br There are as many types of electric boat as there are boats with any other method of propulsion but some types are significant for various reasons br br Historical and restored electric boats such as the Mary Gordon Electric Boat exist and are often important projects for those involved br br Range anxiety is a common concern for those considering electric propulsion on a boat In the crew of Rigging Doctor on board Wisdom crossed the Atlantic Ocean with an electric motor br br Canal river and lake boats Electric boats with their limited range and performance have tended to be used mostly on inland waterways where their complete lack of local pollution is a significant advantage Electric drives are also available as auxiliary propulsion for sailing yachts on inland waters br Electric outboards and trolling motors have been available for some years at prices from about US up to several thousand These require external batteries in the bottom of the boat but are otherwise practical one piece items Most available electric outboards are not as efficient as custom drives but are optimised for their intended use e g for inland waterway fishermen They are quiet and they do not pollute the water or the air so they do not scare away or harm fish birds and other wildlife Combined with modern waterproof battery packs electric outboards are also ideal for yacht tenders and other inshore pleasure boats br Electric personal watercraft have been invented but yet to be fully commercialized These watercraft use a high powered internal battery systems that are waterproofed and propel the vessel at high speeds using a jet drive propulsion The most first successful project of electric personal watercraft is by United States Company ELAQUA Marine br Cruising yachts usually have an auxiliary engine and there are two main uses for it One is to power ahead or motor sail at sea when the wind is light or from the wrong direction The other is to provide the last minutes or so of propulsion when the boat is in port and needs to be manoeuvred into a tight berth in a crowded and confined marina or harbour Electric propulsion is not suitable for prolonged cruising at full power although the power required to motor slowly in light airs and calm seas is small Regarding the second case electric drives are ideally suited as they can be finely controlled and can provide substantial power for short periods of time br br Commercial ferries br Norway s first battery electric ferry is MV Ampere with capacity for cars and trucks As of November it has operated for km Its battery holds MWh of energy but the minute charge time is sometimes not enough and more battery capacity is to be installed Norway has scheduled several other electric ferry projects Based on operational data Siemens concludes in a life cycle analysis that of Norway s diesel ferry routes could be replaced by electric ferries with a payback time of years The analysis includes auxiliary costs such as chargers grid and so on br In Finland F ri the historic Turku city ferry across the Aura River to Abo was converted to all electric propulsion in April The vessel was introduced as a wood burning steam ferry in converted to diesel operation in and now provides a continuous daily service from to late evening for foot and cycle passengers on battery power Charging takes place at night br Other projects are considered in Canada Sweden and Denmark br India s First Solar Ferry a passenger boat that is powered by sun and grid charging with lithium batteries began service in Based on the predictions of consumption the payback time is years br Some ferries can charge their onboard batteries while docked by using a pantograph br On the other hand ferries can include sometimes free charging points for the passengers transported electric bicycle electric motorcycles and electric cars br Diesel electric hybrid There is a third potential use for a diesel auxiliary and that is to charge the batteries when they suddenly start to wane far from shore in the middle of the night or at anchor after some days of living aboard In this case where this kind of use is to be expected perhaps on a larger cruising yacht then a combined diesel electric solution may be designed from the start The diesel engine is installed with the prime purpose of charging the battery banks and the electric motor with that of propulsion There is some reduction in efficiency if motoring for long distances as the diesel s power is converted first to electricity and then to motion but there is a balancing saving every time the wind sail and solar charged batteries are used for manoeuvring and for short journeys without starting the diesel There is the flexibility of being able to start the diesel as a pure generator whenever required The main losses are in weight and installation cost but on the bigger cruising boats that may sit at anchor running large diesels for hours every day these are not too big an issue compared to the savings that can be made at other times An example is the fishing boat Selfa El Max with kWh battery and kW diesel generator An LNG powered supply vessel started operation in with a kWh kW battery acting as spinning reserve during dynamic positioning saving fuel br Solar powered A boat propelled by direct solar energy is a marine solar vehicle The available sunlight is almost always converted to electricity by solar cells temporarily stored in accumulator batteries and used to drive a propeller through an electric motor Power levels are usually on the order of a few hundred watts to a few kilowatts Solar powered boats started to become known around and in the first commercial solar passenger boats appeared Solar powered boats have been used successfully at sea The first crossing of the Atlantic Ocean was achieved in the winter of by the solar catamaran Sun see also List of solar powered boats br br br Wired electric boats br br Trolley boats are a special category of electric boats are the vessels receiving their electrical power by wire This may involve overhead wires where one or two wires are fixed over the water and the boat can make contact with them to draw electric current or a waterproof tether cable may be used to connect the boat to shore In case of a single overhead wire the electrical circuit has to be closed by the water itself giving rise to a larger resistance and corrosion of the electrodes In case of two wires no electric current has to be sent through the water but the twin wires which cause a short circuit whenever they come into contact with each other complicate the construction br Naturally the boat has to stay close to the wire or its tether point and therefore it is limited in its manoeuvrability For ferries and on narrow canals this is no problem The Straussee Ferry in Strausberg Germany is an example It crosses a lake along a m trajectory and is powered by V from a single overhead wire The Kastellet ferry crosses a metres ft wide shipping channel in Sweden using a submergible tethered supply cable which is lowered to the sea bed when the ferry is docked at the opposite terminal to its tethering point br In the Mauvages tunnel on the Marne Rhine Canal a bipolar overhead line provides V DC to an electrical tug pulling itself and several ships through the m tunnel along a submerged chain This prevents the buildup of diesel exhaust fumes in the tunnel Another example was the experimental electrical tug Teltow on the Kleinmachnower See km south west of Berlin It was used from until and had current collection poles based on those used by trolley buses br br br Pollution and embodied energy br br All the component parts of any boat have to be manufactured and will eventually have to be disposed of Some pollution and use of other energy sources are inevitable during these stages of the boat s life and electric boats are no exception The benefits to the global environment that are achieved by the use of electric propulsion are manifested during the working life of the boat which can be many years These benefits are also most directly felt in the sensitive and beautiful environments in which such a boat is used br A life cycle study in Norway states that electric ferries and hybrid offshore supply ships compensate for the environmental effects of producing lithium ion batteries in less than months br br br Historic debate br The British Classic Boat magazine carried a pro and con article entitled Electric debate in May when lead acid batteries dominated the battery market and fossil fuels dominated the UK electricity system Jamie Campbell argued against electric boating on four main counts which were rebuffed by Kevin Desmond and Ian Rutter of the Electric Boat Association Jamie Campbell asserted that electric propulsion can no more be justified afloat than a Seagull outboard motor proposing wooden sailing boats and rowing dinghies as by far the most environmentally sensitive and renewable options for recreational boating br br br Electricity production br Campbell asserts that the lack of pollution from an electric boat reeks of nimbyism as the discharge is all in someone else s back yard and that the provision of re charging points may involve digging up miles of habitat Desmond responds that while there is no doubt that rechargeable batteries derive their energy from power stations when not charged on board by solar and wind generation noisier internal combustion engined boats obtain their fuel from even further away and that once installed a power cable is less environmentally disruptive than a petrol station Rutter notes that electric boats tend to recharge overnight using base load br br br Efficiency br While there are losses in the charge discharge cycle and in the conversion of electricity to motive power Rutter points out that most electric boats need only about kW or hp to cruise at mph km h a common maximum river speed and that a hp kW petrol or diesel engine producing only hp kW is considerably more inefficient While Campbell refers to heavy batteries requiring a load bearing hull and cranky even unseaworthy vessels Desmond points out that electric boaters tend to prefer efficient low wash hull forms that are more friendly to river banks br br br Pollution br Campbell discusses the pollution that traditional batteries put into the water when a boat sinks but Desmond says that electric boats are no more liable to sinking than other types and lists the leakage of fuel engine oil and coolant additives as inevitable when an internal combustion engined boat sinks Rutter points to the very nasty cocktail of pollutants that come out of a diesel wet exhaust in normal use br br br Battery manufacture br Campbell mentions all manner of noxious chemicals involved in battery manufacture but Rutter describes them as being lead and sulphuric acid with a few extra trace metals in a modest plastic box with a potential lifetime of years Desmond says that the US has a recycling rate for lead acid batteries and that the battery and lead smelting industries observe some of the tightest pollution control standards in the world br The article mentions and discounts being offered to electric boaters by the UK Environment Agency and the Broads Authority and that battery powered vehicles have the carbon footprint of their petrol equivalents It is claimed that a typical recharge after a day s cruising costs without the use of solar or wind power br br br Solar ships br br The first passenger solar vessels started to appear in Switzerland in with the Solifleur pictured above which was also the first solar vessel to feed more energy into the electricity grid than it consumed on a yearly average via a grid connection when docked br In the T ranor PlanetSolar a metre long metre wide catamaran yacht powered by square metres of solar panels was unveiled On May it completed a kilometres mi circumnavigation of the Earth in Monaco after days and visiting different countries without using any fossil fuel It is so far the largest solar powered boat ever built br India s first solar ferry the Aditya a passenger boat fully powered by sun is under construction It is expected to be completed by the middle of br Japan s biggest shipping line Nippon Yusen and Nippon Oil Corporation said solar panels capable of generating kilowatts of electricity would be placed on top of a tonne car carrier ship to be used by Toyota Motor Corporation

at knots by means of m of solar panels which generate kW to assist the diesel electric motors and optional Skysails br br br List of battery electric ships br br Gallery of battery ships br br br br
