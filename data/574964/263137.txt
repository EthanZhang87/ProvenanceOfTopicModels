The Daimler Company Limited DAYM l r before known as the Daimler Motor Company Limited was an independent British motor vehicle manufacturer founded in London by H J Lawson in which set up its manufacturing base in Coventry The company bought the right to the use of the Daimler name simultaneously from Gottlieb Daimler and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft of Cannstatt Germany After early financial difficulty and a reorganisation of the company in the Daimler Motor Company was purchased by Birmingham Small Arms Company BSA in which also made cars under its own name before the Second World War In BSA bought the Lanchester Motor Company and made it a subsidiary of the Daimler Company br Daimler was awarded a Royal Warrant to provide cars to the British monarch in it lost this privilege in the s after being supplanted by Rolls Royce Daimler occasionally used alternative technology the Daimler Knight engine which it further developed in the early twentieth century and used from to the worm gear final drive fitted from until after the Second World War and their patented fluid flywheel used in conjunction with a Wilson preselector gearbox from to the mid s br Daimler tried to widen its appeal in the s with a line of smaller cars at one end and opulent show cars at the other stopped making Lanchesters had a highly publicised removal of their chairman from the board and developed and sold a sports car and a high performance luxury saloon and limousine BSA sold Daimler to Jaguar Cars in and Jaguar briefly continued Daimler s line adding a Daimler variant of its Mark II sports saloon Jaguar was then merged into the British Motor Corporation in and British Leyland in Under these companies Daimler became an upscale trim level for Jaguar cars except for the Daimler DS limousine which had no Jaguar equivalent despite being fully Jaguar based When Jaguar Cars was split off from British Leyland in it retained the Daimler company and brand br Ford bought Jaguar Cars in and under Ford it stopped using the Daimler marque in when the last X Daimler models were discontinued The X Jaguar XJ took its place and there was no Daimler variant Jaguar Cars remained in its ownership and from accompanied by Land Rover until they sold both Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors in who formed Jaguar Land Rover as a subsidiary holding company for them In Jaguar Cars was merged with Land Rover to form Jaguar Land Rover Limited and the rights to the Daimler car brand were transferred to the newly formed British multinational car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover br br br Origin br br br Simms and the Daimler engine br br Engineer Frederick Richard Simms was supervising construction of an aerial cableway of his own design for the Bremen Exhibition in when he saw tiny railcars powered by Gottlieb Daimler s motors Simms who had been born to English parents in Hamburg and raised by them there became friends with Daimler an Anglophile who had worked from autumn to summer at Beyer Peacock Company in Gorton Manchester br Simms introduced Daimler s motors to England in to power launches In an agreement dated February he obtained British and Empire rights for the Daimler patents That month Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft lent Simms a motorboat with a hp engine and an extra engine In June Simms had set up a London office at Leadenhall Street and founded Simms Co consulting engineers In May the motorboat which Simms had named Cannstatt began running on the River Thames from Putney After demonstrating a motor launch to The Honourable Evelyn Ellis Simms s motor launch business grew rapidly but became endangered when solicitor Alfred Hendriks was found to have been illegally taking money from the company Hendriks severed his connections with Simms Co in February Simms Daimler related work was later moved into a new company The Daimler Motor Syndicate Limited which was formed on May br br br Simms plans to make cars br Following the success of Daimler powered Peugeots and Panhards at the Paris Rouen competition Simms decided to open a motor car factory br On June Simms told the board of the Daimler Motor Syndicate that he intended to form The Daimler Motor Company Limited to acquire the British rights to the Daimler patents and to manufacture Daimler engines and cars in England That month he arranged for the syndicate to receive a ten per cent commission on all British sales of Daimler powered Panhard Levassor cars br At the same meeting Simms produced the first licence to operate a car under the Daimler patents It was for a hp Panhard Levassor that had been bought in France by The Honourable Evelyn Ellis who had three Daimler motor launches moored by his home at Datchet On July after Ellis bought the licence the car was landed at Southampton and driven by Ellis to Micheldever near Winchester where Ellis met Simms and they drove together to Datchet Ellis later drove it on to Malvern This was the first long journey by motorcar in Britain Simms later referred to the car as a Daimler Motor Carriage br Later in Simms announced plans to form The Daimler Motor Company Limited and to build a brand new factory with delivery of raw materials by light rail for workmen making Daimler engines and motor carriages Simms asked his friend Daimler to be consulting engineer to the new enterprise Works premises at Eel Pie Island on the Thames where the Thames Electric and Steam Launch Company owned by Andrew Pears of Pears Soap fame had been making electrically powered motor launches were purchased to be used to service Daimler powered motor launches br br br Simms sells out to Lawson br Investor Harry John Lawson had set out to use the British Motor Syndicate to monopolise motor car production in Britain by taking over every patent he could As part of this goal Lawson approached Simms on October seeking the right to arrange the public flotation of the proposed new company and to acquire a large shareholding for his British Motor Syndicate Welcomed by Simms the negotiations proceeded on the basis that this new company should acquire The Daimler Motor Syndicate Limited as a going concern including the name and patent rights br In order that the Daimler licences could be transferred from Simms to the new company all the former partners would have to agree to the transfer By this time Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach had withdrawn from Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft s business to concentrate on cars and engines for them Simms offered to pay DMG for the transfer and for a licence for Daimler and Maybach s Ph nix engine which DMG did not own Simms therefore insisted that the transfer be on the condition that Daimler and Maybach rejoined DMG This was agreed in November and the Daimler Maybach car business re merged with DMG s Daimler was appointed DMG s General Inspector and Maybach chief Technical Director At the same time Simms became a director of DMG but did not become a director of the London company According to Gustav Vischer DMG s business manager at the time Simms getting Daimler to return to DMG was no mean feat br The sale of Daimler Motor Syndicate to Lawson s interests was completed by the end of November The shareholders of the Syndicate had made a profit of two hundred per cent on their original investment br br br Independent br br br From starting to stability br br On January Lawson incorporated The Daimler Motor Company Limited A prospectus was issued on February The subscription lists opened on February and closed oversubscribed the next day The Daimler Motor Company Limited bought The Daimler Motor Syndicate Limited from Lawson s British Motor Syndicate as a going concern Simms was appointed consulting engineer to the new business but was not to be on the board of directors possibly because he had become a director of the Cannstatt firm br One of the duties assigned to Simms was to find a suitable location for the factory Simms found the Trusty Oil Engine Works a company in receivership whose six acre site at Cheltenham included a foundry a machine shop and testing facilities Simms recommended buying the works immediately since with ready facilities and the availability of skilled workers they could start up in a very short time Instead at the first statutory meeting of the company held while Simms was overseas Lawson persuaded the board to buy a disused four storey cotton mill in Coventry which was owned by Lawson s associate Ernest Terah Hooley Despite Simms later protest and pleas to sell the mill and buy the Trusty Oil Engine Works Daimler stayed with the mill as the site of Britain s first automobile factory br Delayed delivery of machines kept the factory unfinished throughout and into During Daimler sold imported cars from companies for which Lawson held the licences Cannstatt supplied engine parts but the delivery of working drawings were delayed for months Four experimental cars were built in Coventry and a Panhard van was dismantled and reverse engineered Some Daimler engines with details redesigned by works manager J S Critchley were also made in br The first car left the works in January fitted with a Panhard engine followed in March by Daimler engined cars The first Coventry Daimler engined product made its maiden run in March By mid year they were producing three of their own cars a week and producing L on Boll e cars under licence Lawson claimed to have made cars by July making the Daimler Britain s first motor car to go into serial production an honour that is also credited to Humber Motors who had also displayed but in their case their production models at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in The Daimlers had a twin cylinder cc engine mounted at the front of the car four speed gearbox and chain drive to the rear wheels br br Because of Daimler s financial difficulty in July Daimler began asking Lawson s Great Horseless Carriage Company to settle its accounts with them In the same month they refused to send working drawings of their hp motor frame to DMG in Canstatt Lack of co operation with the Canstatt firm caused Simms to resign as Daimler s consulting engineer that month Also in July the company sold their launch works at Eel Pie Island at a loss of or more br Ongoing difficulties with the Great Horseless Carriage Company and the British Motor Syndicate caused Lawson to resign from Daimler s board on October He was replaced as chairman by Henry Sturmey who at the time was five days into a motor tour in his personal Daimler from John O Groats to Land s End On arriving at Land s End on October Sturmey became the first person to make that journey in a motor car br Gottlieb Daimler resigned from the board of the Daimler Motor Company in July having never attended a board meeting Sturmey opposed the appointment of a proposed successor who according to Sturmey held no shares and knew nothing about the automobile business A committee was brought in to investigate the activities of the board and the company The committee summed up the management of the business as being inefficient and not energetic and suggested that it be reorganised and run by a paid managing director When Evelyn Ellis and another board member did not run for re election they were replaced by E H Bayley and Edward Jenkinson with Bayley replacing Sturmey as chairman Sturmey resigned in May after Bayley and Jenkinson had reorganised the business br Simms as a director of DMG proposed a union between the Daimler Motor Company in Coventry and DMG in Cannstatt in mid but the reorganised company was not interested in the merger and turned the offer down br Persistent financial troubles caused Daimler to be reorganised again in The previous company was wound up and a new company was formed to acquire the old one and pay its debts and winding up costs br Under the chairmanship of Sir Edward Jenkinson Daimler hired American electrical engineer Percy Martin as works manager and socialite Undecimus Stratton as the head of the London depot and promoted Ernest Instone to general manager Jenkinson was succeeded in by Edward Manville a consulting electrical engineer br br br Royal patronage br br Known as Britain s oldest car manufacturers Daimler was first associated with royalty in when the Prince of Wales later Edward VII was given a ride on a Daimler by John Douglas Scott Montagu later known as Lord Montagu of Beaulieu Scott Montagu as a member of parliament also drove a Daimler into the yard of the Palace of Westminster the first motorised vehicle to be driven there br Daimler had sold the Prince of Wales a mail phaeton in early In upon buying another Daimler King Edward VII awarded Daimler a royal warrant as suppliers of motor cars br Undecimus Stratton met E G Jenkinson the chairman of Daimler in when Jenkinson s Daimler was stranded by the roadside Upon seeing the stranded motorist Stratton stopped his Daimler and offered assistance Jenkinson was impressed by Stratton and by his motoring knowledge At the time Jenkinson was looking to replace the head of Daimler s London depot a particularly sensitive position because of the royal cars Taking the position Stratton soon found himself having to select better royal chauffeurs and mechanics He quickly became an occasional motoring companion to the King In through Stratton s Royal connections Daimler was awarded a Royal Appointment as suppliers of motor cars to the Court of Spain by King Alfonso XIII and a Royal Warrant as Motor Car Manufacturer to the Court of Prussia by Kaiser Wilhelm II Stratton also sold Daimlers to the Sultan of Johor In he spent some weekends at Sandringham tutoring the new Prince of Wales on the workings and driving of an automobile br Stratton went into partnership with Daimler s commercial manager Ernest Instone in Stratton and Instone took charge of the Daimler showrooms at Pall Mall naming the business Stratton Instone Stratton died in July after a brief illness His successors and Instone bought out Daimler s interest in and renamed the business Stratstone Limited The following summer the future King Edward VIII rented Stratton s house at Sunningdale from his widow br Every British monarch from Edward VII to Elizabeth II has been driven in Daimler limousines In after a persistent transmission failure on the King s car Rolls Royce was commissioned to provide official state cars and as Daimlers retired they were not replaced by Daimlers The current official state car is either one of a pair which were specially made for the purpose by Bentley unofficial chauffeured transport is by Daimler Elizabeth II s own car for personal use was a Daimler Super Eight but she was also seen to drive herself in other smaller cars br br br Fluted radiator br Since the fluted top surface to the radiator grille has been Daimler s distinguishing feature This motif developed from the heavily finned water cooling tubes slung externally at the front of early cars Later a more conventional vertical radiator had a heavily finned header tank Eventually these fins were echoed on a protective grille shell and even later on the rear licence plate holder br br br Sleeve valve engines br br Attracted by the possibilities of the Silent Knight engine Daimler s chairman contacted Charles Yale Knight in Chicago and Knight settled in England near Coventry in Daimler bought rights from Knight for England and the colonies and shared ownership of the European rights in which it took with Minerva of Belgium Daimler contracted Dr Frederick Lanchester as their consultant for the purpose and a major re design and refinement of Knight s design took place in great secrecy Knight s design was made a practical proposition When unveiled in September the new engine caused a sensation Suffice it to say that mushroom valves springs and cams and many small parts are swept away bodily that we have an almost perfectly spherical explosion chamber and a cast iron sleeve or tube as that portion of the combustion chamber in which the piston travels br br The Royal Automobile Club held a special meeting to discuss the new engine still silent but no longer Wholly Knight The Autocar reported on its extraordinary combination of silence flexibility and power Daimler stopped making poppet valve engines altogether Under the observation of the Royal Automobile Club RAC two Daimler sleeve valve engines were put through severe bench road and track tests and upon being dismantled showed no visible wear earning Daimler the Dewar Trophy Sales outran the works ability to supply br Daimler s sleeve valve engines idle silently but they left a slight haze of oil smoke trailing behind them These engines consumed oil at a rate of up to an Imperial gallon every miles oil being needed to lubricate the sleeves particularly when cold However by the standards of their day they required very little maintenance br Daimler kept their silent sleeve valve engines until the mid s The change to poppet valves began with the Fifteen of br br br First fatal motor accident in the United Kingdom br A Daimler hp was involved in the first motor accident in the UK to be recorded as having involved the death of the driver A young engineer was killed in when the rim of a rear wheel of the car he was driving collapsed under heavy braking in a turn on a sloping road in Harrow on the Hill The driver and his four passengers were thrown from the car One of the passengers fractured his skull in the accident and died in hospital three days later br br br Under BSA br br br Acquisition by BSA br br Under an agreement dated September the shareholders of The Daimler Motor Company Limited merged their holdings with those of the Birmingham Small Arms Company BSA group of companies receiving five BSA shares in exchange for four ordinary Daimler shares and s plus accrued dividend for each preference share This deal was engineered by Dudley Docker deputy chairman of BSA who was famous for previous successful business mergers br Daimler a manufacturer of motor vehicles had a payroll of workmen and staff immediately before the merger BSA produced rifles ammunition military vehicles bicycles motorcycles and some BSA branded cars The chairman of the combined group was Edward Manville who had been chairman of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders founded by Simms since br However the merger was not a great success By Daimler had a workforce of workers which made only vehicles a year br br br Commercial Division br br In Daimler had plans to create The Premier Motor Omnibus Company running Daimler buses and appoint Frank Searle ex London General Omnibus Company as the managing director However plans had to be scrapped at the last moment and instead the Daimler managing director Percy Martin created the Daimler commercial division with Frank Searle as its head Daimler had been involved with various commercial vehicle designs for some time and this brought vans trucks buses tractors and railcars under the same division head All vehicles used the Daimler sleeve valve petrol engines many using the hp L sleeve valve straight six engine br New product announcements followed rapidly with the hp tractor launched at the June Norwich Agricultural Show and its larger hp version the Foster Daimler tractor a joint project with William Foster Co following in January mainly destined for the South American market Both used Daimler sleeve valve engines the larger cylinder tractor having a small BSA starter engine br In January new commercial vehicles included a ton delivery van lorries from to ton and a hp omnibus br Buses and trucks were able to use the same chassis and engines and as was common practice for commercial vehicles then have bespoke bodywork fitted The Metropolitan Electric Tramways ordering double decker buses in and engines were sold to the London General Omnibus Company LGOC The bus models were the foot wheelbase CB same chassis as the ton truck and the foot wheelbase CC both with hp engines With the onset of WW CC chassis production was stopped and CB production was ramped up for trucks for the military br A half ton delivery van was based on a hp chassis similar to a car chassis br The railcar project utilised of the large six cylinder engines Daimler had created a railcar in and though it went into service briefly it was hardly a success The new project in was of advanced design with the drive engines charging accumulators which could be used to provide a power boost or to drive the vehicle in the event of engine failure The bodywork was completed in The war interrupted the testing though it fared well although it wasn t a commercial success and in the railcar project was dropped br There was a close link between the Associated Equipment Company AEC and Daimler commercial division Daimler secured sole marketing rights for any AEC chassis other than those required by AEC s owner the London General Omnibus Company and in exchange AEC were to fit Daimler engines in their chassis This agreement was made in and continued until AEC war service vehicles had to have the Tylor engine fitted In the late s AEC and Daimler commercial division formed the Associated Daimler Company to build commercial vehicles The association was dissolved in with each company retaining manufacture of its original products br br br Royal transport br br By Daimlers were used by royal families including those of Great Britain Germany Russia Sweden Japan Spain and Greece its list of owners among the British nobility read like a digest of Debrett the Bombay agent supplied Indian princes the Japanese agent Okura handled sales in Manchuria and Korea br br br World War I work br br During World War I the military took the normal production cars lorries buses and ambulances together with a scout army vehicle and engines used in ambulances trucks and double decker buses Special products included aero engines and complete aircraft tank and tractor engines and munitions br The first aircraft engine manufactured by Daimler was the hp Gnome Monosoupape rotary With no drawings available to them Daimler s Gnome engines were reverse engineered from an engine delivered to them on August Daimler later built the RAF and a air cooled V s the RAF and a V s the Le Rhone rotary and the Bentley BR rotary alongside other manufacturers Production of RAF engines gave Daimler experience in building V engines which would be appreciated when they later designed and built Double Six V engines for their large cars br Daimler trained air force mechanics at its works and its training methods became the standard for all manufacturers instructing RAF mechanics br Having its own body shop Daimler had the woodworking ability to build complete aircraft By the end of they had built units of the Royal Aircraft Factory B E c These were followed by the BE and RE Daimler purchased an open field beside their Radford factory cleared the site and made it available to the Government who turned it into the main RAF testing ground for aircraft built in the Coventry district Although Daimler tooled up for production of the Royal Aircraft Factory F E bomber the aircraft was cancelled due to poor performance The last wartime aircraft produced was the Airco DH Amiens bomber when they were building aeroplanes a month br br Before the war Daimler had been making hp engines for the Foster Daimler tractor which was manufactured by William Foster Co in a joint venture with Daimler for the South American market These tractors were developed into artillery tractors to haul inch mm howitzers Production of the artillery tractors began on December These engines were later used for the first British tanks ever built the prototypes Little Willie and Mother and later in the production Mark I tank One major difficulty for the tanks was the fine oil haze above their Daimler engines which the enemy quickly learned meant tanks were operating nearby if out of sight The early tanks weighed up to tons They were all Daimler powered The Mark IV tank the first major improvement in design had uprated engines delivering hp these engines had aluminium pistons and are believed to have been designed by W O Bentley while he was working on the Bentley BR rotary engine in Coventry br Daimler made more twelve inch mm shell casings than any other private business in the country with a peak production of more than casings a day Each was machined from a lb forging down to a finished weight of lb br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Civil aviation br br After the Armistice it was decided that Daimler Hire should extend its luxury travel services to include charter aircraft through a new enterprise Daimler Air Hire Following the take over of Airco and its subsidiaries in February services included scheduled services London Paris as well as Taxi Planes to anywhere in Europe In under the name of Daimler Airway services extended to scheduled flights London to Berlin and places between Frank Searle managing director of Daimler Hire and its subsidiaries moved with his deputy Humphery Wood into the new national carrier Imperial Airways at its formation on April Searle and Wood and their Daimler Airway machines formed the core of Imperial Airways operations br br br Lanchester acquisition and badging br br The bulk of Daimler s shareholding in its subsidiary Daimler Hire Limited was sold to the Thomas Tilling Group in and in January Daimler completed the purchase of The Lanchester Motor Company Limited The new Lanchester model introduced in was fitted with Daimler s fluid flywheel transmission br Although at first they produced separate ranges of cars with the Daimler badge appearing mainly on the larger models by the mid s the two were increasingly sharing components leading to the Lanchester Daimler Light differing in little except trim and grille br This marketing concept already employed with their BSA range of cars continued to the end of Lanchester and BSA car production Some very important customers including the Duke of York and at least two Indian princes were supplied with big Daimler limousines with Lanchester grilles The Daimler range was exceptionally complex in the s with cars using a variety of six and eight cylinder engines with capacities from cc in the short lived of to the cc litre of br br br Review of BSA management before the Second World War br br The divisiveness of the Daimler board did not end with the BSA takeover but continued into the board of BSA Despite this Daimler prospered until the late s increasing its profits and its reputation Along with an apprenticeship programme that was among the best in the British industry at the time they attracted a large number of pupils out of public schools During the First World War Daimler s labour force grew from to men br The acquisition of Airco in February was a financial disaster for the BSA group Percy Martin had been strongly in favour of the purchase including Airco s extensive production facilities near London and no one thought to examine Airco s true circumstances leading to liabilities in excess of million All dividends were passed from to br br By the BSA Group s primary activities were BSA motorcycles and Daimler vehicles However all the quality car businesses experienced financial difficulties in the late s Daimler s situation seemed particularly serious Sales fell sharply in a period of losses ensued and no dividends were paid between and The sleeve valve engine was outdated Daimler s production methods had become old fashioned they had an extravagantly large range of products Their bankers noted the decreasing sales volume the poor performance for price and the need for up to date machine tool equipment Stratton Instone s dominance of distribution was removed and other outlets arranged The interests in Singer and the Daimler Hire business were sold and Lanchester bought The in house bodywork department was closed and by the spring of car production ceased only commercial vehicle production and aero engine work kept Daimler in business br br Laurence Pomeroy joined Damler in late at first working on commercial vehicles but from he worked at the products of the main Daimler operation Pomeroy introduced redesigned poppet valve engines with the Daimler Fifteen in September developed new models of Daimlers and recommended what became the September introduction of the small BSA and Lanchester Tens with poppet valve engines to help Daimler survive the depression According to Martin these actions rescued the business from total collapse in In the Pomeroy designed poppet valve Straight Eights replaced the Daimler Double Six sleeve valve V s without controversy or embarrassment thereby being a personal triumph for Pomeroy br br br Management shift br From before the merger of Daimler into the BSA group the core of Daimler s management was formed by chairman Edward Manville works manager Percy Martin and sales manager Ernest Instone who left Daimler in to start auto dealer Stratton Instone and was responsible for Daimler sales in England and Wales thereafter Instone died in Manville died in and Martin who in January replaced Alexander Roger Manville s replacement as chairman retired in In May Laurence Pomeroy was fired as managing director of Daimler with immediate effect Daimler was not paying dividends and the BSA shareholders meetings were stormy Attempted solutions had included the Lanchester acquisition and the introduction of smaller cars the lower priced hp Lanchester and its matching but six cylinder stable mate the Daimler Fifteen later DB and DB introduced in the early thirties This particular product line as the Lanchester Fourteen and Daimler Conquest was to run through to almost the very end br Edward H W Cooke attempted a revival and from introduced saloons with a freshness of design new to Daimler The new products had successes in competitions and rallies His policy was proved sound but another war post war austerity and yet more boardroom battles this time in public seemed to put an end to Daimler s once proud business br br br Daimler s semi automatic transmissions br br Daimler started testing the Fluidrive system in a bus chassis in This system patented by Harold Sinclair in applied Hermann F ttinger s fluid flywheel to replace the clutch in the transmission systems of road vehicles Daimler was initially interested in the fluid flywheel for use in commercial vehicles but Martin decided to develop the system for use in passenger cars as well Martin and Pomeroy originally intended to use the fluid flywheel with a conventional gearbox Their consultant Frederick Lanchester warned them that putting a car with that combination on the market would be a terribly big gambling risk and an accident in March where a Double Six with a prototype transmission damaged a garage in Devon after Pomeroy left it idling while in gear may have shown the nature of this risk By October when Daimler introduced the fluid flywheel on their new Light Double Six for an extra it was used with the self changing gearbox developed by W G Wilson Martin and the Daimler Company patented their refinements to Sinclair s system in br By November the combination of fluid flywheel and Wilson preselector gearbox was used in all Daimler vehicles ranging from h p passenger cars to double deck omnibuses according to the chairman s report to the shareholders at their Annual General Meeting that month According to the same report more than vehicles were using the transmission by that time Daimler would continue to develop and use these transmissions until when Borg Warner fully automatic units were offered initially as an alternative but later as standard br The Lanchester Sprite a L car with a unit body and Hobbs fully automatic gearbox was shown at the British International Motor Show at Earls Court in Problems with the transmission and other systems were never fully sorted out and the Sprite was discontinued about two years later with only thirteen being built br br br Second World War work br br During the Second World War Daimler turned again to military production A four wheel drive scout car known to the Army as the Dingo had a litre engine and the larger Daimler Armoured Car powered by a litre engine and armed with a pounder gun were produced both with six cylinder power units fluid flywheels and epicyclic gearboxes These military vehicles incorporated various innovative features including disc brakes on all four wheels The Dingo was designed by parent company BSA and took the name Dingo from an unsuccessful competitor submitted by Alvis br During the war Daimler built more than Scout Cars and some Mk I and Mk II Armoured Cars Daimler also provided tank components including epicyclic gearboxes for Crusader Covenanter and Cavalier tanks They built Bren gun initially at a workshop in their Coventry factory and after the workshop was destroyed in the April raid at a boot and shoe factory in Burton on Trent br Instead of building complete aircraft as they had in World War I Daimler built aircraft components including Bristol radial aero engines Mercury Hercules and Pegasus with full sets of parts for more of these engines propeller shafts for Rolls Royce aero engines and gun turrets for bombers including their Browning machine guns In all Daimler produced more than million aircraft parts during the war All this production is Daimler s alone excluding BSA s other involvements br Daimler s peak workforce people was reached in this period br The original Sandy Lane plant used as a government store was destroyed by fire during intensive enemy bombing of Coventry but there were by now shadow factories elsewhere in the city including one located at Brown s Lane Allesey In Jaguar moved to Brown s Lane which became the principal Jaguar car plant for several decades The factory has since been closed but areas retained for smaller Jaguar operations and housing together with development of industrial buildings The Daimler Radford plant has become a large housing estate br After that war Daimler produced the Ferret armoured car a military reconnaissance vehicle based on the innovative litre engined armoured car they had developed and built during the war which has been used by over countries br br br Postwar decline br br Winston Churchill campaigned for the and general elections in the DB two door drophead coup he had ordered in The government ordered new limousines for the commanding officers of the occupying forces New straight eights were supplied to the former colonies for the planned royal tours br The first Daimler limousines to be delivered after the war went to embassies and consulates in Europe and to the Lieutenant Governors of Jersey and Guernsey These were Straight Eights built largely from pre war stock The first post war model was the Eighteen a development of the pre war Fifteen using the Scout Car s L engine with a new high compression cylinder head The model used curved glass in its side windows which were framed by chromed metal channels instead of the thick pillars that were usual at the time Because of ongoing restrictions on steel many of the Eighteen s body panels were made from aluminium The first post war Lanchester the Ten looked like an enlarged Ford Prefect and its body was made in the same factory Briggs Motor Bodies on the Ford Dagenham site br br Despite the austerity of the times Daimler celebrated the golden jubilee of the founding of the business with a luncheon at the Savoy at which they announced the pricing of the Daimler Eighteen and the Lanchester Ten Production of large eight seat limousines the six cylinder DE and the eight cylinder DE began in March These were among the first series built cars with electrically operated windows They were also the first Daimler cars since to use bevel gear final drive instead of Daimler s usual worm final drive and the DE was the last straight eight automobile to be manufactured in Britain The DE chassis was also used in the Daimler Ambulance with bodies by Barker and Hooper br Foreign monarchs including the Queen of the Netherlands the King of Thailand The Aga Khan and Prince Aly Khan the Emperor of Ethiopia the Prince of Monaco and the King of Afghanistan re ordered to replenish their fleets br Then in June the purchase tax was doubled on cars costing more than with home market sales already having been restricted to cars for essential purposes Petrol remained rationed initially ten gallons a month the monthly ration was increased to fifteen gallons in July but was reduced again late in the summer of Princess Elizabeth took her litre coup a st birthday gift from her father to Malta where her new husband was stationed The King took delivery of a new open tourer straight eight in March In the commodities boom caused by the Korean War Australasian woolgrowers reported the new electrically operated limousine division to be just the thing if over heated sheepdogs licked the back of a driver s ears A DE limousine given to Princess Elizabeth by the Royal Air Force as a wedding present was traded for a Rolls Royce when its transmission failed br Until the early s the British aristocracy like British royalty preferred Daimlers because they saw Rolls Royces as flashy br Rolls Royce built the straight eight Phantom IV solely for royalty and heads of state Former Daimler customers including British royals and the Aga Khan switched to the Phantom IV while the Emperor of Ethiopia and the King and Queen of Greece ordered coachbuilt six cylinder Silver Wraiths br br br Consorts discounted br br Sir Bernard Docker chairman of the parent company took the extra responsibility of Daimler s managing director in January when James Leek was unable to continue through illness Car buyers were still waiting for the new Churchill government s easing of the temporary swingeing purchase tax promised in the lead up to the snap election held during the Earl s Court Motor Show Lady Docker told her husband to rethink his marketing policies litre Regency production was stopped In the hope of keeping employed the Consort price was dropped from February to the expected new tax inclusive level br br Stagnation of all the British motor industry was relieved by the reduction of purchase tax in the April budget Daimler announced the introduction of the moderately sized Conquest in May apparently developed in just four months from the four cylinder Lanchester or Leda with a Daimler grille br Daimler and Lanchester there were no more BSA cars struggled after the War producing too many models with short runs and limited production and frequently selling too few of each model while Jaguar seemed to know what the public wanted and expanded rapidly Daimler produced heavy staid large and small luxury cars with a stuffy if sometimes opulent image Jaguar produced lower quality cars at a remarkably low price designed for enthusiasts br The BSA group s leadership of the world s motorcycle market was eventually lost to Japanese manufacturers br br br Lady Docker s Daimlers br br Sir Bernard Docker was the managing director of BSA from early in WWII and married Norah Lady Collins in Nora was twice widowed and wealthy in her own right This was her third marriage She had originally been a successful dance hall hostess Lady Docker took an interest in her husband s companies and became a director of Hooper the coachbuilders br Daughter of an unsuccessful Birmingham car salesman Lady Docker could see that the Daimler cars no longer popular with the royal family were in danger of becoming an anachronism in the modern world She took it upon herself to raise Daimler s profile but in an extravagant fashion by encouraging Sir Bernard to produce show cars br br The first was the Golden Daimler an opulent touring limousine in Blue Clover a two door sportsmans coupe in the Silver Flash based on the litre Regency chassis and in Stardust redolent of the Gold Car but based on the DK chassis as was what proved to be her Paris grande finale a door coup she named Golden Zebra the last straw for the Tax Office and now on permanent display at The Hague br At the same time Lady Docker earned a reputation for having rather poor social graces when under the influence and she and Sir Bernard were investigated for failing to correctly declare the amount of money taken out of the country on a visit to a Monte Carlo casino Sir Bernard was instantly dumped for absenteeism by the Midland Bank board without waiting for the court case Norah drew further attention She ran up large bills and presented them to Daimler as business expenses but some items were disallowed by the Tax Office The publicity attached to this and other social episodes told on Sir Bernard s standing as some already thought the cars too opulent and vulgar for austere post war Britain To compound Sir Bernard s difficulty the royal family shifted allegiance to Rolls Royce By the end of all the State Daimlers had been sold and replaced by Rolls Royces br br br Turner s engines br br Jack Sangster sold his motorcycle companies Ariel and Triumph to BSA in and joined their board In Sangster was elected chairman defeating Sir Bernard votes to After a certain amount of electioneering by the Dockers an extraordinary shareholders meeting backed the board decision and Bernard and Norah left buying a brace of Rolls Royces as they went registering them as ND and BD Many important European customers turned out to have been Docker friends and did not re order Daimler cars br br Sangster promptly made Edward Turner head of the automotive division which as well as Daimler and Carbodies London Taxicab manufacturers included Ariel Triumph and BSA motorcycles Turner designed the lightweight hemi head Daimler Litre V Engines The small engine was used to power a production version of an apprentice s exercise the very flexible Dart and the larger engine installed in the Majestic Major a relabelled Majestic Under Sangster Daimler s vehicles became a little less sober and more performance oriented The Majestic Major proved an agile high speed cruiser on the new motorways Bill Boddy described the SP as unlikely to stir the memories of such ghosts as haunt the tree lined avenues near Sandringham Balmoral and Windsor Castle br The two excellent Turner V engines disappeared with British Leyland s first rationalisation the larger in and the smaller a year later br br br Buses br br A significant element of Daimler production was bus chassis mostly for double deckers Daimler had been interested in the commercial vehicle market from In it produced using the Auto Mixte patents of Belgian Henri Pieper a petrol electric vehicle and on May registered Gearless Motor Omnibus Co Limited It was too heavy Following the introduction of Daimler Knight sleeve valve engines re designed for Daimler by Dr Frederick Lanchester Lanchester also refined the Gearless design and it re emerged in as the KPL Knight Pieper Lanchester omnibus an advanced integral petrol electric hybrid The KPL bus had four wheel brakes and steel unitary body chassis construction Failure to produce the KPL set bus design back twenty years br Introduction of the KPL was stopped by a patent infringement action brought by London General Omnibus s associate Tilling Stevens in early May when just twelve KPL buses had been built This was just after Daimler had poached LGOC s Frank Searle and announced him to be general manager of its new London bus service which would be using its new KPL type to compete directly with LGOC br Some of LGOC s vehicles used Daimler engines With the collapse of Daimler s plans Searle an engineer and designer of the LGOC X type and AEC B type bus instead joined Daimler s commercial vehicle department Reverting to before LGOC omnibus salesman Searle rapidly achieved some notable sales to Metropolitan Electric Tramways and to LGOC s new owner the Underground Electric Railways Company of London br First Searle designed for Daimler a seater with gearbox transmission the KPL used electric motors each side very like the B Type and it was introduced by Daimler in early The main difference from what became the AEC B Type was the use of Daimler s sleeve valve engine In June what had been LGOC s manufacturing plant was hived off as AEC Between and AEC built some Daimler models under contract and Daimler sold all AEC vehicles which were surplus to LGOC needs After war service now Colonel Searle moved to Daimler Hire Limited and its involvement in aviation The Searle models were developed after World War I but from to Daimler entered into a joint venture with AEC vehicles being badged as Associated Daimler or ADC s br Daimler s CO chassis became the main model in the s followed by a similar but heavier CW austerity model produced during the Second World War with the Gardner LW engine CWG the rest with the AEC litre engine CWA and in post war years production worked through the Daimler CV to the long running Daimler CR Fleetline built from to CVG and CVG had been a common type of bus in Hong Kong between and and Fleetline had also become a major type of bus in Hong Kong until Small numbers of single deck vehicles were also built Many British bus operators bought substantial numbers of the vehicles and there were also a number built for export The standard London double decker bus bought from to was the Daimler Fleetline br br Daimler buses were fitted with proprietary diesel engines the majority by the Gardner company of Eccles Lancashire although there were a few hundred Daimler diesels built in the s s and the Leyland O was offered as an option on the Fleetline designated CRL after the merger with Leyland The bus chassis were also fitted with bodywork built by various outside contractors as is standard in the British bus industry so at a casual glance there is no real identifying feature of a Daimler bus apart from the badges Front engined Daimler buses retained the distinctive fluted radiator grille top The last Daimler Fleetline was built at the traditional Daimler factory in Radford Coventry in After that date the remaining buses were built at the Leyland factory in Farington Lancashire the final eight years of Fleetline production being badged as Leylands The last Fleetline built was bodied by Eastern Coach Works in br During that Jaguar owned period Daimler became the second largest after Leyland double decker bus manufacturer in Britain with the Fleetline model At the same time Daimler made trucks and motorhomes BMH merged with the Leyland Motor Corporation to give the British Leyland Motor Corporation in Production of Daimler buses in Coventry ceased in when production of its last bus product the Daimler Fleetline was transferred to Leyland plant in Farington Daimler stayed within BLMC and its subsequent forms until at which point Jaguar with Daimler was demerged from BL as an independent manufacturer br br Daimler Freeline to br Daimler Fleetline to br Daimler Roadliner to br br br Trolleybuses br In Daimler launched a range of trolleybus chassis and were one of the last British chassis manufacturers to enter this field only BUT were later There were two basic models both fitted with Metropolitan Vickers MV electrical equipment one with four wheels model CTM suitable for bodywork up to feet m long the other with six wheels model CTM for bodywork up to feet m long Including some demonstrators of the CTM model and three of the CTM were built during all being fitted with double deck bodywork by several different coachbuilders The biggest customers for the CTM were West Hartlepool Corporation which bought fourteen and Derby Corporation which bought six None were produced during World War and when the trolleybuses were reintroduced in either Crompton Parkinson CP or English Electric EE electrical equipment were available as alternatives to MV which was still available The model codes consisted of the letters CT for Commercial Trolleybus followed by a letter C E or M denoting the manufacturer of the electrical equipment CP EE or MV respectively and a figure for the number of wheels There were only three customers for the relaunched range Glasgow Corporation bought thirty CTM Rotherham Corporation bought eighteen CTC and CTE whilst eighteen CTM were exported to Pretoria South Africa Those for Rotherham were given single deck bodywork the others were all double deck Production ceased in at a time when the market for trolleybuses was in decline including the built in there were a total of Daimler trolleybuses br br Daimler CTM br Daimler CTM br Daimler CTE br Daimler CTC br br br Owned by Jaguar Cars br br In May the Daimler business was purchased from BSA by Jaguar Cars for million William Lyons was looking to expand manufacture wanted the manufacturing facilities and had to decide what to do with the existing Daimler vehicles br Jaguar had been refused planning permission for a new factory in the area in which it wanted it to be Daimler had shrunk to representing just of BSA group turnover in and BSA wished to dispose of its motoring interests Jaguar stated publicly that it would continue production of the existing range of Daimler that it would continue normal research and development for future Daimler products and that it would expand Daimler markets in Britain and overseas br Jaguar put a Daimler L V in a Mark X and tested it at the Motor Industry Research Association MIRA With an inefficient prototype exhaust the car went up to mph on MIRA s banked track faster than the production Mark X br Jaguar discontinued the six cylinder Majestic in and the SP in but Daimler s core product the old fashioned heavy but fast L V Majestic Major was continued throughout Jaguar s independent ownership of Daimler In Daimler introduced the DR a long wheelbase limousine version of the Majestic Major The DR also continued in production beyond the end of Jaguar s independent ownership of Daimler examples of the long wheelbase DR were sold as opposed to examples of the Majestic Major saloon br The litre saloon and limousine were the last Daimlers not designed by Jaguar br br br Jaguar based Daimlers br br Apart from the DR limousine new models under Lyons control were the result of negotiations between Lyons and the executives of Daimler distributor Stratstone Ltd In exchange for a small Daimler in the tradition of the Consort and the Conquest Stratstone gave up their Volkswagen franchise Lyons response was the V a more luxurious Jaguar Mark with the V engine from the SP automatic transmission different badges and a grille with a fluted top Despite the obvious Jaguar heritage motor journalist S C H Davis wrote of the car s marked character and claimed This is not a Jaguar with a Daimler radiator grille and name plate It can stand on its own br br While the V later renamed the V under new ownership became the most popular car Daimler ever produced it was not enough to establish brand loyalty Unlike Jaguar whose wide range of models allowed sixty per cent of new Jaguars to be sold in exchange for Jaguars few customers traded old V s for new ones Most V buyers were trading up from the bigger Ford Wolseley or Rover cars br James Smillie chairman of Stratstone made Lyons aware of this situation in Lyons responded by preparing a Daimler ised version of the upcoming Jaguar and presenting it to Smillie and Stratstone managing director John Olley Lyons asked the Stratstone executives what it should be called Smillie suggested Sovereign while Olley suggested Royale Despite Lyons stating his preference for Royale at the meeting the company decided on Sovereign two months later The Sovereign was launched in October to fill the gap between the V and the Majestic Major br br br Owned by BMH br Jaguar was taken over by British Motor Corporation BMC in and a few months later BMC was renamed British Motor Holdings BMH br br br Lyons reasons and reactions br Though Jaguar had diversified by adding after Daimler Guy trucks and Coventry Climax to their group they remained dependent on Pressed Steel for bodies Once BMC had taken control of Pressed Steel Lyons felt compelled to submit to the BMC takeover Lyons remained anxious to see that Jaguar maintained its own identity and came to resent the association with British Leyland He was delighted by Sir John Egan s accomplishments and by the new independence arranged in br br br End of Daimler brand in the United States br BMH s dealer network in the United States stopped importing Daimlers in claiming that there was insufficient funds in the group advertising budget to market all of BMH s brands in the US br br br Owned by British Leyland br br br Daimler DS Limousine br br The Daimler DS Limousine was introduced in to replace their Daimler DR and BMC s Vanden Plas Princess The DS used a Jaguar Mk X unitary carcass with a restyled roof and a floor pan extended by inches behind the front seat and strengthened The extension of the Mark X unit bodies was done by Motor Panels a subsidiary of Rubery Owen The floor pan with mechanicals was available to coachbuilders as a rolling chassis for use with specialised bodywork usually as hearses Startin of Birmingham built more than DS based hearses Finishing from the bare metal including final assembly and trimming the interior was done by Vanden Plas who had earlier made the Princess for BMC br The DS was withdrawn from production in From it had been the last production automobile to use the William Heynes designed Jaguar XK engine The last DS based Startin hearse was delivered on February to Mr Slack a funeral director in Cheshire br Though based entirely on Jaguar components the DS was unique to Daimler These limousines wedding and funeral cars and the hearses made by independent coachbuilders are now the Daimlers most remembered br br br Daimler Sovereign Daimler Double Six br br These were the first series of vehicles that were badge engineered Jaguars XJ Series but given a more luxurious and upmarket finish br For example the Daimler Double Six was a Jaguar XJ the Daimler badge and fluted top to its grille and boot handle being the only outward differences from the Jaguar with more luxurious interior fittings and extra standard equipment marking it out on the inside br br br Chairmen br br One strategy to sell Daimlers was through fleet sales of Jaguars to boards of directors Jaguar would offer to include a more prestigious Daimler for the chairman br From to the chairman of Jaguar Cars was Lofty England who began his career in the automotive industry as a Daimler apprentice from to br br br Fluted grilles in Continental Europe and the US br br The Daimler name was dropped in Europe in the s while Jaguar adopted the Sovereign designation This caused a great demand for imported Daimler parts as conversion kits to convert Jaguars into Daimlers Deducing from this conversion kit market that there was still a demand for Daimler cars Jaguar Cars returned the Daimler brand to Europe at the end of br Meanwhile in the United States Jaguar marketed the Vanden Plas with Daimler fluted grilles and licence plate housings br br br Owned by Jaguar Cars br br If Jaguar was not to follow Daimler into becoming just another once iconic brand it needed immense amounts of capital to develop new models and build and equip new factories This was beyond the ability of the BMH now British Leyland Group It was decided to market the Jaguar business by first obtaining a separate London Stock Exchange listing to fix a price then ensuring any successful bid for all the listed shares in the whole business would be from a bidder with or with access to the necessary capital That bidder proved to be Ford br produced a record group output of cars but less than were badged Daimler Two years later Daimler s share had reached and would have been almost if the Vanden Plas sold in the US were included br When the new XJ came into production in the Series III was kept in production a further six years to to carry the big Double Six

model that was a little more than just a rebadged Jaguar br When Ford bought Jaguar in the British press showed a coloured computer generated image of a proposed new Daimler car not merely a rebadged Jaguar XJ At least one related project has been documented br Daimler remained the flagship Jaguar product in every country except the US where the top Jaguar is known as the XJ Vanden Plas Jaguar may have feared that the American market would confuse Jaguar Daimler with Daimler AG br br br Century br br Daimler s centenary was celebrated in by the production of a special edition Double Six and straight six cars each with special paint and other special finishes including electrically adjustable rear seats br br The single door seater convertible built in to commemorate Daimler s centenary and called Daimler Corsica was based on the Daimler Double Six saloon The prototype which lacked an engine had all the luxury features of the standard saloon but a shorter wheelbase Painted Seafrost
