became a major centre of the British motor industry this made it a target for German air raids during the Second World War and in November much of the historic city centre was destroyed by a large air raid br The city was rebuilt after the war and the motor industry thrived until the mid s However by the late s early s Coventry was in an economic crisis with one of the country s highest levels of unemployment due to major plant closures and the collapse of the respective local supply chain In recent years it has seen regeneration and an increase in population The city also has three universities Coventry University in the city centre the University of Warwick on the southern outskirts and the smaller private Arden University with its headquarters close to Coventry Airport In addition Coventry was awarded UK City of Culture for br br br History br br br Origins and toponymy br The Romans founded a large fort on the outskirts of what is now Coventry at Baginton next to the River Sowe it has been excavated and partially reconstructed in modern times and is known as the Lunt Fort The fort was probably constructed around AD in connection with the Boudican revolt and then inhabited sporadically until around AD br The origins of the present settlement are obscure but Coventry probably began as an Anglo Saxon settlement Although there are various theories of the origin of the name the most widely accepted is that it was derived from Cofa s tree derived from a Saxon landowner called Cofa and a tree which might have marked either the centre or the boundary of the settlement br br br Medieval br br Around c AD a Saxon nunnery was founded here by St Osburga which was later left in ruins by King Canute s invading Danish army in Leofric Earl of Mercia and his wife Lady Godiva built on the remains of the nunnery and founded a Benedictine monastery in dedicated to St Mary It was during this time that the legend of Lady Godiva riding naked on horseback through the streets of Coventry to protest against unjust taxes levied on the citizens of Coventry by her husband was alleged to have occurred Although this story is regarded as a myth by modern historians it has become an enduring part of Coventry s identity br A market was established at the abbey gates and the settlement expanded At the time of the Norman Conquest in Coventry was probably a modest sized town of around inhabitants and its own minster church br Coventry Castle was a motte and bailey castle in the city It was built in the early th century by Ranulf de Gernon th Earl of Chester Its first known use was during The Anarchy when Robert Marmion a supporter of King Stephen expelled the monks from the adjacent priory of Saint Mary in and converted it into a fortress from which he waged a battle against the Earl Marmion perished in the battle It was demolished in the late th century St Mary s Guildhall was built on part of the site It is assumed the name Broadgate comes from the area around the castle gates br The Bishops of Lichfield were often referred to as the Bishops of Coventry and Lichfield or Lichfield and Coventry from to and in the medieval period Coventry was a major centre of pilgrimage of religion The Benedictines Carthusians Carmelites and Franciscans all had religious houses in the city of Coventry The Carthusian Priory of St Anne was built between and with royal patronage from King Richard II and his queen Anne of Bohemia Coventry has some surviving religious artworks from this time such as the doom painting at Holy Trinity Church which features Christ in judgement figures of the resurrected and contrasting images of Heaven and Hell br By the th century Coventry had become an important centre of the cloth trade especially blue cloth dyed with woad and known as Coventry blue Throughout the Middle Ages it was one of the largest and most important cities in England which at its Medieval height in the early th century had a population of up to making it the most important city in the Midlands and possibly the fourth largest in England behind London York and Bristol Reflecting its importance in around work began on a defensive city wall which when finally finished around years later in measured miles km long at least feet m high and up to feet m thick it had two towers and twelve gatehouses Coventry s city walls were described as one of the wonders of the late Middle Ages Today Swanswell Gate and Cook Street Gate are the only surviving gatehouses and they stand in the city centre framed by Lady Herbert s Garden br Coventry claimed the status of a city by ancient prescriptive usage and was granted a charter of incorporation and coat of arms by King Edward III in The motto Camera Principis the Prince s Chamber refers to Edward the Black Prince In Coventry became a county in its own right a status it retained until when it was reincorporated into Warwickshire br br Coventry s importance during the Middle Ages was such that on a two occasions a national Parliament was held there as well as a number of Great Councils In King Henry IV summoned a parliament in Coventry as he needed money to fight rebellion which wealthy cities such as Coventry lent to him During the Wars of the Roses the Royal Court was moved to Coventry by Margaret of Anjou the wife of Henry VI as she believed that London had become too unsafe On several occasions between and parliament was held in Coventry including the so called Devil s Parliament For a while Coventry served as the effective seat of government but this would come to an end in when Edward IV was installed on the throne br br br Tudor period br As throughout the Middle Ages Coventry had been home to several monastic orders the city was badly hit by Henry VIII s dissolution of the monasteries between and monasteries priories and other properties belonging to the Carmelites Greyfriars Benedictines and Carthusians were either sold off or dismantled The greatest loss to the city was of Coventry s first Cathedral St Mary s Priory and Cathedral which was mostly demolished leaving only ruins making it the only English Cathedral to be destroyed during the dissolution Coventry would not have another Cathedral until when the parish church of St Michael was elevated to Cathedral status and it was itself destroyed by enemy bombing in Coventry therefore has had the misfortune of losing its Cathedral twice in its history br William Shakespeare from nearby Stratford upon Avon may have witnessed plays in Coventry during his boyhood or teens and these may have influenced how his plays such as Hamlet came about br br br Civil War and aftermath br br During the English Civil War Coventry became a bastion of the Parliamentarians In August a Royalist force led by King Charles I attacked Coventry After a two day battle however the attackers were unable to breach the city walls and the city s garrison and townspeople successfully repelled the attack forcing the King s forces to withdraw During the Second Civil War many Scottish Royalist prisoners were held in Coventry it is thought likely that the idiom sent to Coventry meaning to ostracise someone derived from this period owing to the often hostile attitude displayed towards the prisoners by the city folk br Following the restoration of the monarchy as punishment for the support given to the Parliamentarians King Charles II ordered that the city s walls be slighted damaged and made useless as defences which was carried out in br br br Industrial age br In the th and early th centuries ribbon weaving and watch and clock making became Coventry s staple industries In the s the ribbon weaving industry was estimated to employ around weavers in Coventry and its surrounding towns like Bedworth and Nuneaton Coventry s growth was aided by the opening of the Coventry Canal in which gave the city a connection to the growing national canal network Nevertheless during the th century Coventry lost its status as the Midlands most important city to nearby Birmingham which overtook Coventry in size During the same period Coventry became one of the three main British centres of watch and clock manufacture and ranked alongside Prescot in Lancashire and Clerkenwell in London By the s Coventry had overshadowed its rivals to become the main centre of British watch and clock manufacture which by that time employed around people The watch and clock industry produced a pool of highly skilled craftsmen who specialised in producing precision components br The ribbon weaving and clock industries however both rapidly collapsed after due to cheap imports following the Cobden Chevalier free trade treaty which flooded the market with cheaper French silks and Swiss Made clocks and watches For a while this caused a devastating slump in Coventry s economy br A second wave of industrialisation however began soon after Coventry s pool of highly skilled workers attracted James Starley who set up a company producing sewing machines in Coventry in Within a decade he became interested in bicycles and developed the penny farthing design in His company soon began producing these bicycles and Coventry soon became the centre of the British bicycle industry Further innovation came from Starley s nephew John Kemp Starley who developed the Rover safety bicycle the first true modern bicycle with two equal sized wheels and a chain drive in By the s Coventry had the largest bicycle industry in the world with numerous manufacturers however bicycle manufacture went into steady decline from then on and ended entirely in when the last bicycle manufacturer in the city relocated br By the late s bicycle manufacture began to evolve into motor manufacture The first motor car was made in Coventry in by the Daimler Company Before long Coventry became established as one of the major centres of the British motor industry In the early to mid th century a number of famous names in the British motor industry became established in Coventry including Alvis Armstrong Siddeley Daimler Humber Jaguar Riley Rootes Rover Singer Standard Swift and Triumph For most of the early th century Coventry s economy boomed in the s a decade otherwise known for its economic slump Coventry was noted for its affluence In Coventry topped a national purchasing power index designed to calculate the purchasing power of the public br The London Road Cemetery was designed by Joseph Paxton on the site of a former quarry to meet the needs of the city br br br Great War br br Many Coventry factories switched production to military vehicles armaments and ammunitions during the Great War Approximately men from Coventry and Warwickshire served during the First World War so most of the skilled factory workers were women drafted from all over the country Due to the importance of war production in Coventry it was a target for German zeppelin attacks and defensive anti aircraft guns were established at Keresley and Wyken Grange to protect the city br In June the War Memorial Park was opened on the former Styvechale Common to commemorate the soldiers from the city who lost their lives in the war The War Memorial was designed by Thomas Francis Tickner and is a Grade II building It was unveiled by Earl Haig in with a room called the Chamber of Silence inside the monument holding the roll of honour Soldiers who lost their lives in recent conflicts have been added to the roll of honour over the years br br br Urban expansion and development br br With many of the city s older properties becoming increasingly unfit for habitation the first council houses were let to their tenants in With Coventry s industrial base continuing to soar after the end of the Great War in numerous private and council housing developments took place across the city in the s and s to provide housing for the large influx of workers who came to work in the city s booming factories The areas which were expanded or created in this development included Radford Coundon Canley Cheylesmore and Stoke Heath br As the population grew the city boundaries underwent several expansions in and In Coventry topped a national purchasing power index designed to calculate the purchasing power of the public br The development of a southern by pass around the city starting in the s and being completed in helped deliver more urban areas to the city on previously rural land In the s plans were created to redevelop Coventry s narrow streets and by the s the plans were put into action with Coventry s medieval street of Butcher Row being demolished even before the war the plans had been put in place to destroy the medieval character of Coventry br br br German bombing of Coventry br br Coventry suffered severe bomb damage during the Second World War The most severe was a massive Luftwaffe air raid that the Germans called Operation Moonlight Sonata The raid which involved more than aircraft started at pm on November and carried on for hours into the morning of November The raid led to severe damage to large areas of the city centre and to Coventry s historic cathedral leaving only a shell and the spire More than houses were damaged or destroyed along with around three quarters of the city s industrial plants Between and people were killed with thousands injured and homeless br Aside from London Hull and Plymouth Coventry suffered more damage than any other British city during the Luftwaffe attacks with huge firestorms devastating most of the city centre The city was probably targeted owing to its high concentration of armaments munitions aircraft and aero engine plants which contributed greatly to the British war effort although there have been claims that Hitler launched the attack as revenge for the bombing of Munich by the RAF six days before the Coventry Blitz and chose the Midlands city because its medieval heart was regarded as one of the finest in Britain Following the raids the majority of Coventry s historic buildings were demolished by a council who saw no need of them in a modern city although some of them could have been repaired and some of those demolished were unaffected by the bombing br br br Post Second World War br br br Redevelopment br In the post war years Coventry was largely rebuilt under the general direction of the Gibson Plan gaining a new pedestrianised shopping precinct the first of its kind in Europe on such a scale and in Sir Basil Spence s much celebrated new St Michael s Cathedral incorporating one of the world s largest tapestries was consecrated Its prefabricated steel spire fl che was lowered into place by helicopter br Further housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and also to replace condemned and bomb damaged properties Several new suburbs were constructed in the post war period including Tile Hill Wood End and Stoke Aldermoor br br br Boom and bust br br Coventry s motor industry boomed during the s and s and Coventry enjoyed a golden age In over people were employed in the production of motor vehicles tractors and aircraft in Coventry During this period the disposable income of Coventrians was amongst the highest in the country and both the sports and the arts benefited A new sports centre with one of the few Olympic standard swimming pools in the UK was constructed and Coventry City Football Club reached the First Division of English Football The Belgrade Theatre was also constructed along with the Herbert Art Gallery Coventry s pedestrianised Precinct shopping area came into its own and was considered one of the finest retail experiences outside London In the new University of Warwick campus was opened to students and rapidly became one of the country s leading higher education institutions br Coventry s large industrial base made it attractive to the wave of Asian and Caribbean immigrants who arrived from Commonwealth colonies after In one of Britain s first mosques and the very first in Coventry was opened on Eagle Street to serve the city s growing Pakistani community br The s however saw a decline in the British motor industry and Coventry suffered particularly badly especially towards the end of that decade By the s most of Coventry s motor companies had been absorbed and rationalised into larger companies such as British Leyland and Chrysler which subsequently collapsed The early s recession dealt Coventry a particularly severe blow By Coventry was in an economic crisis with one in six of its residents unemployed By the number of British Leyland employees in the city had fallen from at its height to just Other Coventry industrial giants such as the tool manufacturer Alfred Herbert also collapsed during this time br In the late s and early s Coventry also became the centre of the Two tone musical phenomena The two tone style was multi racial derived from the traditional Jamaican music genres of ska reggae and rocksteady combined with elements of punk rock and new wave Bands considered part of the genre include the Specials the Selecter Madness the Beat Bad Manners the Bodysnatchers and Akrylykz Most famously the Specials UK no hit Ghost Town reflected the unemployment and desolation of Coventry at the time br

no longer be producing bodies and chassis in Coventry instead producing them in China and shipping them in for final assembly in Coventry br Since the s Coventry has recovered with its economy diversifying into services with engineering ceasing to be a mass employer what remains of manufacturing in the city is driven by smaller more specialist firms By the s the biggest drivers of Coventry s economy had become its two large universities the University of Warwick and Coventry University which between them had students and a combined annual budget of around billion br In Coventry became

Water br br The Coventry Canal terminates near the city centre at Coventry Canal Basin and is navigable for miles km to Fradley Junction in Staffordshire br br br Accent br br br Origins br Coventry in a linguistic sense looks both ways towards both the West and East Midlands One thousand years ago the extreme west of Warwickshire what today we would designate Birmingham and the Black Country was separated from Coventry and east Warwickshire by the forest of Arden with resulting inferior means of communication The west Warwickshire settlements too were smaller in comparison to Coventry which by the th century was England s third city Even as far back as Anglo Saxon times Coventry situated as it was close to Watling Street was a trading and market post between King Alfred s Saxon Mercia and Danelaw England with a consequent merging of dialects br br br Coventry and Birmingham accents br Phonetically the accent of Coventry like the perhaps better known accent of Birmingham is similar to Northern English with respect to its system of short vowels For example it lacks the BATH TRAP Cov ba Southern b and FOOT STRUT Cov str t Southern str t splits Yet the longer vowels in the accent also contain traces of Estuary English such as a partial implementation of the London diphthong shift increasingly so amongst the young since We also see other Estuary English features such as a l vocalisation whereby words such as milk come to be pronounced as m k However the distinction between Coventry and Birmingham accents is often overlooked Certain features of the Birmingham accent e g occasional tapping of prevocalic r in words such as crack stop starkly as one moves beyond Solihull in the general direction of Coventry a possible approximation of the Arden Forest divide perhaps In any case Coventry sits right at a dialectal crossroads very close to isoglosses that generally delineate Northern and Southern dialects exhibiting features from both sides of the divide br br br
