Atmospheric pressure also known as air pressure or barometric pressure after the barometer is the pressure within the atmosphere of Earth The standard atmosphere symbol atm is a unit of pressure defined as Pa hPa which is equivalent to millibars mm Hg inches Hg or psi The atm unit is roughly equivalent to the mean sea level atmospheric pressure on Earth that is the Earth s atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately atm br In most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point As elevation increases there is less overlying atmospheric mass so atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation Because the atmosphere is thin relative to the Earth s radius especially the dense atmospheric layer at low altitudes the Earth s gravitational acceleration as a function of altitude can be approximated as constant and contributes little to this fall off Pressure measures force per unit area with SI units of pascals pascal newton per square metre N m On average a column of air with a cross sectional area of square centimetre cm measured from the mean average sea level to the top of Earth s atmosphere has a mass of about kilogram and exerts a force or weight of about newtons resulting in a pressure of N cm or kN m kilopascals kPa A column of air with a cross sectional area of in would have a weight of about lbf resulting in a pressure of lbf in br br br Mechanism br Atmospheric pressure is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet on the atmospheric gases above the surface and is a function of the mass of the planet the radius of the surface and the amount and composition of the gases and their vertical distribution in the atmosphere It is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity density variations due to temperature and variations in composition br br br Mean sea level pressure br br The mean sea level pressure MSLP is the atmospheric pressure at mean sea level This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio television and newspapers or on the Internet br The altimeter setting in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment br Average sea level pressure is hPa inHg mmHg In aviation weather reports METAR QNH is transmitted around the world in hectopascals or millibars hectopascal millibar except in the United States Canada and Japan where it is reported in inches of mercury to two decimal places The United States and Canada also report sea level pressure SLP which is adjusted to sea level by a different method in the remarks section not in the internationally transmitted part of the code in hectopascals or millibars However in Canada s public weather reports sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascals br In the US weather code remarks three digits are all that are transmitted decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted hPa psi is transmitted as hPa kPa is transmitted as hPa is transmitted as etc The highest sea level pressure on Earth occurs in Siberia where the Siberian High often attains a sea level pressure above hPa psi inHg with record highs close to hPa psi inHg The lowest measurable sea level pressure is found at the centres of tropical cyclones and tornadoes with a record low of hPa psi inHg br br br Surface pressure br br Surface pressure is the atmospheric pressure at a location on Earth s surface terrain and oceans It is directly proportional to the mass of air over that location br For numerical reasons atmospheric models such as general circulation models GCMs usually predict the nondimensional logarithm of surface pressure br The average value of surface pressure on Earth is hPa This is in contrast to mean sea level pressure which involves the extrapolation of pressure to sea level for locations above or below sea level The average pressure at mean sea level MSL in the International Standard Atmosphere ISA is hPa or atmosphere atm or inches of mercury br Pressure P mass m and acceleration due to gravity g are related by P F A m g A where A is the surface area Atmospheric pressure is thus proportional to the weight per unit area of the atmospheric mass above that location br br br Altitude variation br br Pressure on Earth varies with the altitude of the surface so air pressure on mountains is usually lower than air pressure at sea level Pressure varies smoothly from the Earth s surface to the top of the mesosphere Although the pressure changes with the weather NASA has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year round As altitude increases atmospheric pressure decreases One can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude Temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure Pressure is proportional to temperature and inversely related to humidity and both of these are necessary to compute an accurate figure The graph above was developed for a temperature of C and a relative humidity of br At low altitudes above sea level the pressure decreases by about kPa hPa for every metres For higher altitudes within the troposphere the following equation the barometric formula relates atmospheric pressure p to altitude h br br br br br br br br br p br br br br br br p br br br br br br br br br br br br

variation br br Atmospheric pressure varies widely on Earth and these changes are important in studying weather and climate Atmospheric pressure shows a diurnal or semidiurnal twice daily cycle caused by global atmospheric tides This effect is strongest in tropical zones with an amplitude of a few hectopascals and almost zero in polar areas These variations have two superimposed cycles a circadian h cycle and a semi circadian h cycle br br br Records br The highest adjusted to sea level barometric pressure ever recorded on Earth above meters was hPa inHg measured in Tosontsengel Mongolia on December The highest adjusted to sea level barometric pressure ever recorded below meters was at Agata in Evenk Autonomous Okrug Russia N E elevation m ft on December of hPa inHg The discrimination is due to the problematic assumptions assuming a standard lapse rate associated with reduction of sea level from high elevations br The Dead Sea the lowest place on Earth at metres ft below sea level has a correspondingly high typical atmospheric pressure of hPa A below sea level surface pressure record of hPa inHg was set on February br The lowest non tornadic atmospheric pressure ever measured was hPa atm inHg set on October during Typhoon Tip in the western Pacific Ocean The measurement was based on an instrumental observation made from a reconnaissance aircraft br br br Measurement based on the depth of water br One atmosphere kPa or psi is also the pressure caused by the weight of a column of freshwater of approximately m ft Thus a diver m underwater experiences a pressure of about atmospheres atm of air plus atm of water Conversely m is the maximum height to which water can be raised using suction under standard atmospheric conditions br Low pressures such as natural gas lines are sometimes specified in inches of water typically written as w c water column gauge or w g inches water gauge A typical gas using residential appliance in the US is rated for a maximum of psi kPa mbar which is approximately w g Similar metric units with a wide variety of names and notation based on millimetres centimetres or metres are now less commonly used br br br Boiling point of liquids br br Pure water boils at C F at earth s standard atmospheric pressure The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapour pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure around the liquid Because of this the boiling point of liquids is lower at lower pressure and higher at higher pressure Cooking at high elevations therefore requires adjustments to recipes or pressure cooking A rough approximation of elevation can be obtained by measuring the temperature at which water boils in the mid th century this method was used by explorers Conversely if one wishes to evaporate a liquid at a lower temperature for example in distillation the atmospheric pressure may be lowered by using a vacuum pump as in a rotary evaporator br br br Measurement and maps br An important application of the knowledge that atmospheric pressure varies directly with altitude was in determining the height of hills and mountains thanks to reliable pressure measurement devices In Maskelyne was confirming Newton s theory of gravitation at and on Schiehallion mountain in Scotland and he needed to measure elevations on the mountain s sides accurately William Roy using barometric pressure was able to confirm Maskelyne s height determinations the agreement being to be within one meter feet This method became and continues to be useful for survey work and map making br br br See also br br br br br
