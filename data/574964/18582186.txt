Benzene is an organic chemical compound with the molecular formula C H The benzene molecule is composed of six carbon atoms joined in a planar hexagonal ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each Because it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon br Benzene is a natural constituent of petroleum and is one of the elementary petrochemicals Due to the cyclic continuous pi bonds between the carbon atoms benzene is classed as an aromatic hydrocarbon Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell and is partially responsible for the aroma of gasoline It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structures such as ethylbenzene and cumene of which billions of kilograms are produced annually Although benzene is a major industrial chemical it finds limited use in consumer items because of its toxicity Benzene is a volatile organic compound br Benzene is classified as a carcinogen br br br History br br br Discovery br The word benzene derives from gum benzoin benzoin resin an aromatic resin known since ancient times in Southeast Asia and later to European pharmacists and perfumers in the th century via trade routes An acidic material was derived from benzoin by sublimation and named flowers of benzoin or benzoic acid The hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid thus acquired the name benzin benzol or benzene Michael Faraday first isolated and identified benzene in from the oily residue derived from the production of illuminating gas giving it the name bicarburet of hydrogen In Eilhard Mitscherlich produced it by distilling benzoic acid from gum benzoin and lime He gave the compound the name benzin In the French chemist Auguste Laurent named the substance ph ne this word has become the root of the English word phenol which is hydroxylated benzene and phenyl the radical formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom from benzene br In Charles Blachford Mansfield working under August Wilhelm von Hofmann isolated benzene from coal tar Four years later Mansfield began the first industrial scale production of benzene based on the coal tar method Gradually the sense developed among chemists that a number of substances were chemically related to benzene comprising a diverse chemical family In Hofmann was the first to apply the word aromatic to designate this family relationship after a characteristic property of many of its members In benzene was detected in deep space br br br Ring formula br br The empirical formula for benzene was long known but its highly polyunsaturated structure with just one hydrogen atom for each carbon atom was challenging to determine Archibald Scott Couper in and Johann Josef Loschmidt in suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings but in these years very little was known about aromatic chemistry and so chemists were unable to adduce appropriate evidence to favor any particular formula br But many chemists had begun to work on aromatic substances especially in Germany and relevant data was coming fast In the German chemist Friedrich August Kekul published a paper in French for he was then teaching in Francophone Belgium suggesting that the structure contained a ring of six carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds The next year he published a much longer paper in German on the same subject Kekul used evidence that had accumulated in the intervening years namely that there always appeared to be only one isomer of any monoderivative of benzene and that there always appeared to be exactly three isomers of every disubstituted derivative now understood to correspond to the ortho meta and para patterns of arene substitution to argue in support of his proposed structure Kekul s symmetrical ring could explain these curious facts as well as benzene s carbon hydrogen ratio br br br br br br br The new understanding of benzene and hence of all aromatic compounds proved to be so important for both pure and applied chemistry that in the German Chemical Society organized an elaborate appreciation in Kekul s honor celebrating the twenty fifth anniversary of his first benzene paper Here Kekul spoke of the creation of the theory He said that he had discovered the ring shape of the benzene molecule after having a reverie or day dream of a snake biting its own tail a symbol in ancient cultures known as the ouroboros This vision he said came to him after years of studying the nature of carbon carbon bonds This was seven years after he had solved the problem of how carbon atoms could bond to up to four other atoms at the same time Curiously a similar humorous depiction of benzene had appeared in in a pamphlet entitled Berichte der Durstigen Chemischen Gesellschaft Journal of the Thirsty Chemical Society a parody of the Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft only the parody had monkeys seizing each other in a circle rather than snakes as in Kekul s anecdote Some historians have suggested that the parody was a lampoon of the snake anecdote possibly already well known through oral transmission even if it had not yet appeared in print Kekul s speech in which this anecdote appeared has been translated into English If the anecdote is the memory of a real event circumstances mentioned in the story suggest that it must have happened early in br In the cyclic nature of benzene was finally confirmed by the crystallographer Kathleen Lonsdale using X ray diffraction methods Using large crystals of hexamethylbenzene a benzene derivative with the same core of six carbon atoms Lonsdale obtained diffraction patterns Through calculating more than thirty parameters Lonsdale demonstrated that the benzene ring could not be anything but a flat hexagon and provided accurate distances for all carbon carbon bonds in the molecule br br br Nomenclature br The German chemist Wilhelm K rner suggested the prefixes ortho meta para to distinguish di substituted benzene derivatives in however he did not use the prefixes to distinguish the relative positions of the substituents on a benzene ring It was the German chemist Carl Gr be who in first used the prefixes ortho meta para to denote specific relative locations of the substituents on a di substituted aromatic ring viz naphthalene In the German chemist Viktor Meyer first applied Gr be s nomenclature to benzene br br br Early applications br In Ludwig Roselius popularized the use of benzene to decaffeinate coffee This discovery led to the production of Sanka This process was later discontinued Benzene was historically used as a significant component in many consumer products such as liquid wrench several paint strippers rubber cements spot removers and other products Manufacture of some of these benzene containing formulations ceased in about although Liquid Wrench continued to contain significant amounts of benzene until the late s br br br Occurrence br Trace amounts of benzene are found in petroleum and coal It is a byproduct of the incomplete combustion of many materials For commercial use until World War II much of benzene was obtained as a by product of coke production or coke oven light oil for the steel industry However in the s increased demand for benzene especially from the growing polymers industry necessitated the production of benzene from petroleum Today most benzene comes from the petrochemical industry with only a small fraction being produced from coal Benzene has been detected on Mars br br br Structure br br X ray diffraction shows that all six carbon carbon bonds in benzene are of the same length at picometres pm The C C bond lengths are greater than a double bond pm but shorter than a single bond pm This intermediate distance is caused by electron delocalization the electrons for C C bonding are distributed equally between each of the six carbon atoms Benzene has hydrogen atoms fewer than the corresponding parent alkane hexane which has Benzene and cyclohexane have a similar structure only the ring of delocalized electrons and the loss of one hydrogen per carbon distinguishes it from cyclohexane The molecule is planar The molecular orbital description involves the formation of three delocalized orbitals spanning all six carbon atoms while the valence bond description involves a superposition of resonance structures It is likely that this stability contributes to the peculiar molecular and chemical properties known as aromaticity To reflect the delocalized nature of the bonding benzene is often depicted with a circle inside a hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms br Derivatives of benzene occur sufficiently often as a component of organic molecules so much so that the Unicode Consortium has allocated a symbol in the Miscellaneous Technical block with the code U C to represent it with three double bonds and U E for a delocalized version br br br Benzene derivatives br br Many important chemical compounds are derived from benzene by replacing one or more of its hydrogen atoms with another functional group Examples of simple benzene derivatives are phenol toluene and aniline abbreviated PhOH PhMe and PhNH respectively Linking benzene rings gives biphenyl C H C H Further loss of hydrogen gives fused aromatic hydrocarbons such as naphthalene anthracene phenanthrene and pyrene The limit of the fusion process is the hydrogen free allotrope of carbon graphite br In heterocycles carbon atoms in the benzene ring are replaced with other elements The most important variations contain nitrogen Replacing one CH with N gives the compound pyridine C H N Although benzene and pyridine are structurally related benzene cannot be converted into pyridine Replacement of a second CH bond with N gives depending on the location of the second N pyridazine pyrimidine or pyrazine br br br Production br Four chemical processes contribute to industrial benzene production catalytic reforming toluene hydrodealkylation toluene disproportionation and steam cracking etc According to the ATSDR Toxicological Profile for benzene between and catalytic reformates accounted for approximately of the total U S benzene production br br br Catalytic reforming br In catalytic reforming a mixture of hydrocarbons with boiling points between and C is blended with hydrogen gas and then exposed to a bifunctional platinum chloride or rhenium chloride catalyst at C and pressures ranging from atm Under these conditions aliphatic hydrocarbons form rings and lose hydrogen to become aromatic hydrocarbons The aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture or reformate by extraction with any one of a number of solvents including diethylene glycol or sulfolane and benzene is then separated from the other aromatics by distillation The extraction step of aromatics from the reformate is designed to produce aromatics with lowest non aromatic components Recovery of the aromatics commonly referred to as BTX benzene toluene and xylene isomers involves such extraction and distillation steps br In similar fashion to this catalytic reforming UOP and BP commercialized a method from LPG mainly propane and butane to aromatics br br br Toluene hydrodealkylation br Toluene hydrodealkylation converts toluene to benzene In this hydrogen intensive process toluene is mixed with hydrogen then passed over a chromium molybdenum or platinum oxide catalyst at C and atm pressure Sometimes higher temperatures are used instead of a catalyst at the similar reaction condition Under these conditions toluene undergoes dealkylation to benzene and methane br br br br br br br C br br br br br br br br br H br br br

CH H C H CH br br br This irreversible reaction is accompanied by an equilibrium side reaction that produces br biphenyl aka diphenyl at higher temperature br br C H H C H C H br If the raw material stream contains much non aromatic components paraffins or naphthenes those are likely decomposed to lower hydrocarbons such as methane which increases the consumption of hydrogen br A typical reaction yield exceeds Sometimes xylenes and heavier aromatics are used in place of toluene with similar efficiency br This is often called on purpose methodology to produce benzene compared to conventional BTX benzene toluene xylene extraction processes br br br Toluene disproportionation br Toluene disproportionation TDP is the conversion of toluene to benzene and xylene br Given that demand for para xylene p xylene substantially exceeds demand for other xylene isomers a refinement of the TDP process called Selective TDP STDP may be used In this process the xylene stream exiting the TDP unit is approximately p xylene In some systems even the benzene to xylenes ratio is modified to favor xylenes br br br Steam cracking br Steam cracking is the process for producing ethylene and other alkenes from aliphatic hydrocarbons Depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins steam cracking can produce a benzene rich liquid by product called pyrolysis gasoline Pyrolysis gasoline can be blended with other hydrocarbons as a gasoline additive or routed through an extraction process to recover BTX aromatics benzene toluene and xylenes br br br Other methods br Although of no commercial significance many other routes to benzene exist Phenol and halobenzenes can be reduced with metals Benzoic acid and its salts undergo decarboxylation to benzene The reaction of the diazonium compound derived from aniline with hypophosphorus acid gives benzene Alkyne trimerisation of acetylene gives benzene Complete decarboxylation of mellitic acid gives benzene br br br Uses br Benzene is used mainly as an intermediate to make other chemicals above all ethylbenzene and other alkylbenzenes cumene cyclohexane and nitrobenzene In it was reported that two thirds of all chemicals on the American Chemical Society s lists contained at least one benzene ring More than half of the entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene a precursor to styrene which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene Some of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene which is needed to produce phenol and acetone for resins and adhesives Cyclohexane consumes around of the world s benzene production it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of rubbers lubricants dyes detergents drugs explosives and pesticides In the biggest consumer country of benzene was China followed by the USA Benzene production is currently expanding in the Middle East and in Africa whereas production capacities in Western Europe and North America are stagnating br Toluene is now often used as a substitute for benzene for instance as a fuel additive The solvent properties of the two are similar but toluene is less toxic and has a wider liquid range Toluene is also processed into benzene br br br Component of gasoline br As a gasoline petrol additive benzene increases the octane rating and reduces knocking As a consequence gasoline often contained several percent benzene before the s when tetraethyl lead replaced it as the most widely used antiknock additive With the global phaseout of leaded gasoline benzene has made a comeback as a gasoline additive in some nations In the United States concern over its negative health effects and the possibility of benzene entering the groundwater has led to stringent regulation of gasoline s benzene content with limits typically around European petrol specifications now contain the same limit on benzene content The United States Environmental Protection Agency introduced new regulations in that lowered the benzene content in gasoline to br In some European languages the word for petroleum or gasoline is an exact cognate of benzene For instance in Catalan the word benzina can be used for gasoline though now it is relatively rare br br br Reactions br The most common reactions of benzene involve substitution of a proton by other groups Electrophilic aromatic substitution is a general method of derivatizing benzene Benzene is sufficiently nucleophilic that it undergoes substitution by acylium ions and alkyl carbocations to give substituted derivatives br br The most widely practiced example of this reaction is the ethylation of benzene br br Approximately tons were produced in Highly instructive but of far less industrial significance is the Friedel Crafts alkylation of benzene and many other aromatic rings using an alkyl halide in the presence of a strong Lewis acid catalyst Similarly the Friedel Crafts acylation is a related example of electrophilic aromatic substitution The reaction involves the acylation of benzene or many other aromatic rings with an acyl chloride using a strong Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminium chloride or Iron III chloride br br br Sulfonation chlorination nitration br Using electrophilic aromatic substitution many functional groups are introduced onto the benzene framework Sulfonation of benzene involves the use of oleum a mixture of sulfuric acid with sulfur trioxide Sulfonated benzene derivatives are useful detergents In nitration benzene reacts with nitronium ions NO which is a strong electrophile produced by combining sulfuric and nitric acids Nitrobenzene is the precursor to aniline Chlorination is achieved with chlorine to give chlorobenzene in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminium tri chloride br br br Hydrogenation br Via hydrogenation benzene and its derivatives convert to cyclohexane and derivatives This reaction is achieved by the use of high pressures of hydrogen in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts such as finely divided nickel Whereas alkenes can be hydrogenated near room temperatures benzene and related compounds are more reluctant substrates requiring temperatures C This reaction is practiced on a large scale industrially In the absence of the catalyst benzene is impervious to hydrogen Hydrogenation cannot be stopped to give cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes as these are superior substrates Birch reduction a non catalytic process however selectively hydrogenates benzene to the diene br br br Metal complexes br Benzene is an excellent ligand in the organometallic chemistry of low valent metals Important examples include the sandwich and half sandwich complexes respectively Cr C H and RuCl C H br br br Health effects br br Benzene is classified as a carcinogen which increases the risk of cancer and other illnesses and is also a notorious cause of bone marrow failure Substantial quantities of epidemiologic clinical and laboratory data link benzene to aplastic anemia acute leukemia bone marrow abnormalities and cardiovascular disease The specific hematologic malignancies that benzene is associated with include acute myeloid leukemia AML aplastic anemia myelodysplastic syndrome MDS acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL and chronic myeloid leukemia CML br The American Petroleum Institute API stated as early as that it is generally considered that the only absolutely safe concentration for benzene is zero There is no safe exposure level even tiny amounts can cause harm The US Department of Health and Human Services DHHS classifies benzene as a human carcinogen Long term exposure to excessive levels of benzene in the air causes leukemia a potentially fatal cancer of the blood forming organs In particular acute myeloid leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia AML ANLL is caused by benzene IARC rated benzene as known to be carcinogenic to humans Group br As benzene is ubiquitous in gasoline and hydrocarbon fuels that are in use everywhere human exposure to benzene is a global health problem Benzene targets the liver kidney lung heart and brain and can cause DNA strand breaks and chromosomal damage hence is teratogenic and mutagenic Benzene causes cancer in animals including humans Benzene has been shown to cause cancer in both sexes of multiple species of laboratory animals exposed via various routes br br br Exposure to benzene br According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ATSDR benzene is both a synthetically made and naturally occurring chemical from processes that include volcanic eruptions wild fires synthesis of chemicals such as phenol production of synthetic fibers and fabrication of rubbers lubricants pesticides medications and dyes The major sources of benzene exposure are tobacco smoke automobile service stations exhaust from motor vehicles and industrial emissions however ingestion and dermal absorption of benzene can also occur through contact with contaminated water Benzene is hepatically metabolized and excreted in the urine Measurement of air and water levels of benzene is accomplished through collection via activated charcoal tubes which are then analyzed with a gas chromatograph The measurement of benzene in humans can be accomplished via urine blood and breath tests however all of these have their limitations because benzene is rapidly metabolized in the human body br Exposure to benzene may lead progressively to aplastic anemia leukaemia and multiple myeloma br OSHA regulates levels of benzene in the workplace The maximum allowable amount of benzene in workroom air during an hour workday hour workweek is ppm As benzene can cause cancer NIOSH recommends that all workers wear special breathing equipment when they are likely to be exposed to benzene at levels exceeding the recommended hour exposure limit of ppm br br br Benzene exposure limits br The United States Environmental Protection Agency has set a maximum contaminant level for benzene in drinking water at mg L ppb as promulgated via the U S National Primary Drinking Water Regulations This regulation is based on preventing benzene leukemogenesis The maximum contaminant level goal MCLG a nonenforceable health goal that would allow an adequate margin of safety for the prevention of adverse effects is zero benzene concentration in drinking water The EPA requires that spills or accidental releases into the environment of pounds kg or more of benzene be reported br The U S Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set a permissible exposure limit of part of benzene per million parts of air ppm in the workplace during an hour workday hour workweek The short term exposure limit for airborne benzene is ppm for minutes These legal limits were based on studies demonstrating compelling evidence of health risk to workers exposed to benzene The risk from exposure to ppm for a working lifetime has been estimated as excess leukemia deaths per employees exposed This estimate assumes no threshold for benzene s carcinogenic effects OSHA has also established an action level of ppm to encourage even lower exposures in the workplace br The U S National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH revised the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health IDLH concentration for benzene to ppm The current NIOSH definition for an IDLH condition as given in the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic is one that poses a threat of exposure to airborne contaminants when that exposure is likely to cause death or immediate or delayed permanent adverse health effects or prevent escape from such an environment The purpose of establishing an IDLH value is to ensure that the worker can escape from a given contaminated environment in the event of failure of the respiratory protection equipment and is considered a maximum level above which only a highly reliable breathing apparatus providing maximum worker protection is permitted In September NIOSH issued a new policy for developing recommended exposure limits RELs for substances including carcinogens As benzene can cause cancer NIOSH recommends that all workers wear special breathing equipment when they are likely to be exposed to benzene at levels exceeding the REL hour of ppm The NIOSH short term exposure limit STEL min is ppm br American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists ACGIH adopted Threshold Limit Values TLVs for benzene at ppm TWA and ppm STEL br br br Toxicology br br br Biomarkers of exposure br Several tests can determine exposure to benzene Benzene itself can be measured in breath blood or urine but such testing is usually limited to the first hours post exposure due to the relatively rapid removal of the chemical by exhalation or biotransformation Most people in developed countries have measureable baseline levels of benzene and other aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in their blood In the body benzene is enzymatically converted to a series of oxidation products including muconic acid phenylmercapturic acid phenol catechol hydroquinone and trihydroxybenzene Most of these metabolites have some value as biomarkers of human exposure since they accumulate in the urine in proportion to the extent and duration of exposure and they may still be present for some days after exposure has ceased The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure are g g creatinine for muconic acid and g g creatinine for phenylmercapturic acid in an end of shift urine specimen br br br Biotransformations br Even if it is not a common substrate for metabolism benzene can be oxidized by both bacteria and eukaryotes In bacteria dioxygenase enzyme can add an oxygen to the ring and the unstable product is immediately reduced by NADH to a cyclic diol with two double bonds breaking the aromaticity Next the diol is newly reduced by NADH to catechol The catechol is then metabolized to acetyl CoA and succinyl CoA used by organisms mainly in the citric acid cycle for energy production br The pathway for the metabolism of benzene is complex and begins in the liver Several enzymes are involved These include cytochrome P E CYP E quinine oxidoreductase NQ or DT diaphorase or NAD P H dehydrogenase quinone GSH and myeloperoxidase MPO CYP E is involved at multiple steps converting benzene to oxepin benzene oxide phenol to hydroquinone and hydroquinone to both benzenetriol and catechol Hydroquinone benzenetriol and catechol are converted to polyphenols In the bone marrow MPO converts these polyphenols to benzoquinones These intermediates and metabolites induce genotoxicity by multiple mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II which maintains chromosome structure disruption of microtubules which maintains cellular structure and organization generation of oxygen free radicals unstable species that may lead to point mutations increasing oxidative stress inducing DNA strand breaks and altering DNA methylation which can affect gene expression NQ and GSH shift metabolism away from toxicity NQ metabolizes benzoquinone toward polyphenols counteracting the effect of MPO GSH is involved with the formation of phenylmercapturic acid br Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes may induce loss of function or gain of function For example mutations in CYP E increase activity and result in increased generation of toxic metabolites NQ mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased detoxification Myeloperoxidase mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased generation of toxic metabolites GSH mutations or deletions result in loss of function and result in decreased detoxification These genes may be targets for genetic screening for susceptibility to benzene toxicity br br br Molecular toxicology br The paradigm of toxicological assessment of benzene is shifting towards the domain of molecular toxicology as it allows understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms in a better way Glutathione seems to play an important role by protecting against benzene induced DNA breaks and it is being identified as a new biomarker for exposure and effect Benzene causes chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow explaining the higher incidence of leukemia and multiple myeloma caused by chronic exposure These aberrations can be monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH with DNA probes to assess the effects of benzene along with the hematological tests as markers of hematotoxicity Benzene metabolism involves enzymes coded for by polymorphic genes Studies have shown that genotype at these loci may influence susceptibility to the toxic effects of benzene exposure Individuals carrying variant of NAD P H quinone oxidoreductase NQO microsomal epoxide hydrolase EPHX and deletion of the glutathione S transferase T GSTT showed a greater frequency of DNA single stranded breaks br br br Biological oxidation and carcinogenic activity br One way of understanding the carcinogenic effects of benzene is by examining the products of biological oxidation Pure benzene for example oxidizes in the body to produce an epoxide benzene oxide which is not excreted readily and can interact with DNA to produce harmful mutations br br br Routes of exposure br br br Inhalation br Outdoor air may contain low levels of benzene from automobile service stations wood smoke tobacco smoke the transfer of gasoline exhaust from motor vehicles and industrial emissions About of the entire nationwide United States exposure to benzene results from smoking tobacco or from exposure to tobacco smoke After smoking cigarettes per day the smoker would take in about milligrams mg of benzene This amount is about times the average daily intake of benzene by nonsmokers br Inhaled benzene is primarily expelled unchanged through exhalation In a human study to of retained benzene was eliminated through the lungs within five to seven hours after a two to three hour exposure to to ppm and only to of the remaining benzene was excreted unchanged in the urine After exposure to to mg m of benzene for to hours to was excreted in the urine as phenol over a period of to hours In another human study of absorbed dermally applied benzene which is primarily metabolized in the liver was excreted as phenol in the urine br br br Exposure from soft drinks br br Under specific conditions and in the presence of other chemicals benzoic acid a preservative and ascorbic acid Vitamin C may interact to produce benzene In March the official Food Standards Agency in United Kingdom conducted a survey of brands of soft drinks It found that four contained benzene levels above World Health Organization limits The affected batches were removed from sale Similar problems were reported by the FDA in the United States br br br Contamination of water supply br In the water supply to the city of Harbin in China with a population of almost nine million people was cut off because of a major benzene exposure Benzene leaked into the Songhua River which supplies drinking water to the city after an explosion at a China National Petroleum Corporation CNPC factory in the city of Jilin on November br When plastic water pipes are subject to high heat the water may be contaminated with benzene br br br Genocide br The Nazi German government used benzene administered via injection as one of their many methods for killing br br br See also br br BTEX br
