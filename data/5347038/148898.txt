id: 148898
Asian Americans are Americans of Asian ancestry including naturalized Americans who are immigrants from specific regions in Asia and descendants of those immigrants Although this term had historically been used for all the indigenous peoples of the continent of Asia the usage of the term Asian by the United States Census Bureau only includes people with origins or ancestry from East Asia Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent and excludes people with ethnic origins in certain parts of Asia including West Asia who are now categorized as Middle Eastern Americans Furthermore Central Asians are not mentioned in any census racial category The Asian census category includes people who indicate their race s on the census as Asian or reported entries such as Chinese Indian Bangladeshi Filipino Vietnamese Indonesian Korean Japanese Pakistani Malaysian and Other Asian In Americans who identified as Asian alone or in combination with other races made up of the U S population br Chinese Indian and Filipino Americans make up the largest share of the Asian American population with million million and million people respectively These numbers equal and of the total Asian American population or and of the total U S population br Although migrants from Asia have been in parts of the contemporary United States since the th century large scale immigration did not begin until the mid th century Nativist immigration laws during the s s excluded various Asian groups eventually prohibiting almost all Asian immigration to the continental United States After immigration laws were reformed during the s s abolishing national origins quotas Asian immigration increased rapidly Analyses of the census have shown that by percentage change Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial group in the United States br br br Terminology br As with other racial and ethnicity based terms formal and common usage have changed markedly through the short history of this term Prior to the late s people of various Asian ancestries were usually referred to as Yellow Oriental Asiatic Brown Mongoloid or Hindoo Additionally the American definition of Asian originally included West Asian ethnic groups particularly Turkish Americans Armenian Americans Assyrian Americans Iranian Americans Kurdish Americans Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern descent and certain Arab Americans although in modern times these groups are now considered Middle Eastern American and grouped under White Americans in the census The term Asian American was coined by historian activists Yuji Ichioka and Emma Gee in during the founding of the Asian American Political Alliance and they were also credited with popularizing the term which meant to be used to frame a new inter ethnic pan Asian American self defining political group This effort was part of New Left anti war and anti imperialist activism directly opposing what was viewed as an unjust Vietnam War br Prior to being included in the Asian category in the s many Americans of South Asian descent usually classified themselves as Caucasian or other Changing patterns of immigration and an extensive period of exclusion of Asian immigrants have resulted in demographic changes that have in turn affected the formal and common understandings of what defines Asian American For example since the removal of restrictive national origins quotas in the Asian American population has diversified greatly to include more of the peoples with ancestry from various parts of Asia br Today Asian American is the accepted term for most formal purposes such as government and academic research although it is often shortened to Asian in common usage The most commonly used definition of Asian American is the U S Census Bureau definition which includes all people with origins in East Asia Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent This is chiefly because the census definitions determine many governmental classifications notably for equal opportunity programs and measurements br According to the Oxford English Dictionary Asian person in the United States is most often thought of as a person of East Asian descent In vernacular usage Asian is usually used to refer to those of East or Southeast Asian descent with South Asians not included as often This differs from the U S census definition and the Asian American Studies departments in many universities consider all those of East South or Southeast Asian descent to be Asian br br br Census definition br In the U S census people with origins or ancestry in East Asia Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent are classified as part of the Asian race while those with origins or ancestry in West Asia Israelis Turks Persians Kurds Assyrians Arabs etc and the Caucasus Georgians Armenians Azerbaijanis Chechens Circassians etc are classified under the Middle Eastern and North African race and those with origins from Central Asia Kazakhs Uzbeks Turkmens Tajiks Kyrgyz Afghans etc are not mentioned in any racial definitions provided by the United States Census Bureau As such Asian and African ancestry are seen as racial categories only for the purpose of the census with the definition referring to ancestry from parts of the Asian and African continents outside of West Asia North Africa and Central Asia br In and before census forms listed particular Asian ancestries as separate groups along with white and black or negro Asian Americans had also been classified as other In the federal Office of Management and Budget issued a directive requiring government agencies to maintain statistics on racial groups including on Asian or Pacific Islander By the census Asian or Pacific Islander API was included as an explicit category although respondents had to select one particular ancestry as a subcategory Beginning with the census two separate categories were used Asian American and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander br br br Debates and criticism br br The definition of Asian American has variations that derive from the use of the word American in different contexts Immigration status citizenship by birthright and by naturalization acculturation and language ability are some variables that are used to define American for various purposes and may vary in formal and everyday usage For example restricting American to include only U S citizens conflicts with discussions of Asian American businesses which generally refer both to citizen and non citizen owners A Pew Research Center survey of Asian Americans found that self identify as Asian with preferring to refer to themselves by more specific ethnic groupings and simply self identifying as American br In a PBS interview from a panel of Asian American writers discussed how some groups include people of Middle Eastern descent in the Asian American category Asian American author Stewart Ikeda has noted The definition of Asian American also frequently depends on who s asking who s defining in what context and why the possible definitions of Asian Pacific American are many complex and shifting some scholars in Asian American Studies conferences suggest that Russians Iranians and Israelis all might fit the field s subject of study Jeff Yang of The Wall Street Journal writes that the panethnic definition of Asian American is a unique American construct and as an identity is in beta The majority of Asian Americans feel ambivalence about the term Asian American as a term by which to identify themselves Pyong Gap Min a sociologist and Professor of Sociology at Queens College has stated the term is merely political used by Asian American activists and further reinforced by the government Beyond that he feels that South Asians and East Asians do not have commonalities in culture physical characteristics or pre migrant historical experiences br Scholars have grappled with the accuracy correctness and usefulness of the term Asian American The term Asian in Asian American most often comes under fire for only encompassing some of the diverse peoples of Asia and for being considered a racial category instead of a non racial ethnic category This is namely due to the categorization of the racially different South Asians and East Asians as part of the same race Furthermore it has been noted that West Asians whom are not considered Asian under the U S census share some cultural similarities with Indians but very little with East Asians with the latter two groups being classified as Asian Scholars have also found it difficult to determine why Asian Americans are considered a race while Americans of Hispanic and Latino heritage are a non racial ethnic group given how the category of Asian Americans similarly comprises people with diverse origins However it has been argued that South Asians and East Asians can be justifiably grouped together because of Buddhism s origins in South Asia br In contrast leading social sciences and humanities scholars of race and Asian American identity point out that because of the racial constructions in the United States including the social attitudes toward race and those of Asian ancestry Asian Americans have a shared racial experience Because of this shared experience the term Asian American is argued as still being a useful panethnic category because of the similarity of some experiences among Asian Americans including stereotypes specific to people in this category Despite this others have stated that many Americans do not treat all Asian Americans equally highlighting the fact that Asian American is generally synonymous with people of East Asian descent thereby excluding people of Southeast Asian and South Asian origin Some South and Southeast Asian Americans may not identify with the Asian American label instead describing themselves as Brown Asians or simply Brown due to the perceived racial and cultural differences between them and East Asian Americans br br br Demographics br br The demographics of Asian Americans describe a heterogeneous group of people in the United States who can trace their ancestry to one or more countries in East South or Southeast Asia Because they compose of the entire U S population the diversity of the group is often disregarded in media and news discussions of Asians or of Asian Americans While there are some commonalities across ethnic subgroups there are significant differences among different Asian ethnicities that are related to each group s history The Asian American population is greatly urbanized with nearly three quarters of them living in metropolitan areas with population greater than million As of July California had the largest population of Asian Americans of any state and Hawaii was the only state where Asian Americans were the majority of the population br The demographics of Asian Americans can further be subdivided into as listed in alphabetical order br br East Asian Americans including Chinese Americans Hong Kong Americans Japanese Americans Korean Americans Macanese Americans Mongolian Americans Ryukyuan Americans Taiwanese Americans and Tibetan Americans br South Asian Americans including Bangladeshi

Americans including Bruneian Americans Burmese Americans Cambodian Americans Filipino Americans Hmong Americans Indonesian Americans Iu Mien Americans Karen Americans Laotian Americans Malaysian Americans Singaporean Americans Thai Americans Timorese Americans and Vietnamese Americans br This grouping is by country of origin before immigration to the United States and not necessarily by ethnicity as for example nonexclusive Singaporean Americans may be of Chinese Indian or Malay descent br br Asian Americans include multiracial or mixed race persons with origins or ancestry in both the above groups and another race or multiple of the above groups br Asian American alone population distribution over time br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

the United States Other sizable Asian languages are Hindustani Hindi Urdu Tagalog Vietnamese and Korean with all four having more than million speakers in the United States br In Alaska California Hawaii Illinois Massachusetts Michigan Nevada New Jersey New York Texas and Washington were publishing election material in Asian languages in accordance with the Voting Rights Act these languages include Tagalog Mandarin Chinese Vietnamese Spanish Hindi and Bengali Election materials were also available in Gujarati Japanese Khmer Korean and Thai A poll found that percent of Asian Americans considered media in their native language as their primary news source br The census found the more prominent languages of the Asian American community to include the Chinese languages Cantonese Taishanese and Hokkien Tagalog Vietnamese Korean Japanese Hindi Urdu Telugu and Gujarati In the Chinese Japanese Korean Tagalog and Vietnamese languages are all used in elections in Alaska California Hawaii Illinois New York Texas and Washington state br br br Sexuality br According to a Gallup survey conducted from June to September percent of Asian Americans self identify as LGBT compared to of the general American population This makes the Asian American population disproportionately over represented within the LGBT community br In a Gallup survey conducted in percent of Asian Americans identified as LGBT representing the second highest growth of LGBT representation in the United States behind Hispanic Americans br br br Religion br br According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted from July to January the religious landscape of Asian Americans is both diverse and evolving The survey reveals that of Asian Americans are religiously unaffiliated up from in Christianity remains the largest faith group among Asian Americans at although it has seen an decline since br br br Christianity br As of the most recent Pew Research Center survey approximately of Asian American adults identify as Christians a decrease from in This decline is especially notable among Protestants who currently constitute of the Asian American population down from in Catholics on the other hand have maintained a relatively stable presence making up of the Asian American adult population nearly unchanged from in Beyond formal religious identification an additional of Asian Americans report a cultural or familial closeness to Christianity This means that about of Asian Americans express some connection to the Christian faith br Filipino and Korean Americans display particularly strong affiliations with Christianity Among Filipino Americans identify as Christian and when considering those who feel culturally close to Christianity this figure rises to Among Korean Americans identify as Christians and express some connection to the faith Most Filipino Americans are Catholic whereas Korean Americans tend to be Protestant with identifying as evangelical Protestants br br br Unaffiliated br Religious disaffiliation among Asian Americans has been steadily increasing of Asian Americans identify as religiously unaffiliated which encompasses individuals identifying as atheist agnostic or nothing in particular This represents a growth from in The majority of these individuals describe their religion as nothing in particular rather than explicitly identifying as atheist or agnostic Despite a lack of formal religious affiliation a significant number of religiously unaffiliated Asian Americans maintain a connection to various religious or philosophical traditions due to cultural or ancestral reasons In total only of Asian Americans report having no connection to any religious or philosophical tradition br Among Asian Americans Chinese and Japanese Americans are more likely to be religiously unaffiliated with and respectively identifying as such Both groups are also more likely to feel a cultural or ancestral connection to a faith tradition despite their lack of formal religious affiliation Conversely Indian Filipino and Vietnamese Americans are considerably less likely to be religiously unaffiliated and more likely to express some form of connection to a religious tradition br br br Religious trends br The percentage of Christians among Asian Americans has sharply declined since the s chiefly as a result of large scale immigration from countries in which Christianity is a minority religion China and India in particular In of the Asian Americans identified as Christians while in only did This development has been accompanied by a rise in traditional Asian religions with the people identifying with them doubling during the same decade br br br History br br br Early immigration br br Because Asian Americans or their ancestors immigrated to the United States from many different countries each Asian American population has its own unique immigration history br Filipinos have been in the territories that would become the United States since the th century In an East Indian is listed in Jamestown Virginia preceding wider settlement of Indian immigrants on the East Coast in the s and the West Coast in the s In Filipinos established the small settlement of Saint Malo Louisiana after fleeing mistreatment aboard Spanish ships Since there were no Filipino women with them these Manilamen as they were known married Cajun and indigenous women The first Japanese person to come to the United States and stay any significant period of time was Nakahama Manjir who reached the East Coast in and Joseph Heco became the first Japanese American naturalized U S citizen in br Chinese sailors first came to Hawaii in a few years after Captain James Cook came upon the island Many settled and married Hawaiian women Most Chinese Korean and Japanese immigrants in Hawaii or San Francisco arrived in the th century as laborers to work on sugar plantations or construction place There were thousands of Asians in Hawaii when it was annexed to the United States in Later Filipinos also came to work as laborers attracted by the job opportunities although they were limited Ryukyuans would start migrating to Hawaii in br Large scale migration from Asia to the United States began when Chinese immigrants arrived on the West Coast in the mid th century Forming part of the California gold rush these early Chinese immigrants participated intensively in the mining business and later in the construction of the transcontinental railroad By the number of Chinese immigrants in San Francisco had jumped to more than A wave of Japanese immigration to the United States began after the Meiji Restoration in In all Filipinos in the Philippine Islands became American nationals when the United States took over colonial rule of the islands from Spain following the latter s defeat in the Spanish American War br br br Exclusion era br Under United States law during this period particularly the Naturalization Act of only free white persons were eligible to naturalize as American citizens Ineligibility for citizenship prevented Asian immigrants from accessing a variety of rights such as voting Bhicaji Balsara became the first known Indian born person to gain naturalized U S citizenship Balsara s naturalization was not the norm but an exception in a pair of cases Ozawa v United States and United States v Bhagat Singh Thind the Supreme Court upheld the racial qualification for citizenship and ruled that Asians were not white persons Second generation Asian Americans however could become U S citizens due to the birthright citizenship clause of the Fourteenth Amendment this guarantee was confirmed as applying regardless of race or ancestry by the Supreme Court in United States v Wong Kim Ark br From the s to the s the United States passed laws inaugurating an era of exclusion of Asian immigrants Although the exact number of Asian immigrants was small compared to that of immigrants from other regions much of it was concentrated in the West and the increase caused some nativist sentiment which was known as the yellow peril Congress passed restrictive legislation which prohibited nearly all Chinese immigration to the United States in the s Japanese immigration was sharply curtailed by a diplomatic agreement in The Asiatic Barred Zone Act in further barred immigration from nearly all of Asia the Asiatic Zone The Immigration Act of provided that no alien ineligible for citizenship could be admitted as an immigrant to the United States consolidating the prohibition of Asian immigration br br br World War II br President Roosevelt issued Executive Order on February resulting in the internment of Japanese Americans among others Over people of Japanese descent mostly on the West Coast were forcibly removed in an action later considered ineffective and racist Japanese Americans were kept isolated in military camps just because of their race including children old person and young generation Issei The first generation and Children of the camps are two great documentaries to represent the situation of Japanese American s during World War II br br br Postwar immigration br World War II era legislation and judicial rulings gradually increased the ability of Asian Americans to immigrate and become naturalized citizens Immigration rapidly increased following the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of as well as the influx of refugees from conflicts occurring in Southeast Asia such as the Vietnam War Asian American immigrants have a significant percentage of individuals who have already achieved professional status a first among immigration groups br The number of Asian immigrants to the United States grew from in to about million in representing a percent increase Asian Americans were the fastest growing racial group between and By more immigrants came from Asia than from Latin America In Pew Research Center found that from to more immigrants came from Asia than from Latin America and that since Asians have made up a quarter of all immigrants to the United States br Asians have made up an increasing proportion of the foreign born Americans In Asians represented percent of the U S foreign born population by their share grew to percent of the nation s million immigrants As of Asia is the second largest region of birth after Latin America of U S immigrants In China surpassed Mexico as the top single country of origin for immigrants to the U S Asian immigrants are more likely than the overall foreign born population to be naturalized citizens in of Asian immigrants had U S citizenship compared to of all immigrants Postwar Asian immigration to the U S has been diverse in of Asian immigrants to the U S were from East Asia predominantly China and Korea were from South Asia predominantly India were from Southeastern Asia predominantly the Philippines and Vietnam and were from Western Asia br br br Asian American movement br br Prior to the s Asian immigrants and their descendants had organized and agitated for social or political purposes according to their particular ethnicity Chinese Japanese Filipino Korean or Asian Indian The Asian American movement a term coined by the Japanese American Yuji Ichioka and the Chinese American Emma Gee gathered all those groups into a coalition recognizing that they shared common problems with racial discrimination and common opposition to American imperialism particularly in Asia The movement developed during the s inspired in part by the Civil Rights Movement and the protests against the Vietnam War Drawing influences from the Black Power and antiwar movements the Asian American movement forged a coalitional politics that united Asians of varying ethnicities and declared solidarity with other Third World people in the United States and abroad Segments of the movement struggled for community control of education provided social services and defended affordable housing in Asian ghettoes organized exploited workers protested against U S imperialism and built new multiethnic cultural institutions William Wei described the movement as rooted in a past history of oppression and a present struggle for liberation The movement as such was most active during the s and s br Increasingly Asian American students demanded university level research and teaching into Asian history and interaction with the United States They support multiculturalism and support affirmative action but oppose colleges quota on Asian students viewed as discriminatory br br br Notable contributions br br br Arts and entertainment br br Asian Americans have been involved in the entertainment industry since the first half of the th century when Chang and Eng Bunker the original Siamese Twins became naturalized citizens Throughout the th century acting roles in television film and theater were relatively few and many available roles were for narrow stereotypical characters Bruce Lee born in San Francisco CA only achieved movie stardom after leaving the United States for Hong Kong br More recently young Asian American comedians and film makers have found an outlet on YouTube allowing them to gain a strong and loyal fanbase among their fellow Asian Americans There have been several Asian American centric television shows in American media beginning with Mr T and Tina in and as recent as the TV series Fresh Off the Boat in br In the Pacific American beatboxer of Hawaii Chinese descent Jason Tom co founded the Human Beatbox Academy to perpetuate the

discoveries For example the co founders of Yahoo Zoom YouTube and LinkedIn are Asian American contributors Intury In the st century Asian Americans are building connections with other Asian countries such as China Korea Bangladesh and India Another example could be the CEO of Microsoft originally from India Satya Nadella is an example of the contribution of Asian Americans in the technological fields Asian Americans have a vital contribution not only in technology and education but also in political aspects An article by the U S Agricultural Department posted on their website is a great example stating that the birthright citizenship law passed in the U S Supreme Court due to a year long battle between Wong Kim Ark a Chinese immigrant born in San Francisco and the U S Department of

traditions and history of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders the United States government has permanently designated the month of May to be Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month before it was known as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month Asian American parenting as seen through relationships between Chinese parents and adolescence which is described as being more authoritarian and less warm than relations between European parents and adolescence has become a topic of study and discussion These influences affect how parents regulate and monitor their children and has been described as Tiger parenting and has received interest and curiosity from non Chinese parents br br br Health and medicine br br Asian immigrants are also changing the American medical landscape through increasing number of Asian medical practitioners in the United States Beginning in the s and s the U S government invited a number of foreign physicians particularly from India and the Philippines to address the shortage of physicians in rural and medically underserved urban areas The trend in importing foreign medical practitioners however became a long term solution as U S schools failed to produce enough health care providers to match the increasing population Amid decreasing interest in medicine among American college students due to high educational costs and high rates of job dissatisfaction loss of morale stress and lawsuits Asian American immigrants maintained a supply of healthcare practitioners for millions of Americans It is documented that Asian American international medical graduates including highly skilled guest workers using the J Visa program for medical workers tend to serve in health professions shortage areas HPSA and specialties that are not filled by US medical graduates especially primary care and rural medicine In of all the medical personnel in the United States of doctors were Asian Americans of physician assistants were Asian American and more than of nurses were Asian Americans br Nearly one in four Asian Americans are likely to use common alternative medicine This includes traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda Due to the prevalence of usage engaging with Asian American populations through the practitioners of these common alternative medicines can lead to an increase of usage of underused medical procedures br br br Education br br Among America s major racial categories Asian Americans have the highest educational qualifications This varies however for individual ethnic groups For example a study of all Asian American adults found have at least a college degree but only of Vietnamese Americans and only for Laotians and Cambodians It has been noted however that US Census statistics put the bachelor s degree attainment rate of Vietnamese Americans at which is not very different from the rate of for all Americans Census data from show of Asian adults have earned at least a bachelor s degree compared to for all Americans and for non Hispanic whites Taiwanese Americans have some of the highest education rates with nearly having attained at least a bachelor s degree in as of December Asian Americans made up twelve to eighteen percent of the student population at Ivy League schools larger than their share of the population For example the Harvard College Class of admitted students were Asian American br In the years immediately preceding of Asian American adult immigrants have a bachelor or higher level college education br In August the U S Justice Department argued that Yale University discriminated against Asian candidates on the basis of their race a charge the university denied br br br Popular media br Asian American culture is referenced in a number of mainstream forms such as literature TV shows and movies Crazy Rich Asians directed by John M Chu follows Rachel Chu a Chinese American economics professor Min Jin Lee s novel Pachinko is an intergenerational story that tells the story of Koreans who immigrate to Japan Some of the popular Asian American plays are Chickencoop Chinaman And the Soul Shall Dance Paper Angels Yellow fever and many more br br br Identity br As of year a recent survey showed one out of five respondents said they do not identify as Asian to non Asians Most immigrants identify as Asian compared to American born Asian Americans People under the age are more likely not to identify as Asian People over the age of are more likely to identify as Asian br br br Social and political issues br br br Media portrayal br br Because Asian Americans total about of the entire US population diversity within the group is often overlooked in media treatment br br br Bamboo ceiling br br This concept appears to elevate Asian Americans by portraying them as an elite group of successful highly educated intelligent and wealthy individuals but it can also be considered an overly narrow and overly one dimensional portrayal of Asian Americans leaving out other human qualities such as vocal leadership negative emotions risk taking ability to learn from mistakes and desire for creative expression Furthermore Asian Americans who do not fit into the model minority mold can face challenges when people s expectations based on the model minority myth do not match with reality Traits outside of the model minority mold can be seen as negative character flaws for Asian Americans despite those very same traits being positive for the general American majority e g risk taking confidence empowered For this reason Asian Americans encounter a bamboo ceiling the Asian American equivalent of the glass ceiling in the workplace with only of Fortune CEOs being Asians a percentage smaller than their percentage of the total United States population br The bamboo ceiling is defined as a combination of individual cultural and organisational factors that impede Asian Americans career progress inside organizations Since then a variety of sectors including nonprofits universities the government have discussed the impact of the ceiling as it relates to Asians and the challenges they face As described by Anne Fisher the bamboo ceiling refers to the processes and barriers that serve to exclude Asians and American people of Asian descent from executive positions on the basis of subjective factors such as lack of leadership potential and lack of communication skills that cannot actually be explained by job performance or qualifications Articles regarding the subject have been published in Crains Fortune magazine and The Atlantic br br br Illegal immigration br br In there were million Asian Americans and for those awaiting visas there were lengthy backlogs with over Filipinos over Indians over Vietnamese and over Chinese awaiting visas As of Filipinos and Indians accounted for the highest number of alien immigrants for Asian Americans with an estimated illegal population of and respectively Indian Americans are also the fastest growing alien immigrant group in the United States with an increase in illegal immigration of since This is followed by Koreans and Chinese Nonetheless Asian Americans have the highest naturalization rates in the United States In out of a total of applicants became new Americans According to the U S Department of Homeland Security legal permanent residents or green card holders from India Philippines and China were among the top nationals applying for U S naturalization in br Due to the stereotype of Asian Americans being successful as a group and having the lowest crime rates in the United States public attention to illegal immigration is mostly focused on those from Mexico and Latin America while leaving out Asians Asians are the second largest racial ethnic alien immigrant group in the U S behind Hispanics and Latinos While the majority of Asian immigrants immigrate legally to the United States up to of Asian immigrants immigrate without legal documents br br br Race based violence br br Asian Americans have been the targets of violence based on their race and or ethnicity This violence includes but is not limited to such events as the Rock Springs massacre Watsonville Riots Bellingham Riots in against South Asians attacks upon Japanese Americans following the attack on Pearl Harbor and Korean American businesses targeted during the Los Angeles riots Attacks on Chinese in the American frontier were common This included the slaughter of forty to sixty Chinese miners by Paiute Indians in during the Snake War the Los Angeles Chinese massacre of and an attack on Chinese miners at the Chinese Massacre Cove by cowboys in which resulted in deaths In the late s assaults and other hate crimes were committed against South Asians in New Jersey by a group of Latinos who were known as the Dotbusters In the late s the lone death that occurred during the Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting by a white supremacist was a Filipino postal worker On July Patrick Edward Purdy a drifter and former resident of Stockton California wen and opened fire on Cleveland Elementary School students in the playground who were mainly of southeast Asian descent Within minutes he fired dozens of rounds although reports ranged He was armed with two pistols and an AK with a bayonet killing five students and shooting at least others After the shooting spree Purdy killed himself br Even when it did not manifest as violence contempt against Asian Americans was reflected in aspects of popular culture such as the playground chant Chinese Japanese dirty knees br After the September attacks Sikh Americans were targeted becoming the victims of numerous hate crimes including murder Other Asian Americans have also been the victims of race based violence in Brooklyn Philadelphia San Francisco and Bloomington Indiana Furthermore it has been reported that young Asian Americans are more likely to be the targets of violence than their peers In racist graffiti and other property damage was done to a community center in Stockton s Little Manila Racism and discrimination still persist against Asian Americans occurring not only against recent immigrants but also against well educated and highly trained professionals br Recent waves of immigration of Asian Americans to largely African American neighborhoods have led to cases of severe racial tension Acts of large scale violence against Asian American students by their black classmates have been reported in multiple cities In October black students chased and attacked Asian students at South Philadelphia High School and a similar attack on Asian students occurred at the same school one year later prompting a protest by Asian students in response br Asian owned businesses have been a frequent target of tensions between black and Asian Americans During the Los Angeles riots more than Korean owned businesses were looted or burned by groups of African Americans From to a high profile racially motivated boycott of an Asian owned shop in Brooklyn was organized by a local black nationalist activist eventually resulting in the owner being forced to sell his business Another racially motivated boycott against an Asian owned business occurred in Dallas in after an Asian American clerk fatally shot an African American who had robbed his store During the Ferguson unrest in Asian owned businesses were looted and Asian owned stores were looted during the Baltimore protests while African American owned stores were bypassed Violence against Asian Americans continue to occur based on their race with one source asserting that Asian Americans are the fastest growing targets of hate crimes and violence br During the COVID pandemic in the United States concern has grown due to an increase in anti Asian sentiment in the United States In March President Donald Trump called the disease China Virus and Kung Flu based on its origin in response organizations such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice and Western States Center stated that doing so will increase anti Asian sentiment and violence Vox wrote that the Trump Administration s use of the terms China Virus Kung Flu and Wuhan virus would lead to an increase in xenophobia The disease naming controversy occurred at a time when the Chinese Foreign Ministry was claiming that the disease originated in the United States Violent acts relating to the disease against Asian Americans have been documented mostly in New York California and elsewhere As of December there were reports of anti Asian incidents in New York reported to Stop AAPI Hate As of March there have been more than anti Asian racist incidents A notable incident was the Atlanta spa shootings a fatal attack in which six of the eight casualties were of Asian descent The shooter reportedly said I m going to kill all Asians br br br Racial stereotypes br br Until the late th century the term Asian American was mostly adopted by activists while the average person who was of Asian ancestry identified with his or her specific ethnicity The murder of Vincent Chin in was a pivotal civil rights case and it marked the emergence of Asian Americans as a distinct group in United States br Stereotypes of Asians have largely been collectively internalized by society and most of the repercussions of these stereotypes are negative for Asian Americans and Asian immigrants in daily interactions current events and governmental legislation In many instances media portrayals of East Asians often reflect a dominant Americentric perception rather than realistic and authentic depictions of true cultures customs and behaviors Asians have experienced discrimination and have been victims of hate crimes related to their ethnic stereotypes br A study has indicated that most non Asian Americans generally do not differentiate between Asian Americans who are of different ethnicities Stereotypes of Chinese Americans and Asian Americans are nearly identical A survey of Americans attitudes toward Asian Americans and Chinese Americans indicated that of the respondents disapprove of intermarriage with an Asian American second only to African Americans would be uncomfortable supporting an Asian American presidential candidate compared to for an African American for a woman and for a Jew would be upset if a substantial number of Asian Americans moved into their neighborhood had somewhat or very negative attitude toward Chinese Americans in general The study did find several positive perceptions of Chinese Americans strong family values honesty as business people high value on education br There is a widespread perception that Asian Americans are not American but are instead perpetual foreigners Asian Americans often report being asked the question Where are you really from by other Americans regardless of how long they or their ancestors have lived in United States and been a part of its society Many Asian Americans are themselves not immigrants but rather born in the United States Many East Asian Americans are asked if they are Chinese or Japanese an assumption based on major groups of past immigrants br Discrimination against Asians and Asian Americans increased with the COVID pandemic in the United States according to a study done at Washington State University WSU and published in Stigma and Health The NYPD reported a increase in hate crimes motivated by anti Asian sentiment in largely due to the virus origins in Wuhan China br According to a poll done in percent of Americans believe Asian Americans are more loyal to their country of origin than the US while percent falsely believe Asian Americans are at least partially responsible for the COVID pandemic Additionally only percent of Asian Americans believe they completely agree with the statement that they feel they belong and are accepted in the US while percent say they are discriminated in the US br br br Model minority br br Asian Americans are sometimes characterized as a model minority in the United States because many of their cultures encourage a strong work ethic a respect for elders a high degree of professional and academic success a high valuation of family education and religion Statistics such as high household income and low incarceration rate low rates of many diseases and higher than average life expectancy are also discussed as positive aspects of Asian Americans br The implicit advice is that the other minorities should stop protesting and emulate the Asian American work ethic and devotion to higher education Some critics say the depiction replaces biological racism with cultural racism and should be dropped According to The Washington Post the idea that Asian Americans are distinct among minority groups and immune to the challenges faced by other people of color is a particularly sensitive issue for the community which has recently fought to reclaim its place in social justice conversations with movements like ModelMinorityMutiny br The model minority concept can also affect Asians public education By comparison with other minorities Asians often achieve higher test scores and grades compared to other Americans Stereotyping Asian American as over achievers can lead to harm if school officials or peers expect all to perform higher than average The very high educational attainments of Asian Americans has often been noted in for example of Chinese Americans of Japanese Americans and of Korean Americans aged were in college compared to only a third of the whites The disparity at postgraduate levels is even greater and the differential is especially notable in fields making heavy use of mathematics By a plurality of undergraduates at such elite public California schools as UC Berkeley and UCLA which are obligated by law to not consider race as a factor in admission were Asian American The pattern is rooted in the pre World War II era Native born Chinese and Japanese Americans reached educational parity with majority whites in the early decades of the th century One group of writers who discuss the model minority stereotype have taken to attaching the term myth after model minority thus encouraging discourse regarding how the concept and stereotype is harmful to Asian American communities and ethnic groups br The model minority concept can be emotionally damaging to some Asian Americans particularly since they are expected to live up to those peers who fit the stereotype Studies have shown that some Asian Americans suffer from higher rates of stress depression mental illnesses and suicides in comparison to other groups indicating that the pressures to achieve and live up to the model minority image may take a mental and psychological toll on some Asian Americans The American Psychological Association has published a paper relying on data that takes issue with what is said are myths about the suicide rates of Asian Americans br Alongside mental and psychological tolls that the model minority concept has on Asian Americans they are also faced with the repercussions that it has on physical health and the desire for individuals to seek medical care more specifically cancer screening or treatment Asian Americans between the other racial ethnic groups in the United States are the only group with the leading cause of death being cancer while having significantly low rates of cancer screenings Different pressures like alienation if diagnosed or the desire to conform to stereotypes of the image of a healthy lifestyle can deter individuals from seeking cancer screenings or treatment before the onset of symptoms br The model minority stereotype fails to distinguish between different ethnic groups with different histories When divided up by ethnicity it can be seen that the economic and academic successes supposedly enjoyed by Asian Americans are concentrated into a few ethnic groups Cambodians Hmong and Laotians and to a lesser extent Vietnamese all have relatively low achievement rates possibly due to their refugee status and the fact that they are non voluntary immigrants br br br Social and economic disparities br In Asian American earnings were found to exceed all other racial groups when all Asian ethnic groups are grouped as a whole Yet a report from the Census Bureau reported that of Asian Americans were living below the poverty line while of non Hispanic White Americans live below the poverty line A study of wealth inequality within Asian Americans found a greater gap between wealthy and non wealthy Asian Americans compared to non Hispanic white Americans Once country of birth and other demographic factors are taken into account a portion of the sub groups that make up Asian Americans are much more likely than non Hispanic White Americans to live in poverty Healthcare access varies greatly by race and ethnicity in the United States some lifelong diseases and impairments affect Asian Americans more negatively compared to other U S Census recognized racial groups Research shows many health disparities among different racial and ethnic groups in the United States br There are major disparities that exist among Asian Americans when specific ethnic groups are examined For example in Asian Americans had the highest educational attainment level of any racial demographic in the country Yet there are many sub groups of Asian Americans who suffer in terms of education with some sub groups showing a high rate of dropping out of school or lacking a college education This occurs in terms of household income as well in Asian Americans had the highest median household income overall of any racial demographic while there were Asian sub groups who had average median incomes lower than both the U S average and non Hispanic Whites In data released by the United States Census Bureau revealed that five Asian American ethnic groups are in the top ten lowest earning ethnicities in terms of per capita income in all of the United States br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br Bibliography br br br External links br br Asian American
