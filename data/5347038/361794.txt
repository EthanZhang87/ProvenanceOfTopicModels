title: History of Atlanta
id: 361794
The history of Atlanta dates back to when Georgia decided to build a railroad to the U S Midwest and a location was chosen to be the line s terminus The stake marking the founding of Terminus was driven into the ground in called the Zero Mile Post In homes and a store were built there and the settlement grew Between and rail lines arrived from four different directions and the rapidly growing town quickly became the rail hub for the entire Southern United States During the American Civil War Atlanta as a distribution hub became the target of a major Union campaign and in Union William Sherman s troops set on fire and destroyed the city s assets and buildings save churches and hospitals After the war the population grew rapidly as did manufacturing while the city retained its role as a rail hub Coca Cola was launched here in and grew into an Atlanta based world empire Electric streetcars arrived in and the city added new streetcar suburbs br The city s elite black colleges were founded between and and despite disenfranchisement and the later imposition of Jim Crow laws in the s a prosperous black middle class and upper class emerged By the early th century Sweet Auburn Avenue was called the most prosperous Negro street in the nation In the s black people started moving into city neighborhoods that had previously kept them out while Atlanta s first freeways enabled large numbers of whites to move to and commute from new suburbs Atlanta was home to Martin Luther King Jr and a major center for the Civil Rights Movement Resulting desegregation occurred in stages over the s Slums were razed and the new Atlanta Housing Authority built public housing projects br From the mid s to mid s nine suburban malls opened and the downtown shopping district declined but just north of it gleaming office towers and hotels rose and in the new Georgia World Congress Center signaled Atlanta s rise as a major convention city In the city elected its first black mayor Maynard Jackson and in ensuing decades black political leaders worked successfully with the white business community to promote business growth while still empowering black businesses From the mid s to mid s most of the MARTA rapid transit system was built While the suburbs grew rapidly much of the city itself deteriorated and the city lost of its population between and br In Atlanta hosted the Summer Olympics for which new facilities and infrastructure were built Hometown airline Delta continued to grow and by Atlanta s airport was the busiest in the world Since the mid s gentrification has given new life to many of the city s intown neighborhoods The census showed affluent black people leaving the city for newer exurban properties and growing suburban towns younger whites moving back to the city and a much more diverse metropolitan area with heaviest growth in the exurbs at its outer edges br br br Native American civilization before br The region where Atlanta and its suburbs were built was originally Creek and Cherokee Native American territory In the Creeks who had been recruited by the British to assist them in the War of attacked and burned Fort Mims in southwestern Alabama The conflict broadened and became known as the Creek War In response the United States built a string of forts along the Ocmulgee and Chattahoochee Rivers including Fort Daniel on top of Hog Mountain near present day Dacula Georgia and Fort Gilmer br Fort Gilmer was situated next to an important Indian site called Standing Peachtree a Creek Indian village The site traditionally marked a Native American meeting place at the boundary between Creek and Cherokee lands at the point where Peachtree Creek flows into the Chattahoochee The fort was soon renamed Fort Peachtree A road was built linking Fort Peachtree and Fort Daniel following the route of existing trails br As part of the systematic removal of Native Americans from northern Georgia from to the Creek ceded the area that is now metro Atlanta in Four months later the Georgia Land Lottery Act created five new counties in the area that would later become Atlanta Dekalb County was created in from portions of Henry Fayette and Gwinnett Counties and Decatur was created as its county seat the following year As part of the land lottery Archibald Holland received a grant for District Land Lot an area of acres near the present day Coca Cola headquarters Holland farmed the land and operated a blacksmith shop However the land was low lying and wet so his cattle often became mired in the mud He left the area in to farm in Paulding County br In an inn was established that became known as Whitehall due to the then unusual fact that it had a coat of white paint when most other buildings were of washed or natural wood Later Whitehall Street was built as the road from Atlanta to Whitehall The Whitehall area was renamed West End in and is the oldest intact Victorian neighborhood of Atlanta br In some leaders of the Cherokee Nation ceded their territory to the United States without the consent of the majority of the Cherokee people in exchange for land out west under the Treaty of New Echota an act that led to the Trail of Tears br br br From railroad terminus to Atlanta br br In the Georgia General Assembly voted to build the Western and Atlantic Railroad to provide a link between the port of Savannah and the Midwest The initial route of that state sponsored project was to run from Chattanooga Tennessee to a spot east of the Chattahoochee River in present day Fulton County The plan was to eventually link up with the Georgia Railroad from Augusta and with the Macon and Western Railroad which ran between Macon and Savannah A U S Army engineer Colonel Stephen Harriman Long was asked to recommend the location where the Western and Atlantic line would terminate He surveyed various possible routes then in the autumn of drove a stake into the ground between what are now Forsyth Street and Andrew Young International Boulevard about three or four blocks northwest of today s Five Points The zero milepost was later placed to mark that spot br In John Thrasher built homes and a general store in this vicinity and the settlement was nicknamed Thrasherville A marker identifies the location of Thrasherville at Marietta Street NW in front of the State Bar of Georgia Building between Spring and Cone Streets br N W At this point Thrasher built the Monroe Embankment an earthen embankment to carry the Monroe Railway to meet the W A at the terminus This is the oldest existing man made structure in downtown Atlanta br In the planned terminus location was moved four blocks southeast two to three blocks southeast of Five Points to what would become State Square on Wall Street between Central Avenue and Pryor Street N W At this location the zero milepost can now be found adjacent to the southern entrance of Underground Atlanta As the settlement grew it became known as Terminus literally meaning end of the line By the settlement at Terminus had six buildings and residents br Meanwhile settlement began at what became the Buckhead section of Atlanta several miles north of today s downtown In Henry Irby started a tavern and grocery at what became the intersection of Paces Ferry and Roswell Roads br br In when a two story brick depot was built the locals asked that the settlement of Terminus be called Lumpkin after Governor Wilson Lumpkin Gov Lumpkin asked them to name it after his young daughter Martha Atalanta Lumpkin instead and Terminus became Marthasville it was officially incorporated on December In the chief engineer of the Georgia Railroad J Edgar Thomson suggested that Marthasville be renamed Atlantica Pacifica which was quickly shortened to Atlanta Wilson Lumpkin seems to have supported the change reporting that Martha s middle name was Atalanta br The residents approved the name change apparently undaunted by the fact that not a single train had yet visited Act of the Georgia General Assembly enacted the name change which was approved December and signed into law days afterward In the same act the election precinct known as the Whitehall precinct in the home of Charner Humphries was also changed to Atlanta In the city s charter was approved elections were held and the first slate of councilmen and the mayor took office in January br br AN ACT to change the name of Marthasville in DeKalb County to that of Atlanta also to change the election precinct now held at the house of Charner Humphries known as the Whitehall precinct to

freight and passenger trains from Augusta to the east of Atlanta arrived in September and in that year the first hotel the Atlanta Hotel was opened The railroad was the chief stimulus to the town s growth with several lines being added br In a second railroad company the Macon Western orig Monroe Railroad completed tracks to Terminus Atlanta connecting the little settlement with Macon to the south and Savannah to the southeast The town then began to boom In late the Washington Hall hotel was opened By the population had reached In the town elected its first mayor and appointed its first town marshal German M Lester coinciding with the first homicide and the first jail built A new city council approved the building of wooden sidewalks and banned conducting business on Sundays In Atlanta s third and largest antebellum hotel was built the Trout House and the Daily Intelligencer became the town s first successful daily newspaper In Oakland Cemetery was founded southeast of town where it remains today within the city limits br In a third rail line the Western and Atlantic Railroad for which the site of Atlanta had been identified as a terminus finally arrived connecting Atlanta to Chattanooga in the northwest and opening up Georgia to trade with the Tennessee and Ohio River Valleys and the American Midwest The union depot was completed in on State Square That year the depot s architect Edward A Vincent also delivered Atlanta s first official map to the city council br Fulton County was established in from the western section of DeKalb and in a combination Fulton County Court House and Atlanta City Hall was built which would be razed years later to make way for today s State Capitol building After the Civil War the Georgia General Assembly decided to move the state capital from Milledgeville to Atlanta br In a fourth rail line the Atlanta and LaGrange Rail Road later Atlanta West Point Railroad arrived connecting Atlanta with LaGrange Georgia to the southwest sealing Atlanta s role as a rail hub for the entire South with lines to the northwest east southeast and southwest br By the town had grown to residents and had a bank a daily newspaper a factory to build freight cars a new brick depot property taxes a gasworks gas street lights a theater a medical college and juvenile delinquency br br br Manufacturing and commerce br br The first true manufacturing establishment was opened in when Jonathan Norcross who later became mayor of Atlanta arrived in Marthasville and built a sawmill Richard Peters Lemuel Grant and John Mims built a three story flour mill which was used as a pistol factory during the Civil War In Austin Leyden started the town s first foundry and machine shop which was later the Atlanta Machine Works br The Atlanta Rolling Mill later the Confederate Rolling Mill was built in near Oakland Cemetery It soon became the South s second most productive rolling mill During the American Civil War it rolled out cannon iron rail and inch thick mm sheets of iron to clad the CSS Virginia for the Confederate navy The mill was destroyed by the Union Army in br The city became a busy center for cotton distribution As an example in the Georgia Railroad alone sent empty rail cars to the city to be loaded with cotton br By the city had four large machine shops two planing mills three tanneries two shoe factories a soap factory and clothing factories employing people br br br Slavery in antebellum Atlanta br In out of people were enslaved African Americans and were free blacks for a total black population of The black proportion of Atlanta s population became much higher after the Civil War when freed slaves came to Atlanta in search of opportunity br Several slave auction houses were in the town which advertised in the newspapers and many of which also traded in manufactured goods br br br Civil War and Reconstruction br br br Civil War br br During the American Civil War Atlanta served as an important railroad and military supply hub See also Atlanta in the Civil War In the city became the target of a major Union invasion the setting for the film Gone with the Wind The area now covered by Atlanta was the scene of several battles including the Battle of Peachtree Creek the Battle of Atlanta and the Battle of Ezra Church General Sherman cut the last supply line to Atlanta at the Battle of Jonesboro fought on August September br With all of his supply lines cut Confederate General John Bell Hood was forced to abandon Atlanta On the night of September his troops marched out of the city to Lovejoy Georgia General Hood ordered that the rail cars filled with ammunition and other military supplies be destroyed The resulting fire and explosions were heard for miles The next day Mayor James Calhoun surrendered the city and on September Sherman ordered the civilian population to evacuate He then ordered Atlanta burned to the ground on November in preparation for his punitive march south br After a plea by the Bishops of the Episcopal and Catholic churches in Atlanta Sherman did not burn the city s churches or hospitals The remaining war resources were then destroyed in the aftermath in Sherman s March to the Sea The fall of Atlanta was a critical point in the Civil War Its much publicized fall gave confidence to the Northerners Together with the Battle of Mobile Bay the fall of Atlanta led to the re election of Abraham Lincoln and the eventual surrender of the Confederacy br br br Reconstruction br The city emerged from the ashes hence the city s symbol the phoenix and was gradually rebuilt as its population increased rapidly after the war Atlanta received migrants from surrounding counties and states from to Fulton County more than doubled in population from to In a pattern seen across the South after the Civil War many freedmen moved from plantations to towns or cities for work including Atlanta Fulton County went from black in to black in br br br Food supplies were erratic due to poor harvests which were a result of the turmoil in the agricultural labor supply after emancipation of the slaves Many refugees were destitute without even proper clothing or shoes the AMA helped fill the gap with food shelter and clothing and the federally sponsored Freedmen s Bureau also offered much help though erratically br The destruction of the housing stock by the Union army together with the massive influx of refugees resulted in a severe housing shortage Some acre m to acre m lots with a small house rented for per month while those with a glass pane rented for High rents rather than laws led to de facto segregation with most black people settling in three shantytown areas at the city s edge There housing was substandard an AMA missionary remarked that many houses were rickety shacks rented at inflated rates Two of the three shantytowns sat in low lying areas prone to flooding and sewage overflows which resulted in outbreaks of disease in the late th century A shantytown named Tight Squeeze developed at Peachtree at what is now th Street in Midtown Atlanta It was infamous for vagrancy desperation and robberies of merchants transiting the settlement br A smallpox epidemic hit Atlanta in December with few doctors or hospital facilities to help Another epidemic hit in fall hundreds died br Construction created many new jobs and employment boomed Atlanta soon became the industrial and commercial center of the South From until U S Army soldiers occupied McPherson Barracks later renamed Fort McPherson in southwest Atlanta to ensure Reconstruction era reforms In Atlanta became the Georgia state capital taking over from Milledgeville br br br Center of black education br Atlanta quickly became a center of black education Atlanta University was established in the forerunner of Morehouse College in Clark University in Spelman College in and Morris Brown College in This was one of several factors aiding the establishment of one of the nation s oldest and best established African American elite in Atlanta br br br Gate City of the New South br br br The New South br Henry W Grady the editor of the Atlanta Constitution promoted the city to investors as a city of the New South by which he meant a diversification of the economy away from agriculture and a shift from the Old South attitudes of slavery and rebellion As part of the effort to modernize the South Grady and many others also supported the creation of the Georgia School of Technology now the Georgia Institute of Technology which was founded on the city s northern outskirts in With Grady s support the Confederate Soldiers Home was built in br br In Sister Cecilia Carroll RSM and three companions traveled from Savannah Georgia to Atlanta to minister to the sick With just cents in their collective purse the sisters opened the Atlanta Hospital the first medical facility in the city after the Civil War This later became known as Saint Joseph s Hospital br br br Expansion and the first planned suburbs br br Starting in horse drawn and later starting in electric streetcars fueled real estate development and the city s expansion Washington Street south of downtown and Peachtree Street north of the central business district became wealthy residential areas br In the s West End became the suburb of choice for the city s elite but Inman Park planned as a harmonious whole soon overtook it in prestige Peachtree Street s mansions reached ever further north into what is now Midtown Atlanta including Amos G Rhodes founder of the Rhodes Furniture Company in mansion Rhodes Hall which can still be visited br Atlanta surpassed Savannah as Georgia s largest city by br br br Disenfranchisement of black people br br As Atlanta grew ethnic and racial tensions mounted Late th and early th century immigration added a very small number of new Europeans to the mix After Reconstruction whites had used a variety of tactics including militias and legislation to re establish political and social supremacy throughout the South Starting with a poll tax in by the turn of the century Georgia passed a variety of legislation that completed the disfranchisement of black people Not even college educated men could vote Nonetheless African Americans in Atlanta had been developing their own businesses institutions churches and a strong educated middle class Meanwhile the nd Ku Klux Klan era headed by William J Simmons and the rd Ku Klux Klan era present headed by Dr Samuel Green both started off in Atlanta br br br Coca Cola br The identities of Atlanta and Coca Cola have been intertwined since when John Pemberton developed the soft drink in response to Atlanta and Fulton County going dry The first sales were at Jacob s Pharmacy in Atlanta Asa Griggs Candler acquired a stake in Pemberton s company in and incorporated it as the Coca Cola Company in In Candler incorporated a second company The Coca Cola Company the current corporation By the time of its th anniversary the drink had reached the status of a national icon in the USA Coca Cola s world headquarters have remained in Atlanta ever since In the company opened the World of Coca Cola which has remained one of the city s top visitor attractions br br br Cotton States Expo and Booker T Washington speech br In the Cotton States and International Exposition was held at what is now Piedmont Park Nearly visitors attended the event The exposition was designed to promote the region to the world and showcase products and new technologies as well as to encourage trade with Latin America The exposition featured exhibits from several states including various innovations in agriculture and technology President Grover Cleveland presided over the opening of the exposition but the event is best remembered for the both hailed and criticized Atlanta Compromise speech given by Booker T Washington in which Southern black people would work meekly and submit to white political rule while Southern whites guaranteed that black people would receive basic education and due process in law br br br Streetcar suburbs and World War II br br br race riot br br Competition between working class whites and black for jobs and housing gave rise to fears and tensions In print media fueled these tensions with hearsay about alleged sexual assaults on white women by Black men triggering the Atlanta race riot which left at least people dead of them black and over injured Many Black businesses were destroyed br br br Rise of Sweet Auburn br Black businesses started to move from the previously integrated business district downtown to the relative safety of the area around the Atlanta University Center west of downtown and to Auburn Avenue in the Fourth Ward east of downtown Sweet Auburn Avenue became home to Alonzo Herndon s Atlanta Mutual the city s first black owned life insurance company and to a celebrated concentration of black businesses newspapers churches and nightclubs In Fortune magazine called Sweet Auburn the richest Negro street in the world a phrase originally coined by civil rights leader John Wesley Dobbs Sweet Auburn and Atlanta s elite black colleges formed the nexus of a prosperous black middle class and upper class which arose despite enormous social and legal obstacles br br br Jim Crow laws br br Jim Crow laws were passed in swift succession in the years after the riot The result was in some cases segregated facilities with nearly always inferior conditions for black customers In many cases it resulted in no facilities at all available to black people e g all parks were designated whites only although a private park Joyland opened in In the city council passed an ordinance requiring that restaurants be designated for one race only hobbling black restaurant owners who had been attracting both black and white customers br In the same year Atlanta s streetcars were segregated with black patrons required to sit in the rear If not enough seats were available for all white riders the black people sitting furthest forward in the trolley were required to stand and give their seats to whites In the city created official boundaries for white and black residential areas In the city prohibited black owned salons from serving white women and children br Beyond this black people were subject to the South s racial protocol whereby according to the New Georgia Encyclopedia br br A ll blacks were required to pay obeisance to all whites even those whites of low social standing And although they were required to address whites by the title sir blacks rarely received the same courtesy themselves Because even minor breaches of racial etiquette often resulted in violent reprisals the region s codes of deference transformed daily life into a theater of ritual where every encounter exchange and gesture reinforced black inferiority br In Leo Frank a Jewish supervisor at a factory in Atlanta was put on trial for raping and murdering a year old white employee from Marietta a suburb of Atlanta After doubts about Frank s guilt led his death sentence to be commuted in riots broke out in Atlanta among whites They kidnapped Frank from the State Prison Farm in the city of Milledgeville with the collusion of prison guards and took him to Marietta where he was lynched Later that year the Klan was reborn in Atlanta br br br Country music scene br br Many Appalachian people came to Atlanta to work in the cotton mills and brought their music with them Starting with a fiddler s

the summer of approximately Atlanta business leaders American Legion members and members of law enforcement founded the American Fascisti Association and Order of the Black Shirts with the goal to foster the principles of white supremacy br In the city began to deny the Black Shirts permits for parades and charters In Angelo Herndon was arrested and charged under the insurrection statute for being in possession of communist literature Herndon s defense team including attorney Benjamin J Davis Jr countered that by systemically excluding Black Americans from the jury pool the criminal justice system was violating Herndon s civil rights making the verdict invalid The defense team appealed the decision to the Supreme Court twice and secured a decision against the insurrection statute in br br br Gone with the Wind premiere br On December Atlanta hosted the premiere of Gone with the Wind the movie based on Atlanta resident Margaret Mitchell s best selling novel Stars Clark Gable Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland were in attendance The premiere was held at Loew s Grand Theatre at Peachtree and Forsyth Streets current site of the Georgia Pacific building An enormous crowd

Atlanta Delta became the world s largest airline in after acquiring Northwest Airlines br br br World War II br With the entry of the United States into World War II soldiers from around the Southeastern United States went through Atlanta to train and later be discharged at Fort McPherson War related manufacturing such as the Bell Aircraft factory in the suburb of Marietta helped boost the city s population and economy Shortly after the war in the Communicable Disease Center later called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was founded in Atlanta from the old Malaria Control in War Areas offices and staff br br br Suburbanization and Civil Rights br br In the city received the All America City Award due to its rapid growth and high standard of living in the southern U S br Annexation was the central strategy for growth In Atlanta annexed Buckhead as well as vast areas of what are now northwest southwest and south Atlanta adding square miles km and tripling its area By doing so new affluent white residents were added preserving white political power expanding the city s property tax base and enlarging the traditional white upper middle class leadership This class now had room to expand inside the city limits br Federal court decisions in and ended the county unit system thus greatly reducing rural Georgia control over the state legislature enabling Atlanta and other cities to gain proportional political power The federal courts opened the Democratic Party primary to black voters who surged in numbers and became increasingly well organized through the Atlanta Negro Voters League br br br Blockbusting and racial transition in neighborhoods br In the late s after forced housing patterns were outlawed violence intimidation and organized political pressure were used in some white neighborhoods to discourage black people from buying homes there However by the late s such efforts proved futile as blockbusting drove whites to sell their homes in neighborhoods such as Adamsville Center Hill Grove Park in northwest Atlanta and white sections of Edgewood and Kirkwood on the east side In the city attempted to thwart blockbusting by erecting road barriers in Cascade Heights countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster Atlanta as the city too busy to hate br Efforts to stop transition in Cascade failed too Neighborhoods of new black homeowners took root helping alleviate the enormous strain of the lack of housing available to African Americans Atlanta s western and southern neighborhoods transitioned to majority black between and the number of census tracts that were at least black tripled East Lake Kirkwood Watts Road Reynoldstown Almond Park Mozley Park Center Hill and Cascade Heights underwent an almost total transition from white to black The black proportion of the city s population rose from to Meanwhile during the same decade the city lost white residents a decline br White flight and the building of malls in the suburbs triggered a slow decline of the central business district Meanwhile conservatism grew rapidly in the suburbs and white Georgians were increasingly willing to vote for Republicans most notably Newt Gingrich br br br Civil Rights Movement br br In the wake of the landmark U S Supreme Court decision Brown v Board of Education which helped usher in the Civil Rights Movement racial tensions in Atlanta erupted in acts of violence One such instance occurred on October when a Reform Jewish temple on Peachtree Street was bombed A group of white supremacists calling themselves the Confederate Underground claimed responsibility The temple s leader Rabbi Jacob Rothschild actively spoke out in support of the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement and against segregation which is likely why the congregation was targeted br br In January Bobby Grier became the first black player to participate in the Sugar Bowl He is also regarded as the first black player to compete at a bowl game in the Deep South though others such as Wallace Triplett had played in games like the Cotton Bowl in Dallas Grier s team the Pittsburgh Panthers was set to play against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets However Georgia s Governor Marvin Griffin beseeched Georgia Tech s president Blake Van Leer and its players to not participate in this racially integrated game Griffin was widely criticized by news media leading up to the game and protests were held at his mansion by Georgia Tech students After delivering a commencement speech at the all Black Morris Brown College Van Leer was summoned by the board of regents where he was quoted Either we re going to the Sugar Bowl or you can find yourself another damn president of Georgia Tech Despite the governor s objections Georgia Tech upheld the contract and proceeded to compete in the bowl In the game s first quarter a pass interference call against Grier ultimately resulted in Yellow Jackets victory Grier stated that he has mostly positive memories about the experience including the support from teammates and letters from all over the world br In the s Atlanta was a major organizing center of the Civil Rights Movement with Martin Luther King Jr and students from Atlanta s historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movement s leadership On October a sit in at the lunch counters of several Atlanta department stores led to the arrest of Dr King and several students This drew attention from the national media and from presidential candidate John F Kennedy br Despite this incident Atlanta s political and business leaders fostered Atlanta s image as the city too busy to hate While the city mostly avoided confrontation minor race riots did occur in and br br br Desegregation br Desegregation of the public sphere came in stages with buses and trolleybuses desegregated in restaurants at Rich s department store in though Lester Maddox s Pickrick restaurant famously remained segregated through and movie theaters in While in Mayor Ivan Allen Jr became one of the few Southern white mayors to support desegregation of his city s public schools initial compliance was token and in reality desegregation occurred in stages from to br br br air crash and influence on art scene br br In Atlanta in general and its arts community in particular were shaken by the deaths of people on Air France charter flight which crashed The Atlanta Art Association had sponsored a month long tour of the art treasures of Europe of the tour members were heading home to Atlanta on the flight The group included many of Atlanta s cultural and civic leaders Atlanta mayor Ivan Allen Jr went to Orly France to inspect the crash site where so many important Atlantans perished The loss was a catalyst for the arts in Atlanta and helped create the Woodruff Arts Center originally called the Memorial Arts Center as a tribute to the victims and led to the creation of the Atlanta Arts Alliance The French government donated a Rodin sculpture The Shade to the High in memory of the victims of the crash br The crash occurred during the Civil Rights Movement and affected it as well Martin Luther King Jr and Harry Belafonte announced cancellation of a sit in in downtown Atlanta as a conciliatory gesture to the grieving city while Nation of Islam leader Malcolm X gained widespread national attention for the first time by expressing joy over the deaths of the all white group br br br Freeway construction and revolts br Atlanta s freeway system was completed in the s and s with the Perimeter completed in Historic neighborhoods such as Washington Rawson and Copenhill were damaged or destroyed in the process Additional proposed freeways were never built due to the protests of city residents The opposition lasted three decades with then governor Jimmy Carter playing a key role in stopping I through Morningside and Virginia Highland to Inman Park in but pushing hard in the s for a Presidential Parkway between downtown the new Carter Center and Druid Hills Emory br br br Urban renewal br In the s slums such as Buttermilk Bottom near today s Civic Center were razed in principle to build better housing but much of the land remained empty until the s when mixed income communities were built in what was renamed Bedford Pine The African American community east of downtown suffered as the center of the black economy moved squarely to southwestern Atlanta During the s African American citizens rights groups such as U Rescue emerged to address the lack of housing for poor black people br br br Shoppers move to new malls as Downtown gains new roles br br The first major mall built in Atlanta was Lenox Square in Buckhead opening in August From until nine major malls opened most at the Perimeter freeway Cobb Center in Columbia Mall in North DeKalb and Greenbriar malls in South DeKalb Mall in Phipps Plaza near Lenox Square in Perimeter and Northlake malls in and Cumberland Mall in Downtown Atlanta became less and less a shopping destination for the area s shoppers Rich s closed its flagship store downtown in leaving government offices the major presence in the South Downtown area around it br On the north side of Five Points Downtown continued as the largest concentration of office space in Metro Atlanta though it began to compete with Midtown Buckhead and the suburbs The first four towers of Peachtree Center were built in including the Hyatt Regency Atlanta designed by John Portman with its story atrium In total buildings of more than n floors were built in the s The center of gravity of Downtown Atlanta correspondingly moved north from the Five Points area towards Peachtree Center br Atlanta s convention and hotel facilities also grew immensely John C Portman Jr designed and opened what is now the AmericasMart merchandise mart in the Sheraton Atlanta the city s first convention hotel was built in the s the Atlanta Hilton opened in as did two Portman designed hotels the Peachtree Plaza Hotel now owned by Westin in and the Marriott in The Omni Coliseum opened in as did the Georgia World Congress

comprised of the city s population African Americans became a majority in the city by and exercised new found political influence by electing Atlanta s first black mayor Maynard Jackson in In the Board of Aldermen was officially overhauled into the Atlanta City Council br During Jackson s first term as mayor much progress was made in improving race relations in and around Atlanta and Atlanta

existing bus only Atlanta Transit Company br Construction began on the new rail system in Service started in June running east west from Georgia State University downtown to Avondale The Five Points downtown hub opened later that year A short north south line opened in which by had been extended to reach from Brookhaven to Lakewood Fort McPherson In the line was extended to a station inside the airport terminal A line originally envisioned to run to Emory University is still under consideration br br br Child murders br br Atlanta was rocked by a series of murders of children from the summer of until the spring of Over the two year period at least children and adults were killed all of them black Atlanta native Wayne Williams also black and years old at the time of the last murder was convicted of two of the murders and sent to prison for life The rest of the crimes remain unsolved today br br br Mayor Andrew Young br In after being urged by a number of people including Coretta
