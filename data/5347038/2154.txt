African Americans also known as Black Americans or Afro Americans are an ethnic group consisting of Americans with partial or total ancestry from any of the Black racial groups of Africa African Americans constitute the third largest racial or ethnic group in the U S after White Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans The term African American generally denotes descendants of Africans enslaved in the United States br Most African Americans are descendants of enslaved people within the boundaries of the present United States While some Black immigrants or their children may also come to identify as African American the majority of first generation immigrants do not preferring to identify with their nation of origin Most African Americans are of West African and coastal Central African ancestry with varying amounts of Western European and Native American ancestry br African American history began in the th century with Africans from West Africa and coastal Central Africa being sold to European slave traders and transported across the Atlantic to the Western Hemisphere After arriving in the Americas they were sold as slaves to European colonists and put to work on plantations particularly in the southern colonies A few were able to achieve freedom through manumission or escape and founded independent communities before and during the American Revolution After the United States was founded in most Black people continued to be enslaved being most concentrated in the American South with four million enslaved only liberated during and at the end of the Civil War in During Reconstruction they gained citizenship and adult males the right to vote due to the widespread policy and ideology of White supremacy they were largely treated as second class citizens and found themselves soon disenfranchised in the South These circumstances changed due to participation in the military conflicts of the United States substantial migration out of the South the elimination of legal racial segregation and the civil rights movement which sought political and social freedom However racism against African Americans and racial socioeconomic disparity remains a problem into the st century In Barack Obama became the first and so far only African American to be elected president of the United States br African American culture has had a significant influence on worldwide culture making numerous contributions to visual arts literature the English language philosophy politics cuisine sports and music The African American contributions to popular music is so profound that most American music including jazz gospel blues rock and roll funk disco hip hop R B trap and soul has its origins either partially or entirely in the African American community br br br History br br br Colonial era br br The vast majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were people from several Central and West Africa ethnic groups who had been captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids or sold by other West Africans or by half European merchant princes to European slave traders who brought them to the Americas br The first African slaves arrived via Santo Domingo to the San Miguel de Gualdape colony most likely located in the Winyah Bay area of present day South Carolina founded by Spanish explorer Lucas V zquez de Ayll n in The ill fated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership during which the slaves revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local Native Americans De Ayll n and many of the colonists died shortly afterward of an epidemic and the colony was abandoned The settlers and the slaves who had not escaped returned to Haiti whence they had come br The marriage between Luisa de Abrego a free Black domestic servant from Seville and Miguel Rodr guez a White Segovian conquistador in in St Augustine Spanish Florida is the first known and recorded Christian marriage anywhere in what is now the continental United States br br The first recorded Africans in English America including most of the future United States were and odd negroes who came to Jamestown Virginia via Cape Comfort in August as indentured servants As many Virginian settlers began to die from harsh conditions more and more Africans were brought to work as laborers br An indentured servant who could be White or Black would work for several years usually four to seven without wages The status of indentured servants in early Virginia and Maryland was similar to slavery Servants could be bought sold or leased and they could be physically beaten for disobedience or running away Unlike slaves they were freed after their term of service expired or was bought out their children did not inherit their status and on their release from contract they received a year s provision of corn double apparel tools necessary and a small cash payment called freedom dues Africans could legally raise crops and cattle to purchase their freedom They raised families married other Africans and sometimes intermarried with Native Americans or European settlers br br By the s and s several African families owned farms around Jamestown and some became wealthy by colonial standards and purchased indentured servants of their own In the Virginia General Court recorded the earliest documentation of lifetime slavery when they sentenced John Punch a Negro to lifetime servitude under his master Hugh Gwyn for running away br In the Spanish Florida some Spanish married or had unions with Pensacola Creek or African women both slave and free and their descendants created a mixed race population of mestizos and mulattos The Spanish encouraged slaves from the colony of Georgia to come to Florida as a refuge promising freedom in exchange for conversion to Catholicism King Charles II issued a royal proclamation freeing all slaves who fled to Spanish Florida and accepted conversion and baptism Most went to the area around St Augustine but escaped slaves also reached Pensacola St Augustine had mustered an all Black militia unit defending Spanish Florida as early as br br One of the Dutch African arrivals Anthony Johnson would later own one of the first Black slaves John Casor resulting from the court ruling of a civil case br The popular conception of a race based slave system did not fully develop until the th century The Dutch West India Company introduced slavery in with the importation of eleven Black slaves into New Amsterdam present day New York City All the colony s slaves however were freed upon its surrender to the English br Massachusetts was the first English colony to legally recognize slavery in In Virginia passed a law that children of enslaved women took the status of the mother rather than that of the father as under common law This legal principle was called partus sequitur ventrum br By an act of Virginia ordered all free Blacks deported virtually defining as slaves all people of African descent who remained in the colony In the colonial assembly passed a law prohibiting free and baptized Blacks and Native Americans from purchasing Christians in this act meaning White Europeans but allowing them to buy people of their owne nation br br In the Spanish Louisiana although there was no movement toward abolition of the African slave trade Spanish rule introduced a new law called coartaci n which allowed slaves to buy their freedom and that of others Although some did not have the money to buy their freedom government measures on slavery allowed many free Blacks That brought problems to the Spaniards with the French Creoles who also populated Spanish Louisiana French creoles cited that measure as one of the system s worst elements br First established in South Carolina in groups of armed White men slave patrols were formed to monitor enslaved Black people Their function was to police slaves especially fugitives Slave owners feared that slaves might organize revolts or slave rebellions so state militias were formed in order to provide a military command structure and discipline within the slave patrols so they could be used to detect encounter and crush any organized slave meetings which might lead to revolts or rebellions br The earliest African American congregations and churches were organized before in both northern and southern cities following the Great Awakening By Africans made up of the population in the American colonies which made them the second largest ethnic group after English Americans br br br From the American Revolution to the Civil War br br During the s Africans both enslaved and free helped rebellious American colonists secure their independence by defeating the British in the American Revolutionary War Blacks played a role in both sides in the American Revolution Activists in the Patriot cause included James Armistead Prince Whipple and Oliver Cromwell Around Black Loyalists left with the British after the war most of them ending up as free Black people in England or its colonies such as the Black Nova Scotians and the Sierra Leone Creole people br In the Spanish Louisiana Governor Bernardo de G lvez organized Spanish free Black men into two militia companies to defend New Orleans during the American Revolution They fought in the battle in which Spain captured Baton Rouge from the British G lvez also commanded them in campaigns against the British outposts in Mobile Alabama and Pensacola Florida He recruited slaves for the militia by pledging to free anyone who was seriously wounded and promised to secure a low price for coartaci n buy their freedom and that of others for those who received lesser wounds During the s Governor Francisco Luis H ctor baron of Carondelet reinforced local fortifications and recruit even more free Black men for the militia Carondelet doubled the number of free Black men who served creating two more militia companies one made up of Black members and the other of pardo mixed race Serving in the militia brought free Black men one step closer to equality with Whites allowing them for example the right to carry arms and boosting their earning power However actually these privileges distanced free Black men from enslaved Blacks and encouraged them to identify with Whites br Slavery had been tacitly enshrined in the U S Constitution through provisions such as Article I Section Clause commonly known as the compromise Because of Section Clause Congress was unable to pass an Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves until Fugitive slave laws derived from the Fugitive Slave Clause of the Constitution Article IV Section Clause were passed by Congress in and guaranteeing the right for a slaveholder to recover an escaped slave within the U S Slave owners who viewed slaves as property made it a federal crime to assist those who had escaped slavery or to interfere with their capture Slavery which by then meant almost exclusively Black people was the most important political issue in the Antebellum United States leading to one crisis after another Among these were the Missouri Compromise the Compromise of the Dred Scott decision and John Brown s raid on Harpers Ferry br br Prior to the Civil War eight serving presidents owned slaves a practice protected by the U S Constitution By there were to million enslaved Black people in the U S due to the Atlantic slave trade and another Blacks lived free with legislated limits across the country With legislated limits imposed upon them in addition to unconquerable prejudice from Whites according to Henry Clay some Black people who were not enslaved left the U S for Liberia in West Africa Liberia began as a settlement of the American Colonization Society ACS in with the abolitionist members of the ACS believing Blacks would face better chances for freedom and equality in Africa br The slaves not only constituted a large investment they produced America s most valuable product and export cotton They helped build the United States Capitol the White House and other Washington D C based buildings Similar building projects existed in the slave states br br By the domestic slave trade had become a major economic activity in the United States it lasted until the s Historians estimate nearly one million in total took part in the forced migration of this new Middle Passage The historian Ira Berlin called this forced migration of slaves the central event in the life of a slave between the American Revolution and the Civil War writing that whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved the massive deportation traumatized black people Individuals lost their connection to families and clans and many ethnic Africans lost their knowledge of varying tribal origins in Africa br The photograph of Wilson Chinn a branded slave from Louisiana like the one of Gordon and his scarred back served as two early examples of how the newborn medium of photography could encapsulate the cruelty of slavery br br Emigration of free Blacks to their continent of origin had been proposed since the Revolutionary war After Haiti became independent it tried to recruit African Americans to migrate there after it re established trade relations with the United States The Haitian Union was a group formed to promote relations between the countries After riots against Blacks in Cincinnati its Black community sponsored founding of the Wilberforce Colony an initially successful settlement of African American immigrants to Canada The colony was one of the first such independent political entities It lasted for a number of decades and provided a destination for about Black families emigrating from a number of locations in the United States br In during the American Civil War President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation The proclamation declared that all slaves in Confederate held territory were free Advancing Union troops enforced the proclamation with Texas being the last state to be emancipated in br br Slavery in a few border states continued until the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in December While the Naturalization Act of limited U S citizenship to Whites only the th Amendment gave Black people citizenship and the th Amendment gave Black men the right to vote br br br Reconstruction era and Jim Crow br br African Americans quickly set up congregations for themselves as well as schools and community civic associations to have space away from White control or oversight While the post war Reconstruction era was initially a time of progress for African Americans that period ended in By the late s Southern states enacted Jim Crow laws to enforce racial segregation and disenfranchisement Segregation was now imposed with Jim Crow laws using signs used to show Blacks where they could legally walk talk drink rest or eat For those places that were racially mixed non Whites had to wait until all White customers were dealt with Most African Americans obeyed the Jim Crow laws to avoid racially motivated violence To maintain self esteem and dignity African Americans such as Anthony Overton and Mary McLeod Bethune continued to build their own schools churches banks social clubs and other businesses br In the last decade of the th century racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at African Americans began to mushroom in the United States a period often referred to as the nadir of American race relations These discriminatory acts included racial segregation upheld by the United States Supreme Court decision in Plessy v Ferguson in which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the local level of government voter suppression or disenfranchisement in the southern states denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities br br br Great migration and civil rights movement br br The desperate conditions of African Americans in the South sparked the Great Migration during the first half of the th century which led to a growing African American community in Northern and Western United States The rapid influx of Blacks disturbed the racial balance within Northern and Western cities exacerbating hostility between both Blacks and Whites in the two regions The Red Summer of was marked by hundreds of deaths and higher casualties across the U S as a result of race riots that occurred in more than three dozen cities such as the Chicago race riot of and the Omaha race riot of Overall Blacks in Northern and Western cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life Within employment economic opportunities for Blacks were routed to the lowest status and restrictive in potential mobility At the Hampton Negro Conference Reverend Matthew Anderson said the lines along most of the avenues of wage earning are more rigidly drawn in the North than in the South Within the housing market stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx resulting in a mix of targeted violence restrictive covenants redlining and racial steering While many Whites defended their space with violence intimidation or legal tactics toward African Americans many other Whites migrated to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions a process known as White flight br br Despite discrimination drawing cards for leaving the hopelessness in the South were the growth of African American institutions and communities in Northern cities Institutions included Black oriented organizations e g Urban League NAACP churches businesses and newspapers as well as successes in the development in African American intellectual culture music and popular culture e g Harlem Renaissance Chicago Black Renaissance The Cotton Club in Harlem was a Whites only establishment with Blacks such as Duke Ellington allowed to perform but to a White audience Black Americans also found a new ground for political power in Northern cities without the enforced disabilities of Jim Crow br By the s the civil rights movement was gaining momentum A lynching that sparked public outrage about injustice was that of Emmett Till a year old boy from Chicago Spending the summer with relatives in Money Mississippi Till was killed for allegedly having wolf whistled at a White woman Till had been badly beaten one of his eyes was gouged out and he was shot in the head The visceral response to his mother s decision to have an open casket funeral mobilized the Black community throughout the U S Vann R Newkirk wrote the trial of his killers became a pageant illuminating the tyranny of White supremacy The state of Mississippi tried two defendants but they were speedily acquitted by an all White jury One hundred days after Emmett Till s murder Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus in Alabama indeed Parks told Emmett s mother Mamie Till that the photograph of Emmett s disfigured face in the casket was set in her mind when she refused to give up her seat on the Montgomery bus br br The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on presidents John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson Johnson put his support behind passage of the Civil Rights Act of that banned discrimination in public accommodations employment and labor unions and the Voting Rights Act of which expanded federal authority over states to ensure Black political participation through protection of voter registration and elections By the emergence of the Black Power movement which lasted from to expanded upon the aims of the civil rights movement to include economic and political self sufficiency and freedom from White authority br During the post war period many African Americans continued to be economically disadvantaged relative to other Americans Average Black income stood at percent of that of White workers in and percent in In median family income for Whites was equivalent to in compared with equivalent to in for non White families In percent of all Black families fell into the poverty bracket earning under equivalent to in a year The s saw improvements in the social and economic conditions of many Black Americans br From to Black family income rose from to percent of White family income In percent of Black families earned under equivalent to in a year compared with percent in In percent of Black Americans had incomes equal to the national median a proportion that rose to percent by In the median level of education for Blacks had been years and by the late s the figure rose to years half a year behind the median for Whites br br br Post civil rights era br br Politically and economically African Americans have made substantial strides during the post civil rights era In Thurgood Marshall became the first African American Supreme Court Justice In Shirley Chisholm became the first Black woman elected to the U S Congress In Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected governor in U S history Clarence Thomas succeeded Marshall to become the second African American Supreme Court Justice in In Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois became the first African American woman elected to the U S Senate There were Black officeholders in the United States in showing a net increase of since In there were Black mayors br In the number of Africans immigrating to the United States in a single year surpassed the peak number who were involuntarily brought to the United States during the Atlantic Slave Trade On November Democratic Senator Barack Obama defeated Republican Senator John McCain to become the first African American to be elected president At least percent of African American voters voted for Obama He also received overwhelming support from young and educated Whites a majority of Asians and Hispanics picking up a number of new states in the Democratic electoral column Obama lost the overall White vote although he won a larger proportion of White votes than any previous non incumbent Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter Obama was reelected for a second and final term by a similar margin on November In Kamala Harris became the first woman the first African American and the first Asian American to serve as Vice President of the United States In June Juneteenth a day which commemorates the end of slavery in the US became a federal holiday br br br Demographics br br In when the first U S census was taken Africans including slaves and free people numbered about about of the population In at the start of the Civil War the African American population had increased to million but the percentage rate dropped to of the overall population of the country The vast majority were slaves with only counted as freemen By the Black population had doubled and reached million br In about of African Americans lived in the South Large numbers began migrating north looking for better job opportunities and living conditions and to escape Jim Crow laws and racial violence The Great Migration as it was called spanned the s to the s From through the s more than million Black people moved north But in the s and s that trend reversed with more African Americans moving south to the Sun Belt than leaving it br The following table of the African American population in the United States over time shows that the African American population as a percentage of the total population declined until and has been rising since then br br By the African American population reached about million and represented of the U S population roughly the same proportion as in br At the time of the U S census of African Americans lived in the South In that year of African Americans lived in the Northeast and in the Midwest while only lived in the Western states The west does have a sizable Black population in certain areas however California the nation s most populous state has the fifth largest African American population only behind New York Texas Georgia and Florida According to the Census approximately of African Americans identified as Hispanic or Latino in origin many of whom may be of Brazilian Puerto Rican Dominican Cuban Haitian or other Latin American descent The only self reported ancestral groups larger than African Americans are the Irish and Germans br br According to the census nearly of people who self identified as Black had recent ancestors who immigrated from another country Self reported non Hispanic Black immigrants from the Caribbean mostly from Jamaica and Haiti represented of the U S population at million Self reported Black immigrants from sub Saharan Africa also represented at about million Additionally self identified Black Hispanics represented of the United States population at about million people largely found within the Puerto Rican and Dominican communities Self reported Black immigrants hailing from other countries in the Americas such as Brazil and Canada as well as several European countries represented less than of the population Mixed race Hispanic and non Hispanic Americans who identified as being part Black represented of the population Of the of United States residents who identified as Black around were native Black American or ethnic African Americans who are direct descendants of West Central Africans brought to the U S as slaves These individuals make up well over of all Blacks in the country When including people of mixed race origin about of the U S population self identified as Black or mixed with Black However according to the U S Census Bureau evidence from the census indicates that many African and Caribbean immigrant ethnic groups do not identify as Black African Am or Negro Instead they wrote in their own respective ethnic groups in the Some Other Race write in entry As a result the census bureau devised a new separate African American ethnic group category in for ethnic African Americans Nigerian Americans and Ethiopian Americans were the most reported Sub Saharan African groups in the United States br br Historically African Americans have been undercounted in the U S census due to a number of factors In the census the African

br br Texas has the largest African American population by state Followed by Texas is Florida with million and Georgia with million br br br U S cities br br After years of African Americans leaving the south in large numbers seeking better opportunities and treatment in the west and north a movement known as the Great Migration there is now a reverse trend called the New Great Migration As with the earlier Great Migration the New Great Migration is primarily directed toward cities and large urban areas such as Charlotte Houston Dallas Fort Worth Huntsville Raleigh Tampa San Antonio New Orleans Memphis Nashville Jacksonville and so forth A growing percentage of African Americans from the west and north are migrating to the southern region of the U S for economic and cultural reasons The New York City Chicago and Los Angeles metropolitan areas have the highest decline in African Americans while Atlanta Dallas and Houston have the highest increase respectively Several smaller metro areas also saw sizable gains including San Antonio Raleigh and Greensboro N C and Orlando Despite recent declines as of the New York City metropolitan area still has the largest African American metropolitan population in the United States and the only to have over million African Americans br Among cities of or more South Fulton Georgia had the highest percentage of Black residents of any large U S city in with Other large cities with African American majorities include Jackson Mississippi Detroit Michigan Birmingham Alabama Miami Gardens Florida Memphis Tennessee Montgomery Alabama Baltimore Maryland Augusta Georgia Shreveport Louisiana New Orleans Louisiana Macon Georgia Baton Rouge Louisiana Hampton Virginia Newark New Jersey Mobile Alabama Cleveland Ohio Brockton Massachusetts and Savannah Georgia br The nation s most affluent community with an African American majority resides in View Park Windsor Hills California with an annual median household income of Other largely affluent and African American communities include Prince George s County namely Mitchellville Woodmore Upper Marlboro and Charles County in Maryland Dekalb County namely Stonecrest Lithonia Smoke Rise and South Fulton in Georgia Charles City County in Virginia Baldwin Hills in California Hillcrest and Uniondale in New York and Cedar Hill DeSoto and Missouri City in Texas Queens County New York is the only county with a population of or more where African Americans have a higher median household income than White Americans br Seatack Virginia is currently the oldest African American community in the United States It survives today with a vibrant and active civic community br br br Education br br During slavery anti literacy laws were enacted in the U S that prohibited education for Black people Slave owners saw literacy as a threat to the institution of slavery As a North Carolina statute stated Teaching slaves to read and write tends to excite dissatisfaction in their minds and to produce insurrection and rebellion br When slavery was finally abolished in public educational systems were expanding across the country By around seventy four institutions in the south provided a form of advanced education for African American students By over a hundred programs at these schools provided training for Black professionals including teachers Many of the students at Fisk University including the young W E B Du Bois taught school during the summers to support their studies br African Americans were very concerned to provide quality education for their children but White supremacy limited their ability to participate in educational policymaking on the political level State governments soon moved to undermine their citizenship by restricting their right to vote By the late s Blacks were disenfranchised and segregated across the American South White politicians in Mississippi and other states withheld financial resources and supplies from Black schools Nevertheless the presence of Black teachers and their engagement with their communities both inside and outside the classroom ensured that Black students had access to education despite these external constraints br During World War II demands for unity and racial tolerance on the home front provided an opening for the first Black history curriculum in the country For example during the early s Madeline Morgan a Black teacher in the Chicago public schools created a curriculum for students in grades one through eight highlighting the contributions of Black people to the history of the United States At the close of the war Chicago s Board of Education downgraded the curriculum s status from mandatory to optional br Predominantly Black schools for kindergarten through twelfth grade students were common throughout the U S before the s By however desegregation efforts meant that only of Black students were in schools with more than non White students However since then a trend towards re segregation affected communities across the country by million African American students were in such overwhelmingly minority schools including of Black students in school districts that were formerly under desegregation orders br As late as about one third of African Americans over were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names By illiteracy as it had been traditionally defined had been largely eradicated among younger African Americans br U S census surveys showed that by percent of African Americans aged to had completed a high school education less than Whites or Asians but more than Hispanics On many college and university entrance exams or on standardized tests and grades African Americans have historically lagged behind Whites but some studies suggest that the achievement gap has been closing Many policy makers have proposed that this gap can and will be eliminated through policies such as affirmative action desegregation and multiculturalism br br Between and freshmen college enrollment for African Americans increased by percent and only percent for Whites Black women are enrolled in college more than any other race and gender group leading all with enrolled according to the U S Census Bureau br The average high school graduation rate of Blacks in the United States has steadily increased to in Separating this statistic into component parts shows it varies greatly depending upon the state and the school district examined of Black males graduated in the state of New York but in Maine graduated and exceeded the White male graduation rate by percentage points In much of the southeastern United States and some parts of the southwestern United States the graduation rate of White males was in fact below such as in Florida where of White males graduated from high school Examining specific school districts paints an even more complex picture In the Detroit school district the graduation rate of Black males was but for White males In the New York City school district of Black males graduate from high school compared to of White males In Newark County of Black males graduated compared to for White males Further academic improvement has occurred in Roughly of all Blacks have bachelor s degrees In of Whites had obtained a bachelor s degree versus of Blacks In of Blacks had obtained a bachelor s degree versus of Whites Foreign born Blacks of the Black population made even greater strides They exceed native born Blacks by percentage points br College Board which runs the official college level advanced placement AP programs in American high schools have has received criticism in recent years that its curricula have focused too much on Euro centric history In College Board reshaped some curricula among history based courses to further reflect the African diaspora In College Board announced it would be piloting an AP African American Studies course between and The course is expected to launch in br br br Historically Black colleges and universities br br Historically Black colleges and universities HBCUs which were founded when segregated institutions of higher learning did not admit African Americans continue to thrive and educate students of all races today There are HBCUs representing three percent of the nation s colleges and universities with the majority established in the Southeast HBCUs have been largely responsible for establishing and expanding the African American middle class by providing more career opportunities for African Americans br br br Economic status br br The economic disparity between the races in the U S has marginally improved since the end of slavery In two years prior to emancipation Black people owned percent of the national wealth while in it is just over percent Racial disparity in poverty rates has narrowed since the civil rights era with the poverty rate among African Americans decreasing from in to in compared to for all Americans Poverty is associated with higher rates of marital stress and dissolution physical and mental health problems disability cognitive deficits low educational attainment and crime br African Americans have a long and diverse history of business ownership Although the first African American business is unknown slaves captured from West Africa are believed to have established commercial enterprises as peddlers and skilled craftspeople as far back as the th century Around Booker T Washington became the most famous proponent of African American businesses His critic and rival W E B DuBois also commended business as a vehicle for African American advancement br br African Americans had a combined buying power of over trillion as of a increase of their buying power in but lagging significantly in growth behind American Latinos and Asians in the same timer period with and respectively for reference US growth overall was in the same period however African American net worth had shrunk in the previous year despite strong growth in property prices and the S P In African American owned businesses accounted for million of the US s million businesses As of African American owned businesses account for approximately million US businesses Black owned businesses experienced the largest growth in number of businesses among minorities from to br Twenty five percent of Blacks had white collar occupations management professional and related fields in compared with of Americans overall In over half of African American households of married couples earned or more Although in the same year African Americans were over represented among the nation s poor this was directly related to the disproportionate percentage of African American families headed by single women such families are collectively poorer regardless of ethnicity br In the median earnings of African American men was more than Black and non Black American women overall and in all educational levels At the same time among American men income disparities were significant the median income of African American men was approximately cents for every dollar of their European American counterparts although the gap narrowed somewhat with a rise in educational level br Overall the median earnings of African American men were cents for every dollar earned of their Asian American counterparts and for every dollar earned by Hispanic men On the other hand by among American women with post secondary education African American women have made significant advances the median income of African American women was more than those of their Asian European and Hispanic American counterparts with at least some college education br The U S public sector is the single most important source of employment for African Americans During of all Black workers were public employees compared with of non Black workers Both before and after the onset of the Great Recession African Americans were more likely than other workers to be employed in the public sector The public sector is also a critical source of decent paying jobs for Black Americans For both men and women the median wage earned by Black employees is significantly higher in the public sector than in other industries br In the median income of African American families was compared to of European Americans In times of economic hardship for the nation African Americans suffer disproportionately from job loss and underemployment with the Black underclass being hardest hit The phrase last hired and first fired is reflected in the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment figures Nationwide the October unemployment rate for African Americans was while the nationwide rate was In the average income for African Americans was approximately compared to for Whites African Americans experience a higher rate of unemployment than the general population br The income gap between Black and White families is also significant In employed Blacks earned of the wages of Whites down from in The New York Times reported in that in Queens New York the median income among African American families exceeded that of White families which the newspaper attributed to the growth in the number of two parent Black families It noted that Queens was the only county with more than residents where that was true In it was reported that of Black babies were born to unwed mothers The poverty rate among single parent Black families was in according to Walter E Williams while it was among married couple Black families Among White families the respective rates were and in poverty br Collectively African Americans are more involved in the American political process than other minority groups in the United States indicated by the highest level of voter registration and participation in elections among these groups in African Americans also have the highest level of Congressional representation of any minority group in the U S br br br African American homeownership br br Homeownership in the U S is the strongest indicator of financial stability and the primary asset most Americans use to generate wealth African Americans continue to lag behind other racial groups in becoming homeowners In the first quarter of of African Americans owned their homes compared to of all Americans The African American homeownership rate has remained relatively flat since the s despite an increase in anti discrimination housing laws and protections The African American homeownership rate peaked in at br The average White high school drop out still has a slightly better chance of owning a home than the average African American college graduate usually due to unfavorable debt to income ratios or credit scores among most African American college graduates Since fast growing housing costs in most cities have made it even more difficult for the U S African American homeownership rate to significantly grow and reach over for the first time in history From to the median home price in the U S grew outpacing average annual household income growth in that same period which only grew about South Carolina is the state with the most African American homeownership with about of African Americans owning their own homes br br br Politics br Since the mid th century a large majority of African Americans support the Democratic Party In the Presidential election of African American voters supported Democrat Joe Biden while supported Republican Donald Trump Although there is an African American lobby in foreign policy it has not had the impact that African American organizations have had in domestic policy br Many African Americans were excluded from electoral politics in the decades following the end of Reconstruction For those that could participate until the New Deal African Americans were supporters of the Republican Party because it was Republican President Abraham Lincoln who helped in granting freedom to American slaves at the time the Republicans and Democrats represented the sectional interests of the North and South respectively rather than any specific ideology and both conservative and liberal were represented equally in both parties br The African American trend of voting for Democrats can be traced back to the s during the Great Depression when Franklin D Roosevelt s New Deal program provided economic relief to African Americans Roosevelt s New Deal coalition turned the Democratic Party into an organization of the working class and their liberal allies regardless of region The African American vote became even more solidly Democratic when Democratic presidents John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson pushed for civil rights legislation during the s In nearly a third of African Americans voted for Republican Richard Nixon br br br Black national anthem br br Lift Every Voice and Sing is often referred to as the Black national anthem in the United States In the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP had dubbed it the Negro national anthem for its power in voicing a cry for liberation and affirmation for African American people br br br Sexuality br br According to a Gallup survey of Black or African Americans self identified as LGBT in while the total portion of American adults in all ethnic groups identifying as LGBT was in African Americans are more likely to identify themselves as lesbian gay bisexual or transgender than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States br br br Health br br br General health br br The life expectancy for Black men in was years Life expectancy for Black women was years in In when information on Black life expectancy started being collated a Black man could expect to live to years and a Black woman years In White men lived an average of years and White women lived an average of years African American life expectancy at birth is persistently five to seven years lower than European Americans Black men have shorter lifespans than any other group in the US besides Native American men br Black people have higher rates of obesity diabetes and hypertension than the U S average For adult Black men the rate of obesity was in For adult Black women the rate of obesity was in African Americans have higher rates of mortality than any other racial or ethnic group for of the top causes of death In among men Black men had the highest rate of getting cancer followed by White Hispanic Asian Pacific Islander A PI and American Indian Alaska Native AI AN men Among women White women had the highest rate of getting cancer followed by Black Hispanic Asian Pacific Islander and American Indian Alaska Native women African Americans also have higher prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer s disease compared to the overall average br African Americans are more likely than White Americans to die due to health related problems developed by alcoholism Alcohol abuse is the main contributor to the top causes of death among African Americans br In December African Americans were less likely to be vaccinated against COVID due to mistrust in the U S medical system From to there was an increase in African Americans who became vaccinated Still in COVID complications became the third leading cause of death for African Americans br Violence is a major problem within the African American community A report from the U S Department of Justice states In homicide victimization rates for blacks were times higher than the rates for whites The report also found that of black victims were killed by blacks Of the nearly recorded U S homicides in African Americans made up the majority of offenders and victims despite making up less than of the population In all of the top most dangerous U S cities have a significant black population and disturbing black on black violent crime rate Black males age are the only race sex category for which homicide is a top cause of death Black women are times more likely to be killed by an intimate partner than white women Black children are times more likely to die due to parental abuse and neglect than white children br br br Sexual health br According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention African Americans have higher rates of sexually transmitted infections STIs compared to Whites with times the rates of syphilis and chlamydia and times the rate of gonorrhea br The disproportionately high incidence of HIV AIDS among African Americans has been attributed to homophobic influences and lack of proper healthcare The prevalence of HIV AIDS among Black men is seven times higher than the prevalence for White men and Black men are more than nine times as likely to die from HIV AIDS related illness than White men br br br Mental health br African Americans have several barriers for accessing mental health services Counseling has been frowned upon and distant in utility and proximity to many people in the African American community In a qualitative research study explored the disconnect with African Americans and mental health The study was conducted as a semi structured discussion which allowed the focus group to express their opinions and life experiences The results revealed a couple key variables that create barriers for many African American communities to seek mental health services such as the stigma lack of four important necessities trust affordability cultural understanding and impersonal services br Historically many African American communities did not seek counseling because religion was a part of the family values African American who have a faith background are more likely to seek prayer as a coping mechanism for mental issues rather than seeking professional mental health services In a study concluded African Americans with high value in religion are less likely to utilize mental health services compared to those who have low value in religion br In the United States counseling approaches are based on the experience of White Americans and do not fit within the African American culture African American families tend to resolve concerns within the family and it is viewed by the family as a strength On the other hand when African Americans seek counseling they face a social backlash and are criticized They may be labeled crazy viewed as weak and their pride is diminished Because of this many African Americans instead seek mentorship within communities they trust br Terminology is another barrier in relation to African Americans and mental health There is more stigma on the term psychotherapy versus counseling In one study psychotherapy is associated with mental illness whereas counseling approaches problem solving guidance and help More African Americans seek assistance when it is called counseling and not psychotherapy because it is more welcoming within the cultural and community Counselors are encouraged to be aware of such barriers for the well being of African American clients Without cultural competency training in health care many African Americans go unheard and misunderstood br In African Americans had the third highest suicide rate trailing American Indians Alaska Natives and White Americans However African Americans had the second highest increase of its suicide rate from to growing As of suicide is the second leading cause of death among African Americans between the ages of and with black men being four times more likely to kill themselves than black women br br br Genetics br br br Genome wide studies br br Recent surveys of African Americans using a genetic testing service have found varied ancestries which show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors These studies found that on average African Americans have West African European and Native American genetic ancestry with large variation between individuals Genetics websites themselves have reported similar ranges with some finding or percent Native American ancestry and Ancestry com reporting an outlying percentage of European ancestry among African Americans br According to a genome wide study by Bryc et al the mixed ancestry of African Americans in varying ratios came about as the result of sexual contact between West Central Africans more frequently females and Europeans more frequently males This can be understood as being the result of enslaved African American females being raped by White males Consequently the African Americans in their sample have a genome wide average of West African ancestry and European ancestry with large variation among individuals ranging from to West African ancestry The West African ancestral component in African Americans is most similar to that in present day speakers from the non Bantu branches of the Niger Congo Niger Kordofanian family br Correspondingly Montinaro et al observed that around of the overall ancestry of African Americans traces comes from a population similar to the Niger Congo speaking Yoruba of southern Nigeria and southern Benin reflecting the centrality of this West African region in the Atlantic slave trade The next most frequent ancestral component found among African Americans was derived from Great Britain in keeping with historical records It constitutes a little over of their overall ancestry and is most similar to the Northwest European ancestral component also carried by Barbadians Zakharia et al found a similar proportion of Yoruba like ancestry in their African American samples with a minority also drawn from Mandenka and Bantu populations Additionally the researchers observed an average European ancestry of again with significant variation between individuals Bryc et al note that populations from other parts of the continent may also constitute adequate proxies for the ancestors of some African American individuals namely ancestral populations from Guinea Bissau Senegal and Sierra Leone in West Africa and Angola in Southern Africa An individual African American person can have over fifteen African ethnic groups in their genetic makeup alone due to the slave trade covering such vast areas br Altogether genetic studies suggest that African Americans are a genetically diverse people According to DNA analysis led in by Penn State geneticist Mark D Shriver around percent of African Americans have at least European ancestry equivalent to one European great grandparent and their forebears percent of African Americans have at least European ancestry equivalent to one European grandparent and their forebears and percent of African Americans have at least European ancestry equivalent to one European parent and their forebears According to Shriver around percent of African Americans also have at least Native American ancestry equivalent to one Native American great grandparent and their forebears Research suggests that Native American ancestry among people who identify as African American is a result of relationships that occurred soon after slave ships arrived in the American colonies and European ancestry is of more recent origin often from the decades before the Civil War br br br Y DNA br Africans bearing the E V E b a likely traversed across the Sahara from east to west approximately years ago E M E b a likely originated in West Africa or Central Africa According to a Y DNA study by Sims et al the majority of African Americans belong to various subclades of the E M E b a formerly E a paternal haplogroup This is the most common genetic paternal lineage found today among West Central African males and is also a signature of the historical Bantu migrations The next most frequent Y DNA haplogroup observed among African Americans is the R b clade which around of African Americans carry This lineage is most common today among Northwestern European males The remaining African Americans mainly belong to the paternal haplogroup I which is also frequent in Northwestern Europe br br br mtDNA br According to an mtDNA study by Salas et al the maternal lineages of African Americans are most similar to haplogroups that are today especially common in West Africa followed closely by West Central Africa and Southwestern Africa The characteristic West African haplogroups L b L b c d and L b d and West Central African haplogroups L c and L e in particular occur at high frequencies among African Americans As with the paternal DNA of African Americans contributions from other parts of the continent to their maternal gene pool are insignificant br br br Racism and social status br br Formal political economic and social discrimination against minorities has been present throughout American history Leland T Saito Associate Professor of Sociology and American Studies Ethnicity at the University of Southern California writes Political rights have been circumscribed by race class and gender since the founding of the United States when the right to vote was restricted to White men of property Throughout the history of the United States race has been used by Whites for legitimizing and creating difference and social economic and political exclusion br Although they have gained a greater degree of social equality since the civil rights movement African Americans have remained stagnant economically which has hindered their ability to break into the middle class and beyond As of the racial wealth gap between Whites and Blacks remains as large as it was in with the typical net worth of a White household equivalent to that of black households Despite this African Americans have increased employment rates and gained representation in the highest levels of American government in the post civil rights era However widespread racism remains an issue that continues to undermine the development of social status br Economically of all the racially Black ethnic groups on the globe African Americans are the wealthiest and most successful with one in every fifty African American families being millionaires This equates in to approximately million African American millionaires in the United States which is more than the total amount of millionaires in any racially Black country and many other countries around the world br br br Policing and criminal justice br br In the U S which has the largest per capita prison population in the world African Americans are overrepresented as the second largest population of prison inmates in coming second to Whites who made up of the prison population According to the National Registry of Exonerations Blacks are roughly times more likely to be wrongfully convicted of murder in the U S than Whites In the New York City Police Department detained people more than times under the city s stop and frisk law Of the total detained were African Americans while Black people made up of the city s population br br African American males are more likely to be killed by police when compared to other races This is one of the factors that led to the creation of the Black Lives Matter movement in Of the civilians killed by police in were White were Black were Hispanic were from other racial groups and were of unknown race br Although there is not enough evidence that suggest Black people consume cannabis with greater regularity than Whites do they have disproportionately higher arrest rates than Whites in for example Blacks were times as likely to get arrested for using cannabis than Whites despite not significantly more frequently being users Even since the legalization of cannabis there are still more arrests made for Black users than White wasting taxpayer money due to many of those cases being abandoned or dropped with no charges being filed after the trivial racially biased arrests br br br Social issues br After over years marriage rates for all Americans began to decline while divorce rates and out of wedlock births have climbed These changes have been greatest among African Americans After more than years of racial parity Black marriage rates began to fall behind Whites Single parent households have become common and according to U S census figures released in January only percent of Black children live with both their parents In statistics show that over percent marriages in the African American ethnic group marry within their ethnic group br br The first ever anti miscegenation law was passed by the Maryland General Assembly in criminalizing interracial marriage In a speech in Charleston Illinois in Abraham Lincoln stated I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people By the late s US states had anti miscegenation statutes By the ban on interracial marriage was still in force in states While interracial marriage had been legal in California since in actor Sammy Davis Jr faced a backlash for his involvement with White actress Kim Novak Harry Cohn the president of Columbia Pictures with whom Novak was under contract gave in to his concerns that a racist backlash against the relationship could hurt the studio Davis briefly married Black dancer Loray White in to protect himself from mob violence Inebriated at the wedding ceremony Davis despairingly said to his best friend Arthur Silber Jr Why won t they let me live my life The couple never lived together and commenced divorce proceedings in September In officers in Virginia entered the home of Mildred and Richard Loving and dragged them out of bed for living together as an interracial couple on the basis that any white person intermarry with a colored person or vice versa each party shall be guilty of a felony and face prison terms of five years In the law was ruled unconstitutional via the th Amendment adopted in by the U S Supreme Court in Loving v Virginia br In Democrats overwhelmingly voted against California Proposition African Americans voted in favor of it while voted against Proposition On May Barack Obama the first Black president became the first U S president to support same sex marriage Since Obama s endorsement there has been a rapid growth in support for same sex marriage among African Americans As of of African Americans support same sex marriage which is higher than support among the national average and White Americans br Polls in North Carolina Pennsylvania Missouri Maryland Ohio Florida and Nevada have also shown an increase in support for same sex marriage among African Americans On November Maryland Maine and Washington all voted for approve of same sex marriage along with Minnesota rejecting a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage Exit polls in Maryland show about of African Americans voted for same sex marriage showing a vast evolution among African Americans on the issue and was crucial in helping pass same sex marriage in Maryland br Black Americans hold far more conservative opinions on abortion extramarital sex and raising children out of wedlock than Democrats as a whole On financial issues however African Americans are in line with Democrats generally supporting a more progressive tax structure to provide more government spending on social services br br br Political legacy br br African Americans have fought in every war in the history of the United States br The gains made by African Americans in the civil rights movement and in the Black Power movement not only obtained certain rights for African Americans but changed American society in far reaching and fundamentally important ways Prior to the s Black Americans in the South were subject to de jure discrimination or Jim Crow laws They were often the victims of extreme cruelty and violence sometimes resulting in deaths by the post World War II era African Americans became increasingly discontented with their long standing inequality In the words of Martin Luther King Jr African Americans and their supporters challenged the nation to rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed that all men are created equal br The civil rights movement marked an enormous change in American social political economic and civic life It brought with it boycotts sit ins nonviolent demonstrations and marches court battles bombings and other violence prompted worldwide media coverage and intense public debate forged enduring civic economic and religious alliances and disrupted and realigned the nation s two major political parties br Over time it has changed in fundamental ways the manner in which Blacks and Whites interact with and relate to one another The movement resulted in the removal of codified de jure racial segregation and discrimination from American life and law and heavily influenced other groups and movements in struggles for civil rights and social equality within American society including the Free Speech Movement the disabled the women s movement and migrant workers It also inspired the Native American rights movement and in King s book Why We Can t Wait he wrote the U S was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American the Indian was an inferior race br African Americans were also involved in the drafting of laws in the United States such as Frank L Stanley Sr who drafted the laws for the Human Rights Commission and the integration of Kentucky schools while his study of how African Americans were segregated was utilized by the government which led to the integration of the military br br br Media and coverage br br Some activists and academics contend that American news media coverage of African American news concerns or dilemmas is inadequate or that the news media present distorted images of African Americans br To combat this Robert L Johnson founded Black Entertainment Television BET a network that targets young African Americans and urban audiences in the United States Over the years the network has aired such programming as rap and R B music videos urban oriented movies and television series and some public affairs programs On Sunday mornings BET would broadcast Christian programming the network would also broadcast non affiliated Christian programs during the early morning hours daily According to Viacom BET is now a global network that reaches households in the United States Caribbean Canada and the United Kingdom The network has gone on to spawn several spin off channels including BET Her originally launched as BET on Jazz which originally showcased jazz music related programming and later expanded to include general interest urban programs as well as some R B soul and world music br Another network targeting African Americans is TV One TV One s original programming was formally focused on lifestyle and entertainment oriented shows movies fashion and music programming The network also reruns classic series from as far back as the s to current series such as Empire

significantly contributed literature art agricultural skills cuisine clothing styles music language and social and technological innovation to American culture The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the United States such as yams peanuts rice okra sorghum grits watermelon indigo dyes and cotton can be traced to West African and African American influences Notable examples include George Washington Carver who created nearly products from peanuts sweet potatoes and pecans Soul food is a variety of cuisine popular among African Americans It is closely related to the cuisine of the Southern United States The descriptive terminology may have originated in the mid s when soul was a common definer used to describe African American culture for example soul music African Americans were the first peoples in the United States to make fried chicken along with Scottish immigrants to the South Although the Scottish had been frying chicken before they emigrated they lacked the spices and flavor that African Americans had used when preparing the meal The Scottish American settlers therefore adopted the African American method of seasoning chicken However fried chicken was generally a rare meal in the African American community and was usually reserved for special events or celebrations br br br Language br br African American English is a variety dialect ethnolect and sociolect of American English commonly spoken by urban working class and largely bi dialectal middle class African Americans br African American English evolved during the antebellum period through interaction between speakers of th and th century English of Great Britain and Ireland and various West African languages As a result the variety shares parts of its grammar and phonology with the Southern American English dialect African American English differs from Standard American English SAE in certain pronunciation characteristics tense usage and grammatical structures which were derived from West African languages particularly those belonging to the Niger Congo family br Virtually all habitual speakers of African American English can understand and communicate in Standard American English As with all linguistic forms AAVE s usage is influenced by various factors including geographical educational and socioeconomic background as well as formality of setting Additionally there are many literary uses of this variety of English particularly in African American literature br br br Traditional names br br African American names are part of the cultural traditions of African Americans most of these cultural names having no connection to Africa but strictly an African American cultural practice that developed in the United States during enslavement This new evidence became apparent by census records which show African Americans and White Americans though they spoke the same language chose to use different names even during times of enslavement which is where and when the development of African American cultural names began br Prior to this newer information it was only thought that before the s and s most African American names closely resembled those used within European American culture Babies of that era were generally given a few common names with children using nicknames to distinguish the various people with the same name With the rise of s civil rights movement there was a dramatic increase in names of various origins br By the s and s it had become common among African Americans to invent new names for themselves although many of these invented names took elements from popular existing names Prefixes such as La Le Da De Ra Re and Ja Je and suffixes like ique iqua isha and aun awn are common as are inventive spellings for common names The book Baby Names Now From Classic to Cool The Very Last Word on First Names places the origins of La names in African American culture in New Orleans br Even with the rise of inventive names it is still common for African Americans to use biblical historical or traditional European names Daniel Christopher Michael David James Joseph and Matthew were thus among the most frequent names for African American boys in br The name LaKeisha is typically considered American in origin but has elements that were drawn from both French and West Central African roots Names such as LaTanisha JaMarcus DeAndre and Shaniqua were created in the same way Punctuation marks are seen more often within African American names than other American names such as the names Mo nique and D Andre br br br Religion br br The majority of African Americans are Protestant many of whom follow the historically Black churches The term Black church refers to churches which minister to predominantly African American congregations Black congregations were first established by freed slaves at the end of the th century and later when slavery was abolished more African Americans were allowed to create a unique form of Christianity that was culturally influenced by African spiritual traditions One of these early African American Christian cultural traditions in the Black Church is the Watchnight service also called Freedom s Eve where African American congregations all over the nation come together on New Year s Eve through New Years morning in remembrance of the eve and New Year of their emancipation sharing testimonies being baptized and partaking in praise and worship br According to a survey more than half of the African American population are part of the historically Black churches The largest Protestant denomination among African Americans are the Baptists distributed mainly in four denominations the largest being the National Baptist Convention USA and the National Baptist Convention of America The second largest are the Methodists the largest denominations are the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church br Pentecostals are distributed among several different religious bodies with the Church of God in Christ as the largest among them by far About of African American Christians are members of White Protestant communions these denominations which include the United Church of Christ mostly have a to African American membership There are also large numbers of Catholics constituting of the African American population Of the total number of Jehovah s Witnesses are Black br Some African Americans follow Islam Historically between and of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas were Muslims but most of these Africans were converted to Christianity during the era of American slavery During the twentieth century some African Americans converted to Islam mainly through the influence of Black nationalist groups that preached with distinctive Islamic practices including the Moorish Science Temple of America and the largest organization the Nation of Islam founded in the s which attracted at least people by Prominent members included activist Malcolm X and boxer Muhammad Ali br br Malcolm X is considered the first person to start the movement among African Americans towards mainstream Islam after he left the Nation and made the pilgrimage to Mecca In Warith Deen Mohammed the son of Elijah Muhammad took control of the Nation after his father s death and guided the majority of its members to orthodox Islam br African American Muslims constitute of the total U S Muslim population the majority are Sunni or orthodox Muslims some of these identify under the community of W Deen Mohammed The Nation of Islam led by Louis Farrakhan has a membership ranging from to members br There is also a small but growing group of African American Jews making up less than of African Americans or about of the Jewish population in the United States The majority of African American Jews are Ashkenazi while smaller numbers identify as Sephardi Mizrahi or other Many African American Jews are affiliated with denominations such as the Reform Conservative Reconstructionist or Orthodox branches of Judaism but the majority identify as Jews of no religion commonly known as secular Jews A significant number of people who identify themselves as Black Jews are affiliated with syncretic religious groups largely the Black Hebrew Israelites whose beliefs include the claim that African Americans are descended from the Biblical Israelites Jews of all races typically do not accept Black Hebrew Israelites as Jews in part because they are usually not Jewish according to Jewish law and in part because these groups are sometimes associated with antisemitism African American Jews have criticized the Black Hebrew Israelites regarding the movement as primarily composed of Black non Jews who have appropriated Black Jewish identity br Confirmed atheists are less than one half of one percent similar to numbers for Hispanics br br br Music br br African American music is one of the most pervasive African American cultural influences in the United States today and is among the most dominant in mainstream popular music Hip hop R B funk rock and roll soul blues and other contemporary American musical forms originated in Black communities and evolved from other Black forms of music including blues doo wop barbershop ragtime bluegrass jazz and gospel music br African American derived musical forms have also influenced and been incorporated into virtually every other popular music genre in the world including country and techno African American genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in America as they have developed independent of African traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups including Europeans make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in America and have historically been more influential interculturally geographically and economically than other American vernacular traditions br br br Dance br African Americans have also had an important role in American dance Bill T Jones a prominent modern choreographer and dancer has included historical African American themes in his work particularly in the piece Last Supper at Uncle Tom s Cabin The Promised Land Likewise Alvin Ailey s artistic work including his Revelations based on his experience growing up as an African American in the South during the s has had a significant influence on modern dance Another form of dance stepping is an African American tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally Black fraternities and sororities at universities br br br Literature and academics br br Many African American authors have written stories poems and essays influenced by their experiences as African Americans African American literature is a major genre in American literature Famous examples include Langston Hughes James Baldwin Richard Wright Zora Neale Hurston Ralph Ellison Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou br African American inventors have created many widely used devices in the world and have contributed to international innovation Norbert Rillieux created the technique for converting sugar cane juice into white sugar crystals Moreover Rillieux left Louisiana in and went to France where he spent ten years working with the Champollions deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics from the Rosetta Stone Most slave inventors were nameless such as the slave owned by the Confederate President Jefferson Davis who designed the ship propeller used by the Confederate navy br By over inventions were patented by Black Americans Among the most notable inventors were Jan Matzeliger who developed the first machine to mass produce shoes and Elijah McCoy who invented automatic lubrication devices for steam engines Granville Woods had patents to improve electric railway systems including the first system to allow moving trains to communicate Garrett A Morgan developed the first automatic traffic signal and gas mask br Lewis Howard Latimer invented an improvement for the incandescent light bulb More recent inventors include Frederick McKinley Jones who invented the movable refrigeration unit for food transport in trucks and trains Lloyd Quarterman worked with six other Black scientists on the creation of the atomic bomb code named the Manhattan Project Quarterman also helped develop the first nuclear reactor which was used in the atomically powered submarine called the Nautilus br A few other notable examples include the first successful open heart surgery performed by Daniel Hale Williams and the air conditioner patented by Frederick McKinley Jones Mark Dean holds three of the original nine patents on the computer on which all PCs are based More current contributors include Otis Boykin whose inventions included several novel methods for manufacturing electrical components that found use in applications such as guided missile systems and computers and Colonel Frederick Gregory who was not only the first Black astronaut pilot but the person who redesigned the cockpits for the last three space shuttles Gregory was also on the team that pioneered the microwave instrumentation landing system br As part of the preservation of their culture African Americans have continuously launched their own publications and publishing houses such as Robert Sengstacke Abbott founder of the Chicago Defender newspaper and Carter G Woodson the founder of Black History Month who spent over thirty years documenting and publishing African American history in journals and books The Johnson Publishing Company founded by John H Johnson in is a National Historic Landmark br br br Terminology br br br General br br The term African American was popularized by Jesse Jackson in the s although there are recorded uses from the th and th centuries for example in post emancipation holidays and conferences Earlier terms also used to describe Americans of African ancestry referred more to skin color than to ancestry Other terms such as colored person of color or negro were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of White supremacy and oppression br br A page pamphlet entitled A Sermon on the Capture of Lord Cornwallis is notable for the attribution of its authorship to An African American Published in the book s use of this phrase predates any other yet identified by more than years br In the s the term African American was advanced on the model of for example German American or Irish American to give descendants of American slaves and other American Blacks who lived through the slavery era a heritage and a cultural base The term was popularized in Black communities around the country via word of mouth and ultimately received mainstream use after Jesse Jackson publicly used the term in front of a national audience in Subsequently major media outlets adopted its use br Surveys in the s and the first decade of the st century showed that the majority of Black Americans had no preference for African American versus Black American although they had a slight preference for the latter in personal settings and the former in more formal settings By according to polling from Gallup of Black Americans expressed no preference for what their group should be called with each preferring Black and African American Among those with no preference Gallup found a slight majority favored Black if they had to choose br In the Associated Press updated its AP Stylebook to direct its writers to capitalize the first letter of Black when it is used in a racial ethnic or cultural sense conveying an essential and shared sense of history identity and community among people who identify as Black including those in the African diaspora and within Africa The New York Times and other outlets made similar changes at the same time to put Black on the same footing as other racial and ethnic terms such as Latino Asian and African American br In the government released a new more detailed breakdown due to the rise in racially Black immigration into the US listing African American as a compound termed ethnicity distinguished from other racially Black ethnicities such as Nigerian Jamaican etc br The term African American embraces pan Africanism as earlier enunciated by prominent African thinkers such as Marcus Garvey W E B Du Bois and George Padmore The term Afro Usonian and variations of such are more rarely used br br br Official identity br br Since in an attempt to keep up with changing social opinion the United States government has officially classified Black people revised to Black or African American in as having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa Other federal offices such as the U S Census Bureau adhere to the Office of Management and Budget standards on race in their data collection and tabulation efforts In preparation for the U S Census a marketing and outreach plan called Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan ICC recognized and defined African Americans as Black people born in the United States From the ICC perspective African Americans are one of three groups of Black people in the United States br The ICC plan was to reach the three groups by acknowledging that each group has its own sense of community that is based on geography and ethnicity The best way to market the census process toward any of the three groups is to reach them through their own unique communication channels and not treat the entire Black population of the U S as though they are all African Americans with a single ethnic and geographical background The Federal Bureau of Investigation of the U S Department of Justice categorizes Black or African American people as a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa through racial categories used in the UCR Program adopted from the Statistical Policy Handbook and published by the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards U S Department of Commerce derived from the Office of Management and Budget classification br br br Admixture br br Historically race mixing between Black and White people was taboo in the United States So called anti miscegenation laws barring Blacks and Whites from marrying or having sex were established in colonial America as early as and endured in many Southern states until the Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional in Loving v Virginia The taboo among American Whites surrounding White Black relations is a historical consequence of the oppression and racial segregation of African Americans Historian David Brion Davis notes the racial mixing that occurred during slavery was frequently attributed by the planter class to the lower class white males but Davis concludes that there is abundant evidence that many slaveowners sons of slaveowners and overseers took black mistresses or in effect raped the wives and daughters of slave families A famous example was Thomas Jefferson s mistress Sally Hemings Although publicly opposed to race mixing Jefferson in his Notes on the State of Virginia published in wrote The improvement of the blacks in body and mind in the first instance of their mixture with the whites has been observed by every one and proves that their inferiority is not the effect merely of their condition of life br Harvard University historian Henry Louis Gates Jr wrote in that African Americans are a racially mixed or mulatto people deeply and overwhelmingly so see genetics After the Emancipation Proclamation Chinese American men married African American women in high proportions to their total marriage numbers due to few Chinese American women being in the United States African slaves and their descendants have also had a history of cultural exchange and intermarriage with Native Americans although they did not necessarily retain social cultural or linguistic ties to Native peoples There are also increasing intermarriages and offspring between non Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics of any race especially between Puerto Ricans and African Americans American born Blacks According to author M M Drymon many African Americans identify as having Scots Irish ancestry br Racially mixed marriages have become increasingly accepted in the United States since the civil rights movement and up to the present day Approval in national opinion polls has risen from in to in in in A Gallup poll conducted in found that of Whites and of Blacks approved of interracial marriage and overall br At the end of World War II some African American military men who had been stationed in Japan married Japanese women who then immigrated to the United States br br br Terminology dispute br In her book The End of Blackness as well as in an essay for Salon author Debra Dickerson has argued that the term Black should refer strictly to the descendants of Africans who were brought to America as slaves and not to the sons and daughters of Black immigrants who lack that ancestry Thus under her definition President Barack Obama who is the son of a Kenyan is not Black She makes the argument that grouping all people of African descent together regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances would inevitably deny the lingering effects of slavery within the American community of slave descendants in addition to denying Black immigrants recognition of their own unique ancestral backgrounds Lumping us all together Dickerson wrote erases the significance of slavery and continuing racism while giving the appearance of progress br Similar viewpoints have been expressed by author Stanley Crouch in a New York Daily News piece Charles Steele Jr of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and African American columnist David Ehrenstein of the Los Angeles Times who accused White liberals of flocking to Blacks who were Magic Negros a term that refers to a Black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream White as cultural protagonists drivers agenda Ehrenstein went on to say He s there to assuage white guilt they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history br The American Descendants of Slavery ADOS movement coalesces around this view arguing that Black descendants of American slavery deserve a separate ethnic category that distinguishes them from other Black groups in the United States Their terminology has gained popularity in some circles but others have criticized the movement for a perceived bias against especially poor and Black immigrants and for its often inflammatory rhetoric Politicians such as Obama and Harris have received especially pointed criticism from the movement as neither are ADOS and have spoken out at times against policies specific to them br Many Pan African movements and organizations that are ideologically Black nationalist anti imperialist anti Zionist and Scientific socialist like The All African People s Revolutionary Party A APRP have argued that African relating to the diaspora or New Afrikan should be used instead of African American Most notably Malcolm X and Kwame Ture expressed similar views that African Americans are Africans who happen to be in America and should not claim or identify as being American if they are fighting for Black New Afrikan liberation Historically this is due to the enslavement of Africans during the Trans Atlantic slave trade ongoing anti black violence and structural racism in countries like the United States br br br Terms no longer in common use br Before the independence of the Thirteen Colonies until the abolition of slavery in an African American slave was commonly known as a negro Free negro was the legal status in the territory of an African American person who was not enslaved In response to the project of the American Colonization Society to transport free Blacks to the future Liberia a project most Blacks strongly rejected the Blacks at the time said they were no more African than White Americans were European and referred to themselves with what they considered a more acceptable term colored Americans The term was used until the second quarter of the th century when it was considered outmoded and generally gave way again to the exclusive use of negro By the s the term was commonly capitalized Negro but by the mid s it was considered disparaging By the end of the th century negro had come to be considered inappropriate and was rarely used and perceived as a pejorative The term is rarely used by younger Black people but remained in use by many older African Americans who had grown up with the term particularly in the southern U S The term remains in use in some contexts such as the United Negro College Fund an American philanthropic organization that funds scholarships for Black students
