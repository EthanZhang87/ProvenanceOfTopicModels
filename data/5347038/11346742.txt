id: 11346742
Georgia is a state in the Southeastern United States in North America The Golden Isles of Georgia lie off the coast of the state The main geographical features include mountains such as the Ridge and valley Appalachians in the northwest the Blue Ridge Mountains in the northeast the Piedmont plateau in the central portion of the state and Coastal Plain in the south The highest area in Georgia is Brasstown Bald which is m ft above sea level while the lowest is at sea level at the Atlantic Ocean Georgia is located at approximately N W The state has a total area of km sq mi and the geographic center is located in Twiggs County br Georgia has primarily a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers except at the highest elevations Georgia s subtropical climate depends on latitude and how close an area is to the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico The state s weather is mostly moderate but Georgia has occasional extreme weather The highest temperature ever recorded is F C and the lowest is F C Georgia is vulnerable to hurricanes though the coast rarely experiences a direct hurricane strike br Georgia has cities in counties and congressional districts of the counties in the state are governed by a commission of between three to eleven commissioners while the other seven are overseen by a single commissioner Most of the cities are governed by a mayor council system Georgia has almost eight million acres km of prime farmland while over of the land is made up of pine forests Georgia has miles km of streams and rivers acres km of lakes and approximately acres km of freshwater wetlands Manganese iron copper and other minerals make up the natural resources of the state br br br Physical geography br br There are five major geographical regions of Georgia They are the Appalachian Plateau region the Ridge and Valley region the Blue Ridge region the Piedmont region and the Atlantic Plain region br The Appalachian Plateau region is the southern portion of the Appalachian Plateau that stretches from New York through Georgia and west into Alabama br The Ridge and Valley region lies in the northwestern portion of the state The area was formed due to extreme folding and faulting events This folding and faulting created a series of ridges and valleys that vary in height width and geological materials It consists of limestone sandstone chert mudstone and shale as well as many other types of rocks Much of the land in the area is heavily forested as forests cover almost half of the region br The Blue Ridge region of Georgia is situated in the northeast of the state just north of the Piedmont The mountain peaks in the Blue Ridge which are among the highest in the state average between two thousand and five thousand feet It includes igneous metamorphic and sedimentary geology the main types of rocks in the area are gneiss slate and saprolite The soils of the Broad Basin are mostly loamy or clayey Ultiso br The Blue Ridge consists primarily of Precambrian metamorphic rocks and the landscape has relatively high relief br The Piedmont region consists of Paleozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks and the landscape has relatively low relief The Piedmont is the second largest region of Georgia and it has water systems the Chattahoochee River West Point Lake and Lake Sidney Lanier The rocks of the Piedmont are made up of Precambrian and Paleozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks and the soils are of a finer texture than those found on the coastal plain Some specific types of rock in the Piedmont are schist gneiss and phyllite among others Georgia s coastal plain is made up of sedimentary rock dating from the Late Cretaceous to Holocene periods The primary natural mineral resource in the area is kaolin br The Coastal Plain region is the largest and includes portions of the Atlantic coastal plain and the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Plain The Atlantic Coastal Plain and Gulf of Mexico Coastal Plain consist of sediments and sedimentary rocks that range in age from Cretaceous to Present The boundary between the Piedmont Region and the Coastal Plain Region is the Fall Line The Sandhills or Carolina Sandhills is a mi km wide region within the Atlantic Coastal Plain province along the inland margin of this province The Satilla River is in the Atlantic Coastal Plain Alapaha River Suwanee River and the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers flow through the Gulf Coastal Plain and the Florida Panhandle into the Gulf of Mexico Lake Seminole is a reservoir at the confluence of the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers on the Georgia Florida border br br br Geologic history br The oldest known rocks found in Georgia are from the Precambrian Proterozoic Era and are about to billion years old They are found in the Piedmont Plateau and Blue Ridge mountain regions Approximately billion years ago a metamorphic change occurred during an event called the Grenville Orogeny and caused the rocks which were originally sediment to compress into a form of rock called gneiss due to heat and pressure Around million years ago the Grenville mountains began to erode carrying sediments from streams to the sea The gneiss formed from these sediments created the marble metaconglomerate phyllite quartzite schist and slate found in the Blue Ridge and Piedmont areas br Three separate orogeny events impacted the eastern portion of North America during the Paleozoic From these orogeny came folding faulting and igneous intrusions in the Piedmont the Blue Ridge the Valley and Ridge and the Appalachian Plateau br br br Georgia mountains br br The Georgia mountains region are part of the Blue Ridge Mountains and begin in the northeast corner of Georgia Brasstown Bald the highest mountain in Georgia at feet m above mean sea level is part of the chain and sits in an area known as Wolfpen Ridge Other mountains in Georgia include Rabun Bald Arabia Mountain Big Bald Mountain Black Mountain and Blood Mountain br Stone Mountain located in Stone Mountain Georgia is a well known mountain that has an elevation of feet m amsl from its summit and feet m above the surrounding plateau The mountain is known for its geology and also for its enormous bas relief depicting three Confederate leaders Jefferson Davis Robert E Lee and Thomas J Stonewall Jackson The bas relief is the largest in the world br br br Rivers and lakes br br Several major rivers run through the state of Georgia Some of them are the Flint River Towaliga River Ocmulgee River Etowah River Altamaha River Savannah River the Suwannee River The Chattahoochee River is Georgia s longest at miles km The river begins in the Blue Ridge Mountains just below Brasstown Bald and ends at Lake Seminole in the southwesternmost corner of Georgia where it creates a boundary between Alabama and Florida br Lake Lanier is the largest lake in Georgia followed by Lake Oconee as the second largest Lake Lanier is miles km long and covers approximately miles km of riverbed Lake Oconee is miles km long and about a mile wide Other lakes in the state include Lake Acworth Lake Allatoona Lake Blackshear Jackson Lake Georgia West Point Lake High Falls Lake Seminole Lake Chatuge and Walter F George Lake br br br Islands br br Georgia has fourteen barrier islands off of its coast Four of these islands are known as The Golden Isles The largest of these islands is Cumberland Island in Camden County The island is uninhabited and is only accessible by boat Some of the next largest islands are St Simon s Island in Glynn County as the second largest Ossabaw Island twenty miles km south of Savannah is the third largest of the islands and Sapelo Island sixty miles south of Savannah is the fourth The smallest of the islands is Jekyll Island in Glynn County br br br Climate br br The majority of Georgia has primarily a humid subtropical climate tempered somewhat by occasional polar air masses in the winter Hot and humid summers are typical except at the highest elevations The entire state including the north Georgia mountains receives moderate to heavy precipitation which varies from inches mm in central Georgia to approximately inches mm around the Northeast part of the state The degree to which the weather of a certain area of Georgia is subtropical depends not just on the latitude but also on how close it is to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico and the altitude This is especially true in the mountainous areas in the northern part of the state which are further away from ocean waters and can be up to feet m or higher above sea level br In spite of having moderate weather compared to many other states Georgia has occasional extreme weather The highest temperature ever recorded is F C while the lowest ever recorded is F C Georgia is one of the leading states in incidents of tornadoes The areas closest to the Florida border get the same small F and F tornadoes associated with summer afternoon thunderstorms However it is very uncommon for tornadoes to become severe over F As it is on the Atlantic coast Georgia is also vulnerable to hurricanes although the Georgia coastline only rarely experiences a direct hurricane strike More common are hurricanes which strike the Florida panhandle weaken over land and bring strong tropical storm winds and heavy rain to the Georgia interior as well as hurricanes that come close to the Georgia coastline brushing the coast on their recurvature on the way up to hit the Carolinas br In and however Georgia has had severe droughts especially in Temperatures over degrees have been recorded br br br Climate data br br br Climate change br br br Political and human geography br br Georgia is made up of more than cities in counties within congressional districts The map to the right shows the county boundaries for all counties in Georgia br of the counties in the state are governed by a committee made of between three and eleven commissioners while the other counties are overseen by a single commissioner All commissioners are elected by the voters of their county for terms that range between two and six years with most counties having terms lasting four years Serving members wield both executive and legislative power in their county br Most of the cities in Georgia are governed by a mayor council system All municipalities in the state are considered cities There are no lesser incorporations such as towns villages or boroughs Most basic public services rendered outside of the cities are provided by the counties br br br Natural resources br br br Agriculture and water br Georgia has almost eight million acres km of prime farmland while over of the land is made up of pine forests Due to the great number of forested areas in the state Georgia produces more lumber and pulpwood than any other state east of the Mississippi river from these forests come percent of the rosins and turpentines naval stores produced in the United States and over half of the world s supply Both the agricultural areas and the waters of Georgia have created a thriving environment for hunting fishing and game br The state of Georgia has much in the way of agricultural resources br Georgia has miles km of streams and rivers acres km of lakes and approximately acres km of freshwater wetlands br br br Geological resources br The geological resources of Georgia include many types of minerals manganese iron ore copper coal oil clays stone kaolin sand and gravel br br br See also br br Geologic map of Georgia br Waterwood br br br Notes br br br
