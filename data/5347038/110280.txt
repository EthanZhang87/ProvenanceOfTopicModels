Legislature Columbus was situated at the beginning of the navigable portion of the Chattahoochee River and on the last stretch of the Federal Road before entering Alabama The city was named for Christopher Columbus The plan for the city was drawn up by Dr Edwin L DeGraffenried who placed the town on a bluff overlooking the river Across the river to the west where Phenix City Alabama is now located lived several tribes of the Creek and other Georgia and Alabama indigenous peoples Most Creeks moved west with the Treaty of Washington Those who stayed and made war were forcibly removed in br The river served as Columbus s connection to the world particularly enabling it to ship its commodity cotton crops from the plantations to the international cotton market via New Orleans and ultimately Liverpool England The city s commercial importance increased in the s with the arrival of the railroad In addition textile mills were developed along the river bringing industry to an area reliant upon agriculture By the city was one of the more important industrial centers of the South earning it the nickname the Lowell of the South referring to an important textile mill town in Massachusetts br br br Civil War and Reconstruction br br When the American Civil War broke out in the industries of Columbus expanded their production this became one of the most important centers of industry in the Confederacy During the war Columbus ranked second only to the Confederate capital city of Richmond Virginia in the manufacture of supplies for the Confederate army The Eagle Manufacturing Company made various textiles especially woolens for Confederate uniforms The Columbus Iron Works manufactured cannons and machinery for the nearby Confederate Navy shipyard Greenwood and Gray made firearms and Louis and Elias Haimon produced swords and bayonets Smaller firms provided additional munitions and sundries As the war turned in favor of the Union each industry faced exponentially growing shortages of raw materials and skilled labor as well as worsening financial opportunities br Unaware of Lee s surrender to Grant and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln Union and Confederates clashed in the Battle of Columbus Georgia on Easter Sunday April when a Union detachment of two cavalry divisions under Maj Gen James H Wilson attacked the lightly defended city and burned many of the industrial buildings John Stith Pemberton who later developed Coca Cola in Columbus was wounded in this battle Col Charles Augustus Lafayette Lamar owner of the last slave ship in America was also killed here A historic marker erected in Columbus notes that this was the site of the Last Land Battle in the War from to br br Reconstruction began almost immediately and prosperity followed Factories such as the Eagle and Phenix Mills were revived and the industrialization of the town led to rapid growth causing the city to outgrow its original plan The Springer Opera House was built during this time attracting such notables as Irish writer Oscar Wilde The Springer is now the official State Theater of Georgia br By the time of the Spanish American War the city s modernization included the addition of a new waterworks as well as trolleys extending to outlying neighborhoods such as Rose Hill and Lakebottom Mayor Lucius Chappell also brought a training camp for

passed a resolution to set aside one day annually to memorialize the Confederate dead The secretary of the association Mary Ann Williams was directed to write a letter inviting the ladies of every Southern state to join them in the observance The letter was written in March and sent to representatives of all of the principal cities in the South including Atlanta Macon Montgomery Memphis Richmond St Louis Alexandria Columbia and New Orleans This was the beginning of the influential work by ladies organizations to honor the war dead br The date for the holiday was selected by Elizabeth Rutherford Ellis She chose April the first anniversary of Confederate General Johnston s final surrender to Union General Sherman at Bennett Place North Carolina For many in the South that act marked the official end of the Civil War br In General John A Logan commander in chief of the Union Civil War Veterans Fraternity called the Grand Army of the Republic launched the Memorial Day holiday that is now observed across the entire United States General Logan s wife said he had borrowed from practices of Confederate Memorial Day She wrote that Logan said it was not too late for the Union men of the nation to follow the example of the people of the South in perpetuating the memory of their friends who had died for the cause they thought just and right br While two dozen cities across the country claim to have originated the Memorial Day holiday Bellware and Gardiner firmly establish that the holiday began in Columbus In The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America they show that
