title: Height above mean sea level
id: 71840293
Height above mean sea level is a measure of a location s vertical distance height elevation or altitude in reference to a vertical datum based on a historic mean sea level In geodesy it is formalized as orthometric height The zero level varies in different countries due to different reference points and historic measurement periods Climate change and other forces can cause sea levels and elevations to vary over time br br br Uses br Elevation or altitude above sea level is a standard measurement for br br Geographic locations such as towns mountains and other landmarks br The top of buildings and other structures br Mining infrastructure particularly underground br Flying objects such as airplanes or helicopters below a Transition Altitude defined by local regulations br br br Units and abbreviations br Elevation or altitude is generally expressed as metres above mean sea level in the metric system or feet above mean sea level in United States customary and imperial units Common abbreviations in English are br br AMSL above mean sea level br ASL above sea level br FAMSL feet above mean sea level br FASL feet above sea level br MAMSL metres above mean sea level br MASL metres above sea level br MSL mean sea level br For elevations or altitudes often just the abbreviation MSL is used e g Mount Everest m MSL or the reference to sea level is omitted completely e g Mount Everest m br br br Methods of measurement br Altimetry is the measurement of altitude or elevation above sea level Common techniques are br br Surveying especially levelling br Global Navigation Satellite System such as GPS where a receiver determines a location from pseudoranges to multiple satellites A geoid is needed to convert the D position to sea level elevation br Pressure altimeter measuring atmospheric pressure which decreases as altitude increases Since atmospheric pressure varies with the weather too a recent local measure of the pressure at a known altitude is needed to calibrate the altimeter br Stereoscopy in aerial photography br Aerial lidar and satellite laser altimetry br Aerial or satellite radar altimetry br Accurate measurement of historical mean sea levels is complex Land mass subsidence as occurs naturally in some regions can give the appearance of rising sea levels Conversely markings on land masses that are uplifted due to geological processes can suggest a relative lowering of mean sea level br br br See also br Depth below seafloor br Height above average terrain br Height above ground level br List of places on land with elevations below sea level br br br
