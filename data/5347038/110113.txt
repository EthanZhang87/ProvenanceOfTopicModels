Sandy Springs is a city in northern Fulton County Georgia United States and a suburb of Atlanta The city s population was at the census making it Georgia s th most populous city It is the site of several corporate headquarters including UPS Newell Brands Inspire Brands Focus Brands Cox Enterprises and Mercedes Benz USA s corporate offices br br br History br Human settlement in the area can be traced back to approximately CE when Native Americans forged three trails to better access the area s freshwater springs In the th century the Creek Muskogee tribe settled the area where they remained until the early s when they were forced out of the area due to the discovery of gold br In the federal government held a number of land lotteries in the area resulting in the purchase of land in present day Sandy Springs and its subsequent settlement The Austin Johnson House the oldest existing unaltered house was built in on what is now Johnson Ferry Road In Wilson Spruill donated acres ha of land for the founding of Sandy Springs United Methodist Church near the natural spring for which the city is named In the Hammond School was built at Johnson Ferry Road and Mt Vernon Highway across the street from the church br br br th century br In the state legislature blocked Atlanta from annexing the community which remained rural until the Interstate Highway System was authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of In after a fire at Hammond Elementary School William Hartsfield the mayor of Atlanta urged residents to support annexation so that the area would have better firefighting protection Community opposition killed the proposal In the early s Georgia and Interstate were constructed connecting Sandy Springs to metro Atlanta and initiating a housing boom that brought new residents and major land development as part of the white flight from Atlanta after the Civil Rights Movement won greater racial integration within Atlanta br In Hartsfield once again proposed the annexation of the Sandy Springs area Spokesmen for Sandy Springs promised residents to build up a city separate from Atlanta and your Negroes and forbid any Negroes to buy or own or live within our limits should they reject annexation In annexation by Atlanta was defeated in a referendum with two thirds voting against br Efforts to incorporate Sandy Springs began in in response to attempts by the city of Atlanta to annex this unincorporated area of north Fulton County br In the early s the city of Atlanta attempted to use a state law to force annexation of Sandy Springs which failed after the Supreme Court of Georgia ruled that the law was unconstitutional In response a group of residents formed the Committee for Sandy Springs to lobby for the incorporation of Sandy Springs br During this time proponents for an incorporated Sandy Springs argued that their taxes were disproportionately going to other largely non white communities in Fulton County In every legislative session state legislators representing the area introduced a bill in the Georgia General Assembly to authorize a referendum on incorporation Legislators representing Atlanta and southwestern Fulton County who feared that tax revenue would be lost from incorporation blocked the bills using the procedural requirement that all local legislation be approved first by a delegation of representatives from the affected area br In the Georgia state government determined that Sandy Springs along with other wealthier and predominantly white communities in Fulton County was being taxed below statewide minimums resulting in an increase in taxes for the area Some Sandy Springs residents including Mitch Skandalakis launched a number of campaigns against the taxes and launched an unsuccessful lawsuit against the state br On January Eric Rudolph bombed an abortion clinic in Sandy Springs br br br st century br When the Republican Party gained a majority in both houses of the Georgia General Assembly in the procedural rules previously used to prevent a vote by the full chamber were changed so that the bill was handled as a state bill and not as a local bill The assembly also repealed the requirement that new cities must be at least miles km from existing cities that had stymied previous attempts to incorporate due to Sandy Springs directly bordering both Roswell and Atlanta The bill allowing for a referendum on incorporation was introduced and passed as HB The referendum initiative was approved by the Assembly and signed by Governor Sonny Perdue br Many residents expressed displeasure with county services claiming based upon financial information provided by the county that the county was redistributing revenues to fund services in less financially stable areas of the county ignoring local opposition to rezoning and allowing excessive development Many residents of unincorporated and less developed south Fulton County strongly opposed incorporation fearing the loss of tax revenues which fund county services County residents outside Sandy Springs were not allowed to vote on the matter Efforts such as requesting the Justice Department to reject the plan were unsuccessful br The referendum was held on June and residents voted in favor of incorporation In November voters returned to the polls to elect a mayor and six city council members br Formal incorporation occurred on December making Sandy Springs the third largest city ever to incorporate in the U S The city s police force and fire department began service in Upon incorporation Sandy Springs initiated a nontraditional approach by operating as a public private partnership PPP with all but six full time employees being contracted br In the city undertook a procurement process to rebid all general city services which was won by CH M Hill The timing of this contract during the Great Recession allowed the city to leverage a cheaper contract due to the economic downturn br In the city became the first jurisdiction in Georgia to successfully bail out from the preclearance requirements of Section of the Voting Rights Act br In the Sandy Springs City Council moved to scale back the PPP model directly hiring contract employees leaving only outsourced full time workers by the end of The city will still outsource a number of services including the city attorney s office as well as security street sweeping and ambulance services The move is expected to save million in the next year and more than million over years br br br Geography br The boundaries of Sandy Springs are Atlanta to the south
