long inhabited by the Creek Indians who called it Thronateeska after their word for flint the valuable mineral found in beds near the Flint River They used it for making arrowheads and other tools In U S Congress passed the Indian Removal Act and the United States made treaties to extinguish Creek and other Native American land claims in the Southeast The U S Army forcibly removed most of the native peoples to Indian Territory lands west of the Mississippi River br br br Nelson Tift br br European American settlement began with Nelson Tift of Groton Connecticut who took land along the Flint River in October after Indian removal Tift and his colleagues named the new town Albany after the capital of New York noting that New York s Albany was a commercial center located at the headwaters of the Hudson River they hoped that their town near the headwaters of the Flint would prove to be just as successful It proved to be nowhere near as prosperous Alexander Shotwell laid out the town in and it was incorporated as a city by an act of the General Assembly of Georgia on December br Tift was the city s leading entrepreneur for decades An ardent booster he promoted education business and railroad construction During the Civil War he provided naval supplies and helped build two ships He opposed Radical Reconstruction inside the state and in Congress and was scornful of the Yankee carpetbaggers who came in Historian John Fair concludes that Tift became more Southern than many natives His pro slavery attitudes before the war and his support for segregation afterward made him compatible with Georgia s white elite br This area was developed for cotton cultivation by planters who used numerous enslaved African Americans to clear lands and process the cotton As a result of the planters acquisition of slave workers by Dougherty County s majority population was black composed overwhelmingly of slaves The market center for cotton plantations Albany was in a prime location for shipping cotton to other markets by steamboats In Tift hired Horace King a former slave and bridge builder to construct a toll bridge over the river King s bridge toll house still stands

Thronateeska Heritage Center in the former railroad station br br br Carey Wentworth Styles br After the war Carey Wentworth Styles moved to Albany and founded the newspaper Albany News In the early years following the war Styles like Tift took great exception to the Radical Reconstruction program then in force and advocated for a more moderate response based on his interpretation of Georgia s rights under the Constitution Styles backed constitutional reconstruction advanced by Benjamin H Hill and sought support for the idea from the national Democratic party While on a trip to Atlanta in May to meet with Democratic party leaders Styles took measure of the contemporary Atlanta newspapers and found them lacking br Styles believed them to be little more than organs for the Radical Republican reconstruction agenda He resolved to bring a paper aligned with the Democratic party viewpoint to the Atlanta market one supporting his constitutional reconstruction ideals Styles moved from Albany to Atlanta and on May he announced that he had obtained the necessary financial backing to purchase the Daily Opinion br On June the new Democratic daily as he described it printed its first edition under the name The Constitution Styles tenure at the Atlanta Constitution would be brief Unable to pay for his portion of the purchase when the sale of his Albany News fell through Styles was forced to surrender his interest in the paper to his joint venture partners Styles returned to Albany as editor of the News In he was elected to the Georgia Senate representing Augusta and surrounding communities in an ironic turn of events having killed a member of the Georgia House of Representatives in his earlier years After his legislative service Styles sold the Albany newspaper
