title: Trail of Tears
id: 71973
The Trail of Tears was the forced displacement of approximately people of the Five Civilized Tribes between and and the additional thousands of Native Americans within that were ethnically cleansed by the United States government br As part of Indian removal members of the Cherokee Muscogee Seminole Chickasaw and Choctaw nations were forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands in the Southeastern United States to newly designated Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River after the passage of the Indian Removal Act in The Cherokee removal in was the last forced removal east of the Mississippi and was brought on by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega Georgia in resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush The relocated peoples suffered from exposure disease and starvation while en route to their newly designated Indian reserve Thousands died from disease before reaching their destinations or shortly after A variety of scholars have classified the Trail of Tears as an example of the genocide of Native Americans others categorize it as ethnic cleansing br br br Overview br br In a group of Indian nations collectively referred to as the Five Civilized Tribes the Cherokee Chickasaw Choctaw Muscogee and Seminole nations were living autonomously in what would later be termed the American Deep South The process of cultural transformation from their traditional way of life towards a white American way of life as proposed by George Washington and Henry Knox was gaining momentum especially among the Cherokee and Choctaw br American settlers had been pressuring the federal government to remove Indians from the Southeast many settlers were encroaching on Indian lands while others wanted more land made available to the settlers Although the effort was vehemently opposed by some including U S Congressman Davy Crockett of Tennessee President Andrew Jackson was able to gain Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of which authorized the government to extinguish any Indian title to land claims in the Southeast br In the Choctaw became the first Nation to be removed and their removal served as the model for all future relocations After two wars many Seminoles were removed in The Creek removal followed in the Chickasaw in and lastly the Cherokee in Some managed to evade the removals however and remained in their ancestral homelands some Choctaw still reside in Mississippi Creek in Alabama and Florida Cherokee in North Carolina and Seminole in Florida A small group of Seminole fewer than evaded forced removal the modern Seminole Nation of Florida is descended from these individuals A number of non Indians who lived with the nations including over slaves and others of African descent such as spouses or Freedmen also accompanied the Indians on the trek westward By Indians from the southeastern states had been removed from their homelands thereby opening million acres km for white settlement When the Five Tribes arrived in Indian Territory they followed their physical appropriation of Plains Indians land with an erasure of their predecessor s history and perpetuated the idea that they had found an undeveloped wilderness when they arrived in an attempt to appeal to white American values by participating in the settler colonial process themselves Other Indian nations such as the Quapaws and Osages had moved to Indian Territory before the Five Tribes and saw them as intruders br br br Historical background br Before the fixed boundaries of these autonomous Indian nations comprising large areas of the United States were subject to continual cession and annexation in part due to pressure from squatters and the threat of military force in the newly declared U S territories federally administered regions whose boundaries supervened upon the Indian treaty claims As these territories became U S states state governments sought to dissolve the boundaries of the Indian nations within their borders which were independent of state jurisdiction and to expropriate the land therein These pressures were exacerbated by U S population growth and the expansion of slavery in the South with the rapid development of cotton cultivation in the uplands after the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney br Many people of the southeastern Indian nations had become economically integrated into the economy of the region This included the plantation economy and the possession of slaves who were also forcibly relocated during the removal br Prior to Jackson s presidency removal policy was already in place and justified by the myth of the Vanishing Indian Historian Jeffrey Ostler explains that Scholars have exposed how the discourse of the vanishing Indian was an ideology that made declining Indigenous American populations seem to be an inevitable consequence of natural processes and so allowed Americans to evade moral responsibility for their destructive choices Despite the common association of Andrew Jackson and the Trail of Tears ideas for Removal began prior to Jackson s presidency Ostler explains A singular focus on Jackson obscures the fact that he did not invent the idea of removal Months after the passage of the Removal Act Jackson described the legislation as the happy consummation of a policy pursued for nearly years James Fenimore Cooper was also a key component of the maintenance of the vanishing Indian myth This vanishing narrative can be seen as existing prior to the Trail of Tears through Cooper s novel The Last of the Mohicans Scholar and author Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz shows that br br Cooper has the last of the noble and pure Natives die off as nature would have it with the last Mohican handing the continent over to Hawkeye the nativized settler his adopted son Cooper had much to do with creating the US origin myth to which generations of historians have dedicated themselves fortifying what historian Francis Jennings has described as exclusion from the process of formation of American society and culture br br br Jackson s role br Although Jackson was not the sole or original architect of Removal policy his contributions were influential in its trajectory Jackson s support for the removal of the Indians began at least a decade before his presidency Indian removal was Jackson s top legislative priority upon taking office After being elected president he wrote in his first address to Congress The emigration should be voluntary for it would be as cruel as unjust to compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek a home in a distant land But they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to their laws In return for their obedience as individuals they will without doubt be protected in the enjoyment of those possessions which they have improved by their industry The prioritization of American Indian removal and his violent past created a sense of restlessness among U S territories During his presidency the United States made eighty six treaties with twenty six American Indian nations between New York and the Mississippi all of them forcing land cessions including removals br In a speech regarding Indian removal Jackson said br br It will separate the Indians from immediate contact with settlements of whites free them from the power of the States enable them to pursue happiness in their own way and under their own rude institutions will retard the progress of decay which is lessening their numbers and perhaps cause them gradually under the protection of the Government and through the influence of good counsels to cast off their savage habits and become an interesting civilized and Christian community br The removals conducted under both Presidents Jackson and Van Buren followed the Indian Removal Act of which provided the president with powers to exchange land with Indian nations and provide infrastructure improvements on the existing lands The law also gave the president power to pay for transportation costs to the West should the nations willingly choose to relocate The law did not however allow the president to force Indian nations to move west without a mutually agreed upon treaty Referring to the Indian Removal Act Martin Van Buren Jackson s vice president and successor is quoted as saying There was no measure in the whole course of Jackson s administration of which he was more exclusively the author than this br According to historian Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz Jackson s intentions were outwardly violent Dunbar Ortiz claims that Jackson believed in bleeding enemies to give them their senses on his quest to serve the goal of U S expansion According to her American Indians presented an obstacle to the fulfillment of Manifest Destiny in his mind Throughout his military career according to historian Amy H Sturgis Jackson earned and emphasized his reputation as an Indian fighter a man who believed creating fear in the native population was more desirable than cultivating friendship In a message to Congress on the eve of Indian Removal December Jackson wrote that removal will relieve the whole State of Mississippi and the western part of Alabama of Indian occupancy and enable those States to advance rapidly in population wealth and power It will separate the Indians from immediate contact with settlements of whites In this way Sturgis has argued that Jackson demarcated the Indian population as an obstacle to national success Sturgis writes that Jackson s removal policies were met with pushback from respectable social figures and that many leaders of Jacksonian reform movements were particularly disturbed by U S policy toward American Indians Among these opponents were women s advocate and founder of the American Woman s Educational Association Catherine Beecher and politician Davy Crockett br Historian Francis Paul Prucha on the other hand writes that these assessments were put forward by Jackson s political opponents and that Jackson had benevolent intentions According to him Jackson s critics have been too harsh if not wrong He states that Jackson never developed a doctrinaire anti Indian attitude and that his dominant goal was to preserve the security and well being of the United States and its Indian and white inhabitants Corroborating Prucha s interpretation historian Robert V Remini argues that Jackson never intended the monstrous result of his policy Remini argues further that had Jackson not orchestrated the removal of the Five Civilized Tribes from their ancestral homelands they would have been totally wiped out br br br Treaty of New Echota br Jackson chose to continue with Indian removal and negotiated the Treaty of New Echota on December which granted the Cherokee two years to move to Indian Territory modern day Oklahoma The Chickasaws and Choctaws had readily accepted and signed treaties with the U S government while the Creeks did so under coercion The negotiation of the Treaty of New Echota was largely encouraged by Jackson and it was signed by a minority Cherokee political faction the Treaty Party led by Cherokee leader Elias Boudinot However the treaty was opposed by most of the Cherokee people as it was not approved by the Cherokee National Council and it was not signed by Principal Chief John Ross The Cherokee National Council submitted a petition signed by thousands of Cherokee citizens urging Congress to void the agreement in February Despite this opposition the Senate ratified the treaty on March and the Treaty of New Echota thus became the legal basis for the Trail of Tears Only a fraction of the Cherokees left voluntarily The U S government with assistance from state militias forced most of the remaining Cherokees west in The Cherokees were temporarily remanded in camps in eastern Tennessee In November the Cherokee were broken into groups of around each and began the journey west They endured heavy rains snow and freezing temperatures br When the Cherokee negotiated the Treaty of New Echota they exchanged all their land east of the Mississippi for land in modern Oklahoma and a million payment from the federal government Many Cherokee felt betrayed that their leadership accepted the deal and over Cherokee signed a petition to prevent the passage of the treaty By the end of the decade in tens of thousands of Cherokee and other Indian nations had been removed from their land east of the Mississippi River The Creek Choctaw Seminole and Chicksaw were also relocated under the Indian Removal Act of One Choctaw leader portrayed the removal as A Trail of Tears and Deaths a devastating event that removed most of the Indian population of the southeastern United States from their traditional homelands br br br Legal background br br The establishment of the Indian Territory and the extinguishing of Indian land claims east of the Mississippi by the Indian Removal Act anticipated the U S Indian reservation system which was imposed on remaining Indian lands later in the th century br The statutory argument for Indian sovereignty persisted until the U S Supreme Court ruled in Cherokee Nation v Georgia that the Cherokee were not a sovereign and independent nation and therefore not entitled to a hearing before the court In the years after the Indian Removal Act the Cherokee filed several lawsuits regarding conflicts with the state of Georgia Some of these cases reached the Supreme Court the most influential being Worcester v Georgia Samuel Worcester and other non Indians were convicted by Georgia law for residing in Cherokee territory in the state of Georgia without a license Worcester was sentenced to prison for four years and appealed the ruling arguing that this sentence violated treaties made between Indian nations and the United States federal government by imposing state laws on Cherokee lands The Court ruled in Worcester s favor declaring that the Cherokee Nation was subject only to federal law and that the Supremacy Clause barred legislative interference by the state of Georgia Chief Justice Marshall argued The Cherokee nation then is a distinct community occupying its own territory in which the laws of Georgia can have no force The whole intercourse between the United States and this Nation is by our constitution and laws vested in the government of the United States br The Court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision Worcester thus imposed no obligations on Jackson there was nothing for him to enforce although Jackson s political enemies conspired to find evidence to be used in the forthcoming political election to claim that he would refuse to enforce the Worcester decision He feared that enforcement would lead to open warfare between federal troops and the Georgia militia which would compound the ongoing crisis in South Carolina and lead to a broader civil war Instead he vigorously negotiated a land exchange treaty with the Cherokee After this Jackson s political opponents Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams who supported the Worcester decision became outraged by Jackson s alleged refusal to uphold Cherokee claims against the state of Georgia Author and political activist Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote an account of Cherokee assimilation into the American culture declaring his support of the Worcester decision br Nevertheless the actions of the Jackson administration were not isolated because state and federal officials had violated treaties without consequence often attributed to military exigency as the members of individual Indian nations were not automatically United States citizens and were rarely given standing in any U S court br While citizenship tests existed for Indians living in newly annexed areas before and after forced relocation individual U S states did not recognize the Indian nations land claims only individual title under State law and distinguished between the rights of white and non white citizens who often had limited standing in court and Indian removal was carried out under U S military jurisdiction often by state militias As a result individual Indians who could prove U S citizenship were nevertheless displaced from newly annexed areas br br br Choctaw removal br br The Choctaw nation resided in large portions of what are now the U S states of Alabama Mississippi and Louisiana After a series of treaties starting in the Choctaw nation was reduced to million acres km The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek ceded the remaining country to the United States and was ratified in early The removals were only agreed to after a provision in the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek allowed some Choctaw to remain The Choctaws were the first to sign a removal treaty presented by the federal government President Jackson wanted strong negotiations with the Choctaws in Mississippi and the Choctaws seemed much more cooperative than Andrew Jackson had imagined The treaty provided that the United States would bear the expense of moving their homes and that they had to be removed within two and a half years of the signed treaty The chief of the Choctaw nation George W Harkins wrote to the citizens of the United States before the removals were to commence br br It is with considerable diffidence that I attempt to address the American people knowing and feeling sensibly my incompetency and believing that your highly and well improved minds would not be well entertained by the address of a Choctaw But having determined to emigrate west of the Mississippi river this fall I have thought proper in bidding you farewell to make a few remarks expressive of my views and the feelings that actuate me on the subject of our removal We as Choctaws rather chose to suffer and be free than live under the degrading influence of laws which our voice could not be heard in their formation br United States Secretary of War Lewis Cass appointed George Gaines to manage the removals Gaines decided to remove Choctaws in three phases starting in November and ending in The first groups met at Memphis and Vicksburg where a harsh winter battered the emigrants with flash floods sleet and snow Initially the Choctaws were to be transported by wagon but floods halted them With food running out the residents of Vicksburg and Memphis were concerned Five steamboats the Walter Scott the Brandywine the Reindeer the Talma and the Cleopatra would ferry Choctaws to their river based destinations The Memphis group traveled up the Arkansas for about miles km to Arkansas Post There the temperature stayed below freezing for almost a week with the rivers clogged with ice so there could be no travel for weeks Food rationing consisted of a handful of boiled corn one turnip and two cups of heated water per day Forty government wagons were sent to Arkansas Post to transport them to Little Rock When they reached Little Rock a Choctaw chief referred to their trek as a trail of tears and death The Vicksburg group was led by an incompetent guide and was lost in the Lake Providence swamps br br Alexis de Tocqueville the French philosopher witnessed the Choctaw removals while in Memphis Tennessee in br br In the whole scene there was an air of ruin and destruction something which betrayed a final and irrevocable adieu one couldn t watch without feeling one s heart wrung The Indians were tranquil but somber and taciturn There was one who could speak English and of whom I asked why the Chactas were leaving their country To be free he answered could never get any other reason out of him We watch the expulsion of one of the most celebrated and ancient American peoples br Nearly Choctaws made the move to what would be called Indian Territory and then later Oklahoma About died along the trail of tears Approximately Choctaws remained in Mississippi in after the initial removal efforts The Choctaws who chose to remain in newly formed Mississippi were subject to legal conflict harassment and intimidation The Choctaws have had our habitations torn down and burned our fences destroyed cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged manacled fettered and otherwise personally abused until by such treatment some of our best men have died The Choctaws in Mississippi were later reformed as the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and the removed Choctaws became the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma br br br Seminole resistance br br The U S acquired Florida from Spain via the Adams On s Treaty and took possession in In the Seminoles were called to a meeting at Payne s Landing on the Ocklawaha River The Treaty of Payne s Landing called for the Seminoles to move west if the land were found to be suitable They were to be settled on the Creek reservation and become part of the Creek nation who considered them deserters some of the Seminoles had been derived from Creek bands but also from other Indian nations Those among the nation who once were members of Creek bands did not wish to move west to where they were certain that they would meet death for leaving the main band of Creek Indians The delegation of seven chiefs who were to inspect the new reservation did not leave Florida until October After touring the area for several months and conferring with the Creeks who had already settled there the seven chiefs signed a statement on March that the new land was acceptable Upon their return to Florida however most of the chiefs renounced the statement claiming that they had not signed it or that they had been forced to sign it and in any case that they did not have the power to decide for all the Indian nations and bands that resided on the reservation The villages in the area of the Apalachicola River were more easily persuaded however and went west in On December a group of Seminoles and blacks ambushed a U S Army company marching from Fort Brooke in Tampa to Fort King in Ocala killing all but three of the army troops This came to be known as the Dade Massacre br br As the realization that the Seminoles would resist relocation sank in Florida began preparing for war The St Augustine Militia asked the War Department for the loan of muskets Five hundred volunteers were mobilized under Brig Gen Richard K Call Indian war parties raided farms and settlements and families fled to forts large towns or out of the territory altogether A war party led by Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train killing eight of its guards and wounding six others Most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia in another fight a few days later Sugar plantations along the Atlantic coast south of St Augustine were destroyed with many of the slaves on the plantations joining the Seminoles br Other war chiefs such as Halleck Tustenuggee Jumper and Black Seminoles Abraham and John Horse continued the Seminole resistance against the army The war ended after a full decade of fighting in The U S government is estimated to have spent about on the war today Many Indians were forcibly exiled to Creek lands west of the Mississippi others retreated into the Everglades In the end the government gave up trying to subjugate the Seminole in their Everglades redoubts and left fewer than Seminoles in peace Other scholars state that at least several hundred Seminoles remained in the Everglades after the Seminole Wars br As a result of the Seminole Wars the surviving Seminole band of the Everglades claims to be the only federally recognized Indian nation which never relinquished sovereignty or signed a peace treaty with the United States br In general the American people tended to view the Indian resistance as unwarranted An article published by the Virginia Enquirer on January called the Hostilities of the Seminoles assigned all the blame for the violence that came from the Seminole s resistance to the Seminoles themselves The article accuses the Indians of not staying true to their word the promises they supposedly made in the treaties and negotiations from the Indian Removal Act br br br Creek dissolution br br After the War of some Muscogee leaders such as William McIntosh and Chief Shelocta signed treaties that ceded more land to Georgia The signing of the Treaty of Fort Jackson signaled the end for the Creek Nation and for all Indians in the South Friendly Creek leaders like Shelocta and Big Warrior addressed Sharp Knife the Indian nickname for Andrew Jackson and reminded him that they keep the peace Nevertheless Jackson retorted that they did not cut Tecumseh s throat when they had the chance so they must now cede Creek lands Jackson also ignored Article of the Treaty of Ghent that restored sovereignty to Indians and their nations br br Jackson opened this first peace session by faintly acknowledging the help of the friendly Creeks That done he turned to the Red Sticks and admonished them for listening to evil counsel For their crime he said the entire Creek Nation must pay He demanded the equivalent of all expenses incurred by the United States in prosecuting the war which by his calculation came to acres km of land br Eventually the Creek Confederacy enacted a law that made further land cessions a capital offense Nevertheless on February McIntosh and other chiefs signed the Treaty of Indian Springs which gave up most of the remaining Creek lands in Georgia After the U S Senate ratified the treaty McIntosh was assassinated on April by Creeks led by Menawa br The Creek National Council led by Opothle Yohola protested to the United States that the Treaty of Indian Springs was fraudulent President John Quincy Adams was sympathetic and eventually the treaty was nullified in a new agreement the Treaty of Washington The historian R Douglas Hurt wrote The Creeks had accomplished what no Indian nation had ever done or would do again achieve the annulment of a ratified treaty However Governor George Troup of Georgia ignored the new treaty and began to forcibly remove the Indians under the terms of the earlier treaty At first President Adams attempted to intervene with federal troops but Troup called out the militia and Adams fearful of a civil war conceded As he explained to his intimates The Indians are not worth going to war over br Although the Creeks had been forced from Georgia with many Lower Creeks moving to the Indian Territory there were still about Upper Creeks living in Alabama However the state moved to abolish tribal governments and extend state laws over the Creeks Opothle Yohola appealed to the administration of President Andrew Jackson for protection from Alabama when none was forthcoming the Treaty of Cusseta was signed on March which divided up Creek lands into individual allotments Creeks could either sell their allotments and receive funds to remove to the west or stay in Alabama and submit to state laws The Creeks were never given a fair chance to comply with the terms of the treaty however Rampant illegal settlement of their lands by Americans continued unabated with federal and state authorities unable or unwilling to do much to halt it Further as recently detailed by historian Billy Winn in his thorough chronicle of the events leading to removal a variety of fraudulent schemes designed to cheat the Creeks out of their allotments many of them organized by speculators operating out of Columbus Georgia and Montgomery Alabama were perpetrated after the signing of the Treaty of Cusseta A portion of the beleaguered Creeks many desperately poor and feeling abused and oppressed by their American neighbors struck back by carrying out occasional raids on area farms and committing other isolated acts of violence Escalating tensions erupted into open war with the United States after the destruction of the village of Roanoke Georgia located along the Chattahoochee River on the boundary between Creek and American territory in May During the so called Creek War of Secretary of War Lewis Cass dispatched General Winfield Scott to end the violence by forcibly removing the Creeks to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River With the Indian Removal Act of it continued into and after as in over Creeks were driven from their land for the last time of those Creeks did not survive the trip to Oklahoma where they eventually settled br br br Chickasaw monetary removal br br The Chickasaw received financial compensation from the United States for their lands east of the Mississippi River In the Chickasaws had reached an agreement to purchase land from the previously removed Choctaws after a bitter five year debate They paid the Choctaws equal to today for the westernmost part of the Choctaw land The first group of Chickasaws moved in and was led by John M Millard The Chickasaws gathered at Memphis on July with all of their assets belongings livestock and slaves Once across the Mississippi River they followed routes previously established by the Choctaws and the Creeks Once in Indian Territory the Chickasaws merged with the Choctaw nation br br br Cherokee forced relocation br br By about Cherokee had voluntarily relocated from Georgia to Indian Territory present day Oklahoma Forcible removals began in May when General Winfield Scott received a final order from President Martin Van Buren to relocate the remaining Cherokees Approximately Cherokees died in the ensuing trek to Oklahoma In the Cherokee language the event is called nu na da ul tsun yi the place where they cried or nu na hi du na tlo hi lu i the trail where they cried The Cherokee Trail of Tears resulted from the enforcement of the Treaty of New Echota an agreement signed under the provisions of the Indian Removal Act of which exchanged Indian land in the East for lands west of the Mississippi River but which was never accepted by the elected tribal leadership or a majority of the Cherokee people br There were significant changes in gender relations within the Cherokee Nation during the implementation of the Indian Removal Act during the s Cherokee historically operated on a matrilineal kinship system where children belonged to the clan of their mother and their only relatives were those who could be traced through her In addition to being matrilineal Cherokees were also matrilocal According to the naturalist William Bartram Marriage gives no right to the husband over the property of his wife and when they part she keeps the children and property belonging to them In this way the typical Cherokee family was structured in a way where the wife held possession to the property house and children However during the s and s Cherokees began adopting the Anglo American concept of power a political system dominated by wealthy highly acculturated men and supported by an ideology that made women subordinate br The Treaty of New Echota was largely signed by men While women were present at the rump council negotiating the treaty they did not have a seat at the table to participate in the proceedings Historian Theda Perdue explains that Cherokee women met in their own councils to discuss their own opinions despite not being able to participate The inability for women to join in on the negotiation and signing of the Treaty of New Echota shows how the role of women changed dramatically within Cherokee Nation following colonial encroachment For instance Cherokee women played a significant role in the negotiation of land transactions as late as where they spoke at a treaty conference held at Hopewell South Carolina to clarify and extend land cessions stemming from Cherokee support of the British in the American Revolution br The sparsely inhabited Cherokee lands were highly attractive to Georgian farmers experiencing population pressure and illegal settlements resulted Long simmering tensions between Georgia and the Cherokee Nation were brought to a crisis by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega Georgia in resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush the second gold rush in U S history Hopeful gold speculators began trespassing on Cherokee lands and pressure mounted to fulfill the Compact of in which the US Government promised to extinguish Indian land claims in the state of Georgia br When Georgia moved to extend state laws over Cherokee lands in the matter went to the U S Supreme Court In Cherokee Nation v Georgia the Marshall court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was not a sovereign and independent nation and therefore refused to hear the case However in Worcester v Georgia the Court ruled that Georgia could not impose laws in Cherokee territory since only the national government not state governments had authority in Indian affairs Worcester v Georgia is associated with Andrew Jackson s famous though apocryphal quote John Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it In reality this quote did not appear until years after the incident and was first printed in a textbook authored by Jackson critic Horace Greeley br br Fearing open warfare between federal troops and the Georgia militia Jackson decided not to enforce Cherokee claims against the state of Georgia He was already embroiled in a constitutional crisis with South Carolina i e the nullification crisis and favored Cherokee relocation over civil war With the Indian Removal Act of the U S Congress had given Jackson authority to negotiate removal treaties exchanging Indian land in the East for land west of the Mississippi River Jackson used the dispute with Georgia to put pressure on the Cherokees to sign a removal treaty br The final treaty passed in Congress by a single vote and signed by President Andrew Jackson was imposed by his successor President Martin Van Buren Van Buren allowed Georgia Tennessee North Carolina and Alabama an armed force of militiamen army regulars and volunteers under General Winfield Scott to relocate about Cherokees to Cleveland Tennessee After the initial roundup the U S military oversaw the emigration to Oklahoma Former Cherokee lands were immediately opened to settlement Most of the deaths during the journey were caused by disease malnutrition and exposure during an unusually cold winter br In the winter of the Cherokee began the mile km march with scant clothing and most on foot without shoes or moccasins The march began in Red Clay Tennessee the location of the last Eastern capital of the Cherokee Nation Because of the diseases the Indians were not allowed to go into any towns or villages along the way many times this meant traveling much farther to go around them After crossing Tennessee and Kentucky they arrived at the Ohio River across from Golconda in southern Illinois about the rd of December Here the starving Indians were charged a dollar a head equal to today to cross the river on Berry s Ferry which typically charged twelve cents equal to today They were not allowed passage until the ferry had serviced all others wishing to cross and were forced to take shelter under Mantle Rock a shelter bluff on the Kentucky side until Berry had nothing better to do Many died huddled together at Mantle Rock waiting to cross Several Cherokee were murdered by locals The Cherokee filed a lawsuit against the U S Government through the courthouse in Vienna suing the government for a head equal to today to bury the murdered Cherokee br As they crossed southern Illinois on December Martin Davis commissary agent for Moses Daniel s detachment wrote br br There is the coldest weather in Illinois I ever experienced anywhere The streams are all frozen over something like or inches or cm thick We are compelled to cut through the ice to get water for ourselves and animals It snows here every two or three days at the fartherest We are now camped in Mississippi River swamp miles km from the river and there is no possible chance of crossing the river for the numerous quantity of ice that comes floating down the river every day We have only traveled miles km on the last month including the time spent at this place which has been about three weeks It is unknown when we shall cross the river br A volunteer soldier from Georgia who participated in the removal recounted br br I fought through the civil war and have seen men shot to pieces and slaughtered by thousands but the Cherokee removal was the cruelest work I ever knew br br It eventually took almost three months to cross the miles kilometres on land between the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers The trek through southern Illinois is where the Cherokee suffered most of their deaths However a few years before forced removal some Cherokee who opted to leave their homes voluntarily chose a water based route through the Tennessee Ohio and Mississippi rivers It took only days but the Cherokee who were forcibly relocated were wary of water travel br Environmental researchers David Gaines and Jere Krakow outline the context of the tragic Cherokee relocation as one predicated on the difference between Indian regard for the land and its contrast with the Euro Americans view of land as property This divergence in perspective on land according to sociologists Gregory Hooks and Chad L Smith led to the homes of American Indian people being donated and sold off by the United States government to promote the settlement and development of the West with railroad developers white settlers land developers and mining companies assuming ownership In American Indian society according to Colville scholar Dina Gilio Whitaker it caused the loss of ancient connections to homelands and sacred sites the deaths of upward of percent of those on the trail and the loss of life sustaining livestock and crops br Dina Gilio Whitaker draws on research by Choctaw and Chippewa historian Clara Sue Kidwell to show the relationship between the Trail of Tears and a negative impact on the environment In tracking the environmental changes of the southeastern tribes who relocated to new lands across the Trail of Tears Kidwell finds that prior to removal the tribes had already begun adapting to a cash based private property economic system with their adoption of many European customs including the practice of slave owning after their move west they had become more deeply entrenched into the American economic system with the discovery of coal deposits and the western expansion of the railroads on and through their lands So while they adapted to their new environments their relationship to land would change to fit the needs of an imposed capitalist system Cherokee ethnobotanist Clint Carroll illustrates how this imposed capitalist system altered Cherokee efforts to protect traditional medicinal plants during relocation saying that these changes have resulted in contrasting land management paradigms rooted in the language of resource based versus relationship based approaches a binary imposed on tribal governments by the Bureau of Indian Affairs through their historically paternalistic relationship This shift in land management as a function of removal had negative environmental ramifications such as solidifying a deeply entrenched bureaucratic structure that still drives much of the federal tribal relationship and determines how tribal governments use their lands sometimes in ways that contribute to climate change and in extreme cases ways that lead to human rights abuses br In addition to a physical relocation American Indian removal and the Trail of Tears had social and cultural effects as American Indians were forced to contemplate abandonment of their native land To the Cherokees life was a part of the land Every rock every tree every place had a spirit And the spirit was central to the tribal lifeway To many the thought of loss of place was a thought of loss of self loss of Cherokeeness and a loss of life way This cultural shift is characterized by Gilio Whitaker as environmental deprivation a concept that relates to historical processes of land and resource dispossession calculated to bring about the destruction of Indigenous Americans lives and cultures Environmental deprivation in this sense refers to actions by settlers and settler governments that are designed to block Native peoples access to life giving and culture affirming resources The separation of American Indian people from their land lead to the loss of cultural knowledge and practices as described by scholar Rachel Robison Greene who finds the legacy of fifteenth century European colonial domination led to Indigenous knowledge and perspectives being ignored and denigrated by the vast majority of social physical biological and agricultural scientists and governments using colonial powers to exploit Indigenous resources Indigenous cultural and intellectual contribution to environmental issues in the form of a rich history cultural customs and practical wisdom regarding sustainable environmental practices can be lost because of Indigenous removal and the Trail of Tears according to Greene br Removed Cherokees initially settled near Tahlequah Oklahoma When signing the Treaty of New Echota in Major Ridge said I have signed my death warrant The resulting political turmoil led to the killings of Major Ridge John Ridge and Elias Boudinot of the leaders of the Treaty Party only Stand Watie escaped death The population of the Cherokee Nation eventually rebounded and today the Cherokees are the largest American Indian group in the United States br There were some exceptions to removal Approximately Cherokees evaded the U S soldiers and lived off the land in Georgia and other states Those Cherokees who lived on private individually owned lands rather than communally owned tribal land were not subject to removal In North Carolina about Cherokees sometimes referred to as the Oconaluftee Cherokee due to their settlement near to the river of the same name lived on land in the Great Smoky Mountains owned by a white man named William Holland Thomas who had been adopted by Cherokees as a boy and were thus not subject to removal Added to this were some Cherokee from the Nantahala area allowed to stay in the Qualla Boundary after assisting the U S Army in hunting down and capturing the family of the old prophet Tsali who was executed by a firing squad as were most of his family These North Carolina Cherokees became the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation br A local newspaper the Highland Messenger said July that between nine hundred and a thousand of these deluded beings are still hovering about the homes of their fathers in the counties of Macon and Cherokee and that they are a great annoyance to the citizens who wanted to buy land there believing the Cherokee were gone the newspaper reported that President Martin Van Buren said they are in his opinion free to go or stay br Several Cherokee speakers throughout history offered first hand accounts of the events of the Trail of Tears as well as provided insight into its lasting effects Elias Budinot Major Ridge Speckled Snake John Ross and Richard Taylor were all notable Cherokee orators during the th century who used the speech as a form of resistance against the U S government John Ross the Cherokee Chief from to and Major Ridge embarked on a speaking tour within the Cherokee Nation itself in hopes of strengthening a sense of unity amongst the tribal members Tribal unity was a central tenet to Cherokee resistance with Ross stating in his council address Much depends on our unity of sentiment and firmness of action in maintaining those sacred rights which we have ever enjoyed Cherokee speeches like this were made even more important because the state of Georgia made it illegal for members of American Indian tribes to both speak to an all white court and convince other Indian tribal members not to move br Another influential Cherokee figure was Cherokee writer John Ridge son of Major Ridge who wrote four articles using the pseudonym Socrates His works were published in the Cherokee Phoenix the nation s newspaper The choice of pseudonym according to literary scholar Kelly Wisecup facilitated a rhetorical structure that created not only a public persona recognizable to the Phoenix s multiple readerships but also a public character who argued forcefully that white readers should respect Cherokee rights and claims The main focal points of Ridge s articles critiqued the perceived hypocrisy of the U S government colonial history and the events leading up to the Trail of Tears using excerpts from American and European history and literature br br br Eastern Cherokee Restitution br The United States Court of Claims ruled in favor of the Eastern Cherokee Nation s claim against the U S on May This resulted in the appropriation of million equal to today to the Nation s eligible individuals and families Interior Department employee Guion Miller created a list using several rolls and applications to verify tribal enrollment for the distribution of funds known as the Guion Miller Roll The applications received documented over individuals the court approved more than individuals to share in the funds br br br Statistics br br br Legacy br br br Terminology br The events have sometimes been referred to as death marches in particular when referring to the Cherokee march across Tennessee Kentucky and Missouri in br Indians who had the means initially provided for their own removal Contingents that were led by conductors from the U S Army included those led by Edward Deas who was claimed to be a sympathizer for the Cherokee plight The largest death toll from the Cherokee forced relocation comes from the period after the May deadline This was at the point when the remaining Cherokee were rounded up into camps and placed into large groups often over in size Communicable diseases spread quickly through these closely quartered groups killing many These groups were among the last to move but following the same routes the others had taken the areas they were going through had been depleted of supplies due to the vast numbers that had gone before them The marchers were subject to extortion and violence along the route In addition these final contingents were forced to set out during the hottest and coldest months of the year killing many Exposure to the elements disease starvation harassment by local frontiersmen and insufficient rations similarly killed up to one third of the Choctaw and other nations on the march There exists some debate among historians and the affected nations as to whether the term Trail of Tears should be used to refer to the entire history of forced relocations from the Eastern United States into Indian Territory to the relocations of specifically the Five Civilized Tribes to the route of the march or to specific marches in which the remaining holdouts from each area were rounded up br br br Classification debate br There is debate among historians about how the Trial of Tears should be classified Some historians classify the events as a form of ethnic cleansing others refer to it as genocide br Historian and biographer Robert V Remini wrote that Jackson s policy on Native Americans was based on good intentions He writes Jackson fully expected the Indians to thrive in their new surroundings educate their children acquire the skills of white civilization so as to improve their living conditions and become citizens of the United States Removal in his mind would provide all these blessings Jackson genuinely believed that what he had accomplished rescued these people from inevitable annihilation Historian Sean Wilentz writes that some critics who label Indian removal as genocide view Jacksonian democracy as a momentous transition from the ethical community upheld by antiremoval men and says this view is a caricature of US history that turns tragedy into melodrama exaggerates parts at the expense of the whole and sacrifices nuance for sharpness Historian Donald B Cole too argues that it is difficult to find evidence of a conscious desire for genocide in Jackson s policy on Native Americans but dismisses the idea that Jackson was motivated by the welfare of Native Americans Colonial historian Daniel Blake Smith disagrees with the usage of the term genocide adding that no one wanted let alone planned for Cherokees to die in the forced removal out West br br Historian Justin D Murphy argues that Although the Trail of Tears was tragic it does not quite meet the standard of genocide and the extent to which tribes were allowed to retain their identity albeit by removal does not quite meet the standard of cultural genocide br In contrast some scholars have debated that the Trail of Tears was a genocidal act Historian Jeffrey Ostler argues that the threat of genocide was used to ensure Natives compliance with removal policies and concludes that In its outcome and in the means used to gain compliance the policy had genocidal dimensions Patrick Wolfe argues that settler colonialism and genocide are interrelated but should be distinguished from each other writing that settler colonialism is more than the summary liquidation of Indigenous people though it includes that Wolfe describes the assimilation of Indigenous people who escaped relocation and particularly their abandonment of collectivity as a form of cultural genocide though he emphasises that cultural genocide is the real thing in that it resulted in large numbers of deaths The Trail of Tears was thus a settler colonial replacement of Indigenous people and culture in addition to a genocidal mass killing according to Wolfe Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz describes the policy as genocide saying The fledgling United States government s method of dealing with native people a process which then included systematic genocide property theft and total subjugation reached its nadir in under the federal policy of President Andrew Jackson Mankiller emphasises that Jackson s policies were the natural extension of much earlier genocidal policies toward Native Americans established through territorial expansion during the Jefferson administration br Dina Gilio Whitaker in As Long as Grass Grows describes the Trail of Tears and the Din long walk as structural genocide because they destroyed Native relations to land one another and nonhuman beings which imperiled their culture life and history According to her these are ongoing actions that constitute both cultural and physical genocide br br br Landmarks and commemorations br br In about miles km of trails were authorized by federal law to mark the removal of detachments of the
