Alaska Natives also known as Alaskan Indians Alaskan Natives Native Alaskans Indigenous Alaskans Aboriginal Alaskans or First Alaskans are the Indigenous peoples of Alaska and include Alaskan Creoles I upiat Yupik Aleut Eyak Tlingit Haida Tsimshian and a number of Northern Athabaskan cultures They are often defined by their language groups Many Alaska Natives are enrolled in federally recognized Alaska Native tribal entities who in turn belong to Alaska Native Regional Corporations who administer land and financial claims br Ancestors of Native Alaskans or Alaska Natives migrated into the area thousands of years ago in at least two different waves Some are descendants of the third wave of migration in which people settled across the northern part of North America They never migrated to southern areas Genetic studies show they are not closely related to native peoples in South America br Alaska Natives came from Asia Anthropologists have stated that their journey from Asia to Alaska was made possible through the Bering land bridge or by traveling across the sea Throughout the Arctic and the circumpolar north the ancestors of Alaska Natives established varying indigenous complex cultures that have succeeded each other over time They developed sophisticated ways to deal with the challenging climate and environment br Historical groups have been defined by their languages which belong to several major language families Today Alaska Natives or Native Alaskans constitute more than of the population of Alaska br br br List of peoples br br Below is a full list of the different Alaska Native or Native Alaskan peoples who are largely defined by their historical languages within each culture are different tribes br br br Demographics br The Alaska Natives Commission estimated there were about Alaska Natives living in Alaska in with another who lived outside Alaska A study by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development documented more than Alaska Native people in Alaska While the majority of Alaska Natives live in small villages or remote regional hubs such as Nome Dillingham and Bethel the percentage who live in urban areas has been increasing In lived in urban areas compared to in the census As of natives constitute of the overall Alaskan population br br br History br The modern history of Alaska Natives begins with the first contact between Alaskan First Nations and Russians sailing from Siberia in the eighteenth century British and American traders coming mostly from eastern settlements in North America generally did not reach the area until the nineteenth century In some cases Christian missionaries were not active in Alaska until the twentieth century br br br Russian colonial period br Vitus Bering spotted Alaska during an expedition Native Alaskans first came into contact with Russians in the th century Time of contact with Russians varied throughout each native group since the Native Alaskan groups were spread throughout Alaska Arriving from Siberia by ship in the mid eighteenth century Russians began to trade with Alaska Natives in what became known as the Aleutian Islands They started new settlements around trading posts and Russian Orthodox missionaries were part of these The Russian missionaries were the first persons to translate Christian scripture into Native languages such as Tlingit In the st century the numerous congregations of Russian Orthodox Christians in Alaska reflect this early history as they are generally composed mostly of Alaska Natives br Rather than hunting and harvesting marine life themselves the Sibero Russian promyshlenniki forced the Aleuts to do the work for them enserfing the Aleuts As word spread of the riches in furs to be had competition among Russian companies increased Catherine the Great who became Empress in proclaimed good will toward the Aleut and urged her subjects to treat them fairly The growing competition between the trading companies which merged into fewer larger and more powerful corporations created conflicts that aggravated the relations with the indigenous populations Over the years the situation became catastrophic for the Aleuts as well as other Native Alaskan people who were impacted by Russian contact br As the animal populations declined the Aleuts already dependent on the new barter economy created by their fur trade with the Russians were increasingly coerced into taking greater risks in the dangerous waters of the North Pacific to hunt for more otter As the Shelikhov Golikov Company and later Russian American Company developed as a monopoly it used skirmishes and systematic violence as a tool of colonial exploitation of the indigenous people When the Aleut revolted and won some victories the Russians retaliated killing many They also destroyed the peoples boats and hunting gear leaving them no means of survival br The greatest mortality was caused by the Aleuts encounters with new diseases during the first two generations AD of Russian contact percent of the Aleut population died from Eurasian infectious diseases These had been endemic among the Europeans for centuries but the Aleut had no immunity against the new diseases br br br Effects of Russian colonization br br The Russian Tsarist government expanded into Indigenous territory in present day Alaska for its own geopolitical reasons It consumed natural resources of the territory during the trading years and Russian Orthodoxy was evangelized Their movement into these populated areas of Indigenous communities altered the demographic and natural landscape br Historians have suggested that the Russian American Company exploited Indigenous peoples as a source of inexpensive labor The Russian American Company not only used Indigenous populations for labor during the fur trade but also held some as hostages to acquire iasak Iasak a form of taxation imposed by the Russians was a tribute in the form of otter pelts It was a taxation method the Russians had previously found useful in their early encounter with Indigenous communities of Siberia during the Siberian fur trade Beaver pelts were also customary to be given to fur traders upon first contact with various communities br The Russian American Company used military force on Indigenous families taking them as hostage until male community members produced furs for them Otter furs on Kodiak Island and Aleutian Islands enticed the Russians to start these taxations Robbery and maltreatment in the form of corporal punishment and the withholding of food was also present upon the arrival of fur traders Catherine the Great dissolved the giving of tribute in but her government initiated mandatory conscription of Indigenous men between the ages of and to become seal hunters strictly for the Russian American Company This mandatory labor gave the Russian American Company an edge in competition with American and British fur traders But the conscription separated men from their families and villages thus altering and breaking down communities With able bodied men away on the hunt villages were left with little protection as only women children and the elderly remained behind br In addition to changes that came with conscription the spread of disease also altered the populations of Indigenous communities Although records kept in the period were scarce it has been said that of the pre contact population of the Aleut people were gone by br Relationships between Indigenous women and fur traders increased as Indigenous men were away from villages This resulted in marriages and children that would come to be known as Creole peoples children who were Indigenous and Russian To reduce hostilities with Aleutian communities it became policy for fur traders to enter into marriage with Indigenous women The Creole population increased in the territory controlled by the Russian American Company br The growth of the Russian Orthodox Church was another important tactic in the colonization and conversion of Indigenous populations Ioann Veniaminov who later became Saint Innocent of Alaska was an important missionary who carried out the Orthodox Church s agenda to Christianize Indigenous populations The church encouraged Creole children to follow Russian Orthodox Christianity while the Russian American Company provided them with an education Many Orthodox missionaries like Herman of Alaska defended Natives from exploitation Creole people were believed to have high levels of loyalty toward the Russian crown and Russian American Company After completing their education children were often sent to Russia where they would study skills such as mapmaking theology and military intelligence In the s Russia lost much of its interest in Alaska br br br American colonialism br br Alaska has many natural resources which including its gold caught the attention of the United States In the United States purchased Alaska from Russia It did not consider the wishes of Native Alaskans or view them as citizens The land that belonged to Alaska Natives was considered to be open land which could be claimed by white settlers without redress to the Alaska Natives living there The only schools for Alaska Natives were those founded by religious missionaries Most white settlers did not understand the sophisticated cultures the Alaska Natives had developed to live in challenging environment and considered them to be inferior to European Americans correlating with white supremacist beliefs br The Klondike Gold Rush occurred in the increasing white presence in Alaska as well as discriminatory practices Americans imposed racial segregation and discriminatory laws similar to Jim Crow laws that limited Alaska Native opportunities and participation in culture treating them as second class citizens With the imposition of discriminatory laws segregation amongst Alaskan Natives and Americans occurred for example whites only signs excluded natives from entering buildings There were also segregated schools An court case describes a child not allowed to attend a school with Americans because his stepfather was native A child that was part native and part American would only be allowed to attend a school with American children if the family has abandoned their culture This means that they could no longer speak their native language wear traditional native clothing be amongst other natives eat native foods or practice any native religion br In the Alaska Native Brotherhood ANB was formed to help fight for citizenship rights The Alaska Native Sisterhood ANS was created in Also in the Alaska Territorial legislature passed a law allowing Alaskan Natives the right to vote but on the condition that they give up their cultural customs and traditions The Indian Citizenship Act passed in gave all Native Americans United States citizenship br ANB began to hold a great deal of political power in the s They protested the segregation of Alaska Natives in public areas and institutions and also staged boycotts Alberta Schenck Inupiaq staged a well publicized protest against segregation in a movie theater in With the help of Elizabeth Peratrovich Tlingit the Alaska Equal Rights Act of was passed ending segregation in Alaska br In during World War II the United States forced evacuation of around nine hundred Aleuts from the Aleutian Islands The idea was to remove the Aleuts from a potential combat zone during World War II for their own protection but European Americans living in the same area were not forced to leave The removal was handled so poorly that many Aleuts died after they were evacuated the elderly and children had the highest mortality rates Survivors returned to the islands to find their homes and possessions destroyed or looted Civil rights activists such as Alberta Schenck Adams and Elizabeth Peratrovich protested discriminatory laws against Native Alaskans with what were effectively sit ins and lobbying br The Alaska Equal Rights Act of the first anti discrimination state law in the U S occurred as a result of these protests It entitled all Alaskans to full and equal enjoyment of public areas and businesses a ban on segregating signs with discriminatory actions punishable by a fine and up to days in jail br Alaska became part of the United States in upon President Dwight D Eisenhower recognizing Alaska as the th state br br br ANCSA and since to present br br In with the support of Alaska Native leaders such as Emil Notti Willie Hensley and Byron Mallott the U S Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act ANCSA which settled land and financial claims for lands and resources which the Alaska Natives had lost to European Americans It provided for the establishment of thirteen Alaska Native Regional Corporations to administer those claims Similar to the separately defined status of the Canadian Inuit and First Nations in Canada which are recognized as distinct peoples in the United States Alaska Natives or Native Alaskans are in some respects treated separately by the government from other Native Americans in the United States This is in part related to their interactions with the U S government which occurred in a different historical period than its interactions during the period of westward expansion during the th century br Europeans and Americans did not have sustained encounters with the Alaska Natives until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when many were attracted to the region in gold rushes The Alaska Natives were not allotted individual title in severalty to land under the Dawes Act of but were instead treated under the Alaska Native Allotment Act of br The Allotment Act was repealed in following ANSCA at which time reservations were ended Another characteristic difference is that Alaska Native tribal governments do not have the power to collect taxes for business transacted on tribal land per the United States Supreme Court decision in Alaska v Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government Except for the Tsimshian Alaska Natives no longer hold reservations but do control some lands Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of Alaska Natives are reserved the right to harvest whales and other marine mammals br br br Climate change br br Four indigenous tribes in Alaska the Shishmaref Kivalina Shaktoolik and Newtok tribes are being considered the first climate refugees for America due to sea ice melting and increased wildfires in the regions Bronen and Brubaker The effects of climate change on the people of Alaska are extensive and include issues such as increased vulnerability to disease mental health issues injury food insecurity and water insecurity Brubaker According to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA the loss of sea ice will increase erosion area and further displace more native communities The melting sea ice will also affect the migration of some animals that the tribes rely on and with the ice melting there will be no place to store the food that they do obtain EPA Due to the permafrost melting the infrastructure that has been around in the past will become unstable and native villages will collapse EPA br The Shishmaref Kivalina Shaktoolik and Newtok tribes are located on the west coast of Alaska and due to sea level rise the villages are experiencing more severe storm surges that are eroding their coastlines Bronen There is no land for these tribes to move to that are already in the area they live in which forces these communities to migrate and change their whole way of living Bronen It is predicted that a climate event will submerge the tribes completely in less than fifteen years Bronen br Extreme weather conditions has increased the risk of injury usually there are thick layers of ice all year long but due to increasing temperatures in the atmosphere and the sea the ice is becoming thinner and is increasing the number of people who fall through the ice if a person survives falling through the ice they are faced with other health concerns Brubaker Increased water insecurity and failing infrastructure caused by climate change has created sanitation issues which has increased the amount of respiratory illnesses in many regions in Alaska in pneumonia was the leading cause of hospitalizations Brubaker Many of the affected tribes are experiencing increased mental stress due to climate change and the problem of relocating but no policy or way to relocate Brubaker Stress has also increased on villages who face infrastructure damage due to melting permafrost there are almost no regulations other than the Alaskan government recommended not building on permafrost or using extra layers of insulation that is used on foundation walls EPA Food insecurity has also created stress and health issues families can not get enough food due to animals also relocating to get to a climate that is more suitable to them Brubaker Families also do not have a secure food system because their ways of storing food underground ice cellar are no longer frozen year long due to climate change their cellars thaw in the summers leaving their food supply inedible br br br Subsistence br br Gathering of subsistence food continues to be an important economic and cultural activity for many Alaska Natives In Utqia vik Alaska in more than percent of the I upiat households which were interviewed still participated in the local subsistence economy compared with the approximately percent of non I upiat households who used wild resources obtained from hunting fishing or gathering br But unlike many tribes in the contiguous United States Alaska Natives or Native Alaskans do not have treaties with the United States that protect their subsistence rights except for the right to harvest whales and other marine mammals The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act explicitly extinguished aboriginal hunting and fishing rights in the state of Alaska br br br See also br br List of Alaska Native Tribal Entities the list of Native Villages and other tribal entities recognized
