austerity measure to save money during the Great Depression Fulton County annexed Milton County to the north and Campbell County to the southwest to centralize administration That resulted in the current long shape of the county along miles km of the Chattahoochee River On May of that year neighboring Cobb County ceded the city of Roswell and lands lying east of Willeo Creek to Fulton County

Congress br br br Georgia General Assembly br br br Georgia State Senate br br br Georgia House of Representatives br br br Politics br Atlanta is the largest city in Fulton County occupying the county s narrow center section and thus geographically dividing the county s northern and southern portions Atlanta s last major annexation in brought over square miles km into the city including the affluent suburb of Buckhead br The movement to create a city of Sandy Springs launched in the early s and reaching fruition in was largely an effort to prevent additional annexations by the city of Atlanta and later to wrest local control from the county commission br Fulton County is one of the most reliably Democratic counties in the entire nation It has voted Democratic in every presidential election since except those of and in when George McGovern could not win a single county in Georgia The demographic character of the Democratic Party has changed as conservative whites previously its chief members in the South have mostly shifted to the Republican Party In Fulton County Democrats are composed primarily of liberal urbanites of various ethnicities and a growing contingent of suburban voters Fulton is served by Representatives in the U S House with David Scott representing the southern suburbs Lucy McBath representing Johns Creek and John Lewis representing the core of Atlanta until his death on July Lewis was succeeded by Nikema Williams Republican Rich McCormick represents most of North Fulton br br br Taxation br Geographically remote from each other the northern and southern sections of the county have grown increasingly at odds over issues related to taxes and distribution of services Residents of the affluent areas of North Fulton have increasingly complained that the Fulton County Board of Commissioners has ignored their needs taking taxes collected in North Fulton and spending them on programs and services in less wealthy South Fulton In responding to pressure from North Fulton the Georgia General Assembly directed Fulton County alone among all the counties in the state to limit the expenditure of funds to the geographic region of the county where they were collected The Fulton County Commission contested this law known as the Shafer Amendment after Sen David Shafer Republican from Duluth in a lawsuit that went to the Georgia Supreme Court On June the Court upheld the law ruling that the Shafer Amendment was constitutional br The creation of the city of Sandy Springs stimulated the founding of two additional cities resulting in no unincorporated areas remaining in north Fulton In a domino effect the residents of southwest Fulton voted in referendums to create additional cities In one of these two referendums passed and the other was defeated but later passed in br br br Municipalization br br Since the s residents of Sandy Springs had waged a long running battle to incorporate their community as a city which would make it independent of county council control They were repeatedly blocked in the state legislature by Atlanta Democrats but when control of state government switched to suburban Republicans after the and elections the movement to charter the city picked up steam br br The General Assembly approved creation of the city in and for this case it suspended an existing state law that prohibited new cities the only type of municipality in the state from being within three miles km of an existing one The citizens of Sandy Springs voted in favor of ratifying the city charter in a referendum held on June The new city was officially incorporated later that year at midnight on December br br Creation of Sandy Springs was a catalyst for municipalization of the entire county in which local groups would attempt to incorporate every area into a city Such a result would essentially eliminate the county s home rule powers granted statewide by a constitutional amendment to the Georgia State Constitution in the s to act as a municipality in unincorporated areas and return it to being entirely the local extension of state government br In the General Assembly approved creation of two new cities Milton and Johns Creek which completed municipalization of North Fulton The charters of these two new cities were ratified overwhelmingly in a referendum held July br Voters in the Chattahoochee Hills community of southwest Fulton west of Cascade Palmetto Highway voted overwhelmingly to incorporate in June The city became incorporated on December br The General Assembly approved a proposal to form a new city called South Fulton Its proposed boundaries were to include those areas still unincorporated on July As a direct result of possibly being permanently landlocked many of the existing cities proposed annexations while some communities drew up incorporation plans br Voters in the area defined as the proposed city of South Fulton overwhelmingly rejected cityhood in September It was the only remaining unincorporated section of the county until the residents voted in November to incorporate as the city of South Fulton Georgia Prior to that vote North Fulton which is overwhelmingly Republican and members of the state legislature had discussed forcing South Fulton residents to incorporate as a city in order to force Fulton County out of the municipal services business br br br Secession br Some residents of suburban north Fulton have advocated since the early s that they be allowed to secede and re form Milton County after the county that was absorbed into Fulton County in during the Great Depression Fulton County in comparison to the state s other counties is physically large Its population is greater than that of each of the six smallest U S states br The demographic make up of Fulton County has changed considerably in recent decades The northern portion of the county a suburban area is among the most affluent areas in the nation and is majority white It was formerly a Republican stronghold but has seen a shift toward the Democratic Party since the early s In Lucy McBath won the th Congressional District the majority of which is in North Fulton The central and southern portion of the county which includes the city of Atlanta and its core satellite cities to the south is overwhelmingly Democratic and majority black It contains some of the poorest sections in the metropolitan area but also has wealthy sections particularly in Midtown Atlanta many east Atlanta neighborhoods and in the suburban neighborhoods along Cascade Road beyond I Cascade Heights and Sandtown located in the southwest region of Fulton County are predominantly affluent African American in population br The chief opponents to the proposed division of the county comes from the residents of south Fulton County who say that the proposed separation is racially motivated State Senator Vincent Fort an Atlanta Democrat and a member of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus very strongly opposes the plan to split the county If it gets to the floor there will be blood on the walls Fort stated As much as you would like to think it s not racial it s difficult to draw any other conclusion he later added br In a political firestorm broke out in Atlanta when State Senator Sam Zamarripa Democrat from Atlanta suggested that the cities in North Fulton be allowed to secede and form Milton County in exchange for Atlanta and Fulton County consolidating their governments into a new Atlanta County South Fulton residents were strongly opposed to Fulton County s possible future division br br br Taxes br Fulton County has a total sales tax including state SPLOST homestead exemption and MARTA Sales taxes apply through the entire county and its cities except for Atlanta s additional Municipal Option Sales Tax to fund capital improvements to its combined wastewater sewer systems laying new pipes to separate storm sewers from sanitary sewers and to its drinking water system Fulton County has lowered its general fund millage rate by over an eight year period br In early the state s first and so far only fractional percent sales taxes took effect in Fulton Atlanta added an additional for MARTA and TSPLOST for other transportation projects while anti transit Republican legislators from north Fulton blocked a countywide referendum on improving and extending MARTA and instead allowed only a vote on a TSPLOST for more roads in the areas outside Atlanta This puts the total sales tax at in Atlanta and in the rest of the county with less on
