title: Great Depression
id: 19283335
The Great Depression was a severe global economic downturn that affected many countries across the world It became evident after a sharp decline in stock prices in the United States leading to a period of economic depression The economic contagion began around September and led to the Wall Street stock market crash of October Black Tuesday This crisis marked the start of a prolonged period of economic hardship characterized by high unemployment rates and widespread business failures br Between and worldwide gross domestic product GDP fell by an estimated By comparison worldwide GDP fell by less than from to during the Great Recession Some economies started to recover by the mid s However in many countries the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II Devastating effects were seen in both rich and poor countries with falling personal income prices tax revenues and profits International trade fell by more than unemployment in the U S rose to and in some countries rose as high as Cities around the world were hit hard especially those dependent on heavy industry Construction was virtually halted in many countries Farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by about Faced with plummeting demand and few job alternatives areas dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most br Economic historians usually consider the catalyst of the Great Depression to be the devastating Wall Street Crash However some dispute this seeing the crash less as a cause of the Depression and more a symptom of the rising nervousness of investors partly due to gradual price declines caused by falling sales of consumer goods as a result of overproduction because of new production techniques falling exports and income inequality among other factors that had already been underway as part of a gradual depression br br br Overview br br After the Wall Street Crash of where the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped from to over the course of two months optimism persisted for some time The stock market rose in early with the Dow returning to pre depression levels in April before steadily declining for years to a low of in br At the beginning governments and businesses spent more in the first half of than in the corresponding period of the previous year On the other hand consumers many of whom suffered severe losses in the stock market the previous year cut expenditures by In addition beginning in the mid s a severe drought ravaged the agricultural heartland of the U S br Interest rates dropped to low levels by mid but expected deflation and the continuing reluctance of people to borrow meant that consumer spending and investment remained low By May automobile sales declined to below the levels of Prices in general began to decline although wages held steady in Then a deflationary spiral started in Farmers faced a worse outlook declining crop prices and a Great Plains drought crippled their economic outlook At its peak the Great Depression saw nearly of all Great Plains farms change hands despite federal assistance br The decline in the U S economy was the factor that pulled down most other countries at first then internal weaknesses or strengths in each country made conditions worse or better Frantic attempts by individual countries to shore up their economies through protectionist policies such as the U S Smoot Hawley Tariff Act and retaliatory tariffs in other countries exacerbated the collapse in global trade contributing to the depression By the economic decline pushed world trade to one third of its level compared to four years earlier br br br Economic indicators br br br Course br br br Origins br Because the Great Depression began in the United States and then spread around the world the origins of the Great Depression are examined in the context of the United States economy In the aftermath of World War I the Roaring Twenties had brought considerable wealth to the United States and Western Europe The year dawned with considerable economic progress in the American economy A small stock crash occurred on March but the crash was stabilized Despite signs of economic trouble the market continued to improve through September Stock prices began to slump in September and were volatile at the end of September A large sell off of stocks began in mid October Finally on October Black Thursday the American stock market crashed at the opening bell Actions to stabilize the market failed and on October Black Monday the market crashed another The panic peaked the next day on Black Tuesday when the market saw another drop Thousands of investors were ruined and billions of dollars had been lost many stocks could not be sold at any price The market recovered on Wednesday but the damage had been done Though the market recovered from November until April it entered a prolonged slump From April until July the market lost of its value Despite the crash the worst of the crisis did not reverberate around the world until after The crisis hit panic levels again in December with a bank run on the Bank of United States privately run no relation to the government Unable to pay out to all of its creditors the bank failed Among the American banks that closed in November and December the Bank of United States accounted for a third of the total million deposits lost and with its closure bank failures reached a critical mass br br br The Smoot Hawley act and the breakdown of international trade br br The Smoot Hawley Tariff Act was passed in the United States on June having been proposed the year prior Ostensibly aimed at protecting the American economy as the Depression began to take root it backfired enormously and may have even caused the Depression The consensus view among economists and economic historians including Keynesians Monetarists and Austrian economists is that the passage of the Smoot Hawley Tariff exacerbated the Great Depression although there is disagreement as to how much In the popular view the Smoot Hawley Tariff was a leading cause of the depression In a survey of American economic historians two thirds agreed that the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act at least worsened the Great Depression According to the U S Senate website the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act is among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history br Many economists have argued that the sharp decline in international trade after helped to worsen the depression especially for countries significantly dependent on foreign trade Most historians and economists blame the Act for worsening the depression by seriously reducing international trade and causing retaliatory tariffs in other countries While foreign trade was a small part of overall economic activity in the U S and was concentrated in a few businesses like farming it was a much larger factor in many other countries The average ad valorem value based rate of duties on dutiable imports for was but under the new tariff it jumped to during In dollar terms American exports declined over the next four years from about billion in to billion in so not only did the physical volume of exports fall but also the prices fell by about as written Hardest hit were farm commodities such as wheat cotton tobacco and lumber br Governments around the world took various steps into spending less money on foreign goods such as imposing tariffs import quotas and exchange controls These restrictions triggered much tension among countries that had large amounts of bilateral trade causing major export import reductions during the depression Not all governments enforced the same measures of protectionism Some countries raised tariffs drastically and enforced severe restrictions on foreign exchange transactions while other countries reduced trade and exchange restrictions only marginally br br Countries that remained on the gold standard keeping currencies fixed were more likely to restrict foreign trade These countries resorted to protectionist policies to strengthen the balance of payments and limit gold losses They hoped that these restrictions and depletions would hold the economic decline br Countries that abandoned the gold standard allowed their currencies to depreciate which caused their balance of payments to strengthen It also freed up monetary policy so that central banks could lower interest rates and act as lenders of last resort They possessed the best policy instruments to fight the Depression and did not need protectionism br The length and depth of a country s economic downturn and the timing and vigor of its recovery are related to how long it remained on the gold standard Countries abandoning the gold standard relatively early experienced relatively mild recessions and early recoveries In contrast countries remaining on the gold standard experienced prolonged slumps br br br The gold standard and the spreading of global depression br The gold standard was the primary transmission mechanism of the Great Depression Even countries that did not face bank failures and a monetary contraction first hand were forced to join the deflationary policy since higher interest rates in countries that performed a deflationary policy led to a gold outflow in countries with lower interest rates Under the gold standard s price specie flow mechanism countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline deflation br There is also consensus that protectionist policies and primarily the passage of the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act helped to exacerbate or even cause the Great Depression br br br Gold standard br br Some economic studies have indicated that just as the downturn was spread worldwide by the rigidities of the gold standard it was suspending gold convertibility or devaluing the currency in gold terms that did the most to make recovery possible br Every major currency left the gold standard during the Great Depression The UK was the first to do so Facing speculative attacks on the pound and depleting gold reserves in September the Bank of England ceased exchanging pound notes for gold and the pound was floated on foreign exchange markets br Japan and the Scandinavian countries joined the United Kingdom in leaving the gold standard in Other countries such as Italy and the United States remained on the gold standard into or while a few countries in the so called gold bloc led by France and including Poland Belgium and Switzerland stayed on the standard until br According to later analysis the earliness with which a country left the gold standard reliably predicted its economic recovery For example The UK and Scandinavia which left the gold standard in recovered much earlier than France and Belgium which remained on gold much longer Countries such as China which had a silver standard almost avoided the depression entirely The connection between leaving the gold standard as a strong predictor of that country s severity of its depression and the length of time of its recovery has been shown to be consistent for dozens of countries including developing countries This partly explains why the experience and length of the depression differed between regions and states around the world br br br German banking crisis of and British crisis br The financial crisis escalated out of control in mid starting with the collapse of the Credit Anstalt in Vienna in May This put heavy pressure on Germany which was already in political turmoil With the rise in violence of National Socialist Nazi and Communist movements as well as investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies investors withdrew their short term money from Germany as confidence spiraled downward The Reichsbank lost million marks in the first week of June million in the second and million in two days June Collapse was at hand U S President Herbert Hoover called for a moratorium on Payment of war reparations This angered Paris which depended on a steady flow of German payments but it slowed the crisis down and the moratorium was agreed to in July An International conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on August a standstill agreement froze Germany s foreign liabilities for six months Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England The funding only slowed the process Industrial failures began in Germany a major bank closed in July and a two day holiday for all German banks was declared Business failures were more frequent in July and spread to Romania and Hungary The crisis continued to get worse in Germany bringing political upheaval that finally led to the coming to power of Hitler s Nazi regime in January br The world financial crisis now began to overwhelm Britain investors around the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of million per day Credits of million each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of million fiduciary note slowed but did not reverse the British crisis The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August With deficits mounting the bankers demanded a balanced budget the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald s Labour government agreed it proposed to raise taxes cut spending and most controversially to cut unemployment benefits The attack on welfare was unacceptable to the Labour movement MacDonald wanted to resign but King George V insisted he remain and form an all party coalition National Government The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on along with a small cadre of Labour but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government Britain went off the gold standard and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression In the British election the Labour Party was virtually destroyed leaving MacDonald as prime minister for a largely Conservative coalition br br br Turning point and recovery br br In most countries of the world recovery from the Great Depression began in In the U S recovery began in early but the U S did not return to GNP for over a decade and still had an unemployment rate of about in albeit down from the high of in br There is no consensus among economists regarding the motive force for the U S economic expansion that continued through most of the Roosevelt years and the recession that interrupted it The common view among most economists is that Roosevelt s New Deal policies either caused or accelerated the recovery although his policies were never aggressive enough to bring the economy completely out of recession Some economists have also called attention to the positive effects from expectations of reflation and rising nominal interest rates that Roosevelt s words and actions portended It was the rollback of those same reflationary policies that led to the interruption of a recession beginning in late One contributing policy that reversed reflation was the Banking Act of which effectively raised reserve requirements causing a monetary contraction that helped to thwart the recovery GDP returned to its upward trend in A revisionist view among some economists holds that the New Deal prolonged the Great Depression as they argue that National Industrial Recovery Act of and National Labor Relations Act of restricted competition and established price fixing John Maynard Keynes did not think that the New Deal under Roosevelt single handedly ended the Great Depression It is it seems politically impossible for a capitalistic democracy to organize expenditure on the scale necessary to make the grand experiments which would prove my case except in war conditions br According to Christina Romer the money supply growth caused by huge international gold inflows was a crucial source of the recovery of the United States economy and that the economy showed little sign of self correction The gold inflows were partly due to devaluation of the U S dollar and partly due to deterioration of the political situation in Europe In their book A Monetary History of the United States Milton Friedman and Anna J Schwartz also attributed the recovery to monetary factors and contended that it was much slowed by poor management of money by the Federal Reserve System Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke agreed that monetary factors played important roles both in the worldwide economic decline and eventual recovery Bernanke also saw a strong role for institutional factors particularly the rebuilding and restructuring of the financial system and pointed out that the Depression should be examined in an international perspective br br br Role of women and household economics br Women s primary role was as housewives without a steady flow of family income their work became much harder in dealing with food and clothing and medical care Birthrates fell everywhere as children were postponed until families could financially support them The average birthrate for major countries fell from births per thousand population in to in In Canada half of Roman Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births br Among the few women in the labor force layoffs were less common in the white collar jobs and they were typically found in light manufacturing work However there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job so that wives might lose employment if their husband was employed Across Britain there was a tendency for married women to join the labor force competing for part time jobs especially br In France very slow population growth especially in comparison to Germany continued to be a serious issue in the s Support for increasing welfare programs during the depression included a focus on women in the family The Conseil Sup rieur de la Natalit campaigned for provisions enacted in the Code de la Famille that increased state assistance to families with children and required employers to protect the jobs of fathers even if they were immigrants br In rural and small town areas women expanded their operation of vegetable gardens to include as much food production as possible In the United States agricultural organizations sponsored programs to teach housewives how to optimize their gardens and to raise poultry for meat and eggs Rural women made feed sack dresses and other items for themselves and their families and homes from feed sacks In American cities African American women quiltmakers enlarged their activities promoted collaboration and trained neophytes Quilts were created for practical use from various inexpensive materials and increased social interaction for women and promoted camaraderie and personal fulfillment br Oral history provides evidence for how housewives in a modern industrial city handled shortages of money and resources Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families Cheap foods were used such as soups beans and noodles They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat sometimes even horse meat and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups They sewed and patched clothing traded with their neighbors for outgrown items and made do with colder homes New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days Many women also worked outside the home or took boarders did laundry for trade or cash and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer Extended families used mutual aid extra food spare rooms repair work cash loans to help cousins and in laws br In Japan official government policy was deflationary and the opposite of Keynesian spending Consequently the government launched a campaign across the country to induce households to reduce their consumption focusing attention on spending by housewives br In Germany the government tried to reshape private household consumption under the Four Year Plan of to achieve German economic self sufficiency The Nazi women s organizations other propaganda agencies and the authorities all attempted to shape such consumption as economic self sufficiency was needed to prepare for and to sustain the coming war The organizations propaganda agencies and authorities employed slogans that called up traditional values of thrift and healthy living However these efforts were only partly successful in changing the behavior of housewives br br br World War II and recovery br br The common view among economic historians is that the Great Depression ended with the advent of World War II Many economists believe that government spending on the war caused or at least accelerated recovery from the Great Depression though some consider that it did not play a very large role in the recovery though it did help in reducing unemployment br The rearmament policies leading up to World War II helped stimulate the economies of Europe in By unemployment in Britain had fallen to million The mobilization of manpower following the outbreak of war in ended unemployment br The American mobilization for World War II at the end of moved approximately ten million people out of the civilian labor force and into the war br This finally eliminated the last effects from the Great Depression and brought the U S unemployment rate down below br World War II had a dramatic effect on many parts of the American economy Government financed capital spending accounted for only of the annual U S investment in industrial capital in by the government accounted for of U S capital investment The massive war spending doubled economic growth rates either masking the effects of the Depression or essentially ending the Depression Businessmen ignored the mounting national debt and heavy new taxes redoubling their efforts for greater output to take advantage of generous government contracts br br br Causes br br The two classic competing economic theories of the Great Depression are the Keynesian demand driven and the Monetarist explanation There are also various heterodox theories that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists The consensus among demand driven theories is that a large scale loss of confidence led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending Once panic and deflation set in many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets Holding money became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods exacerbating the drop in demand Monetarists believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession but the shrinking of the money supply greatly exacerbated the economic situation causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression br Economists and economic historians are almost evenly split as to whether the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending particularly investment is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression Today there is also significant academic support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that building on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz add non monetary explanations br There is a consensus that the Federal Reserve System should have cut short the process of monetary deflation and banking collapse by expanding the money supply and acting as lender of last resort If they had done this the economic downturn would have been far less severe and much shorter br br br Mainstream explanations br Modern mainstream economists see the reasons in br br A money supply reduction Monetarists and therefore a banking crisis reduction of credit and bankruptcies br Insufficient demand from the private sector and insufficient fiscal spending Keynesians br Passage of the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act exacerbated what otherwise might have been a more standard recession both Monetarists and Keynesians br Insufficient spending the money supply reduction and debt on margin led to falling prices and further bankruptcies Irving Fisher s debt deflation br br br Monetarist view br br The monetarist explanation was given by American economists Milton Friedman and Anna J Schwartz They argued that the Great Depression was caused by the banking crisis that caused one third of all banks to vanish a reduction of bank shareholder wealth and more importantly monetary contraction of which they called The Great Contraction This caused a price drop of deflation By not lowering interest rates by not increasing the monetary base and by not injecting liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling the Federal Reserve passively watched the transformation of a normal recession into the Great Depression Friedman and Schwartz argued that the downward turn in the economy starting with the stock market crash would merely have been an ordinary recession if the Federal Reserve had taken aggressive action This view was endorsed in by Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke in a speech honoring Friedman and Schwartz with this statement br br Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve I would like to say to Milton and Anna Regarding the Great Depression you re right We did it We re very sorry But thanks to you we won t do it again br The Federal Reserve allowed some large public bank failures particularly that of the New York Bank of United States which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed Friedman and Schwartz argued that if the Fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks or simply bought government bonds on the open market to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell all the rest of the banks would not have fallen after the large ones did and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did br With significantly less money to go around businesses could not get new loans and could not even get their old loans renewed forcing many to stop investing This interpretation blames the Federal Reserve for inaction especially the New York branch br One reason why the Federal Reserve did not act to limit the decline of the money supply was the gold standard At that time the amount of credit the Federal Reserve could issue was limited by the Federal Reserve Act which required gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued By the late s the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession This credit was in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes A promise of gold is not as good as gold in the hand particularly when they only had enough gold to cover of the Federal Reserve Notes outstanding During the bank panics a portion of those demand notes was redeemed for Federal Reserve gold Since the Federal Reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a greater reduction in credit On April President Roosevelt signed Executive Order making the private ownership of gold certificates coins and bullion illegal reducing the pressure on Federal Reserve gold br br br Keynesian view br British economist John Maynard Keynes argued in The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money that lower aggregate expenditures in the economy contributed to a massive decline in income and to employment that was well below the average In such a situation the economy reached equilibrium at low levels of economic activity and high unemployment br Keynes s basic idea was simple to keep people fully employed governments have to run deficits when the economy is slowing as the private sector would not invest enough to keep production at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession Keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis to pick up the slack by increasing government spending or cutting taxes br As the Depression wore on Franklin D Roosevelt tried public works farm subsidies and other devices to restart the U S economy but never completely gave up trying to balance the budget According to the Keynesians this improved the economy but Roosevelt never spent enough to bring the economy out of recession until the start of World War II br br br Debt deflation br br Irving Fisher argued that the predominant factor leading to the Great Depression was a vicious circle of deflation and growing over indebtedness He outlined nine factors interacting with one another under conditions of debt and deflation to create the mechanics of boom to bust The chain of events proceeded as follows br br Debt liquidation and distress selling br Contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off br A fall in the level of asset prices br A still greater fall in the net worth of businesses precipitating bankruptcies br A fall in profits br A reduction in output in trade and in employment br Pessimism and loss of confidence br Hoarding of money br A fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation adjusted interest rates br During the Crash of preceding the Great Depression margin requirements were only Brokerage firms in other words would lend for every an investor had deposited When the market fell brokers called in these loans which could not be paid back Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse triggering multiple bank runs Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets br Outstanding debts became heavier because prices and incomes fell by but the debts remained at the same dollar amount After the panic of and during the first months of U S banks failed In all banks failed during the s By April around billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the March Bank Holiday Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans that borrowers did not have time or money to repay With future profits looking poor capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans which intensified deflationary pressures A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated br The liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices that it caused The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed relative to the value of declining asset holdings The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it Paradoxically the more the debtors paid the more they owed This self aggravating process turned a recession into a great depression br Fisher s debt deflation theory initially lacked mainstream influence because of the counter argument that debt deflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group debtors to another creditors Pure re distributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects br Building on both the monetary hypothesis of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz and the debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher Ben Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output He builds on Fisher s argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently lowers aggregate demand a further price level decline would then result in a debt deflationary spiral According to Bernanke a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions which in turn leads to a credit crunch that seriously harms the economy A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption which results in declining aggregate demand and additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral br br br Expectations hypothesis br Since economic mainstream turned to the new neoclassical synthesis expectations are a central element of macroeconomic models According to Peter Temin Barry Wigmore Gauti B Eggertsson and Christina Romer the key to recovery and to ending the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive in March when Franklin D Roosevelt took office Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation industrial production bottomed out in March and investment doubled in with a turnaround in March There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround Money supply was still falling and short term interest rates remained close to zero Before March people expected further deflation and a recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion With these positive expectations interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do Roosevelt s fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped make his policy objectives credible The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investment The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard a balanced budget in times of crisis and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about of the recovery of output and prices from to If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued the economy would have continued its free fall in and output would have been lower in than in br The recession of which slowed down economic recovery from the Great Depression is explained by fears of the population that the moderate tightening of the monetary and fiscal policy in were first steps to a restoration of the pre policy regime br br br Common position br There is common consensus among economists today that the government and the central bank should work to keep the interconnected macroeconomic aggregates of gross domestic product and money supply on a stable growth path When threatened by expectations of a depression central banks should expand liquidity in the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to prevent a collapse in money supply and aggregate demand br At the beginning of the Great Depression most economists believed in Say s law and the equilibrating powers of the market and failed to understand the severity of the Depression Outright leave it alone liquidationism was a common position and was universally held by Austrian School economists The liquidationist position held that a depression worked to liquidate failed businesses and investments that had been made obsolete by technological development releasing factors of production capital and labor to be redeployed in other more productive sectors of the dynamic economy They argued that even if self adjustment of the economy caused mass bankruptcies it was still the best course br Economists like Barry Eichengreen and J Bradford DeLong note that President Herbert Hoover tried to keep the federal budget balanced until when he lost confidence in his Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon and replaced him An increasingly common view among economic historians is that the adherence of many Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist position led to disastrous consequences Unlike what liquidationists expected a large proportion of the capital stock was not redeployed but vanished during the first years of the Great Depression According to a study by Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers the recession caused a drop of net capital accumulation to pre levels by Milton Friedman called leave it alone liquidationism dangerous nonsense He wrote br br I think the Austrian business cycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm If you go back to the s which is a key point here you had the Austrians sitting in London Hayek and Lionel Robbins and saying you just have to let the bottom drop out of the world You ve just got to let it cure itself You can t do anything about it You will only make it worse I think by encouraging that kind of do nothing policy both in Britain and in the United States they did harm br br br Heterodox theories br br br Austrian School br Two prominent theorists in the Austrian School on the Great Depression include Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek and American economist Murray Rothbard who wrote America s Great Depression In their view much like the monetarists the Federal Reserve created in shoulders much of the blame however unlike the Monetarists they argue that the key cause of the Depression was the expansion of the money supply in the s which led to an unsustainable credit driven boom br In the Austrian view it was this inflation of the money supply that led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices stocks and bonds and capital goods Therefore by the time the Federal Reserve tightened in it was far too late to prevent an economic contraction In February Hayek published a paper predicting the Federal Reserve s actions would lead to a crisis starting in the stock and credit markets br According to Rothbard the government support for failed enterprises and efforts to keep wages above their market values actually prolonged the Depression Unlike Rothbard after Hayek believed that the Federal Reserve had further contributed to the problems of the Depression by permitting the money supply to shrink during the earliest years of the Depression However during the Depression in and in Hayek had criticized both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England for not taking a more contractionary stance br Hans Sennholz argued that most boom and busts that plagued the American economy such as those in and were generated by government creating a boom through easy money and credit which was soon followed by the inevitable bust br Ludwig von Mises wrote in the s Credit expansion cannot increase the supply of real goods It merely brings about a rearrangement It diverts capital investment away from the course prescribed by the state of economic wealth and market conditions It causes production to pursue paths which it would not follow unless the economy were to acquire an increase in material goods As a result the upswing lacks a solid base It is not real prosperity It is illusory prosperity It did not develop from an increase in economic wealth i e the accumulation of savings made available for productive investment Rather it arose because the credit expansion created the illusion of such an increase Sooner or later it must become apparent that this economic situation is built on sand br br br Marxist br Marxists generally argue that the Great Depression was the result of the inherent instability of the capitalist mode of production According to Forbes The idea that capitalism caused the Great Depression was widely held among intellectuals and the general public for many decades br br br Inequality br br Two economists of the s Waddill Catchings and William Trufant Foster popularized a theory that influenced many policy makers including Herbert Hoover Henry A Wallace Paul Douglas and Marriner Eccles It held the economy produced more than it consumed because the consumers did not have enough income Thus the unequal distribution of wealth throughout the s caused the Great Depression br According to this view the root cause of the Great Depression was a global over investment in heavy industry capacity compared to wages and earnings from independent businesses such as farms The proposed solution was for the government to pump money into the consumers pockets That is it must redistribute purchasing power maintaining the industrial base and re inflating prices and wages to force as much of the inflationary increase in purchasing power into consumer spending The economy was overbuilt and new factories were not needed Foster and Catchings recommended federal and state governments to start large construction projects a program followed by Hoover and Roosevelt br br br Productivity shock br It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the productivity output and employment trends we are describing are long time trends and were thoroughly evident before These trends are in nowise the result of the present depression nor are they the result of the World War On the contrary the present depression is a collapse resulting from these long term trends br The first three decades of the th century saw economic output surge with electrification mass production and motorized farm machinery and because of the rapid growth in productivity there was a lot of excess production capacity and the work week was being reduced The dramatic rise in productivity of major industries in the U S and the effects of productivity on output wages and the workweek are discussed by Spurgeon Bell in his book Productivity Wages and National Income br br br Socio economic effects br br The majority of countries set up relief programs and most underwent some sort of political upheaval pushing them to the right Many of the countries in Europe and Latin America that were democracies saw them overthrown by some form of dictatorship or authoritarian rule most famously in Germany in The Dominion of Newfoundland gave up democracy voluntarily There too were severe impacts across the Middle East and North Africa including economic decline which led to social unrest br br br Argentina br br Decline in foreign trade hit Argentina hard The British decision to stop importing Argentine beef led to the signing of the Roca Runciman Treaty which preserved a quota in exchange for significant concessions to British exports By the economy had recovered to levels and the same year the Central Bank of Argentina was formed However the Great Depression was the last time when Argentina was one of the richer countries of the world as it stopped growing in the decades thereafter and became underdeveloped br br br Australia br br Australia s dependence on agricultural and industrial exports meant it was one of the hardest hit developed countries Falling export demand and commodity prices placed massive downward pressures on wages Unemployment reached a record high of in with incidents of civil unrest becoming common After an increase in wool and meat prices led to a gradual recovery br br br Canada br br Harshly affected by both the global economic downturn and the Dust Bowl Canadian industrial production had by fallen to only of its figure the second lowest level in the world after the United States and well behind countries such as Britain which fell to only of the level Total national income fell to of the level again worse than any country apart from the United States Unemployment reached at the depth of the Depression in br br br Chile br br The League of Nations labeled Chile the country hardest hit by the Great Depression because of government revenue came from exports of copper and nitrates which were in low demand Chile initially felt the impact of the Great Depression in when GDP dropped mining income declined and export earnings fell By GDP had shrunk to less than half of what it had been in exacting a terrible toll in unemployment and business failures br Influenced profoundly by the Great Depression many government leaders promoted the development of local industry in an effort to insulate the economy from future external shocks After six years of government austerity measures which succeeded in reestablishing Chile s creditworthiness Chileans elected to office during the period a succession of center and left of center governments interested in promoting economic growth through government intervention br Prompted in part by the devastating Chill n earthquake the Popular Front government of Pedro Aguirre Cerda created the Production Development Corporation Corporaci n de Fomento de la Producci n CORFO to encourage with subsidies and direct investments an ambitious program of import substitution industrialization Consequently as in other Latin American countries protectionism became an entrenched aspect of the Chilean economy br br br China br br China was largely unaffected by the Depression mainly by having stuck to the Silver standard However the U S silver purchase act of created an intolerable demand on China s silver coins and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in in favor of the four Chinese national banks legal note issues China and the British colony of Hong Kong which followed suit in this regard in September would be the last to abandon the silver standard In addition the Nationalist Government also acted energetically to modernize the legal and penal systems stabilize prices amortize debts reform the banking and currency systems build railroads and highways improve public health facilities legislate against traffic in narcotics and augment industrial and agricultural production On November the government instituted the fiat currency fapi reform immediately stabilizing prices and also raising revenues for the government br br br European African colonies br The sharp fall in commodity prices and the steep decline in exports hurt the economies of the European colonies in Africa and Asia The agricultural sector was especially hard hit For example sisal had recently become a major export crop in Kenya and Tanganyika During the depression it suffered severely from low prices and marketing problems that affected all colonial commodities in Africa Sisal producers established centralized controls for the export of their fibre There was widespread unemployment and hardship among peasants labourers colonial auxiliaries and artisans The budgets of colonial governments were cut which forced the reduction in ongoing infrastructure projects such as the building and upgrading of roads ports and communications The budget cuts delayed the schedule for creating systems of higher education br The depression severely hurt the export based Belgian Congo economy because of the drop in international demand for raw materials and for agricultural products For example the price of peanuts fell from to centimes In some areas as in the Katanga mining region employment declined by In the country as a whole the wage labour force decreased by and many men returned to their villages In Leopoldville the population decreased by because of this labour migration br Political protests were not common However there was a growing demand that the paternalistic claims be honored by colonial governments to respond vigorously The theme was that economic reforms were more urgently needed than political reforms French West Africa launched an extensive program of educational reform in which rural schools designed to modernize agriculture would stem the flow of under employed farm workers to cities where unemployment was high Students were trained in traditional arts crafts and farming techniques and were then expected to return to their own villages and towns br br br France br br The crisis affected France a bit later than other countries hitting hard around While the s grew at the very strong rate of per year the s rate fell to only br The depression was relatively mild unemployment peaked under the fall in production was at most below the output there was no banking crisis br However the depression had drastic effects on the local economy and partly explains the February riots and even more the formation of the Popular Front led by SFIO socialist leader L on Blum which won the elections in Ultra nationalist groups also saw increased popularity although democracy prevailed into World War II br France s relatively high degree of self sufficiency meant the damage was considerably less than in neighbouring states like Germany br br br Germany br br The Great Depression hit Germany hard The impact of the Wall Street Crash forced American banks to end the new loans that had been funding the repayments under the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan The financial crisis escalated out of control in mid starting with the collapse of the Credit Anstalt in Vienna in May This put heavy pressure on Germany which was already in political turmoil with the rise in violence of national socialist and communist movements as well as with investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies investors withdrew their short term money from Germany as confidence spiraled downward The Reichsbank lost million marks in the first week of June million in the second and million in two days June Collapse was at hand U S President Herbert Hoover called for a moratorium on payment of war reparations This angered Paris which depended on a steady flow of German payments but it slowed the crisis down and the moratorium was agreed to in July An international conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on August a standstill agreement froze Germany s foreign liabilities for six months Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England The funding only slowed the process Industrial failures began in Germany a major bank closed in July and a two day holiday for all German banks was declared Business failures became more frequent in July and spread to Romania and Hungary br In of German reparation payments were cancelled in the s Germany repaid all its missed reparations debts Widespread unemployment reached as every sector was hurt The government did not increase government spending to deal with Germany s growing crisis as they were afraid that a high spending policy could lead to a return of the hyperinflation that had affected Germany in Germany s Weimar Republic was hit hard by the depression as American loans to help rebuild the German economy now stopped The unemployment rate reached nearly in br br The German political landscape was dramatically altered leading to Adolf Hitler s rise to power The Nazi Party rose from being peripheral to winning of the vote in the September election and the Communist Party also made gains while moderate forces like the Social Democratic Party the Democratic Party and the People s Party lost seats The next two years were marked by increased street violence between Nazis and Communists while governments under President Paul von Hindenburg increasingly relied on rule by decree bypassing the Reichstag Hitler ran for the Presidency in and while he lost to the incumbent Hindenburg in the election it marked a point during which both Nazi Party and the Communist parties rose in the years following the crash to altogether possess a Reichstag majority following the general election in July Although the Nazis lost seats in November election they remained the largest party and Hitler was appointed as Chancellor the following January The government formation deal was designed to give Hitler s conservative coalition partners many checks on his power but over the next few months the Nazis manoeuvred to consolidate a single party dictatorship br br Hitler followed an autarky economic policy creating a network of client states and economic allies in central Europe and Latin America By cutting wages and taking control of labor unions plus public works spending unemployment fell significantly by Large scale military spending played a major role in the recovery The policies had the effect of driving up the cost of food imports and depleting foreign currency reserves leading to economic impasse by Nazi Germany faced a choice of either reversing course or pressing ahead with rearmament and autarky Hitler chose the latter route which according to Ian Kershaw could only be partially accomplished without territorial expansion and therefore war br br br Greece br br The reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in The Bank of Greece tried to adopt deflationary policies to stave off the crises that were going on in other countries but these largely failed For a brief period the drachma was pegged to the U S dollar but this was unsustainable given the country s large trade deficit and the only long term effects of this were Greece s foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from drachmas to the dollar in March to drachmas to the dollar in April This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK France and the Middle East for many necessities Greece went off the gold standard in April and declared a moratorium on all interest payments The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas which several European countries did during the period br Protectionist policies coupled with a weak drachma stifling imports allowed the Greek industry to expand during the Great Depression In the Greek industrial output was that of These industries were for the most part built on sand as one report of the Bank of Greece put it as without massive protection they would not have been able to survive Despite the global depression Greece managed to suffer comparatively little averaging an average growth rate of from to The dictatorial regime of Ioannis Metaxas took over the Greek government in and economic growth was strong in the years leading up to the Second World War br br br Iceland br br Icelandic post World War I prosperity came to an end with the outbreak of the Great Depression The Depression hit Iceland hard as the value of exports plummeted The total value of Icelandic exports fell from million kronur in to million in and was not to rise again to the pre level until after Government interference in the economy increased Imports were regulated trade with foreign currency was monopolized by state owned banks and loan capital was largely distributed by state regulated funds Due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War which cut Iceland s exports of saltfish by half the Depression lasted in Iceland until the outbreak of World War II when prices for fish exports soared br br br India br br How much India was affected has been hotly debated Historians have argued that the Great Depression slowed long term industrial development Apart from two sectors jute and coal the economy was little affected However there were major negative impacts on the jute industry as world demand fell and prices plunged Otherwise conditions were fairly stable Local markets in agriculture and small scale industry showed modest gains br br br Ireland br br Frank Barry and Mary E Daly have argued that br br Ireland was a largely agrarian economy trading almost exclusively with the UK at the time of the Great Depression Beef and dairy products comprised the bulk of exports and Ireland fared well relative to many other commodity producers particularly in the early years of the depression br br br Italy br br The Great Depression hit Italy very hard As industries came close to failure they were bought out by the banks in a largely illusionary bail out the assets used to fund the purchases were largely worthless This led to a financial crisis peaking in and major government intervention The Industrial Reconstruction Institute IRI was formed in January and took control of the bank owned companies suddenly giving Italy the largest state owned industrial sector in Europe excluding the USSR IRI did rather well with its new responsibilities restructuring modernising and rationalising as much as it could It was a significant factor in post development But it took the Italian economy until to recover the manufacturing levels of a position that was only better than that of br br br Japan br The Great Depression did not strongly affect Japan The Japanese economy shrank by during Japan s Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was the first to implement what have come to be identified as Keynesian economic policies first by large fiscal stimulus involving deficit spending and second by devaluing the currency Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures Econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective br The devaluation of the currency had an immediate effect Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets The deficit spending proved to be most profound and went into the purchase of munitions for the armed forces By Japan was already out of the depression By Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating and to avoid inflation moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions br This resulted in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists especially those in the army culminating in his assassination in the course of the February Incident This had a chilling effect on all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government From the military s dominance of the government continued to grow Instead of reducing deficit spending the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced but did not eliminate inflation which remained a problem until the end of World War II br The deficit spending had a transformative effect on Japan Japan s industrial production doubled during the s Further in the list of the largest firms in Japan was dominated by light industries especially textile companies many of Japan s automakers such as Toyota have their roots in the textile industry By light industry had been displaced by heavy industry as the largest firms inside the Japanese economy br br br Latin America br br Because of high levels of U S investment in Latin American economies they were severely damaged by the Depression Within the region Chile Bolivia and Peru were particularly badly affected br Before the crisis links between the world economy and Latin American economies had been established through American and British investment in Latin American exports to the world As a result Latin Americans export industries felt the depression quickly World prices for commodities such as wheat coffee and copper plunged Exports from all of Latin America to the U S fell in value from billion in to million in rising to million in br But on the other hand the depression led the area governments to develop new local industries and expand consumption and production Following the example of the New Deal governments in the area approved regulations and created or improved welfare institutions that helped millions of new industrial workers to achieve a better standard of living br br br Netherlands br br From roughly to the Netherlands suffered a deep and exceptionally long depression This depression was partly caused by the after effects of the American stock market crash of and partly by internal factors in the Netherlands Government policy especially the very late dropping of the Gold Standard played a role in prolonging the depression The Great Depression in the Netherlands led to some political instability and riots and can be linked to the rise of the Dutch fascist political party NSB The depression in the Netherlands eased off somewhat at the end of when the government finally dropped the Gold Standard but real economic stability did not return until after World War II br br br New Zealand br br New Zealand was especially vulnerable to worldwide depression as it relied almost entirely on agricultural exports to the United Kingdom for its economy The drop in exports led to a lack of disposable income from the farmers who were the mainstay of the local economy Jobs disappeared and wages plummeted leaving people desperate and charities unable to cope Work relief schemes were the only government support available to the unemployed the rate of which by the early s was officially around but unofficially nearly twice that level official figures excluded M ori and women In riots occurred among the unemployed in three of the country s main cities Auckland Dunedin and Wellington Many were arrested or injured through the tough official handling of these riots by police and volunteer special constables br br br Persia br br In Iran then known as the Imperial State of Persia the Great Depression had negative impacts on its exports In a new concession was signed with the Anglo Persian Oil Company br br br Poland br br Poland was affected by the Great Depression longer and stronger than other countries due to inadequate economic response of the government and the pre existing economic circumstances of the country At that time Poland was under the authoritarian rule of Sanacja whose leader J zef Pi sudski was opposed to leaving the gold standard until his death in As a result Poland was unable to perform a more active monetary and budget policy Additionally Poland was a relatively young country that emerged merely years earlier after being partitioned between German Russian and the Austro Hungarian Empires for over a century Prior to independence the Russian part exported of its exports to Russia proper while the German part exported to Germany proper After independence these markets were largely lost as Russia transformed into USSR that was mostly a closed economy and Germany was in a tariff war with Poland throughout the s br Industrial production fell significantly in hard coal production was down compared to steel production was down and iron ore production noted an decrease On the other hand electrotechnical leather and paper industries noted marginal increases in production output Overall industrial production decreased by A distinct feature of the Great Depression in Poland was the de concentration of industry as larger conglomerates were less flexible and paid their workers more than smaller ones br Unemployment rate rose significantly up to while nominal wages fell by in and in relative to However real wages fell less due to the government s policy of decreasing cost of living particularly food expenditures food prices were down by in compared to price levels Material conditions deprivation led to strikes some of them violent or violently pacified like in Sanok March of the Hungry in Sanok March Lesko county Lesko uprising June July and Zawiercie Bloody Friday April br To adapt to the crisis Polish government employed deflation methods such as high interest rates credit limits and budget austerity to keep a fixed exchange rate with currencies tied to the gold standard Only in late did the government effect a plan to fight the economic crisis Part of the plan was mass public works scheme employing up to people in After Pi sudski s death in the gold standard regime was relaxed and launching the development of the Central Industrial Region kicked off the economy to over annual growth rate in the period br br br Portugal br br Already under the rule of a dictatorial junta the Ditadura Nacional Portugal suffered no turbulent political effects of the Depression although Ant nio de Oliveira Salazar already appointed Minister of Finance in greatly expanded his powers and in rose to Prime Minister of Portugal to found the Estado Novo an authoritarian corporatist dictatorship With the budget balanced in the effects of the depression were relaxed through harsh measures towards budget balance and autarky causing social discontent but stability and eventually an impressive economic growth br br br Puerto Rico br In the years immediately preceding the depression negative developments in the island and world economies perpetuated an unsustainable cycle of subsistence for many Puerto Rican workers The s brought a dramatic drop in Puerto Rico s two primary exports raw sugar and coffee due to a devastating hurricane in and the plummeting demand from global markets in the latter half of the decade unemployment on the island was roughly and by Puerto Rico s per capita income dropped by comparison unemployment in the United States in was approximately reaching a height of in To provide relief and economic reform the United States government and Puerto Rican politicians such as Carlos Chardon and Luis Mu oz Mar n created and administered first the Puerto Rico Emergency Relief Administration PRERA and then in the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration PRRA br br br Romania br br Romania was also affected by the Great Depression br br br South Africa br br As world trade slumped demand for South African agricultural and mineral exports fell drastically The Carnegie Commission on Poor Whites had concluded in that nearly one third of Afrikaners lived as paupers The social discomfort caused by the depression was a contributing factor in the split between the gesuiwerde purified and smelter fusionist factions within the National Party and the National Party s subsequent fusion with the South African Party Unemployment programs were begun that focused primarily on the white population br br br Soviet Union br The Soviet Union was the only major socialist state in the world and had very little international trade Its economy was not tied to the rest of the world and was mostly unaffected by the Great Depression br At the time of the Depression the Soviet economy was growing steadily fuelled by intensive investment in heavy industry The apparent economic success of the Soviet Union at a time when the capitalist world was in crisis led many Western intellectuals to view the Soviet system favorably Jennifer Burns wrote br br As the Great Depression ground on and unemployment soared intellectuals began unfavorably comparing their faltering capitalist economy to Russian Communism Karl Marx had predicted that capitalism would fall under the weight of its own contradictions and now with the economic crisis gripping the West his predictions seem to be coming true By contrast Russia seemed an emblematic modern nation making the staggering leap from a feudal past to an industrial future with ease br The Great Depression caused mass immigration to the Soviet Union mostly from Finland and Germany Soviet Russia was at first happy to help these immigrants settle because they believed they were victims of capitalism who had come to help the Soviet cause However when the Soviet Union entered the war in most of these Germans and Finns were arrested and sent to Siberia while their Russian born children were placed in orphanages Their fate remains unknown br br br Spain br br Spain had a relatively isolated economy with high protective tariffs and was not one of the main countries affected by the Depression The banking system held up well as did agriculture br By far the most serious negative impact came after from the heavy destruction of infrastructure and manpower by the civil war Many talented workers were forced into permanent exile By staying neutral in the Second World War and selling to both sides the economy avoided further disasters br br br Sweden br br By the s Sweden had what America s Life magazine called in the world s highest standard of living Sweden was also the first country worldwide to recover completely from the Great Depression Taking place amid a short lived government and a less than a decade old Swedish democracy events such as those surrounding Ivar Kreuger who eventually committed suicide remain infamous in Swedish history The Social Democrats under Per Albin Hansson formed their first long lived government in based on strong interventionist and welfare state policies monopolizing the office of Prime Minister until with the sole and short lived exception of Axel Pehrsson Bramstorp s summer cabinet in During forty years of hegemony it was the most successful political party in the history of Western liberal democracy br br br Thailand br In Thailand then known as the Kingdom of Siam the Great Depression contributed to the end of the absolute monarchy of King Rama VII in the Siamese revolution of br br br Turkey br br Turkey was badly affected by the Great Depression and it came at a time when the state was still reforming its economic policy following the end of the Ottoman era Exports of grapes which held an important share were down considerably which had already started beforehand due to drought br br br United Kingdom br br The World Depression broke at a time when the United Kingdom had still not fully recovered from the effects of the First World War more than a decade earlier The country was driven off the gold standard in br The world financial crisis began to overwhelm Britain in investors around the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of million per day Credits of million each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of million fiduciary note slowed but did not reverse the British crisis The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August With deficits mounting the bankers demanded a balanced budget the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald s Labour government agreed it proposed to raise taxes cut spending and most controversially to cut unemployment benefits by The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement MacDonald wanted to resign but King George V insisted he remain and form an all party coalition National Government The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on along with a small cadre of Labour but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government Britain went off the gold standard and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression In the British election the Labour Party was virtually destroyed leaving MacDonald as prime minister for a largely Conservative coalition br The effects on the northern industrial areas of Britain were immediate and devastating as demand for traditional industrial products collapsed By the end of unemployment had more than doubled from million to million of the insured workforce and exports had fallen in value by In of Glaswegians were unemployed due to the severe decline in heavy industry In some towns and cities in the north east unemployment reached as high as as shipbuilding fell by The National Hunger March of September October was the largest of a series of hunger marches in Britain in the s and s About unemployed men were sent to the work camps which continued in operation until br In the less industrial Midlands and Southern England the effects were short lived and the later s were a prosperous time Growth in modern manufacture of electrical goods and a boom in the motor car industry was helped by a growing southern population and an expanding middle class Agriculture also saw a boom during this period br br br United States br br Hoover s first measures to combat the depression were based on encouraging businesses not to reduce their workforce or cut wages but businesses had little choice wages were reduced workers were laid off and investments postponed br In June Congress approved the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act which raised tariffs on thousands of imported items The intent of the Act was to encourage the purchase of American made products by increasing the cost of imported goods while raising revenue for the federal government and protecting farmers Most countries that traded with the U S increased tariffs on American made goods in retaliation reducing international trade and worsening the Depression br In Hoover urged bankers to set up the National Credit Corporation so that big banks could help failing banks survive But bankers were reluctant to invest in failing banks and the National Credit Corporation did almost nothing to address the problem br br By unemployment had reached peaking in early at Those releasing from prison during this period had an especially difficult time finding employment given the stigma of their criminal records which often led to recidivism out of economic desperation Drought persisted in the agricultural heartland businesses and families defaulted on record numbers of loans and more than banks had failed Hundreds of thousands of Americans found themselves homeless and began congregating in shanty towns dubbed Hoovervilles that began to appear across the country In response President Hoover and Congress approved the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to spur new home construction and reduce foreclosures The final attempt of the Hoover Administration to stimulate the economy was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act ERA which included funds for public works programs such as dams and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation RFC in The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions But billion was not enough to save all the banks and bank runs and bank failures continued Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill as prices profits and employment fell leading to the political realignment in that brought to power Franklin Delano Roosevelt br br Shortly after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was inaugurated in drought and erosion combined to cause the Dust Bowl shifting hundreds of thousands of displaced persons off their farms in the Midwest From his inauguration onward Roosevelt argued that restructuring of the economy would be needed to prevent another depression or avoid prolonging the current one New Deal programs sought to stimulate demand and provide work and relief for the impoverished through increased government spending and the institution of financial reforms br During a bank holiday that lasted five days the Emergency Banking Act was signed into law It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under Treasury supervision with federal loans available if needed The Securities Act of comprehensively regulated the securities industry This was followed by the Securities Exchange Act of which created the Securities and Exchange Commission Although amended key provisions of both Acts are still in force Federal insurance of bank deposits was provided by the FDIC and the Glass Steagall Act br The Agricultural Adjustment Act provided incentives to cut farm production in order to raise farming prices The National Recovery Administration NRA made a number of sweeping changes to the American economy It forced businesses to work with government to set price codes through the NRA to fight deflationary cut throat competition by the setting of minimum prices and wages labor standards and competitive conditions in all industries It encouraged unions that would raise wages to increase the purchasing power of the working class The NRA was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in br br These reforms together with several other relief and recovery measures are called the First New Deal Economic stimulus was attempted through a new alphabet soup of agencies set up in and and previously extant agencies such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation By the Second New Deal added Social Security which was later considerably extended through the Fair Deal a jobs program for the unemployed the Works Progress Administration WPA and through the National Labor Relations Board a strong stimulus to the growth of labor unions In federal expenditures constituted only of the GDP The national debt as a proportion of GNP rose under Hoover from to Roosevelt kept it at until the war began when it soared to br By the main economic indicators had regained the levels of the late s except for unemployment which remained high at although this was considerably lower than the unemployment rate seen in In the spring of American industrial production exceeded that of and remained level until June In June the Roosevelt administration cut spending and increased taxation in an attempt to balance the federal budget br The American economy then took a sharp downturn lasting for months through most of Industrial production fell almost per cent within a few months and production of durable goods fell even faster Unemployment jumped from in to in rising from million to more than million in early Manufacturing output fell by from the peak and was back to levels br br Producers reduced their expenditures on durable goods and inventories declined but personal income was only lower than it had been at the peak in As unemployment rose consumers expenditures declined leading to further cutbacks in production By May retail sales began to increase employment improved and industrial production turned up after June After the recovery from the Recession of conservatives were able to form a bipartisan conservative coalition to stop further expansion of the New Deal and when unemployment dropped to in the early s they abolished WPA CCC and the PWA relief programs Social Security remained in place br Between and federal expenditure tripled and Roosevelt s critics charged that he was turning America into a socialist state The Great Depression was a main factor in the implementation of social democracy and planned economies in European countries after World War II see Marshall Plan Keynesianism generally remained the most influential economic school in the United States and in parts of Europe until the periods between the s and the s when Milton Friedman and other neoliberal economists formulated and propagated the newly created theories of neoliberalism and incorporated them into the Chicago School of Economics as an alternative approach to the study of economics Neoliberalism went on to challenge the dominance of the Keynesian school of Economics in the mainstream academia and policy making in the United States having reached its peak in popularity in the election of the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom br br br Literature br br The Great Depression has been the subject of much writing as authors have sought to evaluate an era that caused both financial and emotional trauma Perhaps the most noteworthy and famous novel written on the subject is The Grapes of Wrath published in and written by John Steinbeck who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the work and in was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature The novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers who are forced from their home as drought economic hardship and changes in the agricultural industry occur during the Great Depression Steinbeck s Of Mice and Men is another important novella about a journey during the Great Depression Additionally Harper Lee s To Kill a Mockingbird is set during the Great Depression Margaret Atwood s Booker prize winning The Blind Assassin is likewise set in the Great Depression centering on a privileged socialite s love affair with a Marxist revolutionary The era spurred the resurgence of social realism practiced by many who started their writing careers on relief programs especially the Federal Writers Project in the U S Nonfiction works from this time also capture important themes The memoir Prison Days and Nights by Victor Folke Nelson provides insight into criminal justice ramifications of the Great Depression especially in regard to patterns of recidivism due to lack of economic opportunity br A number of works for younger audiences are also set during the Great Depression among them the Kit Kittredge series of American Girl books written by Valerie Tripp and illustrated by Walter Rane released to tie in with the dolls and playsets sold by the company The stories which take place during the early to mid s in Cincinnati focuses on the changes brought by the Depression to the titular character s family and how the Kittredges dealt with it A theatrical adaptation of the series entitled Kit Kittredge An American Girl was later released in to positive reviews Similarly Christmas After All part of the Dear America series of books for older girls take place in s Indianapolis while Kit Kittredge is told in a third person viewpoint Christmas After All is in the form of a fictional journal as told by the protagonist Minnie Swift as she recounts her experiences during the era especially when her family takes in an orphan cousin from Texas br br br Naming br br The term The Great Depression is most frequently attributed to British economist Lionel Robbins whose book The Great Depression is credited with formalizing the phrase though Hoover is widely credited with popularizing the term informally referring to the downturn as a depression with such uses as Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement December Message to Congress and I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression br br The term depression to refer to an economic downturn dates to the th century when it was used by varied Americans and British politicians and economists The first major American economic crisis the Panic of was described by then president James Monroe as a depression and the most recent economic crisis the Depression of had been referred to as a depression by then president Calvin Coolidge br Financial crises were traditionally referred to as panics most recently the major Panic of and the minor Panic of though the crisis was called The Crash and the term panic has since fallen out of use At the time of the Great Depression the term The Great Depression was already used to refer to the period in the United Kingdom or more narrowly in the United States which has retroactively been renamed the Long Depression br br br Other great depressions br The collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakdown of economic ties which followed led to a severe economic crisis and catastrophic fall in the standards of living in the s in post Soviet states and the former Eastern Bloc which was even worse than the Great Depression Even before Russia s financial crisis of Russia s GDP was half of what it had been in the early s br br br Comparison with the Great Recession br br The worldwide economic decline after has been compared to the s br The causes of the Great Recession seem similar to the Great Depression but significant differences exist The then chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke had extensively studied the Great Depression as part of his doctoral work at MIT and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in ways that were not done in the s Bernanke s policies will undoubtedly be analyzed and scrutinized in the years to come as economists debate the wisdom of his choices In one journalist contrasted the Great Depression of the s as opposed to the late s recession br br and were the times in the th century that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes half the unemployed had been out of work for over six months something that
