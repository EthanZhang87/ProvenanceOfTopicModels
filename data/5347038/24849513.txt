Non Hispanic Whites or Non Latino Whites are White Americans classified by the United States census as white and not Hispanic According to the United States Census Bureau yearly estimates as of July Non Hispanic whites make up about of the U S population or people The United States Census Bureau defines white to include European Americans Middle Eastern Americans and North African Americans Americans of European ancestry are divided into various ethnic groups More than half of the white population are German Irish English French and Polish Americans Many Americans are also the product of other European groups that migrated to parts of the US in the th and th centuries as the bulk of immigrants from various countries in Northern Central Eastern and Southeastern Europe as well as the Caucasus region migrated to the United States br The Non Hispanic White population was heavily derived from British as well as French settlement of the Americas in addition to settlement by other Europeans such as the Germans see Pennsylvania Dutch Swiss Dutch Austrians and Swedes that began in the th century see History of the United States The early Spanish presence in the country contributed a certain degree of that ancestry to the white population in parts of the south and southwest as many Americans of Isle o Basque or other colonial Spanish heritage do not necessarily identify as Hispanic or Latino on the census or are interchangeable with the non Hispanic White category as they lack any ties to Latin America or recent ties to Spain br Continued growth since the early th century is attributed to sustained very high birth rates alongside relatively low death rates among settlers and natives alike There has also been periodically massive immigration from European and West Asian countries especially Germany Ireland the Netherlands France as well as Poland Russia Norway Finland the Czech Republic the countries of the former Ottoman Empire Turkey Lebanon and Syria Portugal Serbia Croatia Hungary Ukraine Armenia Iran and more Significant migration of Jews of European North African and Middle Eastern descent into the United States is also notable br The classification is also typically used to refer to an English speaking American in distinction to Spanish speakers In some parts of the country the term Anglo American is used to refer to non Hispanic white English speakers as distinct from Spanish and Portuguese or Italian speakers although the term is more frequently used to refer to people of British or English descent and might include white people of Hispanic descent who no longer speak Spanish br br br History br br The first Europeans who came to present United States or Canada were Norse explorers around the year however they were ultimately absorbed or killed off leaving no permanent settlements behind In the s Spain founded several settlements in the contiguous United States like San Agust n Later Pilgrims and colonists came in the s along the East Coast mainly from England in search of economic opportunities and religious freedom Over time emigrants from Europe settled the coastal regions developing a commercial economy Between one half and two thirds of White immigrants to the American colonies between the s and American Revolution had come as indentured servants The total number of European immigrants to all colonies before was about of these were involuntary prisoners Of the or so European arrivals who came voluntarily an estimated were indentured br By the time of American Revolution there were about million Whites in the colonies The white population was largely of English Irish Scotch Irish Scottish German Dutch and French Huguenot descent at the time Between the revolution and the s there was relatively little immigration to the United States Starting after the s large scale migration to the United States began and lasted until the s Many of the newcomers were Catholics of Irish Italian and Polish descent which lead to a nativist backlash Some Americans worried about the growing Catholic population and wanted to maintain the United States as an Anglo Saxon Protestant nation Over the course of the th century European mass emigration to the United States and high birthrates grew the white population br After the American Revolution white Americans settled the entire nation west of Appalachian Mountains ultimately displacing the Natives and populating the entire country by the late th century All immigration to the United States declined markedly between the mid s until the s due to a combination of immigration laws the Great Depression and World War II Waves of Jewish Syrian and Lebanese immigration also occurred around this time br Since white migration to the United States has been relatively minor compared to other racial and ethnic groups During the s there was a moderate increase from former communist countries of the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union At the same time birthrates amongst Whites have fallen below replacement level br In non Hispanic whites made up about percent of the U S population but that number has declined sharply in recent years br br br Culture br br White Americans have developed their own music art cuisine fashion and political economy largely based on a combination of traditional European ones Today the majority of White Americans are Protestants although there are also large groups of Catholics and Jews throughout the population Many Europeans often Anglicized their names and over time most Europeans adopted English as their primary language and intermarried with other white groups br br br Demographics br br br Population br br Non Hispanic White American population distribution over time br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Non Hispanic Whites are the largest racial and ethnic group in America being the majority of America s population at or people Although the percentage has been declining in the last few decades from in to in According to generational data from the census the racial diversity of each age group is increasing White non Hispanics make up of the population over the age of of the population between the ages of and of the population between the ages of and and just of the population between the ages of and In actual Non Hispanic whites have still been growing From the Non Hispanic White population grew from to This was a growth of over the year period due to population momentum The population continued to grow to in to in br br The reason for falling percentage of non Latino Hispanic white Americans in the last century is due to multiple factors br Non European Immigration The United States has the largest number of immigrants in the world with the vast majority coming from countries where the population is of non White and or Latin American origin Immigration to the United States from European countries has been in a steady decline since World War II averaging of all immigrants in the s and declining to of all immigrants in the s in the s in the s in the s and in the s In approximately of all immigrants came from non European countries The United States does receive a small number of non Latino White immigrants mainly from countries such as Canada Poland Russia and the UK br Intermarriage The United States is seeing an unprecedented increase in intermarriage between the various racial and ethnic groups In a record of all new marriages in the United States were between spouses of a different race or ethnicity from one another of non Latino whites who married in married either a non White or Latino Among all newlyweds in intermarried pairings were primarily white Latino of any race as compared to white Asian white black and other combinations Other combinations consists of pairings between different minority groups multi racial people and Native Indigenous Americans The children of such unions would not automatically be classified as white non Latino One self identifies his or her racial and or ethnic category br Methodology In the Census people were allowed to check more than one race in addition to choosing Latino There was strong opposition to this from some civil rights activists who feared that this would reduce the size of various racial minorities The government responded by counting those who are white and of one minority race or ethnicity as minorities for the purposes of civil rights monitoring and enforcement Hence one could be th Black and still be counted as a minority Also because this does not apply to Latino origin one is either Latino or not but cannot be both Latino and non Latino the offspring of Latinos and non Latinos are usually counted as Latino In the Pew Research Center reported that high intermarriage rates and declining Latin American immigration has led to of US adults with Latino ancestry million people to no longer identify as Latino First generation immigrants from Latin America identify themselves as Latino at a very high rate which slowly falls in each succeeding generation in the second generation to in the third to and in the fourth to br Attrition Minority populations are younger than non Latino Whites The national median age in was years with non Latino Whites having the oldest median age by contrast Latinos had the youngest median age Non Latino Blacks and non Latino Asians also are younger than whites In the Census Bureau reported that for the first time due to the more advanced age profile of the non Latino White population non Latino Whites died at a faster rate than non Latino White births br br br Births br In for the first time in American history Non Hispanic Whites accounted for fewer than half of the births in the country accounting for of total births This increased to in regaining the majority in the process This is likely due to the birth rate declining among people of color For example between and the birth rate declined percent among Blacks percent among Asians percent among Hispanics but only percent among White people If this trend continues the White birth rate will surpass the Black birth rate in a few years br A total of babies were born in a increase from Additionally researchers found that the White fertility rate increased from in to in the first substantial rise since Although the exact reason of why the number of births rose in is unknown a study showed that the uptick in births came among college educated women and native born Americans Despite the increase it is still below the replacement level of br According to an analysis released in by William H Frey a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution only percent of American children are non Hispanic white br

White Americans go to religious services weekly and an additional go to religious services once or twice a month Although historically White Christians made up the majority of the American population

of the state s population than the US overall share of however the states with greater shares of non whites include the four most populous states California Texas New York and Florida The total non Latino white population shrunk between and in out of the states and the relative share of non Latino whites in the overall state population has declined in all states during that same time period br
