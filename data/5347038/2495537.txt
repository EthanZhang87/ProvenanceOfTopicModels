White Americans also referred to as European Americans are Americans who identify as white people This group constitutes the majority of the people in the United States According to the census or people were White alone or in combination and or people were White alone This represented a national white demographic decline from a white alone share of the U S population in br As of July United States Census Bureau estimates that of the US population were white alone while Non Hispanic whites were of the population For these population estimates the who identified as Some Other Race in were redistributed into other racial categories with the vast majority of them reclassified as white alone European Americans are the largest panethnic group of white Americans and have constituted the majority population of the United States since the nation s founding br The U S Census Bureau uses a particular definition of white that differs from some colloquial uses of the term The Bureau defines White people to be those having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe the Middle East or North Africa Within official census definitions people of all racial categories may be further divided into those who identify as not Hispanic or Latino and those who do identify as Hispanic or Latino The term non Hispanic white rather than just white may be the census group corresponding most closely to those persons who identify as and are perceived to be white in common usage similarly not all Hispanic Latino people identify as white black or any other listed racial category In the Census Bureau announced their intention to make Hispanic Latino and Middle Eastern North African racial categories similar to white or black with respondents able to choose one two or more racial categories this change was canceled during the Trump administration Other persons who are classified as white by the U S census but may or may not identify as or be perceived as white include Arab Americans and Jewish Americans of European or MENA descent In the United States the term White people generally denotes a person of European ancestry but has been legally extended to people of West Asian and North African Middle Eastern West Asian and North African ancestry br The most commonly reported ancestries of White Americans include English German Irish Italian and Polish It is difficult to track ancestry from Spain in Whites alone since people of Spanish descent are Hispanic and though the census does track Hispanics national origin it does not classify it by race In people of any race claimed ancestry from Spain of the total population The British Americans demography is considered a serious under count as the stock tend to self report and identify as simply Americans due to the length of time they have inhabited the United States particularly if their family arrived prior to the American Revolution The vast majority of white Americans also have ancestry from multiple countries br br br Historical and present definitions br br Definitions of who is White have changed throughout the history of the United States br br br U S census definition br The term white American can encompass many different ethnic groups Although the United States census purports to reflect a social definition of race the social dimensions of race are more complex than Census criteria The U S census states that racial categories generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country They do not conform to any biological anthropological or genetic criteria br The Census question on race lists the categories White or European American Black or African American American Indian and Alaska Native Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Asian plus Some other race with the respondent having the ability to mark more than one racial or ethnic category The Census Bureau defines White people as follows br br White refers to a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe the Middle East or North Africa It includes people who indicated their race s as White or reported entries such as German br Italian Lebanese Arab Moroccan or Caucasian br In U S census documents the designation White overlaps as do all other official racial categories with the term Hispanic or Latino which was introduced in the census as a category of ethnicity separate and independent of race Hispanic and Latino Americans as a whole make up a racially diverse group and are the largest minority in the country br Beginning in Mexican was added as a distinct race on the U S census with the explanation that practically all Mexican laborers are of a racial mixture difficult to classify The Mexican racial category was removed in with new direction that Mexicans are to be regarded as white unless definitely of Indian or other nonwhite race this was continued in saw the creation of the Spanish Origin category which superseded previous classifications for Latin Americans and is now represented by the Hispanic or Latino ethnic category Hispanic or Latino was again to be raised to racial status for the census along with Middle Eastern and North African but this was canceled by President Donald J Trump br The characterization of Middle Eastern and North African Americans as white has been a matter of controversy In the early th century there were a number of cases where people of Arab descent were denied entry into the United States or deported because they were characterized as nonwhite In the early st century MENA Americans began lobbying for the creation of their own racial group and were successful in the US Census Bureau announced that it had responded to their requests and would add a Middle Eastern and North African racial category to the census However the Trump administration nullified this change after coming to power in br br In cases where individuals do not self identify the U S census parameters for race give each national origin a racial value br On some government documents such as the SEER program s Coding and Staging Manual people who reported Muslim or a sect of Islam such as Shia or Sunni Jewish Zoroastrian Caucasian or a MENA or Latin American ethnicity as their race in the Some other race section without noting a country of origin or Native American tribal affiliation were automatically tallied as White The U S census Public Use Microdata Sample PUMS listed Caucasian or Aryan among other terms as subgroups of white in their ancestry code listing but and proceeding years of PUMS codes do not br br br Social definition br In the contemporary United States essentially anyone of European descent is typically considered white People of Middle Eastern and North African MENA descent may also be considered white However many of the ethnic groups classified as white by the U S Census such as Arab Americans Berber Americans Romani Americans Jewish Americans of European or MENA descent and Hispanics and Latinos of European or MENA descent may not always identify as and may not always be perceived to be white br Social perceptions of whiteness have evolved over the course of American history For example Benjamin Franklin commented that the Saxons of Germany and the English make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth Historically many individuals of European descent were not readily integrated into mainstream American society and found themselves caught on the dark side of the white black binary including Irish Italians Greeks and Slavs In Minnesota increasing numbers of Finnish immigrants led to a debate surrounding Finnish whiteness and whether Finns should be classified as a Mongoloid peoples br David R Roediger argues that the construction of the white race in the United States was an effort to mentally distance slave owners from slaves The process of officially being defined as white by law often came about in court disputes over pursuit of citizenship br br br Demographic information br br The fifty states the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as of the United States Census br White Americans constitute the majority of the million people living in the United States with of the population in the United States Census including who identified as white alone This represented a national white demographic decline from a share of the US s self identified white alone population in br The largest ethnic groups by ancestry among White Americans were English followed by Germans and Irish In the census Americans cited that they were of English ancestry making them of the country and the largest group at the time and in fact larger than the population of England itself Slightly more than half of these people would cite that they were of American ancestry on subsequent censuses and virtually everywhere that American ancestry predominates on the census corresponds to places where English predominated on the census br br br Geographic distribution br br White Americans are the majority racial group in almost all of the United States They are not the majority in Hawaii many American Indian reservations parts of the South the District of Columbia all US territories and in many urban areas throughout the country br Overall the highest concentration of those referred to as non Hispanic whites by the Census Bureau are found in the Midwest New England the northern Rocky Mountain states Kentucky West Virginia and East Tennessee The lowest concentration of whites was found in southern and mid Atlantic states br Although all large geographical areas are dominated by White Americans much larger differences can be seen between specific parts of large cities br States with the highest percentages of White Americans either White Alone or in combination with another race as of br br Vermont br Maine br West Virginia br New Hampshire br Wyoming br Montana br Idaho br Iowa br North Dakota br Kentucky br States with the highest percentages of non Latino Hispanic whites as of br br Maine br Vermont br New Hampshire br West Virginia br Wyoming br Idaho br Utah br Iowa br Montana br Nebraska br br br Income and educational attainment br br White Americans have the second highest median household income and personal income levels in the nation by cultural background The median income per household member was also the highest since White Americans had the smallest households of any racial demographic in the nation In the median individual income of a White American age or older was with those who were full time employed and of age to earning Since of all households had two income earners the median household income was considerably higher than the median personal income which was in Jewish Americans rank first in household income personal income and educational attainment among White Americans In White households had a median household income of which is above the national median of Among Cuban Americans with classified as White those born in the US have a higher median income and educational attainment level than most other Whites br The poverty rates for White Americans are the second lowest of any racial group with of white individuals living below the poverty line lower than the national average However due to Whites majority status of Americans living in poverty are white br White Americans educational attainment is the second highest in the country after Asian Americans Overall nearly one third of White Americans had a Bachelor s degree with the educational attainment for Whites being higher for those born outside the United States of foreign born and of native born Whites had a college degree Both figures are above the national average of br Gender income inequality was the greatest among Whites with White men outearning White women by Census Bureau data for reveals that the median income of White females was lower than that of males of all races In the median income for White American females was only slightly higher than that of African American females br White Americans are more likely to live in suburbs and

voters were white In the presidential election John McCain won of white votes In the House election Republicans won of the white votes br Some academics and commentators have argued that Donald Trump s presidential election victory in is an example of White backlash br br br Health br br br Culture br From their earliest presence in North America White Americans have contributed literature art cinema religion agricultural skills foods science and technology fashion and clothing styles music language legal system political system and social and technological innovation to American culture White American culture derived its earliest influences from English Scottish Welsh and Irish settlers and is quantitatively the largest proportion of American culture The overall American culture reflects White American culture The culture has been developing since long before the United States formed a separate country Much of White American culture shows influences from British culture Colonial ties to Great Britain spread the English language legal system and other cultural attributes br br br Albion s Seed Four British Folkways in America br br In his book Albion s Seed Four British Folkways in America David Hackett Fischer explores the details of the folkways of four groups of settlers from the British Isles that moved to the American colonies during the th and th centuries from distinct regions of Britain and Ireland His thesis is that the culture of each group persisted albeit in modified form providing the basis for the modern United States br According to Fischer the foundation of America s four regional cultures was formed from four mass migrations from four regions of the British Isles by four distinct ethno cultural groups New England s formative period occurred between and when Puritans mostly from East Anglia settled there thus forming the basis for the New England regional culture The next mass migration was of southern English Cavaliers and their working class English servants to the Chesapeake Bay region between and This spawned the creation of the American Southern culture br Then between and thousands of Irish Cornish English and Welsh Quakers plus many Germans sympathetic to Quaker ideas led by William Penn settled the Delaware Valley This resulted in the formation of the General American culture although according to Fischer this is really a regional culture even if it does today encompass most of the U S from the mid Atlantic states to the Pacific Coast Finally a huge number of settlers from the borderlands between England and Scotland sometimes by way of northern Ireland migrated to Appalachia between and This resulted in the formation of the Upland South regional culture which has since expanded to the west to West Texas and parts of the American Southwest br In his book Fischer brings up several points He states that the U S is not a country with one general culture and several regional cultures as is commonly thought Rather there are only four regional cultures as described above and understanding this helps one to more clearly understand American history as well as contemporary American life Fischer asserts that it is not only important to understand where different groups came from but when All population groups have at different times their own unique set of beliefs fears hopes and prejudices When different groups moved to America and brought certain beliefs and values with them these ideas became according to Fischer more or less frozen in time even if they eventually changed in their original place of origin br br br Admixture br br br Admixture in non Hispanic whites br White Americans have a mean of European sub Saharan African and Native American ancestry However non European ancestry in White Americans is highly variable for example Black ancestry or greater is found in over five percent of European Americans in Louisiana and South Carolina and Native American ancestry or greater is found in over three percent of European Americans in Louisiana and North Dakota African ancestry is most common in the South and least common in the Midwest Native American ancestry is more common in Western states than Eastern states br Older studies have also been performed DNA analysis on White Americans by geneticist Mark D Shriver showed an average of sub Saharan African admixture and Native American admixture The same author in another study claimed that about of all White Americans approximately million people have a median of of Black African admixture Shriver discovered his ancestry is percent African and Shriver s partner in DNA Print Genomics J T Frudacas contradicted him two years later stating Five percent of European Americans exhibit some detectable level of African ancestry br In a study Gon alves et al reported sub Saharan and Amerindian mtDNA lineages at a frequency of respectively and in a sample of American Caucasians as compared to in white Brazilians respectively and for white Colombians respectively and and for white Costa Ricans respectively and A study on Y chromosomes and mtDNA found African admixture in European Americans to be below the limits of detection br br br Admixture in Hispanic whites br In contrast to non Hispanic or Latino whites whose average European ancestry is genetic research has found that the average European admixture among White Hispanic and Latino Americans is while the average European admixture for Hispanic Americans overall regardless of their self identified race is br br br See
