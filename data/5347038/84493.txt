Sherman s March to the Sea On December local authorities negotiated a peaceful surrender to save Savannah from destruction and Union troops marched into the city at dawn br Savannah was named after the Savannah River which probably derives from variant names for the Shawnee a Native American people who migrated to the river in the s The Shawnee destroyed another Native people the Westo and occupied their lands at the head of the Savannah River s navigation on the fall line near present day Augusta These Shawnee whose Native name was a wano ki literally southerners were known by several
