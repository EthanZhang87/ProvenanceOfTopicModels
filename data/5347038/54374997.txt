id: 54374997
Climate change in Georgia encompasses the effects of climate change attributed to man made increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide in the U S state of Georgia br Studies show that Georgia is among a string of Deep South states that will experience the worst effects of climate change with effects including more severe floods and drought and higher water levels eroding beaches submerging low lands and exacerbating coastal flooding br In coming decades climate change will cause higher temperatures and more severe flooding and droughts in the state according to a pamphlet published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency The temperature changes will increase the risk of heat stroke and other heat related illnesses br br br Environmental impacts br br br Rising sea levels br br Sea levels are expected to rise one to four feet in the next century as the oceans and atmosphere continue to warm causing coastal areas in southeastern Georgia to be submerged br br br Water resources flooding and drought br br Climate change will also cause more severe flooding droughts and heavy rainstorms in Georgia Warmer temperatures will evaporate water faster leading to dryer conditions and a diminishing supply of available water Soil in non coastal areas will become dryer These conditions are likely to affect farmlands br Rising temperatures will cause water levels to decrease in the Chattahoochee and other major rivers as well as Lake Lanier and other reservoirs which will affect the water supply of Atlanta and other cities br br br Economic and social impacts br br br Agriculture and forest resources br br Changing the climate will have both harmful and beneficial effects on farming Although hotter temperatures alone would tend to depress crop yields higher concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide increase yields and that fertilizing effect is likely to offset the harmful effects of heat on cotton peanuts soybeans and wheat if adequate water is available More severe droughts however could cause crop failures Higher temperatures are likely to reduce livestock productivity because heat stress disrupts the animals metabolism br Warmer temperatures and changes in rainfall are unlikely to substantially reduce forest cover in Georgia although the composition of trees in the forests may change More droughts would reduce forest productivity and climate change is also likely to increase the damage from insects and disease But longer growing seasons and increased carbon dioxide concentrations could more than offset the losses from those factors Forests cover about half of the state with oak pine forests common in the north loblolly shortleaf pine forests common in the center and longleaf slash pine forests common in the south Changing the climate may enable oak pine forests to become the most common forest type throughout the state br br br Coastal storms homes and infrastructure br br Tropical storms and hurricanes have become more intense during the past years Although warming oceans provide energy scientists are not sure whether the recent intensification reflects a long term trend Nevertheless hurricane wind speeds and rainfall rates are likely to increase as the climate continues to warm br Whether or not storms become more intense coastal homes and infrastructure will flood more often as sea level rises because storm surges will become higher as well Rising sea level is likely to increase flood insurance rates while more frequent storms could increase the deductible for wind damage in homeowner insurance policies Parts of Savannah and Brunswick are vulnerable to coastal flooding which is likely to become more severe as sea level rises br br br See also br List of U S states and territories by carbon dioxide emissions br Plug in electric vehicles in Georgia U S state br br br br br br Further reading br Carter L A Terando K Dow K Hiers K E Kunkel A Lascurain D Marcy M Osland P Schramm Southeast In Reidmiller D R C W Avery D R Easterling K E Kunkel K L M Lewis T K Maycock B C Stewart eds Impacts Risks and Adaptation in the United States Fourth National Climate Assessment Volume II Report Washington DC USA U S Global Change Research Program pp doi NCA CH this chapter of the National Climate Assessment covers Southeast states Virginia West Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Florida Georgia Alabama Tennessee Arkansas Louisiana
