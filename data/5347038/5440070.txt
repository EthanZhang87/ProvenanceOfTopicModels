counties br br br History br The area that is now southwest Fulton was originally Campbell County but it agreed to annexation by neighboring Fulton County on January to reduce administrative costs br Historically much of the west center of the current city was considered the town of Rico with other communities including Goodes Rivertown County Line Campbellton Pumpkintown and several other historic communities also within the new city s boundaries br The idea of Chattahoochee Hills is very recent This developed from attempts to incorporate all of Fulton County into cities following the incorporation of Sandy Springs in the north part of the county as well as local efforts to take control of zoning and land subdivision in the multi county Chattahoochee Hill Country area br During the session the Georgia General Assembly passed a law allowing the Fulton section of the area to incorporate as a city the only type of municipality allowed in Georgia the purpose being the municipalization of that county and to allow local residents to have local control of zoning with the goal of preserving as much as possible of the rural character of the community while controlling development Originally this was to be implemented by concentrating the majority of the development in three planned villages The nearby city of Palmetto annexed one of the village sites leaving a gerrymander looking arm of Palmetto sticking northwest into the heart of the new city br On June residents voted by an to margin in a local referendum to incorporate the acre km portion within Fulton as the city of Chattahoochee Hill Country Later annexation could incorporate the portions remaining in other counties br Chattahoochee Hill Country became a city on December with the first elected officials taking office a few days later On September the city was renamed by an ordinance as Chattahoochee Hills br Subsequent zoning updates have maintained the vision of preservation but have decoupled the development from specific landowner sites The end result foreseen by the zoning will permanently protect of the City s land as forest and farm while consolidating the development on the balance of the City s territory in a variety of hamlet village and town typologies scattered throughout the preserved land developed on a first come first served basis Land will be conserved through a variety of methods including preservation internal to developments as well as external preservation through the sale and purchase of Transferable development rights TDR s br In the City responded to
