id: 1040255
Elections in Georgia are held to fill various state and federal seats Regular elections are held every even year The positions being decided each year varies as the terms of office varies The State Senate State House and U S House will typically be up for election as all of those positions have two year terms Special elections are held to fill vacated offices Georgia is one of seven states that require a run off election if no candidate receives a majority of the vote in a primary election Uniquely Georgia requires a run off election for state and congressional offices if no candidate wins a majority of the vote in a general election only Louisiana has a similar requirement but it operates under a different election system br In a ranking of U S states by electoral integrity by PEI electoral integrity project conducted in Georgia ranked st among all U S states and District of Columbia While all other states electoral integrity was valued at very high high or moderate Georgia was the only state in the rankings to be designated as a state with low electoral integrity It scored out of in the PEI index getting lowest marks in voting boundaries out of and the highest in Party and candidate registration out of br In a study Georgia was ranked as the second most difficult state for citizens to vote in br br br History br br Following the end of martial law and readmission to the Union during Reconstruction Georgia was overwhelmingly dominated by the Democratic Party for a hundred years as were many other states of the Confederacy White voters often perceived the Republican Party as the party of the North standing for Yankee values growing industrialisation and an excessively powerful and interfering federal government all arrayed against their localized agricultural society The abolition of slavery by amendment to the U S Constitution and the legacy of an economy damaged by war and social upheaval led many to bitterly oppose a wide variety of national policies br Elections to the U S Congress during this period saw almost exclusively Democratic senators and either totally or almost totally Democratic House rule From to Georgia voters consistently elected Democrats as governor and Democratic majorities to the state legislature Like many other Southern states the Democratic controlled legislature established run off elections for primaries in which no candidate receives more than of the vote In addition the Democratic primaries were further defined by their usage of the white primary to exclude African Americans and other ethnicities from participation as well as the usage of the county unit system from to to allocate votes to winners along rural biased lines br Historically elections at all levels of government in the U S state of Georgia were dominated by conservative white Democrats in the period between Reconstruction and the end of the New Deal Coalition For decades Republicans were a tiny minority generally associated with Union military victory at the end of the Civil War Indeed for several years the Republicans did not even field a candidate for governor or any other statewide elected office br Beginning in the s the credible enforcement of new laws inspired by the Civil Rights Movement began to steadily erode the preponderance of Democrats in elective office in Georgia The repeal of Jim Crow laws allowed previously disenfranchised African Americans to vote in elections and be active in politics As many of these people joined with some white Democrats to work for more immediate liberal and pluralistic policies a growing number of conservative white Democrats who supported either gradual change or none at all either began splitting their tickets at the national level or switching outright to the GOP The strong showing in Georgia by Republican President Dwight D Eisenhower in the presidential race proved to be a turning point Georgia would remain competitive at the national level for most of the rest of the th century the Republican Party appeared positioned to gain even more ground in the coming years The Democratic Party did not carry the state from the election until Jimmy Carter ran for the White House years later br br br Modern times and the shift to Republican dominance br Beginning with Barry Goldwater s presidential bid in the Republican Party began making inroads in Georgia The state swung over dramatically to support Goldwater the first time it had gone Republican in a presidential election in American history In time the Republican Party of Georgia would field competitive candidates and win races for seats in the U S Senate and U S House of Representatives Republicans also began making gains at the state level mostly in the Atlanta suburbs However conservative Democrats continued to hold most offices at the local level well into the s br In presidential races Georgia has given its electoral college votes to the Republican candidate all but five times since in segregationist George Wallace won a plurality of Georgia s votes on the American Independent Party ticket former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter won his home state by landslide margins in and sweeping every county in the state in then Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton won a plurality of votes in against incumbent Republican George H W Bush and Independent Ross Perot and former Delaware Senator and Vice President Joe Biden won a plurality of votes in against incumbent Republican Donald Trump Republican George W Bush won Georgia by double digits in and with and respectively of the vote making him the only Republican presidential candidate to carry Georgia twice In John McCain won the state by a narrower margin of only points winning to Democrat Barack Obama s In Mitt Romney won the state with to Obama s In Donald Trump won the state with to Hillary Clinton s br br By conservative Republicans had become the dominant force in state elections with Republicans holding the offices of governor and lieutenant governor and significant majorities in both houses of the state General Assembly br As in many states Democratic strongholds in Georgia include urban and minority dominated areas Democrats typically fare well in cities such as Atlanta and its suburbs such as Gwinnett County Macon and Columbus which have large minority populations as well as Athens home of the University of Georgia The Republican Party dominates state elections through its hold on rural south Georgia with a very notable exception in the southwestern part of the state the Appalachian north and many of Atlanta s further suburbs and exurbs Former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich co author of the Contract with America and architect of the Republican Revolution represented a district in Cobb County a suburban Atlanta county which has since flipped to supporting Democratic candidates since br A feature of Georgia elections is the requirement for plus one majorities in general and primary elections triggering runoff elections if no candidate receives a majority From to the Democratic Party used a combination of the white primary and the county unit system to ensure that only white rural voters preferences were reflected in the de facto election of political offices across the state although the white primary was abolished in the federal case King v Chapman After the county unit system was struck down by the Supreme Court case Gray v Sanders accompanied by the election of Carl Sanders who became the first Democrat to be nominated for governor by popular vote since the establishment of the county unit system the General Assembly passed a bill to switch future Georgia elections to runoff voting The bill was introduced and sponsored by Macon legislator Denmark Groover who proposed that runoff voting would again provide protection which was removed with the death of the county unit system and warned that W e have got to go the majority vote because all we have to have is a plurality and the Negroes and the pressure groups and special interests are going to manipulate this State and take charge br However the following ascendance of the Republican Party culminated in the defeat of incumbent Wyche Fowler by Republican Paul Coverdell by runoff despite Fowler leading the first round by a plurality This led the Georgia Legislature then controlled by Democrats to change the state s laws requiring a run off election only if the winning candidate received less than of the vote In the Senate election the winner Democrat Max Cleland won with only ahead of Republican Guy Millner thus avoiding a run off In after Republicans took control of the legislature the run off requirement was changed back to in the same bill which implemented a requirement for Voter ID br br br Current status br The current Governor of Georgia is Brian Kemp who was elected as a Republican in The Lieutenant Governor is Burt Jones Other elected state executive officials include Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger Attorney General Chris Carr Commissioner of Insurance Jim Beck and Superintendent of Schools Richard Woods br The Georgia General Assembly has been controlled by the Republicans since They have majorities over the Democrats in both the Senate and House of Representatives by margins of to and to respectively as of In congressional elections until the runoffs Georgia was represented in the U S Senate by David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler both Republicans with Loeffler having been appointed by Governor Brian Kemp after Johnny Isakson announced his retirement in The state also sends members to the U S House of Representatives which in included Republicans and Democrats br However in Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams received of the vote resulting in the closest gubernatorial election since a following runoff for Secretary of State was the first time that a statewide constitutional office was subjected to a runoff election br In the early s despite a Republican trifecta in the state government the state became a competitive swing state with Democrats including two progressive senators winning all three statewide federal races The state voted for Joe Biden for president and senators Jon Ossoff the state s first Jewish senator and Raphael Warnock the state s first Black senator The win was reported to be due to the increased turnout in African American voters due to the work of Stacey Abrams and LaTosha Brown Raffensperger announced in that about Georgians face investigation for voting twice in primary elections on July According to him those voters returned absentee ballots and then showed up at polling places on election day In Georgia swung back substantially to the right towards Republicans with incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp winning reelection by almost double digits at over Democrat Stacey Abrams with a raw vote margin of over votes Every other Republican statewide in Georgia won their elections by a margin of in However Raphael Warnock narrowly won election to his first full term in a December runoff against Republican opponent Herschel Walker who came within points of Warnock but fell short Indicating Georgia has significantly moved into being a red leaning purple state with a PVI of R and regarded by many to be one of if not the most competitive states in the country Republicans continuing to dominate and maintain complete control at the state level in Georgia but the federal level is extremely competitive br br br See also br
