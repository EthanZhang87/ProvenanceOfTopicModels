The United States census was the rd United States census National Census Day the reference day used for the census was April The census was taken via mail in citizen self reporting with enumerators serving to spot check randomly selected neighborhoods and communities As part of a drive to increase the count s accuracy temporary enumerators were hired The population of the United States was counted as a increase from the United States Census This was the first census in which all states recorded a population of over people as well as the first in which all largest cities recorded populations of over br It was the first census since that California did not record the largest population growth in absolute number Texas surpassed California s growth by million to million br br br Introduction br As required by the United States Constitution the U S Census has been conducted every years since The U S Census was the previous census completed Participation in the U S Census is required by law of people living in the United States in Title of the United States Code br On January Census Bureau Director Robert Groves personally inaugurated the census enumeration by counting World War II veteran Clifton Jackson a resident of Noorvik Alaska More than million census forms were delivered by the U S Post Office beginning March The number of forms mailed out or hand delivered by the Census Bureau was approximately million on April Although the questionnaire used April as the reference date as to where a person was living an insert dated March included the following printed in bold type Please complete and mail back the enclosed census form today br The census national mail participation rate was From April through July census takers visited households that didn t return a form an operation called non response follow up NRFU br In December the U S Census Bureau delivered population information to the U S president for apportionment and later in March complete redistricting data was delivered to states br Personally identifiable information will be available in br br br Major changes br The Census Bureau did not use a long form for the census In several previous censuses one in six households received this long form which asked for detailed social and economic information The census used only a short form asking ten basic questions br br How many people were living or staying in this house apartment or mobile home on April br Were there any additional people staying here on April that you did not include in Question Mark all that apply checkboxes for children relatives non relatives people staying temporarily none br Is this house apartment or mobile home Checkboxes for owned with a mortgage owned free and clear rented occupied

Person sometimes live or stay somewhere else checkboxes for No and several locations for Yes br The form included space to repeat some or all of these questions for up to twelve residents total br In contrast to the census an Internet response option was not offered nor was the form available for download br Detailed socioeconomic information collected during past censuses will continue to be collected through the American Community Survey The survey provides data about communities in the United States on a year or year cycle depending on the size of the community rather than once every years A small percentage of the population on a rotating basis will receive the survey each year and no household will receive it more than once every five years br In June the U S Census Bureau announced that it would count same sex married couples However the final form did not contain a separate same sex married couple option When noting the relationship between household members same sex couples who are married could mark their spouses as being Husband or wife the same response given by opposite sex married couples An unmarried partner option was available for couples whether same sex or opposite sex who were not married br The Census Language Program was significantly expanded Language assistance in languages in the Census was increased to languages in Census In addition to English Census questionnaire was available in five non English languages Spanish Chinese simplified Korean Vietnamese and Russian br br br Cost br The census cost billion approximately per capita by comparison the census per capita cost for China was about US and for India was US Operational costs were billion significantly under the billion budget In December the Government Accountability Office GAO noted that the cost of conducting the census has approximately doubled each decade since In a detailed report to Congress the GAO called on the Census Bureau to address cost and design issues and at that time had estimated the census cost to be billion br In August Commerce Secretary Gary Locke announced that the census operational costs came in significantly under budget of an almost billion operational budget br br million was saved in the budget for the door to door questioning NRFU phase because of households returned mailed questionnaires br million was saved because of lower than planned costs in areas including Alaska and tribal lands and br the million emergency fund was not needed br Locke credited the management practices of Census Bureau director Robert Groves citing in particular the decision to buy additional advertising in locations where responses lagged which improved the overall response rate The agency also has begun to rely more on questioning neighbors or other reliable third parties when a person could not be immediately reached at home which reduced the cost of follow up visits Census data for about of U S households that did not reply by mail were based on such outside interviews Groves said br br br Technology br In Lockheed Martin won a six year million contract to capture and standardize data for the census The contract included systems facilities and staffing The final value of that contract was in excess of one billion dollars Information technology was about a quarter of the projected billion cost of the decennial census The use of high speed document scanning technology such as ImageTrac scanners developed by IBML helped Lockheed Martin complete the project on schedule and under budget br Due to the rise in social media and cell phone usage in the U S the Census Bureau used research gathered through a cell phone study in order to target media and adds to populations that were nonrespondents and promote census participation This study also helped gauge the mindset of those who fail to respond trying to figure out why br This was the first census to use hand held computing devices with GPS capability although they were only used for the address canvassing operation Enumerators information gatherers that had operational problems with the device understandably made negative reports During the Senate confirmation hearings for Robert Groves President Obama s Census Director appointee there was much mention of contracting problems but very little criticism of the units themselves The Census Bureau chose to conduct the primary operation Non Response Follow Up NRFU without using the handheld computing devices br br br Marketing and undercounts br Due to allegations surrounding previous censuses that poor people and non whites are routinely undercounted for the census the Census Bureau tried to avoid that bias by enlisting tens of thousands of intermediaries such as churches charities and firms to explain to people the importance of being counted br There was a penalty of for not completing some or all of the U S Census Census Bureau director Robert Grove however wrote the Census Bureau has rarely prosecuted failure to respond While the rationale for the mandatory nature of the census still applies today our message for the Census is about the common good benefits of participation The fine for non participation is much lower than that for reporting false information In that penalty was br There was a one hundred dollar fine for not answering part or all of the U S census The census director Robert Grove wrote in the Census Bureau has rarely prosecuted failure to respond While the rationale for the mandatory nature of the census still applies today our message for the Census is about the common good benefits of participation The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ACORN was given a contract to help publicize the importance of the census count and to encourage individuals to fill out their forms In September after controversial undercover videos showing four ACORN staffers giving tax advice to a man and a woman posing as a prostitute the bureau canceled ACORN s contract Various American celebrities including Demi Lovato and Eva Longoria were used in public service announcements targeting younger people to fill out census forms Wilmer Valderrama and Rosario Dawson have helped spread census awareness among young Hispanics a historically low participating ethnicity in the U S census Rapper Ludacris also participated in efforts to spread awareness of the census br The Census Bureau hired about people to find those U S residents who had not returned their forms by mail as of May census workers had been victims of crime while conducting the census As of June there were incidents involving assaults or threats against enumerators more than double the incidents in one enumerator attempting to hand deliver the census forms to a Hawaii County police officer was arrested for trespassing the officer s fellow policemen made the arrest br Some political conservatives and libertarians questioned the validity of the questions and even encouraged people to refuse to answer questions for privacy and constitutional reasons Michele Bachmann a former conservative Republican Representative from Minnesota stated that she would not fill out her census form other than to indicate the number of people living in her household because the Constitution doesn t require any information beyond that Former Republican representative and Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr stated that the census has become too intrusive going beyond the mere enumeration i e count intended by the framers of the U S Constitution According to political commentator Juan Williams Census participation rates have been declining since and if conservatives don t participate doubts about its accuracy and credibility may become fatal br As a result the Census Bureau undertook an unprecedented advertising campaign targeted at encouraging white political conservatives to fill out their forms in the hope of avoiding an undercount of this group The U S census was the primary sponsor at NASCAR races in Atlanta Bristol and Martinsville and sponsored the No Ford Fusion driven by Greg Biffle for part of the season because of a marketing survey that indicated most NASCAR fans lean politically conservative It also ran an advertisement during the Super Bowl and hired singer Marie Osmond who is thought to have many conservative fans to publicize the census br br br Reapportionment br br The results of the census determined the number of seats that each state received in the United States House of Representatives starting with the elections Consequently this affected the number of votes each state had in the Electoral College for the presidential election br Because of population changes eighteen states had changes in their number of seats Eight states gained at least one seat and ten states lost at least one seat The final result involved seats being switched br br br Controversies br Some objected to the counting of persons who are in the United States illegally Senators David Vitter R LA and Bob Bennett R UT tried unsuccessfully to add questions on immigration status to the census form br Organizations such as the Prison Policy Initiative argued that the census counts of incarcerated men and women as residents of prisons rather than of their pre incarceration addresses skewed political clout and resulted in misleading demographic and population data Many residents of prisons counted on the census were those who identify as Black and Hispanic This could lead to the loss of resources for underserved minority communities br The term Negro was used in the questionnaire as one of the options for African Americans Question What is Person number s race Black African Am or Negro as a choice to describe one s race Census Bureau spokesman Jack Martin explained that many older African Americans identified themselves that way and many still do Those who identify themselves as Negroes need to be included The word was also used in the census with over people identifying themselves as Negro In response to complaints over the word s inclusion on the census the Census Bureau announced in that it would stop using Negro going forward with the American Community Survey census form being the first without the word br Perhaps not a controversy but yet another challenge for the Census Bureau in was that almost three million people selected that their race was Black and in combination with another race This reflects societal changes in the first decade of the st century as hospitals had begun recognizing multiple races at the birth of a child Thus when parents are reporting their child s race on the census they selected multiple races br The census contained ten questions about age gender ethnicity home ownership and household relationships Six of the ten questions were to be answered for each individual in the household Federal law has provisions for fining those who refuse to complete the census form br Detroit Mayor Dave Bing held a press conference on March to announce that the city would challenge its census results The challenge being led by the city s planning department cited an inconsistency as an example showing a downtown census tract which lost only housing units but people implying that a downtown jail or dormitory was missed in canvassing br NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg held a conference on March to announce that the city would also challenge his city s census results specifically the apparent undercounting in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn Bloomberg said that the numbers for Queens and Brooklyn the two most populous boroughs are implausible According to the census they grew by only and respectively while the other boroughs grew by between and He also stated that the census showed improbably high numbers of vacant housing in vital neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights Queens br The District of Columbia announced in August that it would also challenge its census results The Mayor s Office claimed that the detailed information provided for census blocks is nonsensical listing examples of census data that show housing units located in the middle of a street that does not actually exist However officials do not believe the city s total population will drastically change as a result of the challenge br br br State rankings br br The state with the highest percentage rate of growth was Nevada while the state with the largest population increase was Texas Michigan the th largest by population was the only state to lose population although Puerto Rico a U S territory lost population as well and the District of Columbia saw its first gain since the s The resident populations listed below do not include people living overseas For Congressional apportionment the sum of a state s resident population and its population of military personnel and federal contractors living overseas but not other citizens
