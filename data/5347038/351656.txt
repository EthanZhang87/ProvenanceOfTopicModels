The Geographic Names Information System GNIS is a database of name and location information about more than two million physical and cultural features throughout the United States and its territories the associated states of the Marshall Islands Federated States of Micronesia and Palau and Antarctica It is a type of gazetteer It was developed by the United States Geological Survey USGS in cooperation with the United States Board on Geographic Names BGN to promote the standardization of feature names br Data were collected in two phases br Although a third phase was considered which would have handled name changes where local usages differed from maps it was never begun br The database is part of a system that includes topographic map names and bibliographic references The names of books and historic maps that confirm the feature or place name are cited Variant names alternatives to official federal names for a feature are also recorded Each feature receives a permanent unique feature record identifier sometimes called the GNIS identifier The database never removes an entry except in cases of obvious duplication br br br Original purposes br The GNIS was originally designed for four major purposes to eliminate duplication of effort at various other levels of government that were already compiling geographic data to provide standardized datasets of geographic data for the government and others to index all of the names found on official U S government federal and state maps and to ensure uniform geographic names for the federal government br br br Phase br Phase lasted from to with a precursor pilot project run over the states of Kansas and Colorado in and produced databases br It excluded several classes of feature because they were better documented in non USGS maps including airports the broadcasting masts for radio and television stations civil divisions regional and historic names individual buildings roads and triangulation station names br The databases were initially available on paper to spiral bound volumes per state on microfiche and on magnetic tape encoded unless otherwise requested in EBCDIC with byte fixed length records in byte blocks br The feature classes for association with each name included for examples locale a place at which there is or was human activity not covered by a more specific feature class populated place a place or area with clustered or scattered buildings spring a spring lava a lava flow kepula or other such feature and well a well br Mountain features would fall into ridge range or summit classes br A feature class tank was sometimes used for lakes which was problematic in several ways br This feature class was undocumented and it was in the words of a report from the Engineer Topographic Laboratories of the United States Army Corps of Engineers an unreasonable determination with the likes of Cayuga Lake being labelled a tank br The USACE report assumed that tank meant reservoir and observed that often the coordinates of tanks were outside of their boundaries and were possibly at the point where a dam is thought to be br br br National Geographic Names database br The National Geographic Names database NGNDB hereafter was originally computer files one for each state and territory of the United States except Alaska which got two plus one for the District of Columbia br The second Alaska file was an earlier database the Dictionary of Alaska Place Names that had been compiled by the USGS in br A further two files were later added covering the entire United States and that were abridged versions of the data in the other one for the most well known populated places and features and one for most of the populated places br The files were compiled from all of the names to be found on USGS topographic maps plus data from various state map sources br In phase elevations were recorded in feet only with no conversion to metric and only if there was an actual elevation recorded for the map feature br They were of either the lowest or highest point of the feature as appropriate br Interpolated elevations calculated by interpolation between contour lines were added in phase br Names were the official name except where the name contained diacritic characters that the computer file encodings of the time could not handle which were in phase marked with an asterisk for update in a later phase br Generic designations were given after specific names so for examples Mount Saint Helens was recorded as Saint Helens Mount although cities named Mount Olive not actually being mountains would not take Mount to be a generic part and would retain their order Mount Olive br The primary geographic coordinates of features which occupy an area rather than being a single point feature were the location of the feature s mouth or of the approximate center of the area of the feature br Such approximate centers were eye balled estimates by the people performing the digitization subject to the constraint that centers of areal features were not placed within other features that are inside them br alluvial fans and river deltas counted as mouths for this purpose For cities and other large populated places the coordinates were taken to be those of a primary civic feature such as the city hall or town hall main public library main highway intersection main post office or central business district regardless of changes over time these coordinates are called the primary point br Secondary coordinates were only an aid to locating which topographic map s the feature extended across and were simply anywhere on the feature and on the topographic map with which it is associated br River sources were determined by the shortest drain subject to the proxmities of other features that were clearly related to the river by their names br br br USGS Topographic Map Names database br The USGS Topographic Map Names database TMNDB hereafter was also computer files containing the names of maps for scale USGS maps as with the NGNDB the th being rather than a second Alaska file data from the and scale USGS maps br Map names were recorded exactly as on the maps themselves with the exceptions for diacritics as with the NGNDB br Unlike the NGNDB locations were the geographic co rdinates of the south east corner of the given map except for American Samoa and Guam maps where they were of the north east cornder br The TMNDB was later renamed the Geographic Cell Names database GCNDB hereafter in the s br br br Generic database br The Generic database was in essence a machine readable glossary of terms and abbreviations taken from the map sources with their definitions grouped into collections of related terms br br br National Atlas database br The National Atlas database was an abridged version of the NGNDB that contained only those entries that were in the index to the USGS National Atlas of the United States with the co rdinates published in the latter substituted for the co rdinates from the former br br br Board on Geographic Names database br The Board on Geographic Names database was a record of investigative work of the USGS Board on Geographic Names Domestic Names Committee and decisions that it had made from onwards as well as names that were enshrined by Acts of Congress br Elevation and location data followed the same rules as for the NGNDB br So too did names with diacritic characters br br br Phase br Phase was broader in scope than phase extending the scope to a much larger set of data sources br It ran from the end of phase and had managed to completely process data from states by with still underway and the remaining Alaska Kentucky Michigan and New York awaiting the initial systematic compilation of the sources to use br Many more feature classes were included including abandoned Native American settlements ghost towns railway stations on railway lines that no longer existed housing developments shopping centers and highway rest areas br The actual compilation was outsourced by the U S government state by state to private entities such as university researchers br br br Antarctica Geographic Names database br The Antarctica Geographic Names database AGNDB hereafter was added in the s and comprised records for BGN approved names in Antarctica and various off lying islands such as the South Orkney Islands the South Shetland Islands the Balleny Islands Heard Island South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands br It only contained records for natural features not for scientific outposts br br br Additional media br The media on which one could obtain the databases were extended in the s still including tape and paper to floppy disc over FTP and on CD ROM br The CD ROM edition only included the NGNDB the AGNDB the GCNDB and a bibliographic reference database RDB but came with database search software that ran on PC DOS or compatible version or later br The FTP site included extra topical databases a subset of the NGNDB that only included the records with feature classes for populated places a Concise subset of the NGNDB that listed major features and a Historical subset that included the features that no longer exist br br br Populated places br There is no differentiation amongst different types of populated places br In the words of the aforementioned USACE report a subdivision having one inhabitant is as significant as a major metropolitan center such as New York City br In comparing GNIS populated place records with data from the Thematic Mapper of the Landsat program researchers from the University of Connecticut in discovered that a significant number of populated places in Connecticut had no identifiable human settlement in the land use data and were at road intersections br They found that such populated places with no actual settlement often had Corner in their names and hypothesized that either these were historical records or were cartographic locators br In surveying in the United States a Corner is a corner of the surveyed polygon enclosing an area of land whose location is or was since corners can become lost or obliterated marked in various ways including with trees known as bearing trees witness trees in older terminology or corner monuments br From analysing Native American names in the database in order to compile a dictionary professor William Bright of UCLA observed in that some GNIS entries are erroneous or refer to long vanished railroad sidings where no one ever lived Such false classifications have propagated to other geographical information sources such as incorrectly classified train stations appearing as towns or neighborhoods on Google Maps br br br Name changes br The GNIS accepts proposals for new or changed names for U S geographical features through The National Map Corps The general public can make proposals at the GNIS web site and can review the justifications and supporters of the proposals br The usual sources of name change requests are an individual state s board on geographic names or a county board of governors br This does not always succeed the State Library of Montana having submitted three large sets of name changes that have not been incorporated into the GNIS database br Conversely a group of middle school students in Alaska succeeded with the help of their teachers a professor of linguistics and a man who had been conducting a years long project to collect Native American placenames in the area in changing the names of several places that they had spotted in class one day and challenged for being racist including renaming Negrohead Creek to an Athabascan name Lochenyatth Creek and Negrohead Mountain to Tl oo Khanishyah Mountain both of which translate to grassy tussocks in Lower Tanana and Gwich in respectively br Likewise in researching a book on ethnic slurs in U S placenames Mark Monmonier of Syracuse University discovered Niger Hill in Potter County Pennsylvania an erroneous transcription of Nigger Hill from a map and persuaded the USBGN to change it to Negro Hill br br br Removal of racial and ethnic slurs br In November the United States Secretary of the Interior issued an order instructing that Squaw be removed from usage by the U S federal government br Prior efforts had included a replacement of the Nigger racial pejorative for African Americans with Negro and a replacement of the Jap racial pejorative for Japanese Americans with Japanese br In a cross reference of the GNIS database against the Racial Slur Database had found racial slur placenames every state of the United States having them with California having and the state with the most such names being Arizona br One of the two standard reference works for placenames in Arizona is Byrd Howell Granger s book Arizona s Names X Marks the Place which contains many additional names with racial slurs not in the GNIS database br Despite Nigger having been removed from federal government use by Stewart Udall its replacement Negro still remained in GNIS names in as did Pickaninny Uncle Tom and Jim Crow and places named Niggerhead br There were names containing squaw including variations on Squaw Tit and Squaw Teat contrasting with the use of Nipple in names with non Native American allusions such as Susies Nipple br br br Other authorities br The United States Census Bureau USCB defines Census Designated Places as a subset of locations in the National Geographic Names Database br United States Postal Service USPS Publication gives standards for addressing mail In this publication the postal service defines two letter state abbreviations street identifiers such as boulevard BLVD and street ST and secondary identifiers such as suite STE br
