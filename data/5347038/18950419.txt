id: 18950419
Metro Atlanta designated by the United States Office of Management and Budget as the Atlanta Sandy Springs Roswell metropolitan statistical area is the most populous metropolitan statistical area in the U S state of Georgia and the sixth largest in the United States based on the July metropolitan area population estimates from the U S Census Bureau Its economic cultural and demographic center is Atlanta and its total population was in the estimate from the U S Census Bureau br The core counties of metropolitan Atlanta are Fulton DeKalb Cobb Gwinnett and Clayton counties The metro area forms the core of a broader trading area the Atlanta Athens Clarke County Sandy Springs combined statistical area The combined statistical area spans up to counties in North Georgia The CSA recorded in the U S census a population of Atlanta is the largest metropolitan area in the U S Census Bureau s Southeast region It surpassed the Greater Miami area in total population in and both the Washington metropolitan area and the Philadelphia metropolitan area in the latter of which is in the Northeast region br br br Definitions br By U S Census Bureau standards the population of the Atlanta region spreads across a metropolitan area of square miles km comparable to the size of Israel Because Georgia contains more counties than any other state except Texas explained in part by the now defunct county unit system of weighing votes in primary elections area residents live under a heavily decentralized collection of governments As of the census fewer than one in ten residents of the metropolitan area lived inside Atlanta city limits br A survey by the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce counted cities and towns in the county Metropolitan Statistical Area MSA in mid Ten cities Johns Creek Milton Chattahoochee Hills Dunwoody Peachtree Corners Brookhaven Tucker Stonecrest South Fulton and Mableton have incorporated since then following the lead of Sandy Springs in br The Atlanta metropolitan area was first defined in as Fulton DeKalb Gwinnett Cobb and Clayton counties Walton Newton Douglas Fayette Forsyth Henry Cherokee Rockdale and Butts counties were added after the census with Barrow and Coweta counties joining in and Bartow Carroll Paulding Pickens and Spalding counties in br Atlanta s larger combined statistical area CSA adds the Gainesville and Athens metropolitan areas plus LaGrange Thomaston Jefferson Calhoun and Cedartown micropolitan areas for a total population of The CSA also abuts the Macon and Columbus MSAs The region is one of the metropolises of the Southeastern United States and is part of the emerging megalopolis known as Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion along the I Corridor br br br Metropolitan statistical area br The counties listed below are included in the Atlanta Sandy Springs Roswell metropolitan statistical area In the Office of Management and Budget split the MSA into two conurbated metropolitan divisions br The Atlanta Sandy Springs Roswell metropolitan division consists of the following counties br br The Marietta metropolitan consists of the following five counties br br Some entities define a much smaller metropolitan area by including only the counties which have the densest suburban development Fulton DeKalb Gwinnett Cobb and Clayton were the five original counties when the Atlanta metropolitan area was first defined in and continue to be the core of the metro area These five counties along with six more Cherokee Douglas Fayette Henry Rockdale and Forsyth are members of the Atlanta Regional Commission a weak metropolitan government organization which also is a regional planning agency The eleven ARC counties bolded and four more Bartow Coweta Hall Paulding with an asterisk form part of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District created in br br br Atlanta Sandy Springs Roswell MSA br br The counties listed above with under residents are usually not included in any other metropolitan definition except the OMB Census Bureau s MSA and CSA br Hall County forms the Gainesville MSA but with astronomical growth to over residents is now also part of the Atlanta CSA br The official tourism website of the State of Georgia features an Atlanta Metro tourism region that includes only eight counties Fulton DeKalb Gwinnett Cobb Clayton Douglas Fayette and Henry br br br Combined statistical area br br br Atlanta GA AL CSA br br br Municipalities br br br Edge cities br Cumberland br Perimeter Center br Hartsfield Jackson area br Gwinnett Place Sugarloaf area br More than one half of metro Atlanta s population is in unincorporated areas or areas considered a census designated place CDP by the census bureau One notable example is East Cobb an unincorporated area though not a CDP adjacent to Marietta and Roswell in Cobb County With an estimated population of approximately as of it would be the second largest city in the metro besides Atlanta if incorporated br Metro Atlanta includes the following incorporated and unincorporated suburbs both inside and outside Atlanta exurbs and surrounding cities sorted by population according to census data or later data if the city was incorporated after and census data is unavailable br br br Cities and suburbs br Principal Cities br br Atlanta pop br Athens included in CSA pop br Places with to inhabitants br br East Cobb

Places with or fewer inhabitants br br br Geography br br br Topography and geology br The area sprawls across the low foothills of the Appalachian Mountains to the north and the Piedmont to the south The northern and some western suburbs tend to be higher and significantly more hilly than the southern and eastern suburbs The average elevation is around feet m br The highest point in the immediate area is Kennesaw Mountain at ft m followed by Stone Mountain at ft m Sweat Mountain at ft m and Little Kennesaw Mountain at ft m Others include Blackjack Mountain Lost Mountain Brushy Mountain Pine Mountain and Mount Wilkinson Vinings Mountain Many of these play prominently in the various battles of the Atlanta Campaign during the American Civil War If the further north counties are included Bear Mountain is highest followed by Pine Log Mountain Sawnee Mountain and Hanging Mountain followed by the others listed above Stone Sweat Bear and Sawnee are all home to some of the area s broadcast stations br The area s subsoil is a dense clay soil colored rusty by the iron oxide present in it It becomes very muddy and sticky when wet and hard when dry and stains light colored carpets and clothing easily It also tends to have a low pH further aggravating gardeners The fineness of it also means it is easily deposited into streams during heavy rains creating silt problems where it is exposed due to construction This transported red soil can be seen downstream on the riverbanks of south Georgia where the native clay is white and down to the Florida panhandle where the native sand is also white Topsoil is present only in natural forest areas created by the decomposition of leaf litter br br br Earthquakes and fault lines br An extinct fault line called the Brevard Fault runs roughly parallel to the Chattahoochee River but as its last movements were apparently prehistoric it is considered extinct and not a threat to the region Still minor earthquakes do rattle the area and all of Georgia occasionally One notable one was in April magnitude coming from the northwest its epicenter just across the state line in northeastern Alabama While many people slept through the A M quake it caused a minor panic in others completely unaware of what was happening Similar earthquakes occur in this region called the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone often felt much more widely across the stronger crust of eastern North America as compared to the west br Thus the Charleston South Carolina earthquake was also felt in Atlanta and throughout the Southeast It caused damage as far as central Alabama and West Virginia Two small earthquakes were also felt on the southeast side near Eatonton in early April The New Madrid Seismic Zone near the Missouri Tennessee borders and the seismic zone producing the magnitude earthquake are still capable of producing moderate or major earthquakes which the entire Atlanta area will feel moderately or even strongly br br br Climate br br The Atlanta metro area has a humid subtropical climate with four seasons Summer is the longest January daily lows average from F C north to south and highs range from F C but often reach well above or below this average There is an average annual snowfall of about inches cm falling mostly from December through March though there was snow north of the city on April Snow flurries are actually common during the winter months when there is an especially deep trough in the jet stream These events usually do not amount to more than a slight dusting and therefore go unrecognized in most weather summaries br Summers are long and consistently hot and humid July mornings average F C and afternoons average F C with slight breezes and typically a chance of afternoon thunderstorms During the summer afternoon thunderstorms temperatures may suddenly drop to degrees with locally heavy rainfall Average annual rainfall is about inches mm Late winter and early spring as well as July are the wettest Fall especially October is the driest br From to the highest recorded temperatures at Atlanta were F C on three days in the extraordinarily hot July followed by F C that month and in August the hottest month ever for the area This was broken on the last day of June when the temperature reached F C during a massive heat wave that hit most of the country with another the next day tying the July record The lowest recorded temperatures were F C and F C on January and of and F C on February during severe cold snaps that went so far south they devastated the entire citrus industry in central Florida br Hurricane Opal brought sustained tropical storm conditions to the area one night in early October uprooting hundreds of trees and causing widespread power outages after soaking the area with rain for two days prior Since some metro counties have been hit more than times by tornadoes Cobb and Fulton are two of the highest in the state The Dunwoody tornado in early April was the worst tornado to have struck the area A tornado struck downtown Atlanta in March causing a half billion dollars in damage one of the most expensive storms ever recorded anywhere br The area experiences a winter storm with significant snowfall about once each year This can be extremely irregular with several consecutive years receiving no measurable snow A blizzard see Storm of the Century caught much of the Southeast off guard in dumping inches cm at the Atlanta airport on March and much more than that in the suburbs to the north and west as well as in the mountains The only other recorded winter storm of comparable severity was the Great Blizzard of The heaviest snow was in January when inches cm buried the city during its coldest month on record The second heaviest was in when a very late storm dumped inches cm on March Ice storms have occurred in the area The well remembered ice storm was brutal as was the storm in br The Southeastern U S drought of began with dry weather in and left area lakes very low The drought began to abate significantly after the Atlanta floods when some areas got up to inches mm of rain in a week with half of that falling in just hours near the end of the period The USGS calculated it to be a greater than year flood br br br Environment br The area s prolific rains are drained by many different streams and creeks The main basin is that of the Chattahoochee River running northeast to southwest The further northwestern suburbs drain into the Etowah River via the Little River and Lake Allatoona The southern suburbs are drained by the Flint River and the east southeastern ones by the Oconee River and Yellow River br By the metro area was using million US gallons m of water per day about US gallons L per person per day from these rivers This usage was reduced by more than during the drought but soared back up after watering restrictions were eased and before the flooding ensued The need for water is seen as a barrier to further growth in the area but permanent measures for non emergency water conservation have never been put in place The state legislature has refused to pass a requirement for low flow toilets to be installed in homes that are sold bowing to pressure from the real estate sales industry br Disputes over water are becoming increasingly common with both Alabama and Florida filing lawsuits and threatening injunctions to prevent Georgia from taking too much water mostly for metro Atlanta South Carolina also threatened when a pipeline east to the Savannah River was mentioned even informally The state has now been ordered by a judge to reduce withdrawals from the Chattahoochee south of Lanier to s levels within three years something that would create an immediate emergency water shortage if it were actually enforced br br br Flora br The native forest canopy is mainly oak redbud hickory poplar tuliptree pine and sweetgum with chestnut having been common decades before in what is now considered oak hickory forest Saw palmetto Sabal palmetto and Trachycarpus fortunei have become common ornamentals as well Traveling from the south the metro area is generally the first area in which autumn leaf color can be seen due to the different trees growing at the higher elevation and latitude Underneath the flowering dogwood is very common the black cherry are quite prolific with mulberry popping up sometimes as well Sourwood is also in its native range and is easily identified by the fact that it turns fiery red in early October much brighter and weeks earlier than most other trees which usually peak in early November br Shrubby plants include blackberry horsechestnut sumac and sometimes hawthorn Virginia creeper poison ivy and briar are common vines The Confederate yellow daisy is a wildflower native only to the area around Stone Mountain br Common garden plants include dogwood azalea hydrangea flowering cherry maples pin oak red tip photinia holly juniper white pine magnolia Bradford pear forsythia liriope mondograss and English ivy Lawns can be either cool season grasses like fescue and rye or warm season like zoysia and bermudagrass which turn brown in late fall A few homeowners associations actually prohibit green grass in the winter br Native to the nearby mountains maples are now one of the most common landscape trees for new homes and parking lots giving their color in the fall instead of spring When planted close to buildings which provide shelter and radiate heat they can retain some of their color into December especially if November has been warm br Common lawn weeds are mock strawberry violet wild onion and of course the ubiquitous dandelion crabgrass and plantain br By far the most notorious introduced species is kudzu a highly invasive species from Japan which climbs and smothers trees and shrubs New effective herbicides as well as increased development of formerly rural areas has greatly reduced kudzu in the metro area although still quite common elsewhere in Georgia Wisteria planted decades ago by farmers in then rural areas has become wild and is common in undeveloped forests Some vines exceed years of age and cover dozens of acres of forest creating a dense purple explosion each spring br Japanese honeysuckle is extremely common its fragrance an early summer delight A common ornamental shrub the Chinese privet has escaped to become the state s most invasive non native plant species br br br Fauna br Among mammals the eastern gray squirrel is by far the most ubiquitous stealing birdseed from the bird feeders which many locals maintain Chipmunks and small brown rabbits are common but it is relatively rare to hear of them doing any damage Opossum raccoons foxes coyotes and armadillos are frequently seen Garden and meadow snakes are common six venomous pit viper snakes Eastern diamondback rattlesnake timber rattlesnake pygmy rattlesnake coral snake water moccasin and copperhead are indigenous but reports of bites are rare Many types of frogs including tree frogs and bullfrogs are easily heard in early summer as are cicadas in July and August Black bears occasionally wander down from the mountains and white tailed deer are abundant overpopulated in some areas Homeowners in the outer suburbs are prone to landscaping damage due to scavenging deer br The most common birds are the brown thrasher the GA state bird American crow European or common starling American robin mourning dove house sparrow northern cardinal house finch Carolina chickadee tufted titmouse bluejay white breasted nuthatch eastern bluebird mockingbird brown headed nuthatch and Carolina wren Birds of prey thrive in the area with three varieties of hawks common near open fields in even the most populated areas Falcons roost on skyscrapers in downtown Atlanta and can be regularly seen feasting on pigeons br The American kestrel is sometimes seen Late in the year three species of owls can be heard nightly in wooded areas Various woodpeckers can be seen in forested lots including the red bellied woodpecker northern flicker also known as the yellow shafted flicker and the downy woodpecker The red headed woodpecker is common in open fields and on golf courses The American goldfinch is present mostly in winter and the ruby throated hummingbird only in summer br br br Demographics br br Numerically Metro Atlanta is the third fastest growing metropolitan area in the U S The census counted people in the county metro area This was an increase of from its population representing growth of This was however a slower rate than the increase recorded between and br br A Atlanta MSA in did not include Butts Dawson Haralson Heard Jasper Lamar Meriwether and Pike counties whose population totalled in in of total new county metro B Compares the larger county Atlanta Sandy Springs Marietta MSA with a smaller county Atlanta MSA however the new counties represent less than of the larger county metro Source for race and Hispanic population U S Census Bureau and census for foreign born population US Census Bureau and American Community Surveys Immigrants in Metropolitan America Brookings Institution br br br Race and ethnicity br White Americans made up of metro Atlanta s population in a relative decrease from ten years earlier but in absolute numbers their population increased by over Non Hispanic whites proportionally dropped from to of the metro s population while increasing by about br Black Americans are the largest racial minority with of the population in Metro Atlanta has the second largest African American population behind the New York metropolitan area From to the geographic distribution of blacks in Metro Atlanta changed radically Long concentrated in the city of Atlanta and DeKalb County the black population there dropped as more than half a million African Americans settled across other parts of the metro area including approximately in Gwinnett County in Fulton outside Atlanta in Cobb in Clayton in Douglas and each in Newton and Rockdale counties br Due to its availability of jobs Atlanta has been a destination for young college educated blacks in the Reverse Great Migration of African Americans from the North since the turn of the st century with many settling quickly into suburban locations The Atlanta metropolitan area has the second highest total African American population of any metropolitan area with only the New York City metro area having more br br Hispanic Americans are the fastest growing ethnic group At of the metro s population in versus only in the metro s Hispanic population increased an astounding or people in ten years Major Hispanic groups include Mexicans Puerto Ricans and Cubans All of those groups populations increased by over in the ten year period Of the metro s person increase in the Hispanic population from to were in Gwinnett County in Cobb in Fulton all but outside the city of Atlanta in Hall and in DeKalb County br The Asian American population also increased rapidly from to There were Asian Americans in the metro area in making up of the population This represented an increase over The largest Asian groups are Indian Americans Korean Americans Chinese Americans and Vietnamese Americans br Atlanta also has Georgia s largest Bosnian American population with approximately in the metro area mainly in Gwinnett County br Metro Atlanta has an increasingly international population with foreign born residents in a increase since with suburban Gwinnett County being one of the most diverse counties in the Southeastern United States This was the fourth largest rate of growth among the nation s top metros after Baltimore Orlando and Las Vegas The foreign born proportion of the population went up from to and Atlanta moved up from th to th in ranking of U S metro areas with the largest immigrant population by sheer numbers Still its proportion of immigrants is only the th highest of the nation s top metros br Metro Atlanta s immigrants are more suburban than those of most cities Out of the top U S metros Atlanta has the th highest ratio of the foreign born living in the suburbs and not in the core city Atlanta has a few ethnic enclaves such as a Koreatown and areas such as the Buford Highway Corridor in DeKalb County and parts of Gwinnett County are commercial centers for multiple ethnic communities br In greater Atlanta had the largest Japanese population in the Southeast United States The Consulate General of Japan in Atlanta estimated that during that year to Japanese lived in greater Atlanta Of the metropolitan areas in the Southeast United States as of greater Atlanta had the most extensive education network for Japanese nationals br br br Language br In approximately of the population five years and older spoke only English at home which is roughly people Over people spoke Spanish at home giving Metro Atlanta the th highest number of Spanish speakers among American metropolitan areas MSAs Over people spoke other Indo European languages at home People who speak an Asian language at home numbered over and made up of the population br br br Economy br br The Atlanta area is home to Fortune headquarters rankings br br The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is the sixth district of the Federal Reserve Banks of the United States and is headquartered in midtown Atlanta The Atlanta Fed covers the U S states of Alabama Florida and Georgia the eastern two thirds of Tennessee the southern portion of Louisiana and southern Mississippi as part of the Federal Reserve System br br br Utilities br The area is the world s largest toll free calling zone spanning square miles km has four active telephone area codes and local calling extending into portions of two others which originally covered all of northern Georgia until now covers mostly the area inside the Perimeter Interstate In the suburbs were put into requiring mandatory ten digit dialing even for local calls under FCC rules This made Atlanta one of the US s first cities to employ ten digit dialing which was begun by BellSouth the year before the Centennial Olympic Games br In was overlaid onto both of the existing and area codes Mobile phones originally only assigned to may now have any local area code regardless of where in the region they were issued Area code the newest area code was overlaid with and in the same fashion as The local calling area also includes portions of and a small area of in Alabama on the Georgia border br The city of Atlanta is the most wired city in the United States Many residents access the internet on a high speed broadband and or WiFi connection It is home to one of the world s largest fiber optic bundles br Major petroleum and natural gas pipelines cross the area running from the Gulf coast Texas and Louisiana to the population centers of the Northeastern U S This includes Colonial Pipeline and Plantation Pipeline both based in Alpharetta br Metro Atlanta primarily uses natural gas for central heating and water heaters with the major exception of heat pumps in apartments built during and since the s This is because winters are mild and large apartment buildings usually require little energy to heat Backup heat also used during defrosting is usually supplied by electric resistance heating though some homes have hybrid heating units which use gas backup when it is cold Exurban homes may also use all electric instead of gas if gas mains have not been extended to an area br Cooktops and ovens are a mix of gas and electric while gas clothes dryers are rather rare Nearly all homes have a fireplace with a manual valve gas starter and some are now equipped with permanent gas logs with electric switch start Some homes also have natural gas barbecue grills formerly sold at utility company stores br Georgia Power is the main electric power company across the state and the metro area beginning in as Georgia Railway and Power Company Atlanta s streetcar trolley company s Several electric membership corporations also serve the suburbs These include the second largest EMC in the nation in Jackson EMC Cobb EMC Walton EMC and Sawnee EMC The city of Marietta operates its own electric utility Marietta Power under the Board of Lights Water BLW It is also a member of the Municipal Electric Association of Georgia MEAG br Atlanta Gas Light is the natural gas utility for the region and has been so for over a century and a half since it installed gas lamps in Atlanta in It operated as a regulated monopoly until November the after the state legislature voted in early to deregulate natural gas marketing and make customers choose among nearly different marketers still selling the same AGL wholesaled gas such as Gas South Infinite Energy SCANA and Georgia Natural Gas Most of the gas comes via pipeline from Louisiana br Water is provided by various county and a few city systems Several of these systems actually serve parts of neighboring counties and cities as well The Cobb Marietta Water Authority serves not only Cobb but also parts of neighboring Paulding and Cherokee counties for example During drought or other emergency cities and counties can enact outdoor water use restrictions however some cross jurisdiction water systems have also acted to put bans in place In late September the state Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources stepped in with its first ever ban covering most of the northern half of the state While surface water is by far the primary source of water for the region the drought had many systems and a few wealthy homeowners drilling new wells for ground water though the local water table is around feet m deep on average br Sewerage is also handled by the water utilities but the various water and sewer networks may not conform to the same boundaries resulting in interbasin water transfers This is for practical reasons because the area is hilly and divided by several watersheds because the area has developed irregularly and erratically and because water treatment plants are usually not near sewage treatment plants Septic tanks are still used in the older homes of some exurbs br br br Housing br Low density residential subdivision development dominates the metro Atlanta suburbs br Changes in house prices for the metro area are publicly tracked on a regular basis using the Case Shiller index the statistic is published by Standard Poor s and is also a component of S P s city composite index of the value of the U S residential real estate market br br br Community improvement districts br All of Georgia s community improvement districts are located in metro Atlanta br br Buckhead Community Improvement

Atlanta City Studio the city s first pop up urban design laboratory focused on shaping the future of city neighborhoods The studio hosts lectures open forums urban art presentations and other neighborhood and design components br Atlanta City Studio will relocate twice per year in order for residents to interact with staff and share their ideas about improving city design The studio is located on the second floor of Ponce City Market and in January will relocate to a retail location on the Westside possibly on MLK Jr Drive or Cascade Road br br br Education br br br Colleges and universities br br br School districts br br br Government and politics br br In geographic terms Georgia has the smallest average county size of any state This focuses government more locally but allows greater conflict between multiple jurisdictions each with its own agenda br The first significant intergovernmental agency in metro Atlanta was the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority which runs the MARTA public transportation system Alongside other factors such as race and class as well as a lack of planning and perceived lack of need problems associated with the inner city of Atlanta crime poverty and poor public school performance influenced Cobb Gwinnett and Clayton county voters to refuse to allow construction of MARTA into their respective counties during the s These decisions resulted in permanent effects on land development in the region making use of private automobiles even more of a necessity br The Atlanta Regional Commission is so far the closest that the area has come to a metropolitan government It approves only those projects deemed to have a positive effect beyond the immediate area in which they are to be constructed The Georgia Regional Transportation Authority is somewhat of a cross between ARC and MARTA working to improve mobility air quality and land use practices in the region GRTA also operates Xpress buses from counties and could operate commuter rail service in the future Currently plans for commuter rail and eventual intercity rail including the long proposed but still unfunded Atlanta Multimodal Passenger Terminal are the responsibility of the Georgia Rail Passenger Authority which receives almost no funding br Since proposals have been floated to allow new multi county sales taxes in addition to existing county sales taxes for roads to pay for regional transportation initiatives br Politics br Due to demographic shifts and population increases in the region Metro Atlanta has trended toward the Democratic Party so much so that Democrats have been able to win statewide due to turnout from this area In Joe Biden won the area by points enough to narrowly capture the state s electoral votes br In and Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock successfully won full terms to represent the state in the U S Senate mainly due to winning by large margins in Metro Atlanta br br br Healthcare br The area is served by a network of healthcare facilities including private practice urgent care hospital systems and specialty care facilities There are approximately hospitals serving the metro There are both private for profit systems and community not for profit systems br br br Hospitals with beds br Trauma Centers Level I Level II br br br Media br br br Culture and attractions br br br Professional sports teams br br Former teams include the Atlanta Flames now Calgary Flames and Atlanta Thrashers now Winnipeg Jets both of the National Hockey League br Atlanta also plays host to one NASCAR Cup Series race each year at Atlanta Motor Speedway br The Atlanta metropolitan area is also home to three NCAA Division I programs with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets and Georgia State Panthers in Atlanta proper and the Kennesaw State Owls in Kennesaw Both Georgia Tech and Georgia State are members of the Football Bowl Subdivision in the Atlantic Coast Conference and Sun Belt Conference respectively while Kennesaw State is a member of the ASUN Conference in the Football Championship Subdivision however Kennesaw State accepted an invitation to move up to the FBS level from Conference USA starting in br br br Military presence br Dobbins Air Reserve Base br Fort Gillem closed br Fort McPherson closed br br br Transportation br The U S Census Bureau has defined a metropolitan area for Atlanta which includes but is not limited to Roswell Georgia and Sandy Springs Georgia According to the American Community Survey about of working metropolitan residents commuted by driving alone carpooled used public transportation and walked Less than of working residents commuted by bicycle while about of commuters travelled by all other means About of residents worked at home br br br Transit systems br br Atlanta has always been a rail town and the city once had an extensive streetcar system which also provided interurban service as far out as Marietta miles km to the northwest The streetcars were replaced by an extensive trolleybus system supplemented by buses in the s and and then converted to all buses in the s and However building a modern rapid transit system proved a difficult and drawn out process and compared to the original plans for a regional system has only partially been accomplished br MARTA operates buses and a subway system in the city of Atlanta Fulton Clayton and Dekalb counties while Cobb and Gwinnett counties operate their own independent Suburban Transit Systems that feed into MARTA This is a result of those counties refusal to join the MARTA system Gwinnett voted in March to reject MARTA again a situation which was originally closely related to white flight from the city It is the only US system in which the state does not provide any funds for operation or expansion instead relying entirely on a sales tax in its three counties Due to the passage of a sales tax in Clayton County on November MARTA replaced the defunct C Tran system bringing buses and commuter rail to the county beginning March with full bus service in The Atlanta Streetcar a mile km light rail loop connects Centennial Olympic Park and MARTA heavy rail subway to the Sweet Auburn district and points in between Xpress GA a suburban commuter bus service operated by the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority or GRTA has over routes running from the suburbs and exurbs to downtown Atlanta in metropolitan counties br Plans are underway for commuter rail and bus rapid transit BRT though these are some years away The billion Northwest Corridor HOV BRT project appears to conflict with other plans such as the metro wide Concept approved by the Transit Planning Board and the no barrier HOT lanes on I in Gwinnett MARTA is also considering a BRT line of its own to the east br The first commuter rail line would run south of the city eventually extended to Lovejoy and possibly Hampton near Atlanta Motor Speedway The Brain Train would likely be the second route connecting the University of Georgia in Athens to Emory University and Georgia Tech in Atlanta br As planned all commuter trains would arrive at the Atlanta Multimodal Passenger Terminal MMPT the long delayed facility just across Peachtree Street from the Five Points MARTA station where all of its lines meet Planning for the system and its extension as intercity rail across the state are the responsibility of the Georgia Rail Passenger Authority br Another proposed plan that has received very strong grassroots support in recent years is the BeltLine a greenbelt and transit system that takes advantage of existing and unused rail tracks to set up a mile km light rail or streetcar circuit around the core of Atlanta as well as establishing more green space and footpaths for pedestrians and bicyclists br br br Commercial railways br Before Atlanta was even a city it was a railroad hub From this came the joke popular among other Southerners that regardless of whether one goes to heaven or hell everyone must go through Atlanta first Many of its suburbs pre date it as depots or train stations along the major lines in and out of town br Many of these historic stations including Atlanta s Union Station and Terminal Station were demolished like many county courthouses and other historic buildings Many have been saved however including the L N station in Woodstock and the stations along the main W A line in Marietta and Smyrna br Through mergers the main railroads in the area are now Norfolk Southern and CSX The Georgia Northeastern Railroad is a short line that also services part of the area There are also several railyards of Atlanta and vicinity as well as the Southeastern Railway Museum and the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History br The National Railroad Passenger Corporation more commonly known as Amtrak runs the intercity rail line Crescent through metro Atlanta twice daily with one train heading towards New Orleans and the other headed towards New York All trains make a scheduled stop at Peachtree Station in northern Midtown Atlanta but it is also possible for arrange for trains to stop in Gainesville Georgia as well br br br Air br Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the world s busiest airport and is the only international airport for the region and only major international airport for the state br br Other airports maintained by local counties include Charlie Brown Field Fulton McCollum Field Cobb Cartersville Airport Bartow DeKalb Peachtree Airport DeKalb Briscoe Field Gwinnett Coweta County Airport Coweta Cherokee County Airport Cherokee Atlanta Speedway Airport Henry and Paulding County Airport Paulding Former local airports were Stone Mountain Airport and Parkaire Field among others br DeKalb Peachtree Airport is the primary business jet airport This is due to its proximity to Downtown Midtown Buckhead and the Perimeter office areas br br br Roads and freeways br br Atlanta is served by three major interstate highways Including tributaries they are the following br Note The cities used below are also the control cities used for the Metro Atlanta Bypass I signs entering from the suburbs br Interstate passes through from Macon to the south and from Chattanooga to the north Interstate is a spur which merges with I near Kennesaw I serves northeast portions of Cobb County and a large portion of Cherokee County It ends in Ball Ground Interstate is a route which connects I in Henry County to I in southern Dekalb County Most of the corridor is within Clayton County br Interstate passes through from Montgomery on the southwest and from Greenville on the northeast I merges with I to form the Downtown Connector from the Brookwood Interchange just north of Midtown Atlanta to just south of the Lakewood Freeway in south Atlanta Interstate is a spur which merges with I in LaGrange and stretches southward to Columbus Interstate is a spur which merges with I in Suwanee and serves the northern suburbs of Gwinnett and Hall Counties It terminates just northeast of Gainesville br Interstate is the beltway which encircles the city and its immediate eastern suburbs It is commonly known as the Perimeter I passes through Clayton Cobb Fulton and DeKalb Counties br Interstate passes through from Birmingham to the west and from Augusta to the east It serves Douglasville the major suburb west of Atlanta It serves Lithonia and Conyers to the east br Atlanta is also served by several other freeways in addition to the interstate highways including br Georgia is the main corridor serving the north central suburbs and was the only toll road in the metropolitan Atlanta area As of November the tolls ended and the toll plazas were demolished It reaches into the northern portion of Fulton County and gradually turns northeast before entering Forsyth County The controlled access portion terminates just northeast of the city of Cumming To the south it terminates and merges into southbound I just south of the Buckhead business district Cumming Dahlonega is used on I as the northbound sign and Atlanta Buckhead as the southbound From I northbound it uses Buckhead Cumming br Stone Mountain Freeway or U S is an mile corridor east of Downtown Atlanta and the neighboring suburb of Decatur It serves northeast portions of Dekalb County including the city of Stone Mountain It continues east as a divided highway into south Gwinnett County including the suburb of Snellville U S also stretches east to Athens br Lakewood Freeway or Georgia extends between Lakewood Park in south Atlanta and Campbellton Road just west of I br Peachtree Industrial Blvd or Georgia is a route north northeast of Atlanta which begins on the north side of I and runs parallel to I for about four miles until it terminates when it splits into GA and Peachtree Industrial continuing as a normal divided highway br Georgia State Route is a four mile long route that branches from I and stretches eastward into Gwinnett County It continues east as a normal divided highway through the suburb of Lawrenceville and on to Athens br There are many historic roads across the area named after its mills and early ferries and the bridges later built to replace the ferries Pace s Ferry is perhaps the best known br Owing to the area s long history of settlement and uneven terrain most arterial roads are not straight but meander instead which can be confusing as much as the famed proliferation of Atlanta streets with Peachtree in the name It is also often joked that half the streets are named Peachtree while the other half have several names to make up for it br Partly confusion is because the region maintains the historic nomenclature of each county naming its roads for the towns they connect with in surrounding counties Thus from Dallas to Roswell Georgia is Marietta Highway to the Paulding Cobb county line is Dallas Highway to the city of Marietta Whitlock Avenue to the town square South Park Square for just one city block Roswell Street to Cobb Parkway at the Big Chicken Roswell Road to the Cobb Fulton county line and finally Marietta Street to the town square in Roswell Further confusion is from the arbitrary location of state routes by the Georgia Department of Transportation GDOT so that they travel an erratic path requiring several turns by drivers instead of traveling the original straight route and the renaming of roads by state legislators to honor their friends br There are many roads like this throughout the area leading to duplication of names in different counties In Fulton Roswell Road refers to Georgia through northern Atlanta and across Sandy Springs in addition to the above mentioned use in Cobb for example Numeric street addressing is done by county as well with the origin usually being at one corner of the town square in the county seat The U S Postal Service ignores these actual and logical boundaries however overlapping ZIP codes and their associated place names across counties The Cumberland Galleria area has Cobb s numbers and an SE suffix but is called Atlanta by the USPS despite being Vinings which the USPS ironically calls unacceptable which can confuse visitors to think it is far away in southeast Atlanta br Where more than one town in the same county has a road to the same place the smaller towns have their own name prefixed to it while the county seat does not The road need not go directly to the other place but may connect through other roads Examples include Due West Road west from Marietta Kennesaw Due West Road southwest from Kennesaw and Acworth Due West Road south from Acworth Some are usually hyphenated like Peachtree Dunwoody Road Ashford Dunwoody Road Chamblee Dunwoody Road and Chamblee Tucker Road br There are also several roads named for communities which have been overwhelmed by the urban and suburban sprawl and so are somewhat odd to newcomers These include Sandy Plains Crabapple Toonigh Luxomni and Due West Some of these communities are in the middle of the road while some are at or very near one end Some areas are renamed either over time Sandy Plains gradually became Sprayberry when Sprayberry High School moved there and similarly named shopping centers popped up around it by the USPS Toonigh is identified as Lebanon or after rapid development In such cases the roads usually maintain their historic names even if the neighborhoods do not br There are also a few U S highways that cross the area including and br Other arterials are completely new like much of Barrett Parkway Sugarloaf Parkway and South Fulton Parkway constructed by their counties but partly covered with a state route number Occasionally roads are realigned or extended to meet each other directly at a cross road leading to odd curves and name changes br br br See also br North Georgia br br br br br br External links br Media related to Atlanta metropolitan area at
