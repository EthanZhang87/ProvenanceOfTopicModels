br Archaeologists associated with Atlanta s Fernbank Museum of Natural History have excavated a acre km plot near McRae Helena and approximately a mile from the Ocmulgee River beginning in In they announced finding evidence of a Spanish settlement dating to the first half of the th century The archaeologists originally believed that the artifacts may have come from a settlement founded by Spanish leader Lucas V zquez de Ayll n from Hispaniola in and briefly occupied by hundreds of colonists The group encountered hard conditions and fewer than survived to return to Hispaniola br Additional research suggests that the site instead was one visited in by the de Soto Expedition Researchers have recovered Murano glass beads made in Venice Italy and brought by the Spanish for trading with Native Americans pottery fragments and iron weapons Some of the beads bear a chevron pattern Such beads have been identified as a hallmark of the de Soto expedition due to the limited period of time in which they were produced Excavations have also produced six metal objects including three iron tools and a silver pendant br The site is further west than scholars had earlier believed that the de Soto expedition had traveled based on documentation from his expedition This was the first evidence found of his expedition between Tallahassee Florida where excavations have revealed artifacts of his expedition and western North Carolina where another site has been found br br What we have now is the best documented collection of Spanish artifacts in Georgia many are unique and they are the only examples of certain artifacts ever found outside Florida br This site is believed to have been a Native American community occupied from the end of the th century through the first decades of the th century At that time they had neither glass nor metal goods Blanton presented a paper on his findings on November at the Southeastern Archaeological Conference in Mobile
