the area many times before the post office was built He was said to be well known and respected in his namesake community Others contend that the city was named after Thomas Stocks who was State Surveyor and president of the Georgia State Senate in the s br In the East Tennessee Virginia and Georgia Railroad was to pass through Stockbridge between Macon and Atlanta The settlers who owned the land about Old Stockbridge asked such a high price for their land that two prominent Atlanta citizens John W Grant and George W Adair bought a tract about a mile south of Old Stockbridge and offered lots at a reasonable price Here the railroad built their depot and many lots were sold The depot was located about feet m north of what is now North Henry Blvd but was destroyed by the Southern

named after his great great grandfather Levi Stockbridge who had traveled back and forth from the North to his property in Florida and stopped here on his journey br Levi Stockbridge was born on March and fits the time frame just prior to the Civil War Levi would have been years of age when Stockbridge was assigned a post office in br Until May there had never been a name other than Professor Stockbridge At that time Levi Stockbridge was mentioned as the person for whom the city may have been named br It is not certain that Levi Stockbridge was the individual for whom the citizens of the

a new image for the city Stockbridge became the focus of national news and was also one of the largest issues in the Georgia General Assembly and their efforts to prevent abuse of eminent domain br Many of the citizens of Stockbridge and Henry County were surprised by the apparent abuse of eminent domain by the city Early in a protest was organized by the NAACP and supported by the Republican and Libertarian parties from the county Syndicated Atlanta talk show host Neal Boortz said during his show Private property rights are dead in Stockbridge Georgia and called members of the Stockbridge City Council sorry bastards br br The Henry County Board of Commissioners took a stance on the issue by unanimously approving a non binding resolution that the county would not take land for economic development purposes However the county legally has no say in what the City of Stockbridge can do with its land and its use of eminent domain Many have said this was just a political strategy as Henry County has been shown in recent voting history to be one of the most conservative counties in the Atlanta metro area consistently voting Republican in early st century presidential elections However as the population grew the county voted Democratic in the and elections br The conflict between the city and the property owners came to an end on February as the Georgia Court of Appeals threw out
