Creek tribe inhabited the southern two thirds of what is now defined as Georgia west of the Low Country they are believed to be the descendants of the Mississippian culture br They maintained their

bypassed by developing railroads which went to the north and south It did not have railroad access until br Inappropriate farming practices and over cultivation of cotton from before the Civil War led to extensive land erosion by the early th century Together with mechanization of agriculture and damage due to infestation by the boll weevil there were losses in this part of the economy Population declined Up to the mid century many blacks left the area in two waves of the Great Migration seeking escape from Jim Crow conditions and jobs and better lives in northern and midwestern industrial
