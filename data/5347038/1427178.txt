to the branches operating today By the library system had eight branches throughout the city and by the system had branches br br br City county relationship br In the first decades of the library system service was maintained for Atlanta residents only and as a result Fulton County was left without library service Using Works Progress Administration and city funds the City of Atlanta and the Fulton County Board of Commissioners signed a contract in to provide library coverage throughout the county In however Georgia passed a constitutional amendment that allowed the city to transfer control of the system to the county and in the system was turned over the county control To reflect the change in control the system was renamed the Atlanta Fulton Public Library System br br br Black

money until when Tommie Dora Barker the Director of the Carnegie Library School opened the Auburn Avenue Branch Library the first branch library for blacks in the Sweet Auburn neighborhood During segregation two other libraries were opened for the use of blacks After opening its first branches for African Americans in the s the APL began to employ black female librarians like Annie L
