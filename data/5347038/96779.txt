Until the county was divided into three county commission districts Three of the members of the board of commissioners were required to live inside one of the designated districts The remaining two commissioners could live anywhere in the county All members of the county commission were elected at large which meant that each candidate had to attract the majority of votes across the county in order to win Since more than cases of such at large voting systems in Georgia have been replaced by single member districts br The five members of the school board were also elected at large In the early st century Fayette County was one of only school boards among in the state of Georgia to maintain at large voting to elect members of these boards The practical effect was the exclusion of African Americans from these positions The county has been majority white and majority Republican since the late th century Neither Republican nor Democratic African American candidates had any electoral success br In the NAACP and several African American county residents filed suit against the county and the board for the at large voting system In May the federal district court ordered the county and school board to change their systems of at large voting finding that it violated the Voting Rights Act of by diluting the voting power of the minority African Americans make up of the county population but were unable to elect candidates of their choice as every commission and school board seat required a majority of county voters The county has a majority white majority Republican

Batten Sr had made a technical error in granting summary judgment in the case It did not overturn his ruling to establish the single member district system The bench trial by Judge Batten would give the county an opportunity to present additional evidence to support its case br After Coston died in office the Fayette Board of Elections voted to use at large voting in a special election to replace her The NAACP returned to court as it opposed using the former system Judge Batten ruled that the county had to use the single member district system established by his earlier ruling In September Democrat Charles Rousseau was elected from District to succeed Coston becoming the second African American elected to the county commission In October the Fayette Chamber of Commerce and two prominent white leaders urged the county to settle the nearly five year lawsuit and accept district voting Judge Batten ordered the two sides into mediation and postponed the bench trial In January the Fayette County School Board voted unanimously to settle the lawsuit and accept district voting for election of its members The County Commission voted to settle by a vote br Together with the NAACP and black
