prohibition on sex discrimination The Court of Appeals found the Georgia General Assembly had discriminated against Vandy Beth Glenn a transgender woman who was fired from her job as legislative

of the vote from residents and a vote by the Macon Bibb Commission In an official statement from the Mayor s office Reichert stated that after prayerful consideration he would be vetoing the legislation Opponents of the bill focused on how they felt the issue of enacting legislation to protect LGBTQ people went against their rights to their religious beliefs In fact this ordinance takes away the business owners freedom to practice religion and instead coerces many Christian and Jewish faith based people in our county to accept the LGBTQ lifestyle as one of their moral beliefs said
