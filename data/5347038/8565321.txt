House of Representatives The Senate has members and the House has members Lawmakers serve year terms and work part time Each member of the legislature represents geographically distinct districts from which each voter may give support to one candidate for each body For most of its history the state used an unusual county unit system by which districts were drawn such that each had the same area However population growth in cities across the state led to the rural population which was in relative decline having disproportionate power in government After the U S Supreme Court declared such unequal representation to be unconstitutional in Gray v Sanders in state officials began to redefine legislative districts so that each had a similarly sized population Both senators and representatives have terms of two years There are no limits on the number of terms any person may serve Its legislative acts generically called chapter laws or slip laws when printed separately are published in the official Georgia Laws and are called session laws These in turn have been codified in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated O C G A br br br From bill to law br The General Assembly transforms bills into laws A bill is created after citizens contact their representatives about an issue they care about The legislator drafts a bill that addresses the concerns of citizens The lawmaker sponsors the bill and files it with either the Clerk of the House or Secretary of Senate to be registered introduced and assigned to a committee for review While in committee public testimonies and commentary are presented to the committee After studying the bill the committee will recommend one of the following to pass not pass pass with changes or hold bill during its second reading The bill will proceed to its third reading if viewed favorably by the committee Bills will be called to the floor for the first ten days of a session After the tenth day the Rules Committee starts prioritizing bills to be called The Rules Committee prepares which bills will be called to the floor on the next day Once on the floor the General Assembly may vote and or make amendments The bill requires a majority vote to pass through the chamber it originated from by Crossover Day which is the th day in session Bills that do not advance to the other chamber by this day will not be considered for the remainder of the session Both the House and Senate follow these rules before sending it to the other house for review The bills continues to be amendment until both sides can agree on the same version of the bill Once this is reached the bill is sent to the governor to be enacted or vetoed which in the latter case will require a majority vote from both houses to overcome the veto The bill is usually sent to the governor after sine die the last day of the legislative session The governor has days to approve or veto the bill after sine die before it is automatically enacted
