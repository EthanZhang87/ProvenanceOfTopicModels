A geographic coordinate system GCS is a spherical or geodetic coordinate system for measuring and communicating positions directly on Earth as latitude and longitude It is the simplest oldest and most widely used of the various spatial reference systems that are in use and forms the basis for most others Although latitude and longitude form a coordinate tuple like a cartesian coordinate system the geographic coordinate system is not cartesian because the measurements are angles and are not on a planar surface br A full GCS specification such as those listed in the EPSG and ISO standards also includes a choice of geodetic datum including an Earth ellipsoid as different datums will yield different latitude and longitude values for the same location br br br History br br The invention of a geographic coordinate system is generally credited to Eratosthenes of Cyrene who composed his now lost Geography at the Library of Alexandria in the rd century BC A century later Hipparchus of Nicaea improved on this system by determining latitude from stellar measurements rather than solar altitude and determining longitude by timings of lunar eclipses rather than dead reckoning In the st or nd century Marinus of Tyre compiled an extensive gazetteer and mathematically plotted world map using coordinates measured east from a prime meridian at the westernmost known land designated the Fortunate Isles off the coast of western Africa around the Canary or Cape Verde Islands and measured north or south of the island of Rhodes off Asia Minor Ptolemy credited him with the full adoption of longitude and latitude rather than measuring latitude in terms of the length of the midsummer day br Ptolemy s nd century Geography used the same prime meridian but measured latitude from the Equator instead After their work was translated into Arabic in the th century Al Khw rizm s Book of the Description of the Earth corrected Marinus and Ptolemy s errors regarding the length of the Mediterranean Sea causing medieval Arabic cartography to use a prime meridian around east of Ptolemy s line Mathematical cartography resumed in Europe following Maximus Planudes recovery of Ptolemy s text a little before the text was translated into Latin at Florence by Jacopo d Angelo around br In the United States hosted the International Meridian Conference attended by representatives from twenty five nations Twenty two of them agreed to adopt the longitude of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich England as the zero reference line The Dominican Republic voted against the motion while France and Brazil abstained France adopted Greenwich Mean Time in place of local determinations by the Paris Observatory in br br br Latitude and longitude br br The latitude abbreviation Lat or phi of a point on Earth s surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and the straight line that passes through that point and through or close to the center of the Earth Lines joining points of the same latitude trace circles on the surface of Earth called parallels as they are parallel to the Equator and to each other The North Pole is N the South Pole is S The parallel of latitude is designated the Equator the fundamental plane of all geographic coordinate systems The Equator divides the globe into Northern and Southern Hemispheres br The longitude abbreviation Long or lambda of a point on Earth s surface is the angle east or west of a reference meridian to another meridian that passes through that point All meridians are halves of great ellipses often called great circles which converge at the North and South Poles The meridian of the British Royal Observatory in Greenwich in southeast London England is the international prime meridian although some organizations such as the French Institut national de l information g ographique et foresti re continue to use other meridians for internal purposes The prime meridian determines the proper Eastern and Western Hemispheres although maps often divide these hemispheres further west in order to keep the Old World on a single side The antipodal meridian of Greenwich is both W and E This is not to be conflated with the International Date Line which diverges from it in several places for political and convenience reasons including between far eastern Russia and the far western Aleutian Islands br The combination of these two components specifies the position of any location on the surface of Earth without consideration of altitude or depth The visual grid on a map formed by lines of latitude and longitude is known as a graticule The origin zero point of this system is located in the Gulf of Guinea about km mi south of Tema Ghana a location often facetiously called Null Island br br br Geodetic datum br br In order to use the theoretical definitions of latitude longitude and height to precisely measure actual locations on the physical earth a geodetic datum must be used A horizonal datum is used to precisely measure latitude and longitude while a vertical datum is used to measure elevation or altitude Both types of datum bind a mathematical model of the shape of the earth usually a reference ellipsoid for a horizontal datum and a more precise geoid for a vertical datum to the earth Traditionally this binding was created by a network of control points surveyed locations at which monuments are installed and were only accurate for a region of the surface of the Earth Some newer datums are bound to the center of mass of the Earth br This combination of mathematical model and physical binding mean that anyone using the same datum will obtain the same location measurement for the same physical location However two different datums will usually yield different location measurements for the same physical location which may appear to differ by as much as several hundred meters this not because the location has moved but because the reference system used to measure it has shifted Because any spatial reference system or map projection is ultimately calculated from latitude and longitude it is crucial that they clearly state the datum on which they are based For example a UTM coordinate based on WGS will be different than a UTM coordinate based on NAD for the same location Converting coordinates from one datum to another requires a datum transformation such as a Helmert transformation although in certain situations a simple translation may be sufficient br Datums may be global meaning that they represent the whole Earth or they may be local meaning that they represent an ellipsoid best fit to only a portion of the Earth Examples of global datums include World Geodetic System WGS also known as EPSG the default datum used for the Global Positioning System and the International Terrestrial Reference System and Frame ITRF used for estimating continental drift and crustal deformation The distance to Earth s center can be used both for very deep positions and for positions in space br Local datums chosen by a national cartographical organization include the North American Datum the European ED and the British OSGB Given a location the datum provides the latitude br br br br br br br displaystyle phi br br and longitude br br br br br br br displaystyle lambda br br In the United Kingdom there are three common latitude longitude and height systems in use WGS differs at Greenwich from the one used on published maps OSGB by approximately m The military system ED used by NATO differs from about m to m br Points on the Earth s surface move relative to each other due to continental plate motion subsidence and diurnal Earth tidal movement caused by the Moon and the Sun This daily movement can be as much as a meter Continental movement can be up to cm a year or m in a century A weather system high pressure area can cause a sinking of mm Scandinavia is rising by cm a year as a result of the melting of the ice sheets of the last ice age but neighboring Scotland is rising by only cm These changes are insignificant if a local datum is used but are statistically significant if a global datum is used br br br Length of a degree br br On the GRS or WGS spheroid at sea level at the Equator one latitudinal second measures m one latitudinal minute is m and one latitudinal degree is km The circles of longitude meridians meet at the geographical poles with the west east width of a second naturally decreasing as latitude increases On the Equator at sea level one longitudinal second measures m a longitudinal minute is m and a longitudinal degree is km At a longitudinal second is m at Greenwich N m and at it is m br On the WGS spheroid the length in meters of a degree of latitude at latitude that is the number of meters you would have to travel along a north south line to move degree in latitude when at latitude is about br br The returned measure of meters per degree latitude varies continuously with latitude br Similarly the length in meters of a degree of longitude can be calculated as br br Those coefficients can be improved but as they stand the distance they give is correct within a centimeter br The formulae both return units of meters per degree br An alternative method to estimate the length of a longitudinal degree at latitude br br br br br br br displaystyle phi br br is to
