The Georgia Institute of Technology commonly referred to as Georgia Tech and GT or in the state of Georgia as Tech or the Institute is a public research university and institute of technology in Atlanta Georgia Established in it is part of the University System of Georgia and has satellite campuses in Savannah Georgia Metz France Shenzhen China and Singapore br The school was founded as the Georgia School of Technology as part of Reconstruction plans to build an industrial economy in the post Civil War Southern United States Initially it offered only a degree in mechanical engineering By its curriculum had expanded to include electrical civil and chemical engineering In the school changed its name to reflect its evolution from a trade school to a technical institute and research university Georgia Tech is organized into colleges with approximately departments and academic units It has a special emphasis on the academic fields of science and technology br Georgia Tech fields eight men s and seven women s teams that compete in NCAA Division I athletics which have won five national championships throughout their history The university is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference br br br History br br br Establishment br br The idea of a technology school in Georgia was introduced in during the Reconstruction period Two former Confederate officers Major John Fletcher Hanson an industrialist and Nathaniel Edwin Harris a politician and eventually Governor of Georgia who had become prominent citizens in the town of Macon Georgia after the Civil War strongly believed that the South needed to improve its technology to compete with the industrial revolution which was occurring throughout the North However because the American South of that era was mainly populated by agricultural workers and few technical developments were occurring a technology school was needed br In the Georgia State Legislature authorized a committee led by Harris to visit the Northeast to see firsthand how technology schools worked They were impressed by the polytechnic educational models developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science now Worcester Polytechnic Institute The committee recommended adapting the Worcester model which stressed a combination of theory and practice the practice component including student employment and production of consumer items to generate revenue for the school br On October Georgia Governor Henry D McDaniel signed the bill to create and fund the new school In Atlanta pioneer Richard Peters donated to the state acres ha of the site of a failed garden suburb called Peters Park The site was bounded on the south by North Avenue and on the west by Cherry Street He then sold five adjoining acres of land to the state for US equivalent to in This land was near Atlanta s northern city limits at the time of its founding although the city has expanded several miles beyond it A historical marker on the large hill in Central Campus notes the site occupied by the school s first buildings once held fortifications to protect Atlanta during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War The surrender of the city took place on the southwestern boundary of the modern Georgia Tech campus in br br br Early years br br The Georgia School of Technology opened in the fall of with two buildings One building now Tech Tower an administrative headquarters had classrooms to teach students The second building featured a shop and had a foundry forge boiler room and engine room It was designed for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands though at the time there was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used to turn a profit br On October U S President Theodore Roosevelt visited Georgia Tech On the steps of Tech Tower Roosevelt delivered a speech about the importance of technological education He then shook hands with every student br Georgia Tech s Evening School of Commerce began holding classes in The evening school admitted its first female student in although the state legislature did not officially authorize attendance by women until Annie T Wise became the first female graduate in and was Georgia Tech s first female faculty member the following year In the Board of Regents transferred control of the Evening School of Commerce to the University of Georgia UGA and moved the civil and electrical engineering courses at UGA to Tech Tech replaced the commerce school with what later became the College of Business The commerce school would later split from UGA and eventually become Georgia State University In the Engineering Experiment Station later known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute was founded by W Harry Vaughan with an initial budget of equivalent to in and part time faculty In the mid to late s President Blake Van Leer had a focus on making Georgia Tech the MIT of the South Van Leer lobbied government and business for funds for new facilities The Research Building was expanded and a equivalent to in Westinghouse A C network calculator was given to Georgia Tech by Georgia Power in A new library was completed new Textile and Architecture buildings completed and at the time the most modern gymnasium in the world was built br br br Modern history br Founded as the Georgia School of Technology Georgia Tech assumed its present name in to reflect a growing focus on advanced technological and scientific research br br Under President Blake Ragsdale Van Leer s tenure Tech went through a significant change expanded its campus with new facilities added new engineering courses and became the largest engineering institute in the South and the third largest in the US Van Leer also admitted the first female students to regular classes in and began steps toward integration He stood up to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin s demand to bar Bobby Grier from participating in the Sugar Bowl game between Georgia Tech and Grier s University of Pittsburgh After Van Leer s death his wife Ella Lillian Wall Van Leer bought a house on campus and opened it to female students to support their success She also set up the first sorority on campus along with a Society of Women Engineers chapter In women could enroll in all programs at Tech Industrial Management was the last program to open to women The first women s dorm Fulmer Hall opened in Rena Faye Smith appointed as a research assistant in the School of Physics in by Dr Ray Young in X Ray Diffraction became the first female faculty member research in the School of Physics She went on to earn a Ph D at Georgia State University and taught physics and instructional technology at Black Hills State University as Rena Faye Norby She served as a Fulbright Scholar in Russia Women constituted of the undergraduates and of the graduate students enrolled in Spring br In a meeting of students voted by an overwhelming majority to endorse integration of qualified applicants regardless of race Three years after the meeting and one year after the University of Georgia s violent integration Georgia Tech became the first university in the Deep South to desegregate without a court order In the academic year students out of were black In William Peace became the first black instructor and Marle Carter became the first black member of the homecoming court In Dr Calvin Huey became the first black player to play at Grant Field when he took the field for Navy The first black person to play for Georgia Tech was Eddie McAshan in br Similarly there was little student reaction at Georgia Tech to the Vietnam War and United States involvement in the Cambodian Civil War The student council defeated a resolution supporting the Vietnam Moratorium and the extent of the Tech community s response to the Kent State shooting was limited to a student organized memorial service though the institute was ordered closed for two days along with all other University System of Georgia schools br In President John Patrick Crecine pushed through a restructuring of the university The institute at that point had three colleges the College of Engineering the College of Management and the catch all COSALS the College of Sciences and Liberal Arts Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing the College of Sciences and the Ivan Allen College of Management Policy and International Affairs Crecine never asked for input regarding the changes and consequently many faculty members disliked his top down management style despite this the changes passed by a slim margin Crecine was also instrumental in securing the Summer Olympics for Atlanta A large amount of construction occurred creating most of what is now considered West Campus for Tech to serve as the Olympic Village and significantly gentrifying Midtown Atlanta The Undergraduate Living Center Fourth Street Apartments Sixth Street Apartments Eighth Street Apartments Hemphill Apartments and Center Street Apartments housed athletes and journalists The Georgia Tech Aquatic Center was built for swimming events and the Alexander Memorial Coliseum was renovated The institute also erected the Kessler Campanile and fountain to serve as a landmark and symbol of the university on television broadcasts br br In G Wayne Clough became the first Georgia Tech alumnus to serve as the president of institution he was in office during the Summer Olympics In he separated the Ivan Allen College of Management Policy and International Affairs into the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts and returned the College of Management to College status Crecine the previous president had demoted Management from College to School status as part of a controversial reorganization plan His tenure focused on a dramatic expansion of the institute a revamped Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program and the creation of an International Plan On March he was appointed secretary of the Smithsonian Institution effective July Dr Gary Schuster Tech s provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs was named interim president effective July br On April G P Bud Peterson previously the chancellor of the University of Colorado at Boulder became the th president of Georgia Tech On April Georgia Tech was invited to join the Association of American Universities the first new member institution in nine years In Georgia Tech launched the first massive online open degree in computer science by partnering with Udacity and AT T a complete degree through that program costs students It eventually expanded this program with its online masters in analytics in January as well as providing the option for advanced credits with a MicroMasters in collaboration with edX br On January President G P Bud Peterson announced his intention to retire Angel Cabrera former President of George Mason University and Georgia Tech alum was named his successor on June Cabrera took office on September br br br
