The United States Amateur Championship commonly known as the U S Amateur is the leading annual golf tournament in the United States for amateur golfers It is organized by the United States Golf Association and is currently held each August over a day period br br br History br In there were two tournaments called the National Amateur Championship One of them was played at Newport Country Club and was won by William G Lawrence and the other took place at Saint Andrew s Golf Club and was won by Laurence B Stottard This state of affairs prompted Charles B Macdonald of the Chicago Golf Club to call for the creation of a national governing body to authorize an official national championship and the Amateur Golf Association of the United States which was soon to be renamed the United States Golf Association was formed on December of that year In it organized both the first U S Amateur Championship and the first U S Open both of which were played at Newport Country Club br There are no age or gender restrictions on entry but players must have a handicap index of or less Originally entry was restricted to members of USGA affiliated private clubs and presumably international players who were members of private clubs affiliated with their nations golf governing bodies a restriction that was not lifted until The tournament consists of two days of stroke play with the leading competitors then playing a knockout competition held at match play to decide the champion All knockout matches are over holes except for the final which consists of holes separated into morning and afternoon hole rounds Nowadays it is usually won by players in their late teens or early twenties who are working towards a career as a tournament professional Before World War II more top level golfers chose to remain amateur and the average age of U S Amateur champions was higher br Many of the leading figures in the history of golf have been U S Amateur Champion including Bobby Jones five times Jerome Travers four times Jack Nicklaus twice and Tiger Woods three times all consecutive the only player to win three in a row Woods first win as an year old in made him the youngest winner of the event breaking the previous record of years months set by Robert Gardner in In New Zealander Danny Lee became the youngest ever winner only to be eclipsed by year old An Byeong hun the following year Before the professional game became dominant the event was regarded as one of the majors This is no longer the case but the champion still receives an automatic invitation to play in all of the majors except the PGA Championship In addition the runner up also receives an invitation to play in the Masters and the U S Open The golfers must maintain their amateur status at the time the events are held unless they qualify for the tournaments by other means The USGA added an exception starting with the U S Amateur Championship in that the tournament winner only may turn professional and keep his berth for the ensuing U S Open br With the growth in professional golf through the latter half of the th century the U S Amateur has become dominated by younger players destined to soon become professionals In the USGA established a new championship called the U S Mid Amateur for amateurs aged at least years old in order to give players who had not joined the professional ranks and those who had regained their amateur status a chance to play against each other for a national title br br br Field br While most players at the U S Amateur advance through
