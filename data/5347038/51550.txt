A ZIP Code an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan is a system of postal codes used by the United States Postal Service USPS The term ZIP was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly zipping along when senders use the code in the postal address br Introduced on July the basic format comprised five digits In an extended code was introduced named ZIP it included the five digits of the ZIP Code followed by a hyphen and four digits that designated a more specific location br ZIP Code and ZIP are registered trademarks of the United States Postal Service which also registered ZIP Code as a service mark until br br br History br br The early history and context of postal codes began with postal district zone numbers The United States Post Office Department USPOD implemented postal zones for large cities in May Postmaster General Frank Walker explained that many experienced postal clerks were going into the army and the zone system would enable inexperienced clerks to sort mail without having to learn the delivery area of each city carrier br For example br br The is the number of the postal zone in a specific city br By the early s a more organized system was needed and non mandatory five digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July The USPOD issued its Publication Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October with the list of two letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized An earlier list publicized in June had proposed capitalized abbreviations ranging from two to five letters According to Publication the two letter standard was based on a maximum position line because this has been found to be the most universally acceptable line capacity basis for major addressing systems which would be exceeded by a long city name combined with a multi letter state abbreviation such as Sacramento Calif along with the ZIP Code The abbreviations have remained unchanged with the exception of Nebraska which was changed from NB to NE in at the request of the Canadian Post Office Department to avoid confusion with New Brunswick br Robert Moon is considered the father of the ZIP Code he submitted his proposal in while working as a postal inspector br The phrase zone improvement plan is credited to D Jamison Cain a Postal Service executive The post office credits Moon with only the first three digits of the ZIP Code which describe the sectional center facility SCF or sec center An SCF is a central mail processing facility with those three digits The fourth and fifth digits which give a more precise locale within the SCF were proposed by Henry Bentley Hahn Sr br The SCF sorts mail to all post offices with those first three digits in their ZIP Codes The mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the ZIP Code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning Sectional centers do not deliver mail and are not open to the public although the building may include a post office that is open to the public and most of their employees work the night shift Items of mail picked up at post offices are sent to their own SCFs in the afternoon where the mail is sorted overnight In the case of large cities the last two digits as assigned generally coincided with the older postal zone number br For example br br In these became mandatory for second and third class bulk mailers and the system was soon adopted generally The United States Post Office used a cartoon character which it called Mr ZIP to promote the use of the ZIP Code The name Mr ZIP was coined by D Jamison Cain Mr ZIP was often depicted with a legend such as USE ZIP CODE in the selvage of panes of postage stamps or on the covers of booklet panes of stamps Mr ZIP was featured prominently alongside musical group The Swingin Six in a variety show that the post office used to explain the importance of using ZIP Codes br br br ZIP br In the U S Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it named ZIP often known as plus four codes add on codes or add ons A ZIP Code uses the basic five digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five digit delivery area such as a city block a group of apartments an individual high volume receiver of mail a post office box or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery However the new format was not adopted universally by the public it eventually became obsolete with modern technology In general mail is read by a multiline optical character reader MLOCR that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP Code from the address along with the even more specific delivery point and sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode IMb on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to digits nine for the ZIP Code and two for the delivery point br For post office boxes the general but not invariable rule is that each box has its own ZIP Code The add on code is often one of the following the last four digits of the box number e g PO Box Albany NY zero plus the last three digits of the box number e g PO Box Eagle River AK or if the box number consists of fewer than four digits enough zeros are attached to the front of the box number to produce a four digit number e g PO Box Juneau AK However there is no uniform rule so the ZIP Code must be looked up individually for each box e g using the USPS s official ZIP Code Lookup tool and being sure to enter just city and state not the digit ZIP br br br Postal bar code br br The ZIP Code is often translated into an Intelligent Mail barcode that is printed on the mailpiece to make it easier for automated machines to sort A barcode can be printed by the sender some word processing programs such as WordPerfect include the feature but this is not recommended as the address to ZIP lookup tables can be significantly out of date br Customers who send bulk mail can get a discount on postage if they have printed the barcode themselves and have presorted the mail This requires more than just a simple font mailing lists must be standardized with up to date Coding Accuracy Support System CASS certified software that adds and verifies a full correct ZIP Code and an additional two digits representing the exact delivery point Furthermore mail must be sorted in a specific manner to an digit code with at least mailpieces for each qualifying ZIP Code and must be accompanied by documentation confirming this These steps are usually done with PAVE certified software that also prints the barcoded address labels and the barcoded sack or tray tags br The assignment of delivery point digits the th and th digits is intended to ensure that every single mailable point in the country has its own digit number The delivery point digits are calculated based on the primary or secondary number of the address The USPS publishes the rules for calculating the delivery point in a document called the CASS Technical Guide br br br Structure and allocation br br br Scope and international mail br ZIP Codes designate delivery points within the United States and its territories There are generally no ZIP Codes for deliveries to other countries except for the independent countries of the Federated States of Micronesia the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau each of which is integrated into the U S postal system under a Compact of Free Association Another exception is ZIP Codes used for overseas stations of U S armed forces br Mail to U S diplomatic missions overseas is addressed as if it were addressed to a street address in Washington D C The four digit diplomatic pouch number is used as a building number while the city in which the embassy or consulate is located is combined with the word Place to form a fictional street name Each mission uses a ZIP Code consisting of and the diplomatic pouch number br For example the U S Embassy in India has this address in India s postal system br br as well as this U S address br br Individuals posted at diplomatic missions overseas are now assigned a Diplomatic Post Office address and unique box number The ZIP Code identifies the diplomatic mission destination and is different from the diplomatic pouch number in the example above While delivered through the pouch system mail to such addresses are not considered Diplomatic Pouch materials and as such must adhere to the mailing regulations of the host country An example address is br br br By type and use br There are four types of ZIP Codes br br Unique assigned to a single high volume address br Post office box only used only for PO boxes at a given facility not for any other type of delivery br Military used to route mail for the U S military br Standard all other ZIP Codes br Unique ZIP Codes are used for governmental agencies universities businesses or buildings receiving sufficiently high volumes of mail to justify the assignment to them of exclusive ZIP Codes Government examples include for the Central Intelligence Agency in Washington D C and for the Federal Citizen Information Center of the U S General Services Administration GSA in Pueblo Colorado An example of a university specific ZIP Code is which serves Towson University An example of a private address unique ZIP Code is that assigned to the headquarters of Walmart They may also be assigned to a single program such as the Postal Service s Operation Santa Claus program under which children are invited to write to Santa Claus at North Pole br An example of a PO box only ZIP Code is used for boxes at the main post office in Alexandria Virginia including those used by the United States Patent and Trademark Office In the area surrounding that post office home and business mail delivery addresses use ZIP Code a standard ZIP Code br br br By geography br br br Primary state prefixes br br ZIP Codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of U S states the second and third digits together representing a region in that group or perhaps a large city and the fourth and fifth digits representing a group of delivery addresses within that region The main town in a region if applicable often gets the first ZIP Codes for that region afterward the numerical order often follows the alphabetical order Because ZIP Codes are intended for efficient postal delivery there are unusual cases where a ZIP Code crosses state boundaries such as a military facility spanning multiple states or remote areas of one state most easily serviced from a bordering state For example ZIP Code serves Fort Campbell which spans Christian County Kentucky and Montgomery County Tennessee and ZIP Code includes portions of Lake County Oregon and Modoc County California br In general the first three digits designate a sectional center facility the mail sorting and distribution center for an area A sectional center facility may have more than one three digit code assigned to it For example the Northern Virginia sectional center facility in Merrifield is assigned codes and In some cases a sectional center facility may serve an area in an adjacent state usually due to the lack of a proper location for a center in that region For example in Oklahoma is assigned to Amarillo Texas in South Carolina is assigned to Charlotte North Carolina in Arizona is assigned to Albuquerque New Mexico and in California to Reno Nevada br Many of the lowest ZIP Codes which begin with are in the New England region In the region are New Jersey non contiguous with the remainder of the area Puerto Rico the U S Virgin Islands and APO FPO military addresses for personnel stationed in Europe Africa Southwest Asia and onboard vessels based in the waters adjoining those lands The lowest ZIP Code is in Holtsville New York a ZIP Code exclusively for the U S Internal Revenue Service center there Other low ZIP Codes are for Adjuntas Puerto Rico for Agawam Massachusetts and the ZIP Codes and for Amherst Massachusetts is used for mail in town while is reserved for the University of Massachusetts Amherst Until there were six ZIP Codes lower than that were numbered from to located in Portsmouth New Hampshire and were used by the Diversity Immigrant Visa program to receive applications from non U S citizens br The numbers increase southward along the East Coast such as Boston New York City Philadelphia Baltimore Washington D C Atlanta and Miami these are only examples as each of these cities contains several ZIP Codes in the same range From there the numbers increase heading westward and northward east of the Mississippi River southward west of the Mississippi River and northward on the West Coast For example is in Louisville in Des Moines in Chicago in St Louis in Houston in Denver in San Francisco in Seattle and in Ketchikan Alaska the highest ZIP Code br The first digit of the ZIP Code is allocated as follows br br Connecticut CT Massachusetts MA Maine ME New Hampshire NH New Jersey NJ New York NY Fishers Island only Puerto Rico PR Rhode Island RI Vermont VT Virgin Islands VI Army Post

br br The second and third digits represent the sectional center facility SCF e g xx Vanderburgh County Indiana and the fourth and fifth digits represent the area of the city if in a metropolitan area or a village town outside metro areas e g Indiana Vanderburgh County University of Evansville area When a sectional center facility s area crosses state lines that facility is assigned separate three digit prefixes for the states that it serves br In some urban areas like for Marion County Indiana the three digit prefix will often exist in one county while in rural and most suburban areas the prefix will exist in multiple counties for example the neighboring prefix is found in part or entirely in six counties Gibson Pike Posey Spencer Vanderburgh and Warrick In some cases an urban county may have more than one prefix This is the case with Allen Lake St Joseph and Vanderburgh counties Cities like Chicago Houston Los Angeles and New York City have multiple prefixes within their city limits In some cases these may be served from the same SCF such as in San Diego County California where the three digit prefixes and are used for suburban and rural communities and for the city of San Diego itself although all three are processed through the same SCF br Despite the geographic derivation of most ZIP Codes the codes themselves do not represent geographic regions in general they correspond to address groups or delivery routes As a consequence ZIP Code areas can overlap be subsets of each other or be artificial constructs with no geographic area such as for mail to the Navy which is not geographically fixed In similar fashion in areas without regular postal routes rural route areas or no mail delivery undeveloped areas ZIP Codes are not assigned or are based on sparse delivery routes and hence the boundary between ZIP Code areas is undefined For example some residents in or near Haubstadt Indiana which has the ZIP Code have mailing addresses with the ZIP Code for neighboring Fort Branch Indiana while others living in or near Fort Branch have addresses with Many rural counties have similar logistical inconsistencies caused by the aforementioned sparse delivery routes often known as Rural Routes or by some other similar designation br br br Division and reallocation br Like area codes ZIP Codes are sometimes divided and changed especially when a rural area becomes suburban Typically the new codes become effective once announced and a grace period e g one year is provided in which the new and old codes are used concurrently so that postal patrons in the affected area can notify correspondents order new stationery etc br In rapidly growing communities it is sometimes necessary to open a new sectional center facility which must then be allocated its own three digit ZIP code prefix or prefixes Such allocation can be done in various ways For example when a new sectional center facility was opened at Dulles Airport in Virginia the prefix was allocated to that facility therefore for all post offices to be served by that sectional center facility the ZIP Code changed from an old code beginning with or to a new code or codes beginning with However when a new sectional center facility was opened to serve Montgomery County Maryland no new prefix was assigned Instead ZIP Codes in the and ranges which had previously been assigned alphabetically were reshuffled so that xx ZIP Codes in the county was changed to xx codes while xx codes outside that county were changed to xx codes Because Silver Spring whose postal area includes Wheaton has its own prefix there was no need to apply the reshuffling to Silver Spring instead all mail going to xx ZIP Codes was simply rerouted to the new sectional center facility br On the other hand depopulation may cause a post office to close and its associated ZIP Code to be deallocated For example Centralia Pennsylvania s ZIP Code was retired in and ZIP Codes for Onoville Quaker Bridge and Red House in New York were prevented from going into use in in preparation for the Kinzua Dam s completion br br br Other uses br br br Delivery services br Delivery services other than the USPS such as FedEx United Parcel Service and DHL require a ZIP Code for optimal internal routing of a package br br br Statistics br As of October there are ZIP Codes in the United States Due to convenience ZIP Codes are used not only for tracking of mail but also commonly for gathering geographical statistics in the United States by some researchers ZIP Codes are not created for statistical analysis thus use for statistical analysis is heavily criticized for numerous reasons and advised against as a cartographic practice As ZIP Codes are not polygons but collections of mail routes and points they are unsuitable for publication or distribution of most data Polygons for ZIP Codes are not released by the USPS and instead interpolated by rd party vendors These interpolations introduce topological errors and are not standard between vendors The USPS often discontinues splits or otherwise modifies ZIP Codes making continuous space time analysis challenging leading to issues with both the modifiable areal unit problem MAUP and modifiable temporal unit problem MTUP As the ZIP Codes are postal routing numbers individuals and organizations without concrete spatial locations may be given their own number making it impossible to associate demographic data with them Demographic data is not consistent between ZIP Codes and no effort is made to ensure they are proper enumeration units for analysis As ZIP Codes are not made with the same considerations as other enumeration units and is not possible without committing the ecological fallacy This again becomes an issue with the MAUP They have been found not to have significant correlations with health indicators which can lead to poor conclusions Despite these issues ZIP Codes remain popular among researchers in fields such as public health due to their convenience public familiarity with them ability to anonymize subject addresses through aggregation and possible ignorance of more appropriate enumeration units on the part of researchers br In an attempt to satisfy demand by data users for statistical data by ZIP Code area the U S Census Bureau calculates approximate boundaries of ZIP Code areas which it calls ZIP Code Tabulation Areas ZCTAs Statistical census data is then provided for these approximate areas The geographic data provided for these areas includes the latitude and longitude of the center point of the ZCTAs ZIP Codes are inherently discrete or point based data as they are assigned only at the point of delivery not for the spaces in between the delivery points The United States Census Bureau then interpolates this discrete data set to create polygons by attempting to match ZIP Code extents with Census blocks The resulting aerial units represent the approximate extent of the ZIP Code which are combined with to use for mapping and data presentation The process of creating ZCTAs and their use for statistical analysis are heavily criticized in the literature First the creation of ZCTAs from Census blocks encounters issues when a Census block straddles multiple ZIP Codes Addressing this is another instance of the MAUP and the solution of dividing aggregate units between ZIP Codes causes some individuals to fall into ZCTAs that do not match their ZIP Code The creation of these units is therefore committing the ecological fallacy by attempting to disaggregate aggregate data As ZIP Codes are not continuous not everyone in the United States has one and there are ZIP Codes for non populated or geographic areas resulting in there not being one ZCTA for every ZIP Code ZCTAs are not updated as frequently as the USPS updates ZIP Codes resulting in further temporal analysis issues when ZIP Codes change during a study period Datasets providing a similar approximate geographic extent to ZCTA are commercially available Despite these issues ZCTAs are still very popular with researchers in fields like epidemiology and among government agencies with some states employing them to publish and distribute public health data during the COVID pandemic br br br Marketing br The data is often used in direct mail marketing campaigns in a process called ZIP code marketing Point of sale cashiers sometimes ask consumers for their home ZIP Codes Besides providing purchasing pattern data useful in determining the location of new business establishments retailers can use directories to correlate this ZIP Code with the name on a credit card to obtain a consumer s full address and telephone number ZIP Coded data are also used in analyzing geographic factors in risk an insurance and banking industry practice pejoratively known as redlining This can cause problems e g expensive insurance for people living near a town with a high crime rate and sharing its ZIP Code while they live in a relatively crime free town See Elkins Park Pennsylvania above br California outlawed this practice in br br br Legislative districts br ZIP Codes may not currently be used to identify existing legislative districts Although the website of the United States House of Representatives has a Find Your Representative feature that looks up congressional districts based on ZIP Codes alone it often returns multiple districts corresponding to a single ZIP Code This is because different parts of one ZIP Code can be in different districts One proposal to eliminate the possibility of extreme partisan gerrymandering calls on using ZIP Codes as the basic units for redistricting br br br Internet br A proposal for a nationwide system of community networks suggested using ZIP Codes for routing br ZIP Code data is an integral part of dealer store locator software on many websites especially brick and click websites This software processes a user input ZIP Code and returns a list of store or business locations usually in the order of increasing distance from the center of the input ZIP Code As the ZIP Code system is confined to the U S Postal network websites that require ZIP Codes cannot register customers outside the United States Many sites will purchase postal code data of other countries or make allowances in cases where the ZIP Code is not recognized br ZIP Codes are regularly used on the Internet to provide a location in situations where an exact address is not necessary or desirable but the user s municipality or general location is needed Examples in addition to the store locator example listed above include weather forecasts television listings local news and online dating most general purpose sites by default search within a specified radius of a given
