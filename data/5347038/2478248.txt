Glynn County s population at br br br History br Today s Golden Isles were first settled about years ago by tribes of the Creek nation When the Spaniards arrived in the early s they encountered the Guale and Mocame tribes of the Timucuan people Relations between the Native Americans and the European newcomers alternated between friendly and hostile as their allegiance was sought by competing Old World powers By the late s most of present day Georgia became known as the Debatable Land while the French Spanish and English all fought to establish dominance br During this time a Scottish nobleman Sir Robert Montgomery who envisioned a utopian colony between the Savannah and Altamaha rivers published A Description of the Golden Islands in London The colony was never established but the name persists to this day br By the s the Native American population had declined and Great Britain had prevailed to the extent of founding the colony of Georgia under the leadership of Gen James Oglethorpe who established the city of Savannah Some three decades later the town of Brunswick would be laid out in a similar grid pattern consisting of streets and squares In Oglethorpe built Fort Frederica on the western shore of St Simons Island to defend the Georgia colony from the Spaniards to the south br Title to the Debatable Land was finally established in after the Battle of Bloody Marsh on St Simons Island By way of strategic brilliance and trickery Gen Oglethorpe and his badly outnumbered force defeated the Spaniards who then retreated to St Augustine never to return When the General s force was disbanded in Fort Frederica fell into disuse and was destroyed by fire in Today the fort s remains along with the Bloody Marsh site is a national monument operated by the National Park Service br Military action on the south Georgia coast during the American Revolution was very limited compared to events in the north In April there was a brief naval skirmish off St Simons Island in which the Americans prevailed However the British capture of Savannah later that year effectively ended further hostilities br As agriculture took hold after the Revolution the Golden Isles region become known for rice and cotton On St Simons Island a fine long fiber variety known as Sea Island cotton became the preferred option in England and came to be grown throughout the Georgia low country Several plantations thrived on St Simons among them were Hamilton Retreat Hampton and Cannon s Point The only surviving ruins are at Cannon s Point and the tabby slave cabins at Hamilton Both are open to the public One former slave cabin from Retreat Plantation has been restored and today houses a local gift shop br Even before the Civil War Island plantations had begun their decline due to a dramatic slackening of English demand lack of crop rotation for soil management and absentee ownership Postwar the area languished until the advent of the lumber mills in the latter third of the th century During this period a new lighthouse was constructed to replace the lighthouse that was destroyed during the Civil War The current Lovely Lane Chapel was built and Christ Church was rebuilt One of the Island mills supplied timbers for New York s Brooklyn Bridge br With the turn of the th century and the arrival of the automobile a new industry began to arise vacation travel In the F J Torras Causeway opened St Simons Island to everyone Sea Island Little St Simons and Jekyll Island all remained in private hands with the latter becoming the site of winter homes for wealthy Northern industrialists and bankers br During World War II blimps from Glynco Naval Air Station in Brunswick patrolled the Atlantic protecting convoys and looking for German U boats that frequented the area The Brunswick harbor served as one of the nation s most important production centers for Liberty Ships br br br Geography and climate br The City of Brunswick and its four barrier islands are located on the south Georgia coast about midway between Savannah and Jacksonville The islands lie between the Altamaha River delta to the north and the Satilla River to the south This location is the center point of the Georgia Bight the inward curve of the east coast that stretches from Cape Fear North Carolina to Cape Canaveral Florida The resulting funnel effect on incoming tides in this region creates a more extreme tidal swing than elsewhere on the U S coast ranging from six to ten feet br According to the K ppen Climate Classification System the Golden Isles climate is humid subtropical with hot summers and mild winters The average low temperature in January is F The average high in July is F Rainfall is greatest in August and September Accumulation of snow ice is extremely rare br br In when famed Chicago TV weatherman P J Hoff was about to retire he conducted an extensive analysis based on his personal preferences to find the best climate in the U S Based on several factors he chose the Golden Isles and moved to St Simons Island where he lived until his death in br br br Wildlife and vegetation br One of the primary attractions that brings visitors to the Golden Isles is its vast and diverse array of wildlife and marine vegetation The area s most distinctive characteristic its extensive marshes and estuaries provide an abundance of food plus breeding grounds for a multitude of land sea and air creatures br Most of the area between the islands and the mainland consists of marshland dominated by smooth cordgrass Spartina which is the key provider of life sustaining nutrients for the wildlife Every fall the marsh grass turns a rich amber giving evidence for the name Golden Isles br The results of this rich source of nutrients are visible everywhere Commonly seen along the beaches and the adjacent maritime forests are several species of shorebirds including egrets herons white ibis gulls terns plovers sandpipers pelicans and ospreys Local birds of prey include vultures hawks and the southern bald eagle Five of the eighteen sites along Georgia s Colonial Coast Birding Trail are located within the Golden Isles Glynn County br Among the sights along the beaches inshore waterways and piers are horseshoe crabs ghost crabs slipping in and out of their holes in the sand dolphin manatees in summer jumping mullet jellyfish sand dollars stingrays and conch shells inhabited by hermit crabs Sand dunes along the rear of the beach protect the inland vegetation and serve as an essential buffer during storm tides The picturesque sea oats along the dunes with their complex root systems help keep the sand in place and Georgia law prohibits picking them Beach morning glories and their vines serve a similar purpose During certain times of year dead cordgrass known as wrack washes up on the beach and gathers at the high tide line Insects and microorganisms in the wrack offer nutrients and the wrack itself traps sand to help nourish the dunes Behind the dunes sits a variety of vegetation culminating in the maritime forests that provide the tree canopy so characteristic to Georgia s barrier islands Live oaks southern pines cabbage palms magnolias and others create the canopy Below is a vast complex of shrubs including palmettos yaupon yucca prickly pear cactus resurrection fern and many others including the iconic Spanish Moss The forest is also home to different species of amphibians and land animals including deer snakes raccoons alligators wild turkey frogs and many others br One of the area s most beloved and endangered creatures is the loggerhead sea turtle From late May through mid August female turtles clamber up the beach after dark to dig nests in the dunes above the high water line and lay their eggs Turtle eggs face many threats of both the natural and man made variety and all species of sea turtles are currently protected by the Federal Endangered Species Act The Georgia Department of Natural Resources coordinates the efforts of several local agencies and volunteers under the Georgia Sea Turtle Cooperative These groups monitor protect and manage nests found on Golden Isles beaches in addition to conducting research and public awareness and education programs The Georgia Sea Turtle Center on Jekyll Island a member of the Cooperative provides rehabilitation services for injured turtles as well as research and education through a variety of programs and field trips br Another endangered species found just offshore is the North Atlantic Right Whale These migratory animals got their name from whalers because they were easy to hunt and yielded large amounts of oil and baleen As a result they were hunted almost to extinction Right whales are currently protected by both Federal and State law Because the waters off South Georgia and Florida are their only known calving grounds the NOAA has designated a critical habitat area extending from the Altamaha River delta to Melbourne Florida Federal law prohibits vessels from approaching or remaining within yards of a right whale In December the Georgia Department of Natural Resources estimated that there were fewer than breeding females in existence br br br Culture br Because of its long and varied history and mixture of disparate peoples the Golden Isles enjoys a rich cultural heritage that locals work to preserve in a variety of ways There is also a vibrant contemporary culture that manifests itself in a broad mixture of creative arts Local theater productions art exhibits music festivals culinary events environmental expositions art and photography shows are scheduled throughout the year Venues include the historic Ritz Theatre Brunswick Actors Theatre Mary Ross Park Neptune Park and the St Simons Island Casino home of the Island Players br br br Arts and music br The Golden Isles are home to a growing number of art galleries and other venues where creative artists share their works Golden Isles Arts Humanities in Brunswick and Glynn Visual Arts on St Simons Island have each been instrumental in promoting and supporting both established and beginning artists br Among the more unusual local art forms are the Tree Spirits of St Simons Island Created by a local sculptor they memorialize sailors lost at sea on ships made of island lumber along with some Native Americans Their mournful expressions create an emotional and unforgettable experience for viewers br The centuries old art of stained glass is on display at several locations throughout the Golden Isles At Christ Church Frederica The Confession of St Peter dates to Faith Chapel on Jekyll Island includes a window signed by Louis Tiffany Lovely Lane Chapel at Epworth by the Sea features Old English Art Glass windows Another Tiffany window is located at St Mark s Episcopal Church in Brunswick Other notable examples can be seen at the King Prince Resort the Cloister Hotel and the Jekyll Island Club Hotel as well as many other churches throughout the area br In late spring and summer music lovers enjoy outdoor concerts at Mary Ross Waterfront Park in Brunswick and Neptune Park on St Simons Island Jekyll Island hosts annual festivals that feature both local and out of town performers br br br African American heritage br The Golden Isles are located near the southern end of the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor a coastal area that stretches from Wilmington NC to Jacksonville FL extending miles inland along its length Gullah Geechee refers to a people a language and a culture The Gullah Geechee people are descendants of slaves primarily from west and central Africa who were brought to work on cotton and rice plantations along the coast of North and South Carolina Georgia and north Florida The Gullah language is a creole tongue that combines English with a number of African dialects br Coastal primarily rice growing plantations came to be isolated from their mainland counterparts due to the prevalence of tropical diseases such as malaria which tended to keep the plantation owners inland Consequently the West African slaves were able to form tight knit communities that retained more of their homeland culture and languages This Gullah Geechee way of life continued more or less intact until the advent of th century coastal development The Heritage Corridor is one result of efforts to protect and preserve this unique and little known culture br The St Simons African American Heritage Coalition works to preserve and educate people about Gullah Geechee culture through the annual Sea Island Festival each June on St Simons Island Performers at the Festival have included the Georgia Sea Island Singers a world renowned folk group that specializes in Gullah music and dance The Coalition also conducts tours of Gullah Geechee sites on the island Recently they played a leading role in fundraising for restoration of the historic Harrington School House which dates to the s and served the island s African American communities br br br Ghost stories br Given its long history it is not surprising that ghost stories are plentiful in the Golden Isles Some of the tales often heard from locals and tour guides alike include br br Mary the Wanderer who lost her lover in a storm at sea is sometimes seen with a lantern or riding a white horse continuing her search br The flickering light in Christ Church cemetery a candle said to have been put there by the husband of a deceased woman who always kept a lighted candle by her bedside to allay her fear of

Isles beaches are visited throughout the year for walking bird watching and shell hunting br br br Tourism br Because it was one of the few barrier islands not privately owned St Simons Island was the first of the Golden Isles to develop facilities for tourism primarily on and around the south end where visitors arrived at the pier beginning in the s Also during this time the luxurious Oglethorpe Hotel opened in Brunswick With the advent of the automobile and the opening of the F J Torras Causeway in more facilities were built most notably by auto magnate turned developer Howard Coffin and it was not long before St Simons Island became a preferred vacation destination In Mr Coffin who had earlier purchased Sea Island opened the Cloister to great critical acclaim br While St Simons Island was entering its tourism phase Jekyll Island remained a private retreat for the rich and famous After the Great Depression and World War II however the Jekyll Island Club and the winter cottages fell into disuse In the State of Georgia purchased the island for the purpose of creating a state park Shortly thereafter the Jekyll Island Authority was created by the state legislature to manage the
