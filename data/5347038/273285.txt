title: Race and ethnicity in the United States census
id: 273285
In the United States census the U S Census Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget define a set of self identified categories of race and ethnicity chosen by residents with which they most closely identify Residents can indicate their origins alongside their race and are asked specifically whether they are of Hispanic or Latino origin in a separate question br The racial categories represent a social political construct for the race or races that respondents consider themselves to be and generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country The OMB defines the concept of race as outlined for the census to be not scientific or anthropological and takes into account social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry using appropriate scientific methodologies that are not primarily biological or genetic in reference The race categories include both racial and national origin groups br Race and ethnicity are considered separate and distinct identities with a person s origins considered in the census Thus in addition to their race or races all respondents are categorized by membership in one of two ethnic categories which are Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino However the practice of separating race and ethnicity as different categories has been criticized both by the American Anthropological Association and members of U S Commission on Civil Rights br In the OMB issued a Federal Register notice regarding revisions to the standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity The OMB developed race and ethnic standards in order to provide consistent data on race and ethnicity throughout the federal government The development of the data standards stem in large measure from new responsibilities to enforce civil rights laws Among the changes The OMB issued the instruction to mark one or more races after noting evidence of increasing numbers of mixed race children and wanting to record diversity in a measurable way after having received requests by people who wanted to be able to acknowledge theirs and their children s full ancestry rather than identifying with only one group Prior to this decision the census and other government data collections asked people to report singular races br As of the OMB built on the guidelines and suggested the addition of a Middle Eastern or North African MENA racial category and considered combining racial and ethnic categories into one question In March the Office of Management and Budget published revisions to Statistical Policy Directive No Standards for Maintaining Collecting and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity that included a combined question and a MENA category while also collecting additional detail to enable data disaggregation br br br How data on is used br The OMB states many federal programs are put into effect based on the race data obtained from the decennial census i e promoting equal employment opportunities assessing racial disparities in health and environmental risks Race data is also critical for the basic research behind many policy decisions States require this data to meet legislative redistricting requirements The data is needed to monitor compliance with the Voting Rights Act by local jurisdictions br Data on ethnic groups are important for putting into effect a number of federal statutes i e enforcing bilingual election rules under the Voting Rights Act and monitoring enforcing equal employment opportunities under the Civil Rights Act Data on ethnic groups is also needed by local governments to run programs and meet legislative requirements i e identifying segments of the population who may not be receiving medical services under the Public Health Service Act evaluating whether financial institutions are meeting the credit needs of minority populations under the Community Reinvestment Act br br br Brief overview of history br br br th and th centuries br br br census br br The United States census was the first census in the history of the United States The population of the United States was recorded as as of Census Day August as mandated by Article I Section of the United States Constitution and applicable laws br The law required that every household be visited that completed census schedules be posted in two of the most public places within each jurisdiction remain for the inspection of all concerned and that the aggregate amount of each description of persons for every district be transmitted to the president The U S Marshals were also responsible for governing the census br br br Loss of data br About one third of the original census data has been lost or destroyed since documentation The data was lost in and included data from Connecticut Delaware Georgia Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Hampshire New Jersey New York North Carolina Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina Vermont and Virginia However the census was proven factual and the existence of most of this data can be confirmed in many secondary sources pertaining to the first census br br br Data br Census data included the name of the head of the family and categorized inhabitants as free white males at least years of age to assess the country s industrial and military potential free white males under years of age free white females all other free persons reported by sex and color and slaves Thomas Jefferson then the Secretary of State directed U S Marshals to collect data from all original states and from the Southwest Territory The census was not conducted in Vermont until after that state s admission to the Union as the th state on March of that year br br br Contemporary perception br br Some doubt surrounded the numbers as President George Washington and Thomas Jefferson maintained the population was undercounted The potential reasons Washington and Jefferson may have thought this could be refusal to participate poor public transportation and roads spread out population and restraints of current technology br br br Data availability br No microdata from the population census are available but aggregate data for small areas and their compatible cartographic boundary files can be downloaded from the National Historical Geographic Information System However the categories of Free white males of years and upward including heads of families under years Free white females including heads of families All other free persons and Slaves existed in the census form br br br and census br In and the age question regarding free white males was more detailed with five cohorts and included All other free persons except Indians not taxed and Slaves br br br census br The census built on the questions asked in by asking age questions about slaves Also the term colored entered the census nomenclature In addition a question stating Number of foreigners not naturalized was included br br br census br In the census a new question which stated The number of White persons who were foreigners not naturalized was included br br br census br The census had a dramatic shift in the way information about residents was collected For the first time free persons were listed individually instead of by head of household Two questionnaires were used one for free inhabitants and one for slaves The question on the free inhabitants schedule about color was a column that was to be left blank if a person were white marked B if a person were black and marked M if a person were mulatto Slaves were listed by owner and classified by gender and age not individually and the question about color was a column that was to be marked with a B if the slave were black and an M if mulatto br br br census br For the Census Office changed the design of the population questionnaire Residents were still listed individually but a new questionnaire sheet was used for each family Additionally this was the first year that the census distinguished among different Asian ethnic groups such as Japanese and Chinese due to increased immigration This census also marked the beginning of the term race in the questionnaires Enumerators were instructed to write White Black Mulatto Quadroon Octoroon Chinese Japanese or Indian br br br census br During the Color or Race question was slightly modified removing the term Mulatto Also there was an inclusion of an Indian Population Schedule in which enumerators were instructed to use a special expanded questionnaire for American Indians living on reservations or in family groups off of reservations This expanded version included the question Fraction of person s lineage that is white br br br th century br br br census br The census was similar to that of but it included a reinsertion of Mulatto and a question about the mother tongue of foreign born individuals and individuals with foreign born parents Ot was also added to signify other races with space for a race to be written in This decade s version of the Indian Population Schedule featured questions asking the individual s proportion of white black or American Indian lineage br br br census br The census questionnaire was similar to but excluded a separate schedule for American Indians Hin Kor and Fil were also added to the Color or Race question signifying Hindu Asian Indian Korean and Filipino respectively br br br census br The biggest change in this census was in racial classification Enumerators were instructed to no longer use the Mulatto classification Instead they were given special instructions for reporting the race of interracial persons A person with both white and black ancestry termed blood was to be recorded as Negro no matter the fraction of that lineage the one drop rule A person of mixed black and American Indian ancestry was also to be recorded as Neg for Negro unless they were considered to be predominantly American Indian and accepted as such within the community A person with both white and American Indian ancestry was to be recorded as American Indian unless their Indigenous ancestry was small and they were accepted as white within the community In all situations in which a person had white and some other racial ancestry they were to be reported as that other race People who had minority interracial ancestry were to be reported as the race of their father br For the first and only time Mexican was listed as a race Enumerators were instructed that all people born in Mexico or whose parents were born in Mexico should be listed as Mexicans and not under any other racial category In prior censuses and in enumerators were instructed to list Mexican Americans as white perhaps because some of them were of white background mainly Spanish many others mixed white and Native American and some of them Native American br The supplemental American Indian questionnaire was back but in abbreviated form It featured a question asking if the person was of full or mixed American Indian ancestry br br br census br President Franklin D Roosevelt promoted a Good Neighbor policy that sought better relations with Mexico In a federal judge ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white as required by federal law Mexico protested and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white The State Department the Census Bureau the Labor Department and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white This policy encouraged the League of United Latin American Citizens in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness br The census was the first to include separate population and housing questionnaires The race category of Mexican was eliminated in and the population of Mexican descent was counted with the white population br census data was used for Japanese American internment The Census Bureau s role was denied for decades but was finally proven in br br br census br The census questionnaire removed the word color from the racial question and also removed Hindu and Korean from the race choices br br br census br The census re added the word color to the racial question and changed Indian to American Indian as well as adding Hawaiian Part Hawaiian Aleut and Eskimo The Other print out race option was removed br br br census br This year s census included Negro or Black re added Korean and the Other race option East Indians the term used at that time for people whose ancestry is from the Indian subcontinent were counted as White There was a questionnaire that was asked of only a sample of respondents These questions were as follows br br a Where was this person born br b Is this person s origin or descent MexicanPuerto RicanCubanCentral or South AmericanOther SpanishNone of These br What country was the person s father born in br What country was the person s mother born in br a For persons born in a foreign country Is the person naturalized br b When did the person come to the United States to stay br What language other than English was spoken in the person s home as a child br Spanish br French br Italian br German br Other br None only English br Questions on Spanish or Hispanic Origin or Descent br Is this person s origin or descent br Mexican br Puerto Rican Cuban br Central American Other Spanish br No none of these br br br census br This year added several options to the race question including Vietnamese Indian East Guamanian Samoan and re added Aleut Again the term color was removed from the racial question and the following questions were asked of a sample of respondents br br In what state or foreign country was the person born br If this person was born in a foreign country br a Is this person a naturalized citizen of the United States br b When did this person come to the United States to stay br a Does this person speak a language other than English at home br b If yes what is this language br c If yes how well does this person speak English br What is this person s ancestry br Questions on Spanish or Hispanic Origin or Descent br Is this person of Spanish Hispanic origin or descent br No not Spanish Hispanic br Yes Mexican Mexican American Chicano br Yes Puerto Rican br Yes Cuban br Yes other Spanish Hispanic br br br census br The racial categories in this year are as they appear in the and censuses The following questions were asked of a sample of respondents for the census br br In what U S State or foreign country was this person born br Is this person a citizen of the United States br If this person was not born in the United States when did this person come to the United States to stay br br The census was not designed to capture multiple racial responses and when individuals marked the other race option and provided a multiple write in The response was assigned according to the race written first For example a write in of black white was assigned a code of black while a write in of white black was assigned a code of white br Questions on Spanish or Hispanic Origin or Descent br Is this person of Spanish Hispanic origin br No not Spanish Hispanic br Yes Mexican Mexican American Chicano br Yes Puerto Rican br Yes Cuban br Yes other Spanish Hispanic print one group br br Census data indicate that the number of children in interracial families grew from less than one half million in to about two million in In for interracial families with one White partner the other parent was Black for about percent of all children the other parent was Asian for percent and the other parent was American Indian and Alaska Native for about percent br br br census br Race was asked differently in the census in several other ways than previously Most significantly respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate racial identities Data show that nearly seven million Americans identified as members of two or more races Because of these changes the census data on race are not directly comparable with data from the census or earlier censuses Use of caution is therefore recommended when interpreting changes in the racial composition of the U S population over time br The following definitions apply to the census only br br White A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe the Middle East or North Africa It includes people who indicate their race as white skinned people or report entries such as Irish German Italian Lebanese Near Easterner Arab or Polish br Black or African American A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa It includes people who indicate their race as Black African Am or Negro or provide written entries such as African American Afro American Kenyan Nigerian or Haitian br American Indian and Alaska Native A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America including Central America and who maintain tribal affiliation or community attachment br Asian A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East Southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent including for example Cambodia China India Japan Korea Malaysia Pakistan the Philippine Islands Thailand and Vietnam It includes Asian Indian Chinese Filipino Korean Japanese Vietnamese and Other Asian br Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii Guam Samoa or other Pacific Islands It includes people who indicate their race as Native Hawaiian Guamanian or Chamorro Samoan and Other Pacific Islander br Some other race Includes all other responses not included in the White Black or African American American Indian or Alaska Native Asian and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander race categories described above Respondents providing write in entries such as multiracial mixed interracial We Sort or a Hispanic Latino group for example Mexican Puerto Rican or Cuban in the Some other race category are included here br Two or more races People may have chosen to provide two or more races either by checking two or more race response check boxes by providing multiple write in responses or by some combination of check boxes and write in responses br br The federal government of the United States has mandated that in data collection and presentation federal agencies are required to use a minimum of two ethnicities Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino The Census Bureau defines Hispanic or Latino as a person of Cuban Mexican Puerto Rican South or Central American or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race br Use of the word ethnicity for Hispanics only is considerably more restricted than its conventional meaning which covers other distinctions some of which are covered by the race and ancestry questions The distinct questions accommodate the possibility of Hispanic and Latino Americans also declaring various racial identities see also White Hispanic and Latino Americans Black Hispanic and Latino Americans and Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans br In the census of the U S population reported Hispanic or Latino ethnicity and reported Not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity br br br st century br br br census br The census included changes designed to more clearly distinguish Hispanic ethnicity as not being a race That included adding the sentence For this census Hispanic origins are not races Additionally the Hispanic terms were modified from Hispanic or Latino to Hispanic Latino or Spanish origin br Although used in the census and the American Community Survey Some other race is not an official race and the Bureau considered eliminating it prior to the census As the census form did not contain the question titled Ancestry found in prior censuses there were campaigns to get non Hispanic West Indian Americans Turkish Americans Armenian Americans Arab Americans and Iranian Americans to indicate their ethnic or national background through the race question specifically the Some other race category br The Interagency Committee has suggested that the concept of marking multiple boxes be extended to the Hispanic origin question thereby freeing individuals from having to choose between their parents ethnic heritages In other words a respondent could choose both Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino br br br census br The census featured similar designs to the and censuses Subsequently the Census Bureau adhered to the OMB standards and thus used two separate questions to collect data on race and ethnicity However there were improvements in the phrasing of the race and ethnicity questions within the OMB guidelines that would enhance clarity for respondents br The Hispanic origin question included the same checkboxes as the census Mexican Mexican Am Chicano Puerto Rican Cuban along with a Yes another Hispanic Latino or Spanish origin Under this category two changes emerged The first was the shift from Print origin for example to Print for example The removal of the word origin was due to the surveyed confusion and differentiating meanings origin has for respondents or varying backgrounds Furthermore the Census Bureau updated the write in instructions for the Some Other Race category and included the instruction to Print race but changed the instruction to read Print race or origin to match the primary instruction to Mark one or more boxes AND print origins br According to the United States Census Bureau as a result of significant feedback a detailed write in response and example were included for the White and the Black or African Am racial categories to compensate a wider horizon of identities There were also six example groups for each of the White Black or African American and American Indian or Alaska Native racial categories In addition after years the term Negro was removed from the census as a large portion of respondents advocated for its removal Instead the category shifted from Black African Am or Negro to Black or African Am on paper questionnaires and electronic instruments br The identification of the term African American first occurred in the census reflecting a long standing history of offensive terminology since the censuses inception The census included other free persons by color and slaves From to the codes for enumerators were generally Black B and Mulatto M In there were no specified categories on the census listing form and the instructions called for enumerators to list B for Black or negro or negro descent displaying the first occurrence of the controversial term Negro In there were specific instructions that used the term Negro Mixed persons were to be counted as Negro no matter how small the share of blood also known as the one drop rule It was not until that the term Black appeared on a census form and in the enumerator of color was eliminated br The census was also the first to specifically solicit Middle Eastern North African MENA responses through the write in response for the White racial category The term MENA includes the Arab American population which is growing quickly as of This allowed the census to include dis aggregated data on MENA populations which made up over million Americans California New York and Michigan have the largest MENA populations and Lebanese Iranian and Egyptian populations made up nearly half of them This was almost triple the census estimate of a population of million Arab Americans based on the Ancestry question rather than the racial category question That number may have been an under count however as of the American population provided no answer for the Ancestry question br This is significant because MENA identities were previously only tracked through the Ancestry write in question on the American Community Survey in The Arab American population was then estimated through the number of responses that included one or more Arab ancestries The census changed this by explicitly prompting write in responses with Arab American examples listed as Print for example German Irish English Italian Lebanese Egyptian etc br The improvements are part of a larger effort reviewing the OMB guidelines specifically to move MENA from under the White racial category into a new label An OMB working group officially recommended a new MENA category in based on public feedback going back to and plans to make final decisions on revisions by Summer Many people in the community may not be perceived nor perceive themselves to be White The added category could allow for more targeted funding social programs and political representation A study from Rutgers University found significant inequalities in household income citizenship rates and English speaking rates between New Jersey s White population and Arab population concluding that America s White and Arab populations might be different enough both culturally and economically to justify a separate category br The next change was reordering the example groups from Argentinean Colombian Dominican Nicaraguan Salvadoran Spaniard and so on to Salvadoran Dominican Colombian Guatemalan Spaniard Ecuadorian etc to reflect the ever increasing geographic diversity of the Hispanic or Latino category and the variations in populations sums each year br br Net coverage error is statistically significantly different from br Though the issues of identification questions of origin were addressed the accuracy of the census displays undercounts and overcounts of Black people Latinos and Native Americans according to the work conducted under Robert Santos the current director of the United States Census Bureau A follow up survey concluded that the miscounting of children under five years of age and that American Indians and Alaska Natives living on reservations continued to have the highest net undercount rate similar to One of the leading factors of the misrepresented information in the census is the coronavirus pandemic which caused notable delays in the Census Bureau s Post Enumeration Survey The Post Enumeration Survey is used to determine how accurate the census results are and inform planning for the next national count in Furthermore discrepancies persisted due to the irrefutable variables of delays to field work migration of many college students and others and some respondents failed to answer the necessary questions required for the Post Enumeration Survey to match the census Journalist Michael Wines of the New York Times attributes group quarters like college dormitories long term care facilities and prisons to have the largest contingencies in the tally as the pandemic pushed many university students to return home making it harder to count them in the dormitories or apartments where they normally would have been br Hispanic or Latino br Translating the data set the difference in net coverage error for the Hispanic or Latino category proves widely problematic but is an avid reflection of the seismic shifts in the United States Mexican immigrants have been at the center of one of the largest mass migrations in contemporary history reaching a peak of million in but have since declined as reported by the Pew Research Center The predominant reasoning being shifts in political authority and the coronavirus pandemic resulting in policy changes More specifically immigrants entering through a permanent legal residency green card visa overstays and apprehensions have drastically changed the input and output of data br The total number of non immigrant visas processed in Mexico by the U S Department of State dropped in compared with the prior year from about million in to about in The temporary visas were processed for tourism business or crossing the border Consequently due to political shifts apprehensions of unauthorized Mexican immigrants increased considerably after the pandemic started in In fiscal the number of detainments of Mexican adults at the U S Mexican border reached sky high new levels under former president Donald Trump There were such encounters up from the previous year br br br Relation between ethnicity and race in census results br br The Census Bureau warns that data on race in census are not directly comparable to those collected in previous censuses Many residents of the United States consider race and ethnicity to be the same br br In the census respondents were tallied in each of the race groups they reported Consequently the total of each racial category exceeds the total population because some people reported more than one race br According to James P Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University Northridge by some calculations in the census the largest part white biracial population is white Native American and Alaskan Native at followed by white black at then white Asian at and finally white Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander at br The Census Bureau implemented a Census Quality Survey gathering data from about households to assess the reporting of race and Hispanic origin in the census with the purpose of creating a way to make comparisons between the census with previous census racial data br In September during the process of revision of racial categories previously declared by OMB Directive No the American Anthropological Association AAA recommended that OMB combine the race and ethnicity categories into one question to appear as race ethnicity for the census The Interagency Committee agreed stating that race and ethnicity were not sufficiently defined and that many respondents conceptualize race and ethnicity as one and the same sic underscor ing the need to consolidate these terms into one category using a term that is more meaningful to the American people br The AAA also stated br br The American Anthropological Association recommends the elimination of the term race from OMB Directive during the planning for the census During the past years race has been scientifically proven to not be a real natural phenomenon More specific social categories such as ethnicity or ethnic group are more salient for scientific purposes and have fewer of the negative racist connotations for which the concept of race was developed br Yet the concept of race has become thoroughly and perniciously woven into the cultural and political fabric of the United States It has become an essential element of both individual identity and government policy Because so much harm has been based on racial distinctions over the years correctives for such harm must also acknowledge the impact of racial consciousness among the U S populace regardless of the fact that race has no scientific justification in human biology Eventually however these classifications must be transcended and replaced by more non racist and accurate ways of representing the diversity of the U S population br The recommendations of the AAA were not adopted by the Census Bureau for the and censuses This includes Hispanic Latino or Spanish origin which remained an ethnicity not a race While race ethnicity definitions for remained consistent individuals who identify as White Black African American and or American Indian or Alaska Native were asked to specifically identify their racial origins br br br Other agencies br br In the National Institutes of Health adopted the new language to
