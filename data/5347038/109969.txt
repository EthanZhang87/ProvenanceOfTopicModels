community that became College Park was founded as Atlantic City in as a depot on the Atlanta and West Point Railroad The town was renamed Manchester when it was incorporated as a city in It was renamed again as the city of College Park in The city s name came from being the home of Cox College where the city hall and other buildings now stand and Georgia Military Academy now the Woodward Academy The east west avenues in College Park are named for Ivy League colleges and the north south streets are named for influential College Park residents br br br th century br During World War I s anti German hysteria the name of Wilhelm Street was changed to Victoria Street in solidarity with our British brethren At the same time Berlin Avenue was changed to Cambridge Avenue and the name of German Lane was changed to English Lane The history of College Park has been closely linked with what is now known as Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport airport development having spurred several radical changes to the landscape of the municipality over the course of the th century In a study funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development suggested that the introduction and expansion of jet aircraft travel would place the airport and surrounding communities including College Park into conflict ultimately the study concluded that the only effective way to control the use of land is to own it suggesting that the airport would have to acquire the properties it would be in conflict with in order to expand br In the s and s large swaths of property in College Park were purchased using information detailed in The Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport Noise Land Reuse Plan which allowed the airport to apply for federal funding to purchase property deemed to be in so called noise land The Chuck Norris film Invasion U S A was notoriously filmed in these abandoned portions of College Park houses owned by the City of Atlanta and the FAA were allowed to be blown up to simulate bazooka attacks a decision that has faced modern day criticism due to the fact that nearby properties were still in the process of being purchased This site would eventually in in part be home to the Georgia International Convention Center the center officially opened in at a separate location but was relocated to the area in response to planned airport runway expansions Today the GICC is the second largest convention center in Georgia featuring a carpeted ballroom and multiple spaces for meetings conferences and conventions It is the only convention center in the country that also houses a SkyTrain with direct rail access to an international airport Directly next to the Georgia International Convention Center is the Gateway Center Arena which opened in November home to the NBA s G League College Park Skyhawks and where the WNBA s Atlanta Dream will play their season br In the College Park Historical Society was founded in order to combat proposed northward expansion of the airport the society succeeded in lobbying against proposed flight paths over the neighborhood colloquially known as Historic College Park as well as registered swaths of homes and the Main Street commercial district with the National Register of Historic Places eventually resulting in the establishment of the College Park Historic District br Between the s and the early s as part of continued execution of the FAA noise abatement program the City of Atlanta and the FAA purchased roughly acres of property containing residential structures churches and some small commercial buildings immediately adjacent to the west side of downtown College Park resulting in a multitude of properties sitting abandoned for decades The totality of these eventually abandoned properties purchased from the s through the s have been described as a major player in shaping a negative public image of the city second only to the perception of crime in the area br br br Recent history br br br Hip hop br Although the Atlanta hip hop music scene in the s and s was largely credited to artists from nearby suburban Decatur College Park and the adjacent city of East Point have been strongly associated with artists and record producers from SWATS Southwest Atlanta Too Strong who have substantially contributed to the evolution of the southern hip hop genre over the course of the s br br br Gentrification br While the controversial process of gentrification started in the larger Atlanta Metropolitan Area in the s it was only in the latter s that redevelopment substantially spread to College Park proper In the College Park government embarked on a year development plan which included goals to expand its economic base while keeping its small town historic characteristics and to make use of its available land to attract new employers and residential opportunities saw the construction of a mixed use project which contained the first mid rise apartments to be constructed in the city since From the s and into the s the City of College Park succeeded in repurchasing the entirety of the acres adjacent to downtown in concurrent with substantial commercial and residential development in the area the City of College Park announced major redevelopment of this abandoned area now referred to as Airport City as part of a larger transit oriented

airport expansion and the difficult nature of having housing constructed in areas previously considered to be high noise br br br Crime br For much of the s College Park along with the other so called

rates in Georgia with reports including homicides However was an outlier with respect to the rest of that decade and homicide for the rest of the years between and between and homicides were reported
