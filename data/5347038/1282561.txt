Commandant s determination that an infraction had occurred br Morning Formation The entire Cadet Corps of the Senior School Grades would assemble each morning at hours on the south side of the Memorial Oval for inspection and announcements The Corps assembled in platoons three ranks deep and each platoon leader inspected for shave haircut shoeshine tie collar spiffy in place clean starched shirt and trousers shirt seam aligned with trouser flap i e gig line correct The Commandant would then make announcements over the public address speaker system Any cadets whose names had been called would assemble at the required locations the South Sally Port was a favorite assembly point for any required administrative purpose The formation would then be dismissed so cadets could attend class
