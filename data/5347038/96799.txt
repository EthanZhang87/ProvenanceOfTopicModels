government is Evans br Columbia County is included in the Augusta Richmond County GA SC metropolitan statistical area It is located along the Savannah River br br br History br Columbia County the th county formed in Georgia was created by an act of the Legislature of Georgia on December from Richmond County br br br Prehistory and the colonial era br This area along the Savannah River had been inhabited for thousands of years by various cultures of indigenous peoples The area had been home to the historic Muscogee speaking Creek Yuchi people speaking a language isolate and Iroquoian speaking Cherokee for years prior to European colonization The Yuchi had moved south from Tennessee because of pressure from the Cherokee who continued to move into the Piedmont and soon dominated the Native American tribes One of the oldest archaeological sites in the nation to contain pottery can be found on Stallings Island br During the Colonial era settlement of what would become Columbia County occurred primarily due to colonists settling at the second city in Georgia Augusta located on the Fall Line When the British Province of Georgia became a crown colony in and was divided into parishes the area around Augusta became St Paul s Parish The primary areas of settlement were Augusta Wrightsboro a Quaker settlement named for James Wright the royal governor and Brownsborough which was near the present day location of North Columbia Elementary School br Because the Church of England was the established church in the province it was against the law for anyone to preach contrary to its doctrines Influenced by the Great Awakening in New England in Daniel Marshall established Kiokee Baptist Church the first Baptist church in Georgia The church was located below Brownsborough along the Kiokee Creek in present day Appling Born in Connecticut Marshall had been raised as a Presbyterian He had become a Baptist and preached in the Carolinas before coming to Georgia where he was arrested Baptist preachers and their converts continued to flourish and in Virginia their influence helped shape the young James Madison s ideas on religious freedom which he incorporated into the new Constitution Marshall later served in the militia during the American Revolutionary War During the th century and the Second Great Awakening the Baptists became well established in Georgia and other southern states The Baptists offered congregational participation to slaves and approved them and free blacks as preachers leading to the growth in black membership in the church br br br American Revolutionary War br Two small battles occurred in what would become the county during the Revolutionary War between Patriot Militia and Tories the area was then primarily frontier and loyalties were badly divided Legend has it that a small band of Patriots sought refuge from marauding Tories at the county s most dramatic geological feature Heggie s Rock One of these fights occurred on September between the forces of Elijah Clarke and a band of Tories and British Regular soldiers br George Walton the Virginia born statesman who signed the Declaration of Independence resided in what would become Columbia County as did William Few and Abraham Baldwin They were delegates to the Federal Convention that framed the United States Constitution br br br Formation of Columbia County br Just before and immediately after the Revolution numerous Virginians and North Carolinians migrated to the frontier of Georgia above Augusta including the area around Brownsborough After the Revolution residents disagreed as to whether Augusta or Brownsborough should be the county seat of Richmond County At the insistence of William Few the county was partitioned The new county formed from Richmond was named Columbia for the origin of the name see Columbia this did not end the controversy about location of the county seat The citizens of Columbia County turned to arguing among themselves Supporters built one courthouse in Brownsborough and those of Cobbham built another The courthouse at Cobbham was used and Brownsborough in short order ceased to exist In part of the county was taken combined with part of Wilkes County and formed into Warren County br Around William Appling deeded a tract of land to the county for the purpose of building a courthouse It was near Kiokee Creek and the Baptist Church which Marshall had founded A courthouse was constructed and served the county until around The small town that existed around the church and courthouse came to be known as Columbia Courthouse In the Baptist congregation left the town and constructed a new meeting house a building which survives several miles away near the junction of Kiokee and Greenbrier creeks That same year construction began on a new courthouse which was completed in In Columbia Courthouse was chartered as the Town of Appling named for the Appling family who had donated the land to the county and for Colonel John Appling a local resident who died in a campaign against the Seminole br br br Early th century br Appling was the political educational social and religious center of the county Near Appling were located Mt Carmel Academy and Columbia Institute Mt Carmel Academy was run by the famous Southern educator Moses Waddel it was here that John C Calhoun and William H Crawford were educated Columbia Institute was started by a certain gentleman going by the surname Bush he was none other than the Bushnell of Revolutionary War submariner fame During the Georgia Gold Rush of the s some successful prospecting and mining occurred in Columbia County br The s were a period of major infrastructure projects and the coming of the railroad When the Georgia Railroad was established the judges determined that having trains passing near Appling would disturb their proceedings they insisted that the railway line that was built in the county from Atlanta to Augusta pass well below Appling Construction of the Augusta Canal in the s required Columbia County s cooperation as the beginning of the canal and the locks were within the county br In the Courthouse in Appling received a major overhaul and after the remodeling was complete the building was in more or less its present form Despite the extensive project builders retained the shell of the building br br br American Civil War br Plantation agriculture based on slave labor was the major force of the economy in the county prior to the American Civil War Cotton production had expanded dramatically after the invention of the cotton gin which enabled the cultivation of short staple cotton in the upland areas Numerous vast plantations existed the central houses of some of which still exist Thousands of slaves were brought to the county for labor At times the slave population outnumbered the free white population br When Georgia seceded from the United States George Walker Crawford a native son of Columbia County presided over the Secession Convention He had previously been elected as the only Whig governor of the State Men from the county served in several companies among them the Hamilton Rangers and the Ramsey Guards some in the th Georgia Volunteer Infantry Regiment and some in the nd almost all in Wright s Brigade The troops assembled in front of the courthouse then boarded trains at the depots Berzelia Sawdust Dearing and Thomson No fighting occurred in the county during the war nor was it directly in General Sherman s path According to some family stories some Union cavalry scouts or bummers entered the county Near the war s end the remnants of the Confederate treasury were taken through Columbia County from Augusta to where the Chennault Raid occurred in neighboring Lincoln County br The war took a heavy toll on the white male population of the county a plaque behind the bench in the main Courtroom bears the names of Columbia County s Confederate dead During Reconstruction the county was subject to military occupation Because of significant Ku Klux Klan violence in the late s it was attached to a special district including Warren Wilkes and Oglethorpe counties Additional Union forces were sent there to try to suppress the insurgents and their vigilante crimes against freedmen They had been steadily reported by the Freedmen s Bureau whose reports included a mob lynching of a freedman in Appling in July br br br Late th century br The railroad brought increased trade and population to Thomson In the part of Columbia County which included Thomson Dearing and Wrightsboro the acre settlement established in by Colonial Governor James Wright as a settlement for displaced Quakers from North Carolina was combined with parts of Warren County to form McDuffie County named after South Carolina s U S Senator George McDuffie Thomson became the county seat of the newly formed county br On March Appling suffered severe damage during a tornado It never regained its former wealth and position in the county before the Civil War br During Reconstruction the legislature passed an act to establish a public school system for the first time Like the rest of the state the county developed segregated schools The new communities of Harlem and Grovetown grew up Harlem arose in the s when a disgruntled railroad employee named Hicks angered by saloons and Sabbath breaking in Sawdust moved along the tracks one mile east and set up a rival town complete with its own depot Sawdust was eclipsed by Harlem losing its depot and being absorbed by the newer town in the s The city was named after Harlem New York Grovetown named for Grove Baptist Church developed as a summer resort in the s for wealthy Augustans br br br th century br The th century brought many changes to the county with new technologies and modernization In Harlem was badly damaged by fire Bringing electricity to the county began Men from Columbia County answered the call of duty and served in both World Wars Prior to World War II the county was still primarily agricultural it had escaped the boll weevil infestation that destroyed cotton crops in Mississippi and other parts of the South The US Army built Camp later Fort Gordon taking over a large portion of Richmond County and parts of Columbia McDuffie and Jefferson The Army s keeping the fort after WWII created a new population and economic center for the county During the s the Clarks Hill Dam was constructed submerging considerable land in northern Columbia County under the new reservoir It prompted new residential development around the lake br Between and the population increased dramatically Agriculture declined as farmland was redeveloped as suburban housing and community centers for persons employed in Augusta Numerous personnel stationed at Fort Gordon eventually settled in Columbia County During the s the schools were integrated largely without incident under the leadership of Superintendent John Pierce Blanchard The unincorporated communities of Martinez formerly Lulaville named after a Cuban doctor and Evans possibly named after Confederate General Clement A Evans became the population centers of the county since they were located nearest to Augusta br During the s and s and demographic shifts Evans gradually became the de facto county seat as the Columbia County Government Center and the Government Complex Addition were built there to serve the growing population in the county s eastern areas Court functions remained in Appling since Georgia state law required that superior court sessions must be held at the county seat and courthouse of each county at least twice a year In the legislature changed the law to allow counties with unincorporated county seats to hold court sessions at annexes or satellite courthouses With the passage of legislation requiring incorporated cities to provide at least three municipal services Appling was not able to maintain its status as an incorporated city There was question as to whether it was ever incorporated Appling was one of inactive cities in Georgia that lost its charter on June Today it is nearly a dead town Following these changes the county proceeded to build an expansive Courthouse Annex in Evans completed in Appling retains its status as de jure county seat but all governmental functions are carried out in Evans br Historic sites in Appling include the Courthouse and Jail the Marshall Monument and various places associated with Kiokee Baptist Church Other sites in the county include Stevens Creek Dam and Canal Locks the birthplace of the comedian Oliver Hardy in Harlem and various cemeteries br br br Geography br According to the U S Census Bureau the county has a total area of square miles km of which square miles km is land and square miles km is water The county is located in the Piedmont region of the state just above the fall line of the eastern United States br The southern three quarters of Columbia County is located in the Middle Savannah River sub basin of the Savannah River basin A very small corner in the northeast of the county west of Clarks Hill is located in the Upper Savannah River sub basin of the larger Savannah River basin The northern portion of Columbia County north of Appling is located in the Little River sub basin of the same Savannah

in the county The county s population went up in the preceding decade br br br Government and politics br Prior to Columbia County was strongly Democratic in presidential elections as a part of the Solid South Starting with the election it began to break away from the Democratic Party as the party became more supportive of civil rights It voted in line with the state as a whole from to but was one of the few counties Ronald Reagan won statewide in Since then it has become a Republican Party stronghold Underlining this Jimmy Carter is the last Democrat to manage even percent of the county s vote br br br Moves toward incorporation br br For more than a decade there have been discussions by county officials to incorporate the county into a city This issue first became moot in when the city of Augusta and Richmond County consolidated their governments A state law mandating three mile buffer zones between cities effectively halted any efforts for Columbia County to incorporate as it was contiguous to Augusta Richmond County br In talks of incorporating the county into a city resurfaced when the Georgia state legislature abolished the three mile buffer zone thus allowing Sandy Springs in North Fulton County contiguous to Atlanta to become a city Columbia County Commission Chairman Ron Cross led a campaign to bring the idea of county incorporation back to life However it was referred to as consolidation since counties in Georgia alone cannot incorporate but can rather consolidate with an existing municipality within the county The plan was to hold a referendum to incorporate the de facto county seat Evans currently a census designated place as a city and then simultaneously consolidate it with Columbia County br The initiative drew strong opposition from officials in Harlem and Grovetown the county s only municipalities citing that it would keep their cities from growing The word consolidation also had an immediate negative connotation with many residents of Columbia County seeing the example of the Augusta Richmond County plagued with unintended consequences A straw poll conducted during the county Republican Party primary election showed strong opposition to the idea countywide The County Commission Chairman Ron Cross has vowed to keep the issue alive but based on the negative sentiment from voters it appears that at least for now the idea of incorporation is back in hibernation br br br Education br Columbia County is served by the Columbia County School District as well as Augusta Christian Schools the Episcopal Day School
