The Muscogee also known as the Mvskoke Muscogee Creek or just Creek and the Muscogee Creek Confederacy pronounced m sk l i in the Muscogee language English m ss KOH ghee are a group of related Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands in the United States Their historical homelands are in what now comprises southern Tennessee much of Alabama western Georgia and parts of northern Florida br Most of the Muscogee people were forcibly removed to Indian Territory now Oklahoma by the federal government in the s during the Trail of Tears A small group of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy remained in Alabama and their descendants formed the federally recognized Poarch Band of Creek Indians Another Muscogee group moved into Florida between roughly and trying to evade European encroachment and intermarried with local tribes to form the Seminole Through ethnogenesis the Seminole emerged with a separate identity from the rest of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy The great majority of Seminole were forcibly relocated to Indian Territory in the late s where their descendants later formed federally recognized tribes Some of the Seminole with the Miccosukee moved south into the Everglades resisting removal These two tribes gained federal recognition in the th century and remain in Florida br The respective languages of all of these modern day branches bands and tribes except one are closely related variants called Muscogee Mvskoke and Hitchiti Mikasuki all of which belong to the Eastern Muskogean branch of the Muscogean language family These languages are mostly mutually intelligible The Yuchi people today are part of the Muscogee Creek Nation but their Yuchi language is a linguistic isolate unrelated to any other language br The ancestors of the Muscogee people were part of the Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere also known as Mississippian cultures Between and CE they built complex cities with earthwork mounds with surrounding networks of satellite towns and farmsteads Muscogee confederated town networks were based on a year old history of complex and well organized farming and town layouts around plazas ballparks and square ceremonial dance grounds br The Muscogee Creek are associated with multi mound centers such as the Ocmulgee Etowah Indian Mounds and Moundville sites Precontact Muscogee societies shared agriculture transcontinental trade craft specialization hunting and religion Early Spanish explorers encountered ancestors of the Muscogee in the mid th century br The Muscogee were the first Native Americans officially considered by the early United States government to be civilized under George Washington s civilization plan In the th century the Muscogee were known as one of the Five Civilized Tribes because they were said to have integrated numerous cultural and technological practices of their more recent European American neighbors br Influenced by Tenskwatawa s interpretations of the comet and the New Madrid earthquakes the Upper Towns of the Muscogee supported by the Shawnee leader Tecumseh actively resisted European American encroachment Internal divisions with the Lower Towns led to the Red Stick War Creek War Begun as a civil war within Muscogee factions it enmeshed the Northern Muscogee bands as British allies in the War of against the United States while the Southern Muscogee remained US allies Once the northern Muscogee Creek rebellion had been put down by General Andrew Jackson with the aid of the Southern Muscogee Creek the Muscogee nation was forced to sign the Treaty of Fort Jackson which ceded acres of land to the US including land belonging to the Southern Muscogee who had fought alongside Jackson The result was a weakening of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy and the forced cession of Muscogee lands to the US br During the s Indian Removal most of the Muscogee Confederacy were forcibly relocated to Indian Territory The Muscogee Creek Nation Alabama Quassarte Tribal Town Kialegee Tribal Town and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town all based in Oklahoma are federally recognized tribes In addition the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana and the Alabama Coushatta Tribe of Texas are federally recognized Formed in part originally by Muscogee refugees the Seminole people today have three federally recognized tribes the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma Seminole Tribe of Florida and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida br br br History br br br Precontact br br At least years ago Native Americans or Paleo Indians lived in what is today the Southern United States Paleo Indians in the Southeast were hunter gatherers who pursued a wide range of animals including megafauna which became extinct following the end of the Pleistocene age During the time known as the Woodland period from BC to AD locals developed pottery and small scale horticulture of the Eastern Agricultural Complex br The Mississippian culture arose as the cultivation of maize from Mesoamerica led to agricultural surpluses and population growth Increased population density gave rise to urban centers and regional chiefdoms Stratified societies developed with hereditary religious and political elites This culture flourished in what is now the Midwestern Eastern and Southeastern United States from to especially along the Mississippi River and its major tributaries br The early historic Muscogee were descendants of the Mississippian culture along the Tennessee River in modern Tennessee Georgia and Alabama They may have been related to the Tama of central Georgia Muscogee oral history describes a migration from places west of the Mississippi River in which they eventually settled on the east bank of the Ocmulgee River Here they waged war against other bands of Native American Indians such as the Savanna Ogeeche Wapoo Santee Yamasee Utina Icofan Patican and others until at length they had overcome them and absorbed some as confederates into their tribe br In the mid th century when explorers from the Spanish made their first forays inland from the shores of the Gulf of Mexico many political centers of the Mississippians were already in decline or abandoned The region is best described as a collection of moderately sized native chiefdoms such as the Coosa chiefdom on the Coosa River interspersed with completely autonomous villages and tribal groups The earliest Spanish explorers encountered villages and chiefdoms of the late Mississippian culture beginning on April with Juan Ponce de Le n s landing in Florida The Lucas V zquez de Ayll n expedition in South Carolina also recorded encounters with these peoples br Muscogee people were gradually influenced by interactions and trade with the Europeans trading or selling deer hides in exchange for European goods such as muskets or alcohol Secondly the Spanish pressed them to identify leaders for negotiations they did not understand government by consensus br br br Spanish expedition br br After Cabeza de Vaca a castaway who survived the ill fated Narv ez expedition returned to Spain in he told the Court that Hernando de Soto had said that America was the richest country in the world Hernando de Soto was a Spanish explorer and conquistador who led the first expedition into the interior of the North American continent De Soto convinced of the riches wanted Cabeza de Vaca to go on the expedition but Cabeza de Vaca declined his offer because of a payment dispute From to de Soto explored through present day Florida and Georgia and then westward into the Alabama and Mississippi area The areas were inhabited by historic Muscogee Native Americans De Soto brought with him a well equipped army He attracted many recruits from a variety of backgrounds who joined his quest for riches in the Americas As the de Soto expedition s brutalities became known to the indigenous peoples they decided to defend their territory Chief Tuskaloosa led his people in the Battle of Mabila where the Native Americans were defeated However the victory came at great cost to the Spanish campaign in loss of supplies casualties and morale The expedition never fully recovered br br br Rise of the Muscogee Confederacy br br Because of endemic infectious diseases carried unknowingly by the Europeans but new to the Muscogee the Spanish expedition resulted in epidemics of smallpox and measles and a high rate of fatalities among the indigenous peoples These losses were exacerbated by the Indian slave trade that colonists conducted in the Southeast during the th and th centuries As the survivors and descendants regrouped the Muscogee Creek Confederacy arose as a loose alliance of Muskogee speaking peoples br The Muscogee lived in autonomous villages in river valleys throughout present day Tennessee Georgia and Alabama speaking several related Muskogean languages Muskogee was spoken from the Chattahoochee to the Alabama River Koasati Coushatta and Alibamu were spoken in the upper Alabama River basin and along parts of the Tennessee River Hitchiti was spoken in several towns along the Chattahoochee River and across much of present day Georgia The Muscogee were a confederacy of tribes consisting of Yuchi Koasati Alabama Coosa Tuskegee Coweta Cusseta Chehaw Chiaha Hitchiti Tuckabatchee Oakfuskee and many others br The basic social unit was the town idalwa Abihka Coosa Tuckabutche and Coweta are the four mother towns of the Muscogee Confederacy Traditionally the Cusseta and Coweta bands are considered the earliest members of the Muscogee Nation The Lower Towns along the Chattahoochee River before and after and farther east along the Ocmulgee Oconee and Savannah River rivers between and were Coweta Cusseta Kasihta Koloni Tuskegee Chiaha Hitchiti Oconee Ocmulgee Apalachicola and Sawokli br br The Upper Towns located on the Coosa Tallapoosa and Alabama rivers were Tuckabatchee Abhika Coosa Kusa the dominant people of East Tennessee and North Georgia during the Spanish explorations Itawa original inhabitants of the Etowah Indian Mounds Hothliwahi Ullibahali Hilibi Eufaula Wakokai Atasi Alibamu Coushatta Koasati they had absorbed the Kaski Casqui and the Tali and Tuskegee Napochi in the de Luna chronicles br The most important leader in Muscogee society was the mico or village chief Micos led warriors in battle and represented their villages but held authority only insofar as they could persuade others to agree with their decisions Micos ruled with the assistance of micalgi or lesser chiefs and various advisers including a second in charge called the heniha respected village elders medicine men and a tustunnuggee or ranking warrior the principal military adviser The heles hayv or medicine maker officiated at various rituals including providing black drink used in purification ceremonies br The most important social unit was the clan Clans organized hunts distributed lands arranged marriages and punished lawbreakers The authority of the micos was complemented by the clan mothers mostly women elders The Muscogee had a matrilineal kinship system with children considered born into their mother s clan and inheritance was through the maternal line The Wind Clan is the first of the clans The majority of micos have belonged to this clan br br br British French and Spanish expansion br br Britain France and Spain all established colonies in the present day Southeastern woodlands Spain established Jesuit missions and related settlements to influence Native Americans The British and the French opted for trade over conversion In the th century Franciscan friars in Spanish Florida built missions along Apalachee Bay In English colonists from Barbados founded Charles Town modern day Charleston the capital of the new colony of Carolina Traders from Carolina went to Muscogee settlements to exchange firearms gunpowder axes glass beads cloth and West Indian rum for white tailed deer pelts as part of the deerskin trade and Indian slaves The Spanish and their mission Indians burned most of the towns along the Chattahoochee after they welcomed Scottish explorer Henry Woodward in In English colonists built a trading post on the Ocmulgee River known as Ochese hatchee creek where a dozen towns relocated to escape the Spanish and acquire English goods The name Creek most likely derived from a shortening of Ocheese Creek the Hitchiti name for the body of water known today as the Ocmulgee River and broadly applies to all of the Muscogee Confederacy including the Yuchi and Natchez br In Irish colonial administrator James Moore led the Carolina militia and Ochese Creek and Yamasee warriors on a series of raids against Spanish missions in the Florida interior during Queen Anne s War These raids captured thousands of Spanish allied Indians primarily Apalachee who were sold into slavery in Carolina and the West Indies A decade later tensions between colonists and Indians in the American Southwest led to the Yamassee War of br br The Ochese Creeks joined the Yamasee burning trading posts and raiding back country settlers but the revolt ran low on gunpowder and was put down by Carolinian militia and their Cherokee allies The Yamasee took refuge in Spanish Florida the Ochese Creeks fled west to the Chattahoochee French Canadian explorers founded Mobile as the first capital of Louisiana in and took advantage of the war to build Fort Toulouse at the confluence of the Tallapoosa and Coosa in trading with the Alabama and Coushatta Fearing they would come under French influence the British reopened the deerskin trade with the Lower Creeks antagonizing the Yamasee now allies of Spain The French instigated the Upper Creeks to raid the Lower Creeks In May the shrewd Emperor Brim mico of the powerful Coweta band invited representatives of Britain France and Spain to his village and in council with Upper and Lower Creek leaders declared a policy of Muscogee neutrality in their colonial rivalry That year the Spaniards built the presidio of San Marcos de Apalache on Apalachee Bay In the British built Fort King George at the mouth of the Altamaha River As the three European colonial powers established themselves along the borders of Muscogee lands the latter s strategy of neutrality allowed them to hold the balance of power br br The colony of Georgia was created in its first settlement Savannah was founded the following year on a river bluff where the Yamacraw a Yamasee band that remained allies of Britain allowed John Musgrove to establish a fur trading post His wife Mary Musgrove was the daughter of an English trader and a Muscogee woman from the powerful Wind Clan half sister of Emperor Brim She was the principal interpreter for Georgia s founder and first Governor Gen James Oglethorpe using her connections to foster peace between the Creek Indians and the new colony In Georgia constructed Fort Okfuskee near Oakfuskee to compete with French trade with the Creeks at Fort Toulouse The deerskin trade grew and by the s Savannah exported up to deerskins a year br In Spanish and British officials established a neutral zone from the Altamaha to the St Johns River in present day Florida guaranteeing Native hunting grounds for the deerskin trade and protecting Spanish Florida from further British encroachment Ca a group of Ochese moved to the neutral zone after clashing with the Muskogee speaking towns of the Chattahoochee where they had fled after the Yamasee War br Led by Chief Secoffee Cowkeeper they became the center of a new tribal confederacy the Seminole which grew to include earlier refugees from the Yamasee War remnants of the mission Indians and escaped African slaves Their name comes from the Spanish word cimarrones which originally referred to a domestic animal that had reverted to the wild Cimarrones was used by the Spanish and Portuguese to refer to fugitive slaves maroon emerges linguistically from this root as well and American Indians who fled the Europeans In the Hitchiti language which lacked an r sound it became simanoli and eventually Seminole br br br Intermarriage br Many Muscogee Creek leaders due to intermarriage have British names Alexander McGillivray Josiah Francis William McIntosh Peter McQueen William Weatherford William Perryman and others These reflect Muscogee women having children with British colonists For instance Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins married a Muscogee woman In Muscogee culture unmarried Muscogee women had great freedom over their own sexuality compared to European and European American counterparts Under the customs of Muscogee matrilineal society their children belonged to their mother s clan With the exception of McGillivray mixed raced Muscogee people worked against Muscogee Creek interests as they understood them to the contrary in many cases they spearheaded resistance to settler encroachment on Muscogee Creek lands That they usually spoke English as well as Mvskoke and knew European customs as well made them community leaders they dominated Muskogee politics n As put by Claudio Saunt br br These offspring of mixed marriages occupied a different position in the economy of the Deep South than did most Creeks and Seminoles They worked as traders and factors By virtue of their ancestry and upbringing they had greater cultural social linguistic and geographic ties to the colonial settlements traveling periodically to Pensacola and the Georgia trading posts to unload their skins and pick up more trade goods br As Andrew Frank writes Terms such as mixed blood and half breed which imply racial categories and partial Indianness betray the ways in which Native peoples determined kinship and identity in the eighteenth and early nineteen century southeast br br br American Revolutionary War br With the end of the French and Indian War also known as the Seven Years War in France lost its North American empire and British American settlers moved inland Indian discontent led to raids against back country settlers and the perception that the royal government favored the Indians and the deerskin trade led many back country white settlers to join the Sons of Liberty Fears of land hungry settlers and need for European manufactured goods led the Muscogee to side with the British but like many tribes they were divided by factionalism and in general avoided sustained fighting preferring to protect their sovereignty through cautious participation br During the American Revolution the Upper Creeks sided with the British fighting alongside the Chickamauga Lower Cherokee warriors of Dragging Canoe in the Cherokee American wars against white settlers in present day Tennessee This alliance was orchestrated by the Coushatta chief Alexander McGillivray son of Lachlan McGillivray a wealthy Scottish Loyalist fur trader and planter whose properties were confiscated by Georgia His ex partner Scots Irish Patriot George Galphin initially persuaded the Lower Creeks to remain neutral but Loyalist Capt William McIntosh led a group of pro British Hitchiti and most of the Lower Creeks nominally allied with Britain after the Capture of Savannah Muscogee warriors fought on behalf of Britain during the Mobile and Pensacola campaigns of where Spain re conquered British West Florida Loyalist leader Thomas Brown raised a division of King s Rangers to contest Patriot control over the Georgia and Carolina interior and instigated Cherokee raids against the North Carolina back country after the Battle of King s Mountain He seized Augusta in March with the aid of an Upper Creek war party but reinforcements from the Lower Creeks and local white Loyalists never came and Georgia militia led by Elijah Clarke retook Augusta in The next year an Upper Creek war party trying to relieve the British garrison at Savannah was routed by Continental Army troops under Gen Mad Anthony Wayne br After the war ended in the Muscogee learned that Britain had ceded their lands to the now independent United States That year two Lower Creek chiefs Hopoithle Miko Tame King and Eneah Miko Fat King ceded square miles km of land to the state of Georgia Alexander McGillivray led pan Indian resistance to white encroachment receiving arms from the Spanish in Florida to fight trespassers The bilingual and bicultural McGillivray worked to create a sense of Muscogee nationalism and centralize political authority struggling against village leaders who individually sold land to the United States He also became a wealthy landowner and merchant owning as many as sixty black slaves br In he negotiated the Treaty of Pensacola with Spain recognizing Muscogee control over acres km of land claimed by Georgia and guaranteeing access to the British firm Panton Leslie Co which controlled the deerskin trade while making himself an official representative of Spain In a council in Tuckabatchee decided to wage war against white settlers on Muscogee lands War parties attacked settlers along the Oconee River and Georgia mobilized its militia McGillivray refused to negotiate with the state that had confiscated his father s plantations but President George Washington sent a special emissary Col Marinus Willet who persuaded him to travel to New York City then the capital of the U S and deal directly with the federal government In the summer of McGillivray and other Muscogee chiefs signed the Treaty of New York on behalf of the Upper Middle and Lower Creek and Seminole composing the Creek nation of Indians ceding a large portion of their lands to the federal government and promising to return fugitive slaves in return for federal recognition of Muscogee sovereignty and promises to evict white settlers McGillivray died in and with the invention of the cotton gin white settlers on the Southwestern frontier who hoped to become cotton planters clamored for Indian lands In Elijah Clarke and several hundred followers defied the Treaty of New York and established the short lived Trans Oconee Republic br br br Muscogee and Choctaw land dispute br In the Muscogee and Choctaw were in conflict over land near the Noxubee River The two nations agreed to settle the dispute by ball play With nearly players and bystanders the two nations prepared for nearly three months After a day long struggle the Muscogee won the game A fight broke out and the two nations fought until sundown with nearly dead and many more wounded br br br State of Muskogee and William Bowles br br William Augustus Bowles was born into a wealthy Maryland Tory family enlisting with the Maryland Loyalists Battalion at age and becoming an ensign in the Royal Navy by age Cashiered for dereliction of duty after returning too late to his ship at Pensacola Bowles escaped north and found refuge among the Lower Creek towns of the Chattahoochee basin He married two wives one Cherokee and the other a daughter of the Hitchiti Muscogee chieftain William Perryman and later used this union as the basis for his claim to exert political influence among the Creeks In a year old Bowles led Muscogee forces at the Battle of Pensacola After seeking refuge in the Bahamas he travelled to London He was received by King George III as Chief of the Embassy for Creek and Cherokee Nations it was with British backing that he returned to train the Muscogee as pirates to attack Spanish ships br In Bowles formed the State of Muskogee with the support of the Chattahoochee Creeks and the Seminoles He established his capital at Miccosuki a village on the shores of Lake Miccosukee near present day Tallahassee It was ruled by Mico Kanache his father in law and strongest ally Bowles envisioned the State of Muskogee with its capital at Miccosuki encompassing large portions of present day Florida Alabama Georgia North Carolina and Tennessee and incorporating the Cherokee Upper and Lower Creeks Chickasaw and Choctaw Bowles first act was declaring the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso which drew the boundary between the U S and West Florida null and void because the Indians were not consulted br He denounced the treaties Alexander McGillivray had negotiated with Spain and the U S threatening to declare war on the United States unless it returned Muscogee lands and issuing a death sentence against George Washington s Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins who won the loyalty of the Lower Creeks He built a tiny navy and raided Spanish ships in the Gulf of Mexico and in declared war on Spain briefly capturing the presidio and trading post of San Marcos de Apalache before being forced to retreat Although a Spanish force that set out to destroy Mikosuki got lost in the swamps a second attempt to take San Marcos ended in disaster After a European armistice led to the loss of British support Bowles was discredited The Seminole signed a peace treaty with Spain The following year he was betrayed by Lower Creek supporters of Hawkins at a tribal council They turned Bowles over to the Spanish and he died in prison in Havana Cuba two years later br br br Pre removal late th early th centuries br br George Washington the first U S president and Henry Knox the first U S Secretary of War proposed a cultural transformation of the Native Americans Washington believed that Native Americans were equals as individuals but that their society was inferior He formulated a policy to encourage the civilizing process and it was continued under President Thomas Jefferson Noted historian Robert Remini wrote T hey presumed that once the Indians adopted the practice of private property built homes farmed educated their children and embraced Christianity these Native Americans would win acceptance from white Americans Washington s six point plan included impartial justice toward Indians regulated buying of Indian lands promotion of commerce promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Indian society presidential authority to give presents and punishing those who violated Indian rights The Muscogee would be the first Native Americans to be civilized under Washington s six point plan Communities within the Cherokee Chickasaw Choctaw and Seminole tribes followed Muscogee efforts to implement Washington s new policy of civilization br In Washington appointed Benjamin Hawkins as General Superintendent of Indian Affairs dealing with all tribes south of the Ohio River He personally assumed the role of principal agent to the Muscogee He moved to the area that is now Crawford County in Georgia He began to teach agricultural practices to the tribe starting a farm at his home on the Flint River In time he brought in slaves and workers cleared several hundred acres and established mills and a trading post as well as his farm br For years Hawkins met with chiefs on his porch to discuss matters He was responsible for the longest period of peace between the settlers and the tribe overseeing years of peace In the Lower Creeks ceded their lands east of the Ocmulgee to Georgia with the exception of the sacred burial mounds of the Ocmulgee Old Fields They allowed a Federal Road linking New Orleans to Washington D C to be built through their territory A number of Muscogee chiefs acquired slaves and created cotton plantations grist mills and businesses along the Federal Road In Fort Benjamin Hawkins was built on a hill overlooking the Ocmulgee Old Fields to protect expanding settlements and serve as a reminder of U S rule br Hawkins was disheartened and shocked by the outbreak of the Creek War which destroyed his life work of improving the Muscogee quality of life Hawkins saw much of his work toward building a peace destroyed in A faction of Muscogee joined the Pan American Indian movement of Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh rejecting accommodation with white settlers and adaptation of European American culture Although Hawkins personally was never attacked he was forced to watch an internal civil war among the Muscogee develop into a war with the United States br br br A comet earthquakes and Tecumseh br br A comet appeared in March The Shawnee leader Tecumseh whose name meant shooting star br traveled to Tuckabatchee where he told the Muscogee that the comet signaled his coming McKenney reported that Tecumseh would prove that the Great Spirit had sent him by giving the Muscogee a sign Shortly after Tecumseh left the Southeast the sign arrived as promised in the form of an earthquake br On December the New Madrid earthquake shook the Muscogee lands and the Midwest While the interpretation of this event varied from tribe to tribe one consensus was universally accepted the powerful earthquake had to have meant something The earthquake and its aftershocks helped the Tecumseh resistance movement by convincing not only the Muscogee but other Native American tribes as well that the Shawnee must be supported br br The Indians were filled with great terror the trees and wigwams shook exceedingly the ice which skirted the margin of the Arkansas river was broken into pieces and most of the Indians thought that the Great Spirit angry with the human race was about to destroy the world br The Muscogee who joined Tecumseh s confederation were known as the Red Sticks Stories of the origin of the Red Stick name varies but one is that they were named for the Muscogee tradition of carrying a bundle of sticks that mark the days until an event occurs Sticks painted red symbolize war br br br Red Stick rebellion br br The Creek War of also known as the Red Stick War began as a civil war within the Muscogee Nation only to become enmeshed within the War of Inspired by the Shawnee leader Tecumseh to whom th century writers attributed fiery speeches that he must have said and their own religious leaders and encouraged by British traders Red Stick leaders such as William Weatherford Red Eagle Peter McQueen and Menawa won the support of the Upper Creek towns Allied with the British they opposed white encroachment on Muscogee lands and the civilizing programs administered by Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins and clashed with many of the leading chiefs of the Muscogee Nation most notably the Lower Creek Mico William McIntosh Hawkins most powerful ally Before the Muscogee Civil War began the Red Sticks attempted to keep their activities secret from the old chiefs of the Creek national government They were emboldened when Tecumseh rallied his followers and joined with a British invasion to capture Fort Detroit in August br In February a small party of Red Sticks led by Little Warrior was returning from Detroit when they killed two families of settlers along the Duck River near Nashville Hawkins demanded that the Muscogees turn over Little Warrior and his six companions Instead of handing the marauders over to the federal agents Big Warrior and the old chiefs decided to execute the war party This decision was the spark which ignited the civil war among the Muscogee br The first clashes between Red Sticks and the American whites took place on July when a group of American soldiers from Fort Mims north of Mobile Alabama stopped a party of Red Sticks who were returning from West Florida where they had bought munitions from the Spanish governor at Pensacola The Red Sticks fled the scene and the U S soldiers looted what they found allowing the Red Sticks to regroup and retaliate with a surprise attack that forced the Americans to retreat The Battle of Burnt Corn as the exchange became known broadened the Creek Civil War to include American forces and was interpreted as a good omen showing that in fact the Creeks could defeat the whites br On August Red Sticks led by Red Eagle William Weatherford attacked Fort Mims where white settlers and their Indian allies had gathered The Red Sticks captured the fort by surprise and carried out a massacre killing men women and children They spared only the black slaves whom they took as captured booty After the Indians killed nearly at the fort settlers across the American southwestern frontier were in a panic Although the Red Sticks won the battle they had lost the war br br On the morning of August few of Fort Mims defenders stirred in the steaming heat In the forested shade the Creeks watched and waited The fort s main gate located on the east side of the stockade had not been closed by the garrison troops No sentries occupied the blockhouse br The Fort Mims Massacre was followed two days later by the smaller Kimbell James Massacre br The only explanation of this catastrophic event is that the Upper Creek leaders thought that fighting the United States was like fighting another Creek tribe and taking Fort Mims was an even bigger victory than the Battle of Burnt Corn had been br The Red Stick victory spread panic throughout the southeastern United States and the cry Remember Fort Mims was popular among the public wanting revenge With Federal troops tied up on the northern front against the British in Canada the Tennessee Georgia and the Mississippi Territory militias were commissioned and invaded the Upper Creek towns They were joined by Indian allies the Lower Creek under William McIntosh and the Cherokee under Major Ridge Outnumbered and poorly armed much too far from Canada or the Gulf Coast to receive British aid the Red Sticks put up a desperate fight On March General Andrew Jackson s Tennessee militia aided by the th U S Infantry Regiment and Cherokee and Lower Creek warriors crushed the Red Sticks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend on the Tallapoosa River Though the Red Sticks had been soundly defeated and about Upper Muscogee died in the war the remnants held out several months longer br br br Muscogee diaspora br br In August the Red Sticks surrendered to Jackson at Wetumpka near the present city of Montgomery Alabama On August the Muscogee nation was forced to sign the Treaty of Fort Jackson It ended the war and required the tribe to cede some million acres km of land more than half of their ancestral territorial holdings to the United States Even those who had fought alongside Jackson were compelled to cede land since Jackson held them responsible for allowing the Red Sticks to revolt The state of Alabama was created largely from the Red Sticks domain and was admitted to the United States in br br WHEREAS an unprovoked inhuman and sanguinary war waged by the hostile Creeks against the United States hath been repelled prosecuted and determined successfully on the part of the said States in conformity with principles of national justice and honorable warfare And whereas consideration is due to the rectitude of proceeding dictated by instructions relating to the re establishment of peace Be it remembered that prior to the conquest of that part of the Creek nation hostile to the United States numberless aggressions had been committed against the peace the property and the lives of citizens of the United States br Many Muscogee refused to surrender and escaped to Florida They allied with other remnant tribes becoming the Seminole Muscogee were later involved on both sides of the Seminole Wars in Florida br br br Seminole War br The Red Stick refugees who arrived in Florida after the Creek War tripled the Seminole population and strengthened the tribe s Muscogee characteristics In British forces landed in West Florida and began arming the Seminoles The British had built a strong fort on the Apalachicola River at Prospect Bluff and in after the end of the War of offered it with all its ordnance muskets cannons powder shot cannonballs to the locals Seminoles and maroons escaped slaves A few hundred maroons constituted a uniformed Corps of Colonial Marines who had had military training however rudimentary and discipline but whose English officers had departed The Seminole only wanted to return to their villages so the maroons became owners of the Fort It soon came to be called the Negro Fort by Southern planters and it was widely known among enslaved blacks by word of mouth a place nearby where blacks were free and had guns as in Haiti The white pro slave holding planters correctly felt its simple existence inspired escape or rebellion by the oppressed African Americans and they complained to the US government The maroons had not received training in how to aim the Fort s cannons After notifying the Spanish governor who had very limited resources and who said he had no orders to take action U S General Andrew Jackson quickly destroyed the Fort in a famous and picturesque though tragic incident in that has been called the deadliest cannon shot in American history see Battle of Negro Fort br The Seminole continued to welcome fugitive black slaves and raid American settlers leading the U S to declare war in The following year General Andrew Jackson invaded Florida with an army that included more than Lower Creek warriors they destroyed Seminole towns and captured Pensacola Jackson s victory forced Spain to sign the Adams On s Treaty in ceding Florida to the U S In a delegation of Seminole chiefs met with the new U S governor of Florida expressing their opposition to proposals that would reunite them with the Upper and Lower Creek partly because the latter tribes intended to enslave the Black Seminoles Instead the Seminoles agreed to move onto a reservation in inland central Florida br br br Treaties of Indian Springs br br Mico William McIntosh led the Lower Creek warriors who fought alongside the U S in the Creek War and the First Seminole War The son of the Loyalist officer of the same name who had recruited a band of Hitchiti to the British cause McIntosh never knew his white father He had family ties to some of Georgia s planter elite and after the wars became a wealthy cotton planter Through his mother he was born into the prominent Wind Clan of the Creek as the Creek had a matrilineal system of descent and inheritance he achieved his chieftainship because of her He was also related to Alexander McGillivray and William Weatherford both mixed race Creek br In the late s and early s McIntosh helped create a centralized police force called Law Menders establish written laws and form a National Creek Council Later in the decade he came to view relocation as inevitable In McIntosh and several other chiefs including Chief Shelocta signed away Lower Creek lands east of the Flint River at the first Treaty of Indian Springs As a reward McIntosh was granted acres km at the treaty site where he built a hotel to attract tourists to local hot springs br The Creek National Council responded by prescribing the death penalty for tribesmen who surrendered additional land Georgian settlers continued to pour into Indian lands particularly after the discovery of gold in northern Georgia in McIntosh and his first cousin Georgia Governor George Troup a leading advocate of Indian removal signed the second Treaty of Indian Springs at his hotel Signed by six other Lower Creek chiefs the treaty ceded the last Lower Creek lands to Georgia and allocated substantial sums to relocate the Muscogee to the Arkansas River It provided for an equally large payment directly to McIntosh br In April the old Red Stick Menawa led about Law Menders to execute McIntosh according to their law They burned his upper Chattahoochee plantation A delegation of the Creek National Council led by the speaker Opothleyahola traveled to Washington D C to protest the treaty They convinced President John Quincy Adams that the treaty was invalid and negotiated the more favorable Treaty of Washington The tribe ceded their lands to Georgia in return for although they were not required to move west Troup ignored the new treaty and ordered the eviction of the Muscogee from their remaining lands in Georgia without compensation mobilizing state militia when Adams threatened federal intervention br br br Removal br In the aftermath of the Treaty of Fort Jackson and the Treaty of Washington the Muscogee were confined to a small strip of land in present day east central Alabama br Andrew Jackson was inaugurated president of the United States in and with his inauguration the government stance toward Indians turned harsher Jackson abandoned the policy of his predecessors of treating different Indian groups as separate nations Instead he aggressively pursued plans to move all Indian tribes living east of the Mississippi River to Oklahoma br br Friends and Brothers By permission of the Great Spirit above and the voice of the people I have been made President of the United States and now speak to you as your Father and friend and request you to listen Your warriors have known me long You know I love my white and red children and always speak with a straight and not with a forked tongue that I have always told you the truth Where you now are you and my white children are too near to each other to live in harmony and peace Your game is destroyed and many of your people will not work and till the earth Beyond the great River Mississippi where a part of your nation has gone your Father has provided a country large enough for all of you and he advises you to remove to it There your white brothers will not trouble you they will have no claim to the land and you can live upon it you and all your children as long as the grass grows or the water runs in peace and plenty It will be yours forever For the improvements in the country where you now live and for all the stock which you cannot take with you your Father will pay you a fair price br At Jackson s request the United States Congress opened a fierce debate on an Indian Removal Bill In the end the bill passed but the vote was close The Senate passed the measure to while in the House it squeaked by to Jackson signed the legislation into law June br Following the Indian Removal Act in the Creek National Council signed the Treaty of Cusseta ceding their remaining lands east of the Mississippi to the U S and accepting relocation to the Indian Territory Most Muscogee were removed to Indian Territory during the Trail of Tears in with additional removals following the Creek War of although some remained behind br br By when extensive Creek removal was underway Eneah Emathala emerged as leader of the Lower Creeks their desire was only to be left alone in their homeland Gen Winfield Scott was ordered to capture Eneah Emathala Captured with Emathala were some one thousand other person their racial colors were black red and white br br br American Civil War br br At the outbreak of the American Civil War Opothleyahola refused to form an alliance with the Confederacy unlike many other tribes including many of the Lower Creeks Runaway slaves free blacks Chickasaw and Seminole Indians began gathering at Opothleyahola s plantation where they hoped to remain neutral in the conflict between the North and South On August Opothleyahola and tribal chief Micco Hutko contacted President Abraham Lincoln to request help for the Union loyalists On September they received a positive response stating the United States government would assist them The letter directed Opothleyahola to move his people to Fort Row in Wilson County Kansas where they would receive asylum and aid They became known as Loyalists and many were members of the traditional Snake band in the latter part of the century br Because many Muscogee Creek people did support the Confederacy during the Civil War the US government required a new treaty with the nation in to define peace after the war It required the Creek to emancipate their slaves and to admit them as full members and citizens of the Creek Nation equal to the Creek in receiving annuities and land benefits They were then known as Creek Freedmen The US government required setting aside part of the Creek reservation land to be assigned to the freedmen Many of the tribe resisted these changes The loss of lands contributed to problems for the nation in the late th century br The Loyalists among the Creek tended to be traditionalists They formed the core of a band that became known as the Snakes which also included many Creek Freedmen At the end of the century they resisted the extinguishing of tribal government and break up of communal tribal lands enacted by the US Congress with the Dawes Commission of These efforts were part of the US government s attempt to impose assimilation on the tribes to introduce household ownership of land and to remove legal barriers to the Indian Territory s achieving statehood Members of the Creek Nation were registered as individuals on the Dawes Rolls the Commission separately registered intermarried whites and Creek Freedmen whether or not they had any Creek ancestry This ruined their claims to Creek membership later even for people who had parents or other relative who were Creek The Dawes Rolls have been used as the basis for many tribes to establish membership descent European American settlers had moved into the area and pressed for statehood and access to some of the tribal lands for settlement br br br Today br Some Muscogee in Alabama live near the federally recognized Poarch Creek Reservation in Atmore northeast of Mobile and Muscogee live in essentially undocumented ethnic towns in Florida The Alabama reservation includes a casino and story hotel The Creek tribe holds an annual powwow on Thanksgiving Additionally Muscogee descendants of varying degrees of acculturation live throughout the southeastern United States br br br Culture br br Muscogee culture has greatly evolved over the centuries combining mostly European American influences however interaction with Spain France and England greatly shaped it as well They were known for their rapid incorporation of modernity developing a written language transitioning to yeoman farming methods and accepting European Americans and African Americans into their society Muscogee people continue to preserve chaya and share a vibrant tribal identity through events such as annual festivals stickball games and language classes The Stomp Dance and Green Corn Ceremony are revered gatherings and rituals br br br Clans br While families include people who are directly related to each other clans are composed of all people who are descendants of the same ancestral clan grouping Like many Native American nations the Muscogee Creek are matrilineal each person belongs to the clan of their mother who belongs to the clan of her mother Inheritance and property are passed through the maternal line Hereditary chiefs were born into certain clans br Biological fathers are important within the family system but must come from another clan than the mother But within the clan it is the mother s brother the mother s nearest blood relation who functions as the primary teacher protector disciplinarian and role model for children especially for boys Clan members do not claim blood relation but consider each other as family due to their membership in the same clan This is expressed by their using the same kinship titles for both family and clan relations For example clan members of approximately the same age consider each other brother and sister even if they have never met before br Because of this system the Muscogee Creek children born of European fathers belonged to their mother s clans and were part of their tribal communities High ranking daughters of chiefs often found it advantageous to marry European traders who could provide their families with goods Muscogee Creek believed young men who became educated in European ways could help them manage under the new conditions related to colonialism while preserving important Muscogee Creek cultural institutions br Muscogee clans are as follows br br br Clothing br Ancestral Muscogee peoples wore clothing made of woven plant materials or animal hides depending upon the climate During the summer they preferred lightweight fabrics woven from tree bark grasses or reeds During the harsh winters they used animal skins and fur for warmth br During the th century the Muscogee adopted some elements of European fashion and materials As cloth was lighter and more colorful than deer hide it quickly became a popular trade item throughout the region Trade cloth in a variety of patterns and textures enabled Muscogee women to develop new styles of clothing which they made for both men women and children They incorporated European trade items such as bells silk ribbons glass beads and pieces of mirror into the clothing br br br Language br br The Muscogee language is a member of the Muskogean family and was well known among the frontiersmen such as Gideon Lincecum of the early th century The language is related to the Choctaw language with some words being identical in pronunciation The following table is an example of Muscogee text and its translation br br br Treaties br br Land was the most valuable asset which the Native Americans held in collective stewardship The southern English colonies US government and settlers systematically obtained Muscogee land through treaties legislation and warfare Some treaties such as the Treaty of San Lorenzo indirectly affected the Muscogee The treaties were br br br Indian Appropriations Act of br In Congress added a rider to the Indian Appropriations Act to end the United States recognizing additional Indian tribes or nations and prohibiting additional treaties br br That hereafter no Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation tribe or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty Provided further that nothing herein contained shall be construed to invalidate or impair the obligation of any treaty heretofore lawfully made and ratified with any such Indian nation or tribe br br br Population history br Early estimates of the Creek probably did not cover the whole nation but just parts of the population James Seagrove an ambassador for the US to the Creek Nation and merchant who lived in southern Georgia estimated Creek population in year at warriors and therefore around people Around the same time Henry Knox wrote that the Creek lived in at least towns and villages Census
