Abortion in Georgia is legal up to the detection of embryonic cardiac cell activity which typically begins in the th or th week after the onset of the last menstrual period LMP two to three weeks after implantation when many women are not yet aware that they are pregnant br This law came into force on July almost a month after the U S Supreme Court s Dobbs v Jackson Women s Health Organization No U S ruling In mandatory ultrasound requirements were passed by state legislators Georgia has continually sought to legislate against abortion at a state level since The most recent example s HB sought to make abortion illegal as soon as embryonic cardiac cell activity can be detected in most cases that is around the six week mark of a pregnancy An injunction was issued against this bill by a federal judge who ruled that it contravened the Supreme Court s ruling A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in found that of Georgians believed abortions should be illegal in all or most cases vs legal in all or most cases br The number of abortion clinics has been on the decline for many years going from in to in and further falling to in Due to tight restrictions in neighboring states as well as cost issues thousands of women come from out of state to have abortions in Georgia There were legal abortions in and in of all abortions carried out in were for out of state residents There is an active abortion rights movement in the state This received a surge in donations following the passing of the state s controversial bill Women from the state participated in marches supporting abortion rights as part of a StoptheBans movement in May On July this six week abortion ban became law instituting the current ban after the detection of embryonic cardiac cell activity br Abortions after the fifth or sixth week of pregnancy are decriminalized in the Georgia cities of Atlanta and Savannah br br br History br Thousands of women came from out of state in to get abortions in North Carolina and Georgia of all abortions in Georgia that year were for out of state residents while of all abortions performed in North Carolina were performed for out of state residents This contrasted to neighboring South Carolina where only of abortions performed in the state involved out of state residents br br In the late s and early s Arkansas Colorado Georgia Maryland New Mexico North Carolina and Oregon made reforms to their abortion laws with most of these states providing more detailed medical guidance on when therapeutic abortions could be performed In the American Law Institute published their model penal code as it applied to abortions with three circumstances where they believed a physician could justifiably perform an abortion If there is substantial risk that the continuance of the pregnancy would gravely impair the physical or mental health of the mother or that the child would be born with grave physical or mental defect or that the pregnancy resulted from rape incest or other felonious intercourse In Georgia implemented a version of this but created an exception where they did not allow abortion in the case of incest br The state passed a law in the s banning abortions at weeks because they alleged that fetuses can feel pain The state was one of states in to have a detailed abortion specific informed consent requirement Georgia Michigan Arkansas and Idaho all required that women must be provided the option by an abortion clinic to view an image of their fetus if an ultrasound is used prior to the abortion taking place Informed consent materials about fetal pain at weeks in Arkansas Georgia and Oklahoma say the unborn child has the physical structures necessary to experience pain The Journal of the American Medical Association has concluded that pain sensors do not develop in the fetus until between weeks and Georgia and Wisconsin were two of the only states with written informed consent materials referring women to crisis pregnancy centers which acknowledged these centers did not support or provide women with abortion related services br In the state was one of six where the legislature introduced a bill that would have banned abortion in almost all cases It did not pass This was repeated in where the state was one of three to unsuccessfully try to ban abortion br The law as of March required that women wait hours after their initial appointment for an abortion before they could have a second appointment for the actual procedure This could be waived in case of medical emergency allowing a woman to receive mandatory counseling over the phone or via a website State law at the time prohibited health insurance companies on public exchanges from offering abortion services unless the life of the woman was at risk br Georgia had an approximately six week abortion ban slated to go into effect in which would have made it illegal to obtain an abortion in the state once embryonic cardiac cell electrical activity could be detected The law made no exception for cases of rape or incest and mandated a penalty in prison for doctors who perform the procedure but noted specifically that this was not referring to the women who get this procedure done Rep Ed Setzler introduced that law HB in the Georgia House of Representatives on February During his campaign for Governor Brian Kemp now the Governor of Georgia vow ed to sign the toughest abortion laws in the country and when asked about litigation said bring it I ll fight for life at the Capitol and in the courtroom After being passed in the House on March HB was passed out of a Senate committee on March It was subsequently passed by the entire state Senate after which it was narrowly passed by the House The bill was signed by Governor Kemp on May Georgia was one of several states passing similar bills in April and May alongside Missouri Louisiana and Alabama Many women do not yet know that they are pregnant at weeks since the woman s last menstrual period br In June the Atlanta City Council passed a resolution to decriminalize abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy br In an audio from a campaign stop in Blakely on October Governor Brian Kemp said he liked the idea of a statewide ban on the destruction of embryos regardless of the reason or the health risk to the mother br Following the overturn of Roe v Wade in the United States maternal and infant mortality rate rose for the first time in years More than states saw at least slight rises in infant mortality rates in but four had statistically significant increases Georgia Iowa Missouri and Texas br br br Judicial history br The US Supreme Court s decision in s Roe v Wade ruling meant the state could no longer regulate abortion in the first trimester However the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in Dobbs v Jackson Women s Health Organization No U S later in In the US Supreme Court also ruled in a case named Doe v Bolton The ruling invalidated the law in Georgia that said a woman needed to seek and attain permission from three physicians before she could have an abortion performed on her The Court said Georgia s law put too many restrictions on women seeking to get abortions making it unconstitutional br br After HB was passed in May the American Civil Liberties Union Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights sued the state and sought an injunction against enforcement of the ban before it would go into effect in January The case was heard in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under Judge Steve C Jones Jones ruled in favor of the injunction to block enforcement in his decision in October stating By banning pre viability abortions H B violates the constitutional right to privacy which in turn inflicts per se irreparable harm on Plaintiffs br The Georgia Supreme Court on November reinstated the state s ban on abortions after approximately weeks of gestation weeks of pregnancy The limit is when embryonic cardiac cell activity is detected via ultrasound On October considering a challenge to the ban the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the ban and sent the case back to Fulton County Superior Court br br br Statistics br In the period between and the state had an illegal abortion mortality rate per million women aged of between and In women in the state faced
