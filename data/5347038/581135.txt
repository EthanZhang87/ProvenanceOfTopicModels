title: History of Georgia (U.S. state)
id: 581135
The history of Georgia in the United States of America spans pre Columbian time to the present day U S state of Georgia The area was inhabited by Native American tribes for thousands of years A modest Spanish presence was established in the late th century mostly centered on Catholic missions The Spanish had largely withdrawn from the territory by the early th century although they had settlements in nearby Florida They had little influence historically in what would become Georgia Most Spanish place names in Georgia date from the th century not from the age of colonization br Georgia was founded by James Oglethorpe in The initial impetus behind Georgia s founding came from James Oglethorpe who envisioned the new colony as a refuge for the debtors who crowded London prisons however no such prisoners were among the initial settlers Military concerns were a far more motivating force for the British government which wanted Georgia named for King George II as a buffer zone to protect South Carolina and its other southern colonies against incursions from Florida by the Spanish Britain s greatest rival for North American territory As a result a series of fortifications was built along the coast and on several occasions most notably the Battle of Bloody Marsh on St Simons Island British troops that were commanded and financed by Oglethorpe kept the Spanish at bay br European Americans began to settle in Georgia although it was territory of both the Creek and the Cherokee nations They pressured state and the federal government to remove the Indians After Indian Removal in the s under President Jackson the pace of settlement by European Americans increased rapidly The new cotton gin invented at the end of the th century enabled the profitable processing of short staple cotton which could now be grown in the inland and upcountry regions This change stimulated the cotton boom in Georgia and much of the Deep South resulting in cotton being a main economic driver cultivated on slave labor Based on enslaved labor planters cleared and developed large cotton plantations Many became immensely wealthy but most of the yeomen whites did not own slaves and worked family subsistence farms br On January Georgia seceded from the Union and on February joined other Southern states all slave societies to form the Confederate States of America Georgia contributed nearly one hundred twenty thousand soldiers to the Confederacy with about five thousand Georgians both black and white joining the Union Army The first major battle in the state was the Battle of Chickamauga a Confederate victory and the last major Confederate victory in the west In Union General William Tecumseh Sherman s armies invaded Georgia as part of the Atlanta Campaign The burning of Atlanta which was a commercially vital railroad hub but not yet the state capital was followed by Sherman s March to the Sea which laid waste to a wide swath of the state from Atlanta to Savannah in late These events became iconic in the state s memory and dealt a devastating economic blow to the entire Confederacy br After the war Georgians endured a period of economic hardship Reconstruction was a period of military occupation With enfranchisement of freedmen who allied with the Republican Party a biracial legislature was elected It established public education and welfare institutions for the first time in the state and initiated economic programs Reconstruction ended in after white Democrats regained political control of the state through violence and intimidation at elections They passed new laws and constitutional amendments that disenfranchised blacks and many poor whites near the turn of the century In the Jim Crow era from the late th century to blacks were suppressed as second class citizens nearly excluded from politics Thousands of blacks migrated North to escape these conditions and associated violence The state was predominately rural with an agricultural economy based on cotton into the th century All residents of the state suffered in the Great Depression of the s br The many training bases and munitions plants established in World War II stimulated the economy and provided some new opportunities for blacks During the broad based activism of the Civil rights movement in the s and s Atlanta Georgia was the base of African American leader minister Martin Luther King Jr The state integrated public facilities After the economy grew and became more diverse with cotton receding in importance Atlanta became a major regional city and transportation hub expanding into neighboring communities through its fast growing suburbs Politically Georgia was part of the Solid South until when it first voted for a Republican candidate for president Democratic candidates continued to receive majority white support in state and local elections until the s when the realignment of conservative whites shifted to the Republican Party Atlanta was the host of the Summer Olympics which marked the th anniversary of the modern Olympic Games Georgia would grow rapidly both population wise and economically in the late th to early st century In Georgia s population topped million people and was the fourth fastest growing U S state from to br br br Pre colonial era br br Before European contact Native American cultures are divided under archaeological criteria into four lengthy periods of culture Paleo Archaic Woodland and Mississippian Their cultures were identified by characteristics of artefacts and other archaeological evidence including earthwork mounds that survive to the present and are visible aboveground br The human occupation of Georgia can be dated to at least years ago This was one of the most dramatic periods of climate change in recent earth history toward the end of the Ice Age in the Late Pleistocene epoch Sea levels were more than feet m lower than present levels The Atlantic Ocean shoreline was or more miles seaward of its current boundary A research project undertaken by University of Georgia researchers Ervan G Garrison Sherri L Littman and Megan Mitchell looked at and reported on fossils and artefacts associated with Gray s Reef National Marine Sanctuary which is located more than miles km beyond today s shoreline and to feet m to m below the Atlantic Ocean As recently as years ago Gray s Reef was dry ground attached to the mainland The researchers uncovered artefacts from a period of occupation by Clovis culture and Paleoindian hunters dating back more than years br The South Appalachian Mississippian culture the last of many mound building Native American cultures lasted from to AD This culture developed urban societies distinguished by their construction of truncated earthworks pyramids or platform mounds as well as their hierarchical chiefdoms intensive village based maize horticulture which enabled the development of more dense populations and creation of ornate copper shell and mica paraphernalia adorned with a series of motifs known as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex SECC The largest sites surviving in present day Georgia are Kolomoki in Early County Etowah in Bartow County Nacoochee Mound in White County and Ocmulgee National Monument in Macon br br br European exploration br br At the time of European colonization of the Americas the historic Iroquoian speaking Cherokee and Muskogean speaking Yamasee Hitchiti peoples lived throughout Georgia br The coastal regions were occupied by groups of small Muskogean speaking tribes with a loosely shared heritage consisting mostly of the Guale associated groups to the east and the Timucua group to the south This group of tribes had lands that extended into central Florida they were bordered by the Hitchiti and their territory to the west br The Muskogean peoples were related by language to the three large Muskogean nations that occupied territories between the Mississippi River and the Cherokee the Choctaw Chickasaw and Coushatta There were also a few other small Muskogean tribes along the Florida Alabama Gulf Coast region Archaeology shows that these historic peoples were in this region at the very least from the th century to colonial times The name for Appalachia came from the Timucuan language and a specific group from northern Florida called the Apalachee br Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le n may have sailed along the coast during his exploration of Florida In Lucas V zquez de Ayll n attempted to establish a colony on an island possibly near St Catherines Island At San Miguel de Gualdape the first Catholic Mass took place in the boundaries of what are today the United States br From to Hernando de Soto a Spanish conquistador led the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern day southern United States searching for gold and a passage to China A vast undertaking de Soto s North American expedition ranged across parts of the modern states of Florida South Carolina North Carolina Alabama Mississippi Arkansas Louisiana and Texas His expedition traversed much of the state of Georgia from south to north and it recorded encountering many native groups along the way These have largely been identified as part of the Mississippian culture and its chiefdoms br br An expedition of French Protestants founded the colonial settlement of Charlesfort in on Parris Island off the coast of South Carolina Jean Ribault and his party of French Huguenots settled an area in the Port Royal Sound area of present day South Carolina Within a year the colony failed Most of the colonists followed Ren Goulaine de Laudonni re south and founded a new outpost called Fort Caroline in present day Florida br Over the next few decades a number of Spanish explorers from Florida visited the inland region of present day Georgia The Mississippian culture way of life described by de Soto in had completely disappeared by the mid s The people may have suffered from new infectious diseases carried by the Europeans Remaining peoples are believed to have coalesced as the documented historic tribes br English fur traders from the Province of Carolina first encountered the Creek people in The English established a fort at Ocmulgee There they traded iron tools guns cloth and rum for deerskins and Indian slaves captured by warring tribes in regular raids br br br British colony br br The conflict between Spain and England over control of Georgia began in earnest in about when the English colony of South Carolina was founded just north of the missionary provinces of Guale and Mocama part of Spanish Florida Guale and Mocama today part of Georgia lay between Carolina s capital Charles Town and Spanish Florida s capital San Agust n They were subjected to repeated military invasions by English and Spanish colonists br The English destroyed the Spanish mission system in Georgia by The coast of future Georgia was occupied by British allied Yamasee American Indians until they were decimated in the Yamasee War of by South Carolina colonists and Indian allies The surviving Yamasee fled to Spanish Florida leaving the coast of Georgia depopulated This enabled formation of a new British colony A few defeated Yamasee remained and later became known as the Yamacraw br English settlement began in the early s after James Oglethorpe a Member of Parliament proposed that the area be colonized with the worthy poor of England to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors prisons of the period Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of Georgia on June The misconception of Georgia s having been founded as a debtor or penal colony persists because numerous English convicts were later sentenced to transportation to Georgia as punishment with the idea that they would provide labor With the motto Not for ourselves but for others the Trustees selected colonists for Georgia br Oglethorpe and the Trustees formulated a contract multi tiered plan for the settlement of Georgia see the Oglethorpe Plan The plan framed a system of agrarian equality designed to support and perpetuate an economy based on family farming and to prevent the social disintegration they associated with unregulated urbanization Land ownership was limited to acres ha a grant that included a town lot a garden plot near town and a acres ha farm Self supporting colonists were able to obtain larger grants but such grants were structured in acres ha increments tied to headrights that is the number of indentured servants for whom the grantee paid transportation to the colony Survivors who completed their term of indenture to pay for the transportation and associated costs would be granted a parcel of land of their own No person was permitted to acquire additional land through purchase or inheritance br On February the first settlers arrived in the ship Anne at what was to become the city of Savannah From to Georgia garrisoned Fort Okfuskee at the Creek town of Okfuskee to compete with French trade with the Creeks at Fort Toulouse In the colony was invaded by Spanish forces during the War of Jenkins Ear Oglethorpe mobilized local forces and defeated the Spanish at the Battle of Bloody Marsh The Treaty of Aix la Chapelle which ended the war confirmed the English position in Georgia br From to the trustees of Georgia unique among Britain s American colonies prohibited African slavery as a matter of public policy However as the growing wealth of the slave based plantation economy in neighboring South Carolina demonstrated slaves were more profitable than other forms of labor available to colonists In addition improving economic conditions in Europe meant that fewer whites were willing to immigrate as indentured servants In addition many of the whites suffered high mortality rates from the climate tropical diseases and other hardships of the Lowcountry br In the state overturned its ban on slavery From to planters so rapidly imported slaves that the enslaved population grew from less than to approximately a majority of people in the colony Until the free colonists imported slaves from other British colonies thereafter planters imported slaves chiefly from the rice growing regions of present day Sierra Leone the Gambia and Angola Some historians have suggested that the Lowcountry s elaborate earthwork system for rice and indigo cultivation originated in the sophisticated knowledge and material techniques of the newly imported African slaves Others argue that rice cultivation had become a settled system before any persons enslaved in risicultural regions arrived at the colony Later planters developed the infrastructure to grow sugar cane as a cash crop as well br A scarcity of horses proved to be a constant problem as the colonists tried to develop production of the industry of range cattle Planters were occasionally able to arrange roundups of wild horses believed to have escaped from Indian traders or from Spanish Florida br br In Georgia became a royal colony Planters from South Carolina wealthier than the original settlers of Georgia migrated south and soon dominated the colony They replicated the customs and institutions of the South Carolina Lowcountry Planters had higher rates of absenteeism from their large plantations in the Lowcountry and the Sea Islands than did those in the Upper South They often took their families to the hills during the summer the sick season when the Lowcountry had high rates of disease carried by mosquitoes such as malaria and yellow fever The decade after the end of Trustee rule was a decade of significant growth Georgia began to grow after the treaty of ended fear of further attacks from Spain br By the s British settlers lived as far south as Cumberland Island This violated the boundaries set by their own government and Spain which claimed the territory British settlers living south of the Altamaha River frequently engaged in trade with Spanish Florida which was also illegal according to both governments Such a ban was essentially unenforceable br Because of the development of large plantations and commodity crops that required numerous slaves for cultivation and processing the society of the Georgia coast was more like that of such British colonies as Barbados and Jamaica than of Virginia The large plantations were worked by numerous African born slaves Many of these Africans although of different languages and tribes came from closely related geographic areas of West Africa The slaves of the Rice Coast of South Carolina and Georgia developed the unique Gullah or Geechee culture the latter term was more common in Georgia in which important parts of West African linguistic religious and cultural heritage were preserved and creolized This multi ethnic culture developed throughout the Lowcountry and Sea Islands where enslaved African Americans later worked at cotton plantations African American influences which also absorbed elements of Native American and European American culture was strong on the cuisine and music that became integral parts of southern culture br Georgia was largely untouched by war during much of Britain s involvement in the Seven Years War In North America hostilities took place along a front in the North along the border with New France and their allied Native American tribes Americans later called it the French and Indian War In Georgia feared a potential Spanish invasion from Florida although this did not occur by the time peace was signed at the Treaty of Paris During this period the Anglo Cherokee War began br Governor James Wright wrote in thirty two years after its founding that Georgia had br br No manufactures of the least consequence a trifling quantity of coarse homespun cloth wool sic and cotton mixed among the poorer sort of people for their own use a few cotton and yarn stockings shoes for our Negroes and some occasional blacksmith s work But all our supplies of silk linens wool shoes stockings nails locks hinges and tools of every sort are all imported from and through Great Britain br br br Capitals of Georgia br Georgia has had five different capitals in its history The first was Savannah the seat of government during British colonial rule followed by Augusta Louisville Milledgeville and Atlanta the capital city from to the present day The state legislature has gathered for official meetings in other places most often in Macon and especially during the American Civil War br br br American revolution br br Royal governor James Wright was popular but all of the colonies developed the same strong position defending the traditional rights of Englishmen which they feared London was violating Georgia and the others moved rapidly toward republicanism which rejected monarchy aristocracy and corruption and demanded government based on the will of the people In particular they demanded No taxation without representation and rejected the Stamp Act in and all subsequent royal taxes More fearsome was the British punishment of Boston after the Boston Tea Party Georgians knew their remote coastal location made them vulnerable br In August at a general meeting in Savannah the people proclaimed Protection and allegiance are reciprocal and under the British Constitution correlative terms the Constitution admits of no taxation without representation Georgia had few grievances of its own but ideologically supported the patriot cause and expelled the British br Angered by the news of the battle of Concord on the eleventh of May the patriots stormed the royal magazine at Savannah and carried off its ammunition The customary celebration of the King s birthday on June was turned into a wild demonstration against the King a liberty pole was erected Within a month the patriots completely defied royal authority and set up their own government In June and July assemblies at Savannah chose a Council of Safety and a Provincial Congress to take control of the government and cooperate with the other colonies They started raising troops and prepared for war In short my lord wrote Wright to Lord Dartmouth on September the whole Executive Power is Assumed by them and the King s Governor remains little Else than Nominally so br In February Wright fled to a British warship and the patriots controlled all of Georgia The new Congress adopted Rules and Regulations on April which can be considered the Constitution of Along with the other American colonies Georgia declared independence in when its delegates approved and signed the joint Declaration of Independence With that declaration Georgia ceased to be a colony It was a state with a weak chief executive the President and Commander in Chief who was elected by the state Congress for a term of only six months Archibald Bulloch President of the two previous Congresses was elected first President He bent his efforts to mobilizing and training the militia The Constitution of put power in the hands of the elected House of Assembly which chose the governor there was no senate and the franchise was open to nearly all white men br The new state s exposed seaboard position made it a tempting target for the British Navy Savannah was captured by British and Loyalist forces in along with some of its hinterland Enslaved Africans and African Americans chose their independence by escaping to British lines where they were promised freedom About one third of Georgia s slaves escaped during the Revolution br The patriots moved to Augusta At the Siege of Savannah in American and French troops the latter including a company of free men of color from Saint Domingue who were mixed race fought unsuccessfully to retake the city During the final years of the American Revolution Georgia had a functioning Loyalist colonial government along the coast Together with New York City it was the last Loyalist bastion br An early historian reported br br For forty two long months had she been a prey to rapine oppression fratricidal strife and poverty Fear unrest the brand the sword the tomahawk had been her portion In the abstraction removal of negro slaves by the burning of dwellings in the obliteration of plantations by the destruction of agricultural implements and by theft of domestic animals and personal effects it is estimated that at least one half of the available property of the inhabitants had during this period been completely swept away Real estate had depreciated in value Agriculture was at a stand still and there was no money with which to repair these losses and inaugurate a new era of prosperity The lamentation of widows and orphans too were heard in the land These not only bemoaned their dead but cried aloud for food Amid the general depression there was nevertheless a deal of gladness in the hearts of the people a radiant joy an inspiring hope Independence had been won br The end of the war saw a new wave of migration to the state particularly from the frontiers of Virginia and the Carolinas George Mathews soon to be governor of Georgia was instrumental in this migration br Georgia ratified the U S Constitution on January br br The original eight counties of Georgia were Burke Camden Chatham Effingham Glynn Liberty Richmond and Wilkes Before these counties were created in Georgia had been divided into local government units called parishes Each of these original eight counties is named after members of the British government who had supported the American cause during the revolution As with South Carolina most of the Loyalists in Georgia Georgians who had fought for the British cause during the revolution stayed in Georgia after the war ended Leading Georgia patriots such as Archibald Bulloch Stephen Heard Lyman Hall John Houstoun Samuel Elbert Edward Telfair and George Mathews were all instrumental in both encouraging the Loyalists to stay and in making sure that they were not mistreated during the peace that followed the war Screven County had hundreds of first generation Scottish immigrants who had all stayed loyal to the crown during the war Telfair and Mathews personally asked them to stay In the city of Savannah Archibald Bulloch Stephen Heard Lyman Hall and John Houstoun all made personal appeals to the loyalists to stay on after the war ended and make the best of their lives under the new republican form of government br br br Antebellum period br During the years of the Antebellum period the area of Georgia was soon reduced by half from the Mississippi River back to the current state line by The ceded land was added into the Mississippi Territory by following the Louisiana Purchase with the state of Alabama later created in to become the west Georgia state line Also during this period large cotton plantations dominated the inland areas while rice farming was popular near the coast The slave population increased to work the plantations but the native Cherokee tribe was removed and resettled west in Oklahoma in the final two decades before the Civil War as explained further in the paragraphs below br br br Reduced state lines br br In the Treaty of Beaufort had established the eastern boundary of Georgia from the Atlantic seashore up the Savannah River at South Carolina to modern day Tugalo Lake construction to the Tugalo dam was started in and completed in Twelve to fourteen miles km of land inhabited at the time by the Cherokee Nation separate the lake from the southern boundary of North Carolina South Carolina ceded its claim to this land extending all the way to the Pacific Ocean to the federal government br Georgia maintained a claim on western land from N to N the southern part of which overlapped with the Mississippi Territory created from part of Spanish Florida in Following a series of land scandals Georgia ceded its claims in fixing its present western boundary In the federal government added the cession to the Mississippi Territory br The Treaty of fixed the present day northern boundary between Georgia and South Carolina at the Chattooga River proceeding northwest from the lake The Mississippi Territory was split on December to form the U S state of Mississippi and the Alabama Territory for years then in December the new state of Alabama became the western boundary of Georgia br br br Indian relocation br br After the Creek War corresponding with the War of some Muscogee leaders signed treaties that ceded land to Georgia including the signing of the Treaty of Fort Jackson Under this treaty General Andrew Jackson forced the Creek confederacy to surrender more than million acres in what is now southern Georgia and central Alabama On February William McIntosh and other chiefs signed the Treaty of Indian Springs which gave up most of the remaining Creek lands in Georgia After the U S Senate ratified the treaty McIntosh was assassinated on April by Creeks led by Menawa br In gold was discovered in the north Georgia mountains resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush the second gold rush in U S history A federal mint was established in Dahlonega Georgia and continued to operate until During the early s Cherokee Indians owned their ancestral land operated their own government with a written constitution and did not recognize the authority of the state of Georgia An influx of white settlers pressured the U S government to expel them The dispute culminated in the Indian Removal Act of under which all eastern tribes were sent west to Indian reservations in present day Oklahoma In Worcester v Georgia the Supreme Court in ruled that states were not permitted to redraw the boundaries of Indian lands but President Andrew Jackson and the state of Georgia ignored the ruling br Escalating tensions with Creek tribes erupted into open war with the United States following the destruction of the village of Roanoke Georgia located along the Chattahoochee River on the boundary between Creek and American territory in May During the so called Creek War of Secretary of War Lewis Cass dispatched General Winfield Scott to end the violence by forcibly removing the Creeks to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River br In Andrew Jackson s successor President Martin van Buren dispatched federal troops to round up the Cherokee and deport them west of the Mississippi This forced relocation beginning in White County became known as the Trail of Tears and led to the death of over Cherokees br br br Land allocations br In Eli Whitney a Massachusetts born artisan residing in Savannah Georgia had patented a cotton gin mechanizing the separation of cotton fibres from their seeds The Industrial Revolution had resulted in the mechanized spinning and weaving of cloth in the world s first factories in the north of England Fueled by the soaring demands of British textile manufacturers King Cotton quickly came to dominate Georgia and the other southern states Although Congress had banned the slave trade in Georgia s slave population continued to grow with the importation of slaves from the plantations of the South Carolina Lowcountry and Chesapeake Tidewater increasing from in to in A small population of free blacks developed mostly working as artisans The Georgia legislature unanimously passed a resolution in declaring that free blacks were not U S citizens However national citizenship is defined by federal statute While an indication of sentiment this state resolution did not have the power of law br Slaves worked the fields in large cotton plantations and the economy of the state became dependent on the institution of slavery Requiring little cultivation most efficiently grown on large plantations by large slave workforces and easy to transport cotton proved ideally suited to the inland frontier The lower Piedmont or Black Belt counties comprising the middle third of the state and initially named for the region s distinctively dark and fertile soil became the site of the largest and most productive cotton plantations By the slave population in the Black Belt was three times greater than that of the coastal counties where rice remained the principal crop The upper Piedmont was settled mainly by white yeoman farmers of English descent While there were also many smaller cotton plantations the proportion of slaves was lower in north Georgia than in the coastal and Black Belt counties but it still ranged up to of the population In inches cm the state as a whole enslaved African Americans comprised of the population of slightly more than one million br br br Education br Until the th century there were no public secondary schools although there were several private and religious schools br Post secondary education was formalized in with the establishment of the University of Georgia the first university in the U S to gain a state charter Rural families often pooled their resources to hire itinerant teachers for a month or two at a time Ten grammar schools were in operation by many taught by ministers Most had some government funding and many were free to both male and female white students A study of women s signatures indicates a high degree of literacy in areas with schools br Georgia s early promise in education faded after Public education was established by the Reconstruction era legislatures in the South but after Democrats regained power they hardly funded them The entire rural South had limited public schooling until after and black schools were underfunded in the segregated society br Wealthy Georgians took care of their own sending their children to private academies The Presbyterians were especially active in creating academies including numerous schools for women They included Georgia Female College Rome Female College Greensboro Female College Griffin Synodical Female College Thomasville Young s Female College and the most enduring of all Decatur Female Seminary now Agnes Scott College br br br Civil War br br On January Georgia seceded from the Union keeping the name State of Georgia and joining the newly formed Confederacy in February White solidarity was strong in as the planters in the Black Belt formed a common cause with upcountry yeomen farmers in defense of the Confederacy against the Union Around Georgians served in the Confederate Army However disillusionment set in by with class tensions becoming more serious including food riots desertions and growing Unionist activity in the northern mountain region Approximately Georgians both black and white troops served in the Union Army in units including the st Georgia Infantry Battalion the st Alabama Cavalry Regiment and a number of East Tennessean regiments Governor Joseph E Brown tried to divert attention by blaming the Confederate officials in Richmond especially President Jefferson Davis and insisting that many Georgia troops be kept at home Brown was by the Augusta Chronicle and Sentinel an influential weekly newspaper that repeatedly attacked the Davis administration especially after the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus on February br br br Military history br br Georgia sent around one hundred twenty thousand soldiers to the Confederacy mostly to the armies in Virginia More than five thousand Georgians both black and white joined the Union Army mostly in units raised in East Tennessee and Northern Alabama br The first major battle in Georgia was a Confederate victory at the Battle of Chickamauga in It was the last major Confederate victory in the west Following President Abraham Lincoln s Emancipation Proclamation of January slaves began to leave plantations to join Union lines and gain freedom In William T Sherman s armies invaded Georgia as part of the Atlanta Campaign Confederate general Joseph E Johnston fought a series of delaying battles the largest being the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain as he tried to delay as long as possible retreating toward Atlanta Johnston s replacement Gen John Bell Hood attempted several unsuccessful counterattacks at the Battle of Peachtree Creek and the Battle of Atlanta but Sherman captured the city on September br In November Sherman stripped his army of non essentials and began his famous Sherman s March to the Sea living off the land and burning plantations wrecking railroads and killing the livestock Thousands of escaped slaves followed his troops across the region as he entered Savannah on December After the loss of Atlanta the governor withdrew the state s militia from the Confederate forces to harvest crops for the state and the army They did not try to stop Sherman br Sherman s March was devastating to Georgia and the Confederacy in terms of economics and psychology Sherman estimated that the campaign had inflicted million about billion in dollars in destruction about one fifth of which inured to our advantage while the remainder is simple waste and destruction His army wrecked miles km of railroad and numerous bridges and miles of telegraph lines It seized horses mules and head of cattle It confiscated million pounds of corn and million pounds of fodder and destroyed uncounted cotton gins and mills br Sherman s campaign of total war extended to Georgia civilians In July during the Atlanta campaign General Sherman ordered approximately Roswell mill workers mostly women arrested as traitors and shipped as prisoners to the North with their children This was a common tactic of Sherman to economically disrupt the South There is little evidence that more than a few of the women ever returned home br The memory of Sherman s March became iconic and central to the Myth of the Lost Cause The crisis was the setting for Margaret Mitchell s novel Gone with the Wind and the subsequent film Most important were many salvation stories that tell not what Union soldiers destroyed but what was saved by the quick thinking and crafty women on the home front loyal slaves or was preserved due to appreciation of the beauty of homes and the charm of Southern women br br br Food shortages br By summer the Union naval blockade virtually shut down the export of cotton and the import of manufactured goods Food that formerly came overland was cut off In response the governor and legislature pleaded with planters to grow less cotton and more food Most refused some believing that the Yankees would not or could not fight When cotton prices soared in Europe expectations were that Europe would soon intervene to break the blockade Neither proved true and the myth of omnipotent King Cotton died hard The legislature imposed cotton quotas making it a crime to grow an excess But food shortages only worsened especially in the towns Poor white women raised more than two dozen riots when they raided stores and captured supply wagons to get such necessities as bacon corn flour and cotton yarn As the South lost control of more and more of its major ocean and river ports it had to rely on a rickety railroad system and unimproved roads to move soldiers and supplies Atlanta became the Confederacy s chief rail center thus making it a prime target for Sherman Thinking the state was safe from invasion the Confederates built small munitions factories throughout the state as well as soldier hospitals and prison camps br br br Andersonville prison br In the government relocated Union prisoners of war from Richmond Virginia to the town of Andersonville in remote southwest Georgia It proved a death camp because of overcrowding and a severe lack of supplies food water and medicine During its months of operation the Andersonville prison camp held Union soldiers at least died from disease malnutrition starvation or exposure At its peak the death rate was more than persons per day After the war the camp s commanding officer Captain Henry Wirz was the only Confederate to be tried and executed as a war criminal br br br Reconstruction br br At war s end the devastation and disruption in every part of the state was dramatic Wartime damage disruption to plantations and miserable weather had a disastrous effect on agricultural production before the end of the war Production of the state s chief money crop cotton fell from a high of more than bales in to less than in while harvests of corn and wheat were also meager After the war the state subsidized construction of numerous new railroad lines to improve infrastructure and connections to markets Use of commercial fertilizers increased cotton production in Georgia s upcountry but the coastal rice plantations never recovered from the war br In January William T Sherman issued Special Field Orders No authorizing federal authorities to confiscate abandoned plantations in the Sea Islands and redistribute land in smaller plots to former slaves Later that year after succeeding Lincoln in the presidency after he was assassinated Andrew Johnson revoked the order and returned the plantations to their former owners br At the beginning of the period of Reconstruction Georgia had more than freedmen Slaves made up of the state s population in After the Civil War many former slaves moved from rural areas to Atlanta where economic opportunities were better Free from white supervision they established their own communities Other migrations involved blacks moving from plantations to adjacent small towns and communities A new federal agency the Freedmen s Bureau helped blacks negotiate labor contracts and set up schools and churches The region s planters struggled with the transition to paid labor and tried to control the movement of blacks through Black Codes br Andrew Johnson s decision to restore the former Confederate states to the Union without requirements for political change was criticized by Radical Republicans in Congress In March Congress passed the First Reconstruction Act to place the South under military occupation and rule Along with Alabama and Florida Georgia was included in the Third Military District under the command of General John Pope Military rule lasted less than a year It supervised the first elections in which black men could vote The electoral roll in included eligible white men and eligible black men Radical Republicans in Congress required ex Confederates to take an ironclad oath of loyalty or be prevented from holding office The legislature was controlled by a biracial coalition of newly enfranchised freedmen Northerners carpetbaggers and white Southerners disparagingly called scalawags The latter were mostly former Whigs who had opposed secession br The voters elected delegates to write a new constitution in of the delegates were black In July the newly elected General Assembly ratified the Fourteenth Amendment a Republican governor Rufus Bullock was inaugurated and Georgia was readmitted to the Union The state s Democrats including former Confederate leaders Robert Toombs and Howell Cobb convened in Atlanta to denounce Reconstruction Theirs was described as the largest mass rally held in Georgia In September white Republicans joined with the Democrats in expelling all thirty two black legislators from the General Assembly Refusing to give up social domination some ex Confederates organized insurgent paramilitary groups especially chapters of the newly formed Ku Klux Klan Freedmen s Bureau agents reported cases of murder or assault with intent to kill perpetrated against freedmen across the state from January through November br In under Reconstruction Georgia became the first state in the South to implement the convict lease system It generated revenue for the state by leasing out the prison population many of whom were black to work for private businesses and citizens Prisoners did not receive income for their labor In this manner railroad companies mines turpentine distilleries and other manufacturers supplemented their workforce with unpaid convict labor This helped to hasten Georgia s transition to industrialization Under the convict release system employers were legally obliged to provide humane treatment to the laborers But the system was easily abused and akin to slavery One prominent beneficiary of this system was the Republican jurist and politician Joseph E Brown whose railroads coal mines and iron works supplemented their workforce with convict labor br The activity of political groups opposed to Reconstruction prompted Republicans and others to call for the return of Georgia to military rule Georgia was one of only two ex Confederate states to vote against Ulysses S Grant in the presidential election of In March the state legislature defeated ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment br That same month the U S Congress citing election fraud barred Georgia s representatives from taking their seats This culminated in military rule being re imposed in December In January Gen Alfred H Terry the final commanding general of the Third District purged the General Assembly of ex Confederates He replaced them with Republican runners up and reinstated expelled black legislators This militarily imposed General Assembly had a large Republican majority br In February the newly constituted legislature ratified the Fifteenth Amendment and chose new Senators to send to Washington On July Georgia became the last former Confederate state readmitted into the Union After military rule ended Democrats won commanding majorities in both houses of the General Assembly aided by election violence and fraud Some Reconstruction era black legislators held on to their seats through the legislature s passage of laws disfranchising blacks starting with a poll tax in the last black legislator served until In provisions of a new constitution completed black disfranchisement Under threat of impeachment Republican governor Rufus Bullock fled the state br br br Postbellum economic growth br br Under the Reconstruction government the state capital was moved from Milledgeville to the inland rail terminus of Atlanta Construction began on a new capitol building which was completed by With the city a center of trade and government the population of Atlanta increased rapidly br Post Reconstruction Georgia was dominated by the Bourbon Triumvirate of Joseph E Brown Major General John B Gordon and Gen Alfred H Colquitt Between and either Brown or Gordon held one of Georgia s Senate seats Colquitt held the other and in the major part of that period either Colquitt or Gordon occupied the Governor s office Democrats effectively monopolized state politics Colquitt represented the old planter class Brown head of Western Atlantic Railroad and one of the states first millionaires represented the New South businessmen Gordon was neither a planter nor a successful businessman but the former Confederate General proved a most skilled politician br Gordon was thought by some to be the titular leader of the st Ku Klux Klan in Georgia He was the first former Confederate to serve in the U S Senate He helped negotiate the Compromise of that ended Reconstruction and led to the end of federal enforcement of laws protecting blacks A native of northwest Georgia his popularity impeded the growth of the mountain Republicanism which was prevalent elsewhere in Appalachian areas where slavery had been minor and resentment against the planter class widespread br During the Gilded Age Georgia slowly recovered from the devastation of the Civil War One of the most enduring products came about in reaction to the age s excesses In when Atlanta and Fulton County enacted prohibition legislation against alcohol a local pharmacist John Pemberton invented a new soda drink Two years later after he sold the drink to Asa Candler who promoted it Coca Cola became the state s most famous product br Henry W Grady editor of the Atlanta Constitution emerged as the leading spokesman of the New South He promoted sectional reconciliation and the region s place in a rapidly industrializing nation The International Cotton Exposition of and the Cotton States and International Exposition of were staged to promote Georgia and the South as textile centers They attracted mills from New England to build a new economic base in the post war South by diversifying the region s agrarian economies Attracted by low labor costs and the proximity to raw materials new textile businesses transformed Columbus and Atlanta as well as Graniteville on the Georgia South Carolina border into textile manufacturing centers br Due to Georgia s relatively untapped virgin forests particularly in the thinly populated pine savanna of the Atlantic Coastal Plain logging became a major industry It supported other new industries most notably paper mills and turpentine distilling which by made Georgia the leading producer of naval stores Also important were coal granite and kaolin mining the latter used in the manufacture of paper bricks and ceramic piping br In the volatile s and s political violence suppressed black voting as white Democrats imposed laws for Jim Crow and white supremacy Whites increased their lynchings of blacks reaching its height in when Georgians were killed by lynch mobs From to Georgia averaged more than one mob killing per month More than of the victims of the lynchings documented between and were black br This period also corresponded to Georgia s disfranchisement of blacks and many poor whites through changes to its constitution and addition of such requirements as poll taxes literacy and comprehension tests and residency requirements In blacks comprised of the population but hardly any could register and vote The state instituted a white primary in as it was a one party state by that time this further excluded the chance of black political participation This situation prevailed into the mid th century br The Cotton States and International Exposition was the venue for Booker T Washington s speech promoting what became known as the Atlanta Compromise He urged blacks to focus their efforts not on demands for social equality but to improve their own conditions by becoming proficient in skills for available jobs in agriculture mechanics and domestic service He proposed building a broad base within existing conditions in the South He urged whites to take responsibility to improve social and economic relations between the races br Black leaders such as W E B Du Bois who supported classical academic standards for education disagreed with Washington and said he was acquiescing to oppression Born in Massachusetts Du Bois had earned his doctorate in Germany and was one of the most highly educated black men in America in he joined the faculty of Atlanta University and taught there for several years br br br Agrarian unrest and disfranchisement br While Grady and other proponents of the New South insisted on Georgia s urban future the state s economy remained overwhelmingly dependent on cotton Much of the industrialization that did occur was as a subsidiary of cotton agriculture many of the state s new textile factories were devoted to the manufacture of simple cotton bags The price per pound of cotton plummeted from at the end of the Civil War to an average of cents in the s nine cents in the s and seven cents in the s By it had fallen to five cents a pound while costing seven cents to produce Once prosperous planters suffered significant hardship br Thousands of freedmen became tenant farmers or sharecroppers rather than hire out to labor gangs Through the lien system small county merchants assumed a central role in cotton production monopolizing the supply of equipment fertilizers seeds and foodstuffs needed to make sharecropping possible By the s as cotton prices plummeted below production costs of cotton growers whether owner or tenant were in debt to lien merchants br Indebted Georgia cotton growers responded by embracing the agrarian radicalism manifested successively in the s with the Granger movement in the s with the Farmers Alliance and in the s with the Populist Party In Congressman Tom Watson joined the Populists becoming the most visible spokesman for their predominately Western Congressional delegation Southern Populists denounced the convict lease system while urging white and black small farmers to unite on the basis of shared economic self interest They generally refrained from advocating social equality br In his essay The Negro Question in the South Watson framed his appeal for a united front between black and white farmers declaring br You are kept apart that you may be separately fleeced of your earnings You are made to hate each other because upon that hatred is rested the keystone of the arch of financial despotism which enslaves you both You are deceived and blinded that you may not see how this race antagonism perpetuates a monetary system which beggars both br Southern Populists did not share their Western counterparts emphasis on Free Silver and bitterly opposed their desire for fusion with the Democratic Party They had faced death threats mob violence and ballot box stuffing to challenge the monopoly of their states Bourbon Democrat political machines The merger with the Democratic Party in the Presidential election dealt a fatal blow to Southern Populism The Populists nominated Watson as William Jennings Bryan s vice president but Bryan selected New England industrialist Arthur Sewall as a concession to Democratic leaders br Watson was not reelected As the Populist Party disintegrated through his periodical The Jeffersonian Watson crusaded as an anti Catholic and eventually a white supremacist He attacked the socialism which had attracted many former Populists He campaigned with little success for the party s candidate for President in and Watson continued to exert influence in Georgia politics and provided a key endorsement in the gubernatorial campaign of M Hoke Smith br br br Disenfranchisement and court challenges br A former cabinet member in Grover Cleveland s administration M Hoke Smith broke with Cleveland because of his support for Bryan Hoke Smith s tenure as governor was noted for the passage of Jim Crow laws and the constitutional amendment that required a person to satisfy qualifications for literacy tests and property ownership for voting Because a grandfather clause was used to waive those requirements for most whites the legislation effectively secured the disenfranchisement of African Americans Georgia s amendment was made following and Supreme Court decisions that had upheld similar provisions in the constitutions of Mississippi and Alabama br The new provisions were devastating for the African American community and poor whites as losing the ability to register to vote meant they were excluded from serving on juries or in local office as well as losing all representation at local state and Federal levels In African Americans numbered in Georgia nearly of the state s population br Litigation in Georgia and elsewhere brought some relief as in the overturning of the grandfather clause in the U S Supreme Court ruling Guinn v United States White dominated state legislatures and the state Democratic parties quickly responded by creating new barriers to an expanded franchise such as white only primaries br The last black member of the General Assembly W H Rogers resigned in as the final representative of the Reconstruction era coastal Georgia political machine br br br Progressive era br The rapidly growing middle class of professionals businessmen and educated worked to bring the Progressive Era to Georgia in the early th century The goal was to modernize the state increase efficiency apply scientific methods promote education and eliminate waste and corruption Key leaders were governors Joseph M Terrell and Hoke Smith Terrell pushed through important legislation covering judicial affairs schools food and drug regulation taxation and labor measures He failed to obtain necessary penal and railroad reforms br A representative local leader was newspaper editor Thomas Lee Bailey who used his Cochran Journal to reach out to Bleckley County from to The paper mirrored Bailey s personality and philosophy for it was folksy outspoken and upbeat and covered a variety of local topics Bailey was a strong advocate for diversified farming quality education civic and political reform and controls on alcohol and gambling br br br Cotton br In the early s Georgia experienced economic expansion in both the manufacturing and agricultural sectors The cotton industry benefited from the depredations of the boll weevil further west In Georgia produced a record million bales of cotton However the boll weevil arrived in Georgia four years later By infestation had reached such epidemic proportions that of the state s cotton crop was destroyed Demand during World War I drove cotton prices to a high of a pound After however cotton quickly fell to cents per pound Landowners ruined by the boll weevil and declining prices expelled their sharecroppers br br br African Americans br Although blacks also participated in the Progressive movement the state remained in the grip of Jim Crow In Georgia s poll tax which also had excluded poor whites from voter rolls to reduce the Populist threat was upheld in the Supreme Court case of Breedlove v Suttles That challenge was brought by a poor white man seeking the ability to vote without paying a fee By only blacks in Georgia managed to register In the Supreme Court s decision in Smith v Allwright banned white primaries and in Georgia repealed its poll tax NAACP and other activists rapidly registered African Americans in cities such as Atlanta but in rural areas they remained outside politics br Starting around and increasing as jobs began to open up during World War I tens of thousands of African Americans in the Great Migration moved to northern industrial cities out of the rural South for work better education for their children the right to vote and for escape from the violence of lynchings From to and in a second wave from the s to a total of more than million African Americans left the South for northern and western industrial cities They rapidly became urbanized and many built successful middle class lives as industrial workers The demographics of the regions changed br br br Prohibition and Coca Cola br Prohibition was a central issue in local and state politics from the s into the s Before World War I it was widely believed that the solution to drunkenness was the religious revival which would turn the sinner into a teetolaling Christian The Drys were led by ministers and middle class women of the Woman s Christian Temperance Union who succeeded in securing a local option law that dried up most of the rural counties Atlanta and the other cities were wet strongholds br By the much more effective Anti Saloon League took over from the preachers and women and cut deals with the politicians such as Hoke Smith The League pushed through a prohibition law in However the law had loopholes that allowed Georgians to import whiskey from other states through the mail and provided for saloons that supposedly sold only non alcoholic drinks In the drys passed a state law that effectively closed nearly all the liquor traffic Illegal distilling and bootlegging continued br br During this time a non alcoholic beverage first introduced in gained in popularity In when Atlanta and Fulton County passed prohibition legislation pharmacist John Pemberton responded by developing Coca Cola It was essentially a non alcoholic version of the popular French wine coca br The first sales were at Jacob s Pharmacy in Atlanta on May It was initially sold as a patent medicine for five cents a glass at soda fountains which were popular in the United States at the time due to the belief that carbonated water was good for the health In Asa Griggs Candler bought the cola company from Pemberton and with aggressive regional national and international marketing turned it into one of the largest and most profitable corporations in the New South Candler was later elected Mayor of Atlanta taking office immediately after the passage of Georgia s state wide prohibition law of He served from to Atlanta s first airport Candler Field was named in his honor Candler Field was subsequently renamed Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport br br br Social tension br Georgia took the national spotlight in with the lynching of Atlanta Jewish factory superintendent Leo Frank Frank had been convicted in of the murder of a white Irish Catholic employee thirteen year old Mary Phagan After Frank s death sentence was commuted to life in prison by the outgoing Governor an outraged lynch mob seized Frank from his jail cell and hanged him Ringleaders calling themselves The Knights of Mary Phagan included prominent politicians most notably former Governor Joseph Mackey Brown Publisher Thomas E Watson was accused of helping to instigate the violence through inflammatory newspaper coverage br The rising social tensions from new immigration urban migration and rapid change contributed to revival of the Ku Klux Klan On November a group led by William J Simmons burned a cross on top of Stone Mountain inaugurating a revival of the nd Klan The event was attended by charter members and a few aging survivors of the original Klan Atlanta was designated as its Imperial City The Klan quickly grew to occupy a powerful role in both state and municipal politics Governor Clifford Walker who served from to was closely associated with the Klan By the end of the decade the organization suffered from a number of scandals internal feuds and voices raised in opposition Klan membership in the state declined from a peak of in to in br br br Women s suffrage br br Rebecca Latimer Felton was the most prominent woman leader in Georgia Born into a wealthy plantation family she married an active politician managed his career and became a political expert An outspoken feminist she became a leader of the prohibition and woman s suffrage movements endorsed lynching fought for reform of prisons and filled leadership roles in many reform organizations In she was appointed to the U S Senate She was sworn in on November and served one day She was the first woman to serve in the Senate br Although middle class urban women were well organized supporters of suffrage the rural areas were hostile The state legislature ignored efforts to let women vote in local elections and not only refused to ratify the Federal th Amendment but took pride in being the first state to reject it The Amendment passed nationally and Georgia women gained the right to vote in However black women were largely excluded from voting by the state s discriminatory devices until after the federal Voting Rights Act of enforced their constitutional rights br br br Great Depression and Second World War br The state was relatively prosperous in the s The price of cotton remained high until the end of World War I Lower wholesales prices in the s had a negative impact on the rural economy which in turn effected the entire state By economic recession had deteriorated into a severe depression Cotton prices decreased from a high of a pound during World War I to inches cm the late s to lows of cents in and The Great Depression proved to be difficult economically for both rural and urban Georgia Farmers and blue collar workers were impacted the most Georgia benefited from several New Deal programs which raised cotton prices to or a pound promoted rural electrification and set up rural and urban work relief programs Enacted during Roosevelt s first days in office the Agricultural Adjustment Act paid farmers to plant less cotton to reduce oversupply Between and the New Deal injected million into the Georgia economy Franklin Delano Roosevelt visited Georgia on numerous occasions He established his Little White House in Warm Springs where the therapeutic waters offered treatment and relief for the President s paralytic illness br Roosevelt s proposals were popular with many members of Georgia s congressional delegation The Civilian Conservation Corps put young men formerly on relief back to work The Agricultural Adjustment Administration supported the price of cotton and peanuts Work relief programs spread federal money across the state However the most powerful member of the Georgia delegation Congressman Eugene Cox often opposed legislation which favored labor and urban interests particularly the National Industrial Recovery Act br Georgia s powerful governor Eugene Talmadge disliked Roosevelt and the New Deal He was a former Agriculture Commissioner who promoted himself as a real dirt farmer winning the support of his rural constituencies Talmadge opposed many New Deal programs Appealing to his white conservative base Talmadge denounced New Deal programs that paid black workers wages equal to whites and attacked what he described as the communist tendencies of the New Deal The Roosevelt administration was often able to circumvent Talmadge s opposition by working with pro New Deal politicians most notably Atlanta Mayor William B Hartsfield In the election Talmadge unsuccessfully attempted to run for the Senate but lost to pro New Deal incumbent Richard Russell Jr The candidate he endorsed for Governor was also defeated Under the pro New Deal administration of State House speaker E D Rivers by Georgia led the nation in the number of Rural Electrification Cooperatives and rural public housing projects Between and the early s the administration of Franklin D Roosevelt spent slightly over million on projects in Georgia for projects such as malaria control rural sanitation hot lunches for school children nursing services and art projects br Re elected Governor in Talmadge suffered a political setback when he fired a dean at the University of Georgia on the grounds that the dean had advocated integration When this action was opposed by the Georgia Board of Regents Governor Talmadge reconfigured the board appointing members more favorable to his views This in turn led the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to withdraw accreditation from ten of the state s colleges and universities In Talmadge was defeated in his bid for reelection However he was reelected in but died before taking office The death of the Governor elect precipitated a political crisis known as the three governors controversy which was only resolved after a legal ruling by the Georgia Supreme Court br Factory production during World War II lifted Georgia s economy out of recession Marietta s Bell Aircraft plant the principal assembly site for the Boeing B Superfortress bomber employed nearly people at its peak Robins Air Field near Macon employed nearly civilians Fort Benning became the world s largest infantry training school and newly opened Fort Gordon became a major deployment center Shipyards in Savannah and Brunswick built many of the Liberty Ships used to transport materiel to the European and Pacific Theaters Following the cessation of hostilities the state s urban centers continued to thrive br In Georgia became the first state to allow year olds to vote and remained the only one to do so before passage of the th Amendment in Three other states set the voting age at or That same year the Communicable Disease Center later called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC was founded in Atlanta from staff of the former Malaria Control in War Areas offices br From to some new factories were constructed in the state By more Georgians were employed in manufacturing than farming At the same time the mechanization of agriculture dramatically reduced the need for farm laborers This precipitated another wave of urban migration as former sharecroppers and tenant farmers moved chiefly to the urban Midwest West and Northeast as well as to Georgia s own burgeoning urban centers br During the war Atlanta s Candler Field was the nation s busiest airport in terms of flight operations Afterwards Mayor Hartsfield lobbied successfully to make the city Delta Air Lines hub for commercial air travel based on Atlanta s strategic location in relation to the nation s major population centers The airport was subsequently renamed in his honor br br br Civil rights movement br br African Americans who served in the segregated military during World War II returned to a still segregated nation and a South which still enforced Jim Crow laws Many were motivated to participate in the NAACP and other groups to enforce their constitutional rights especially the right to vote and the right of their children to an equal education Following the U S Supreme Court decision in Smith v Allwright which overturned white primaries NAACP activists worked to register voters Statewide blacks registered to vote in and did vote br Atlanta home to a number of traditional black colleges sustained a large educated middle class black community which produced leaders of the Civil Rights Movement In the postwar period the new movement for change was carried forward by several groups with somewhat different agendas but united in the goal of civil rights for African Americans The voting rights campaign in Atlanta was spearheaded by the All Citizen s Registration Committee br The idea of change was not universally embraced The Supreme Court s decision in Brown v Board of Education was denounced by Governor Marvin Griffin who pledged to keep Georgia s schools segregated come hell or high water br br In January Bobby Grier became the first black player to participate in the Sugar Bowl He is also regarded as the first black player to compete at a bowl game in the Deep South though others such as Wallace Triplett had played in games like the Cotton Bowl in Dallas Grier s team the Pittsburgh Panthers was set to play against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets However Georgia s Governor Marvin Griffin beseeched Georgia Tech s president Blake Van Leer and it s players to not participate in this racially integrated game Griffin was widely criticized by news media leading up to the game and protests were held at his mansion by Georgia Tech students After delivering a commencement speech at the all Black Morris Brown College Van Leer was summoned by the board of regents where he was quoted Either we re going to the Sugar Bowl or you can find yourself another damn president of Georgia Tech Despite the governor s objections Georgia Tech upheld the contract and proceeded to compete in the bowl In the game s first quarter a pass interference call against Grier ultimately resulted in Yellow Jackets victory Grier stated that he has mostly positive memories about the experience including the support from teammates and letters from all over the world br In the state passed legislation to restrict voter registration by requiring illiterate candidates to answer of questions of comprehension posed by white registrars In practice it was used subjectively to disqualify blacks In rural counties such as Terrell black voting registration was repressed After the legislation although the county was black in population only blacks managed to register to vote br Atlanta born minister Martin Luther King Jr emerged as a national leader in the Montgomery bus boycott of in Alabama The son of a Baptist minister King earned a doctorate from Boston University and was part of the educated middle class that had developed in Atlanta s African American community The success of the Montgomery boycott led to King s joining with others to form the Southern Christian Leadership Conference SCLC in Atlanta in to provide political leadership for the Civil Rights Movement across the South Black churches had long been important centers of their communities Ministers and their thousands of congregations throughout the South were at the forefront of the civil rights struggle br br The SCLC led a desegregation campaign in Albany Georgia in This campaign however failed to rally significant support or to achieve any dramatic victories Nonetheless the Albany campaign provided important lessons which were put to use in the more successful Birmingham campaign of inches cm Alabama National opinion eventually turned in favor of the moral position of civil rights for all citizens Before his assassination President John F Kennedy prepared and submitted a Civil Rights bill to Congress Kennedy s successor Lyndon B Johnson made the legislation a priority in his administration In President Johnson secured passage of the Civil Rights Act The following year he secured passage of the Voting Rights Act of br African Americans throughout the South registered to vote and began to re enter the political process By the s the proportion of African Americans in Georgia had declined to of the state s population after waves of migration to the North and some in migration by whites With their voting power diminished it took some years for African Americans to win a state wide office Julian Bond a noted civil rights leader was elected to the state House in and served multiple terms there and in the state senate br Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr testified before Congress in support of the Civil Rights Act and Governor Carl Sanders worked with the Kennedy administration to ensure the state s compliance Ralph McGill editor and syndicated columnist at the Atlanta Constitution earned both admiration and enmity by writing in support of the Civil Rights Movement However the majority of white Georgians continued to oppose integration br In Lester Maddox was elected Governor of Georgia Maddox who opposed forced integration had gained fame by threatening African American civil rights demonstrators who tried to enter his restaurant After taking office Maddox appointed more African Americans to positions of responsibility than any governor since Reconstruction br In the U S Department of Justice filed a successful lawsuit against Georgia requiring the state to integrate public schools In newly elected Governor Jimmy Carter declared in his inaugural address that the era of racial segregation had ended br In Georgians elected Andrew Young to Congress as the first African American since Reconstruction br br br Late th century to present br br In construction was completed on an expansion of William B Hartsfield International Airport The busiest in the world it was designed to accommodate up to million passengers a year The airport became a major engine for economic growth With the advantages of cheap real estate low taxes right to work laws and a regulatory environment limiting government interference the Atlanta metropolitan area became a national center of finance insurance and real estate companies as well as the convention and trade show business As a testament to the city s growing international profile in the International Olympic Committee selected Atlanta as the site of the Summer Olympics Taking advantage of Atlanta s status as a transportation hub in UPS established its headquarters in a suburb In construction finished on Bank of America Plaza it was the tallest building in the U S outside New York or Chicago at the time of its completion br Following national Democratic support for civil rights legislation Georgia along with the rest of the formerly Democratic Solid South gradually shifted to support Republicans first in presidential elections Realignment was hastened by the turbulent one term presidency of native son Jimmy Carter the popularity of Ronald Reagan organizational efforts of the Republican Party and the perception of a growing liberalism within the national Democratic Party While Carter would prevail in the state in both his and campaigns and another southern governor Bill Clinton would win the state in Republicans increasingly held the upper hand in presidential politics from the mid s onward br As the era of old south Democratic control symbolized by iconic personalities Herman Talmadge and Georgia Speaker of the House Tom Murphy drew to an end new Republican leaders took their place Republican congressman Newt Gingrich the acknowledged leader of the Republican Revolution was elected Speaker of the House His seat represented the northern suburbs of Atlanta Bob Barr another Georgia Republican congressman was a leader of the campaign to impeach President Bill Clinton in br In this shifting political climate many leading Georgia Democrats most notably Governor Zell Miller drifted to the right After being appointed to the U S Senate by his successor Roy Barnes following the death of early state GOP standard bearer Paul Coverdell in Miller emerged as a prominent ally of George W Bush on the war in Iraq Social Security privatization tax cuts and other conservative backed issues He delivered a controversial keynote speech at the Republican convention where he endorsed Bush for reelection and denounced the liberalism of his Democratic Party colleagues In a pattern common across the region other white Democrats retired or switched parties as Democrats fortunes declined with white voters including future Republican governors Sonny Perdue and Nathan Deal br In Georgia elected Perdue as the first Republican governor since Reconstruction defeating Barnes Shortly thereafter Republicans gained control of both chambers of the state legislature and all state wide elected offices CNN reported that in presidential election exit polls of the voters identified as conservatives moderates and liberals identified as White Evangelical Born Again and they voted for Republican John McCain who carried the state s electoral votes The other voted two to one for Democrat Barack Obama the first African American to be elected as president In and Republicans continued to prevail in Georgia with nominees Mitt Romney and Donald Trump carrying the state in those elections Romney lost nationally to Obama while Trump won the electoral college vote and thus the presidency against former U S senator secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton br Signs the Republicans might be losing their grip on the state began to appear in the state s elections While the governor s office remained in Republican hands Brian Kemp then the state s secretary of state avoided a potential run off against an African American woman former state house minority party leader Stacey Abrams by just votes in the state legislature they fared more poorly Republicans lost eight seats in the Georgia House of Representatives winning while Democrats gained ten winning in the Georgia Senate Republicans lost two seats winning seats while Democrats gained two seats winning In congressional races that year Democrats also posted a gain when five Democratic U S Representatives were elected with Republicans winning nine seats one winning with just votes over the Democratic challenger and one seat being lost br Democrats made a major breakthrough in when Georgians narrowly backed a Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden who was the first to prevail in the state since Bill Clinton in Biden won Georgia s electoral college vote over incumbent GOP president Donald Trump by votes on his way to a national electoral college victory Continuing the Democratic trend in early challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock successfully won run off elections against Republican incumbents to become the first Democrats to represent the state in the U S Senate in years br
