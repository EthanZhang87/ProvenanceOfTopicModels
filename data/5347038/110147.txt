voyage to the New World On March James Sawyer and his brother Charles left England However Snell s parents having learned of the plan would not allow him to leave thus delaying his departure The Sawyer brothers arrived in New York City on April and after a few weeks headed toward Athens Georgia and then to Madison County where they stayed and worked on a farm for a month Snell did eventually follow his friends to New York and made his way south to meet them The three then made their way through Jefferson and Lawrenceville Shortly after Snell s arrival Charles left for Pennsylvania later returning to the South and settling in Alabama where he went into the turpentine business James had gone also in search of his brother leaving Snell to work on the farm of A A Dyer br Unable to find his brother James Sawyer returned to New York and began work on a farm near the Hudson River area until his st birthday in when he returned to England to claim his inheritance Shortly following in August he returned to Americus Georgia and then Gwinnett County Once in Gwinnett County Sawyer found Snell in the small settlement then known as New London near Stone Mountain In the homestead that Snell now referred to as Snellville the two built a small wood frame building and started a business together Snell and Sawyer s Store similar to the one in which they were employed in London As was common in small mill towns of the time they printed store money with the trade value and Snell s likeness on the front that regular customers could use to purchase goods By the end of the business was prospering and catering to customers from the neighboring towns of Lawrenceville and Loganville Travelers bought supplies at Snell and Sawyer s and often spent the night in the nearby oak groves as the trip was too great for one day s travel When New London officially became Snellville is unknown but the location of the partners store was referred to as Snellville in their advertising and the young town began to show a promising future br The partnership later dissolved and Sawyer kept the old store building granite stone above and around the old frame and then disassembling the wood frame from within Snell built a new store of granite In Sawyer built a home and married Emma Webb of the historic Snellville Webb family on November Sawyer opened Snellville s first post office in and served as postmaster from the back of his store br Snell died at age in due to complications following an appendicitis operation He was buried in Brownlee Mountain presently known as Nob Hill and was

Development Public Safety and Public Works The city limits have grown to square miles km and houses of worship are located within the city limits br br br City land swap br br br In early November then Mayor Brett Harrell began negotiating a land swap to transform an abandoned supermarket into a municipal complex and the now former City Hall into part of a church campus The old Kroger in the Oakland Village Shopping Center on US across from Snellville United Methodist Church and City Hall was just one of several dead or dying shopping centers plaguing Snellville Abandoned big box stores had become enough of an eyesore to make them a major issue in the city elections Harrell had campaigned on a platform that included efforts to revitalize vacant retail space br The project was not without its opponents Among the concerned were tenants of the half occupied Oakland Village Shopping Center that the city would take over and who would be forced to relocate The city council voted unanimously that November to proceed with the exploration of a potential land swap There was concern that timing could become an issue and kill the deal in the early stages The owner of the shopping center wanted to sell his property by the end of while the city council decided to take no action for a six month period Some citizens expressed concerns about the project at the city council meeting and asked for the deal to be put to a referendum br On March the city held its first public hearing on the land swap Over citizens attended the meeting to support the idea while more than a dozen showed up to oppose it A few cited a recent roof job on City Hall and the fact that the swap would benefit the church more than the city as reasons to back out of the deal br On March the city council met to vote on the land swap proposal At this meeting the citizens were given a few specifics of the deal According to the council the Oakland Village Shopping Center was worth and the current City Hall was worth Councilman Jerry Oberholtzer estimated that renovation of the shopping center for city use would be in the range He also estimated that to renovate City Hall for future needs would run the city the same cost More opponents than supporters spoke at the meeting and a few senior citizens presented a petition against relocating their center which was part of the land swap plan The City Council voted in favor of the swap Councilman Troy Carter was the only dissenting vote br As preparation for the swap began the city hit a snag in June when a possibility arose of perchloroethylene soil contamination from an old dry cleaner site in the Oakland Village Shopping Center The Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division responded that even in the event of contamination a clean up may not be required if no one lives close enough to the site or no one is using the ground water in the area The city did discover the use of a well by a private citizen within a one mile km radius of the site This citizen Harold Cotton Willams refused a deal from the Methodist Church to cap the well In response the city began exploring a local ordinance banning the construction of new wells and closing any existing ones The city council voted on June to adopt the ordinance but still allow the use of the well for irrigation The city council also decided to include the realignment of Oak Road and Henry Clower Boulevard at U S in the land swap project br In July the land swap hit another snag A lawyer representing the Nash family of Snellville filed a lawsuit claiming the city could not trade one of the parcels because the city did not own it The Nash family contended it owned the approximately acre m tract and the unused building sitting on it In Horace J Nash deeded the building to the Georgia Rural Rehabilitation Corporation for use as a vocational center The building was used to train unemployed workers during and after the Great Depression Later the city used the site for a jail a senior center and an agricultural building Most recently the building housed Recorder s Court Attorney Bill Crecelius said the Nash family had let Snellville use the building for decades without complaint This issue was resolved when the city presented documents verifying its ownership of the title to the building as well as title insurance br In July the last piece of a building plan for the project fell into place The Snellville City Council approved funding for a multipurpose complex combining municipal functions and police services plus offering a public gathering spot In a vote the council approved certificates of participation a series of leases that are to be renewed annually until they are paid off in years In the final plan the land swap would include an acre m project encompassing a new City Hall police department senior center and public forum area br Groundbreaking for the new city hall began in March with the demolition of the Oakland Village Shopping Center Hogan Construction Group of Norcross was awarded the contract to construct both the new City Hall and new Senior Center The original completion date was pushed back because of poor weather conditions Crews also had to blast granite under the building foundation further delaying the project and adding to the cost br On March the city officially dedicated the new City Hall located at the corner of Oak Road and Main Street East US Mayor Jerry Oberholtzer was quoted that arriving at the dedication day took five years four elections three architectural firms and two lawsuits The city hopes to one day expand the complex by adding a parking deck and a new public safety annex br br On August the city council awarded a contract to Smithco Construction of Gainesville to demolish and remove the remaining piece of the old Oakland Village Shopping Center The area has now been converted into an open green space br br br City funds misuse controversy br Former Mayor Tom Witts had been under close watch since for alleged tax evasion owing tens of thousands of dollars in state taxes On September Witts was indicted on counts included allegations that he consistently underreported income and over reported deductions on tax returns that he used more than half of his mayoral campaign funds on expenses like cruises plane tickets and adult entertainment websites and that Witts company completed multiple jobs for the city of Snellville a violation of state law Witts original sentence was reduced due to poor health reducing any jail time to house arrest Mayor Pro Tem Barbara Bender was to be sworn in as mayor until an election can be called br br br Towne Center br In February the City of Snellville hired engineering firm Clark Patterson and Lee in conjunction with renowned urban planning firm Duany Plater Zyberk Company to begin the process of planning a new town center for the suburban community A weekend long design charrette was held to engage the community in the process The plan that emerged from this visioning process provides a new town green and shopping district bordered by neighborhoods that incorporate a variety of housing

U S br Compared to most large cities around the world at approximately the same latitude such as Beirut Casablanca Dallas Los Angeles and Phoenix Snellville has lower average winter temperatures The primary reason for this is that the North American continent extends into high latitudes that allows systems to form and move eastward and southward without obstruction by major mountain ranges Other factors include Snellville s distance from large bodies of water its higher elevation which can lead to rapid weather changes prevailing wind patterns and extensive tree cover which reduces the urban heat island effect an advantage during summer br In the winter weather systems sweeping south from Canada through the Midwest bring temperatures that can reach below Fahrenheit Celsius a few times a
