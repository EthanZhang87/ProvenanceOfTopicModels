an affluent historic district br br br History and government br br In while on a trip to northern Georgia Roswell King passed through the area of what is now Roswell and observed the great potential for building a cotton mill along Vickery Creek Since the land nearby was also good for plantations he planned to put cotton processing near cotton production br Toward the middle of the s King returned to build a mill that would soon become the largest in North Georgia Roswell Mill He brought with him African slaves from his own coastal plantation plus another skilled carpenter slaves bought in Savannah to build the mills The slaves built the mills infrastructure houses mill worker apartments and supporting buildings for the new town The Africans brought their unique Geechee culture language and religious traditions from the coast to north Georgia br br King invited investors from the coast to join him at the new location He was also joined by Barrington King one of his sons who succeeded his father in the manufacturing company Archibald Smith was one of the planters who migrated there to establish a new plantation also bringing enslaved African Americans from the coastal areas br Shortly after a survey of the area was conducted by Nathan Crawford Barnett as part of the Cherokee Purchase in preparation for the sixth state administrated land lottery culminating

part of Cobb County when first settled and the county seat of Marietta was a four hour one way horseback ride to the west Since Roswell residents desired a local government they submitted a city charter for incorporation to the Georgia General Assembly The charter was approved on February br By the time of the Civil War the cotton mills employed more than people mostly women Given settlement patterns in the Piedmont region they were likely of Scots Irish descent As the mill increased in production so did the number of people living in the area br br During the Civil War the city was captured by Union forces under the leadership of General Kenner Garrard Under orders of General Sherman Garrard shipped the mill workers north to prevent them from returning to work if the mills were rebuilt This was a common tactic of Sherman to economically disrupt the Confederate rebellion The mill was burned but the houses were left standing The ruins of the mill and the foot m dam that was built for power still remain Most of the town s property was confiscated by Union forces The leading families had left the town to go to safer places well before the Civil War and arranged for the enslaved people to be taken away from advancing Union troops as was often the practice Some slaves may have escaped to freedom beyond Union lines br After the war Barrington King rebuilt the mills and resumed production While many freedmen stayed in the area to work as paid labor on plantations or in town others migrated to Fulton County and Atlanta for new opportunities The South suffered an
