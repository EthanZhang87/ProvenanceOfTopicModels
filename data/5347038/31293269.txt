title: Politics of Georgia (U.S. state)
id: 31293269
The politics of Georgia change frequently and often follow the rest of the United States in major historical landmarks The state has a long history starting in the th century as a British colony The cultural makeup of the early colony led to a ban on slavery being overturned soon after its implementation setting the stage for the many plantations in the state Rival governments were formed during the Revolutionary War with the Patriot government surviving and forming a unified state government after the war Georgian politics then followed the Democratic Republican Party before the American Civil War and the Democrats afterward In fact the state never voted Republican until making it the last continental state to do so Since then Democrats have won the state just four times for native son Jimmy Carter in and Southerner Bill Clinton in and for Joe Biden in br As the political ideologies of the Democratic and Republican parties shifted in the th century Georgia politicians moved to the Republican Party Republicans won a Senate seat in the state for the first time in history in Then Sonny Perdue became the first Republican governor in the state since upon his election in In the late s and early s Georgia became a competitive swing state with Democrats narrowly winning all statewide federal elections in the elections establishing the state as a battleground on the federal level However the state of Georgia does currently continue to maintain a Republican lean on the state level with Republicans controlling every statewide office having Republican majorities in the State House and Senate as well as a complete Republican pick on the Georgia Supreme Court Though losing the US Senate race in statewide Republicans vastly improved their margins of victory from to in Georgia br br br History br br br Colonial times br The Province of Georgia was founded in as a British colony by a royal charter through a trust led by James Oglethorpe a member of Parliament who had originally envisioned it as a place to resettle volunteering debtors instead of sending them to prison It was named after King George II the reigning monarch of the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies at that time They banned slavery The province recruited yeomen settlers to occupy land where the native Yamasee had lived before the Yamasee War acted as a buffer to protect earlier settlements in South Carolina from the Spanish presence in Florida and hinder West African slaves from escaping and reaching lands beyond the frontier and the control of their owners br Although most early Georgia colonists were English Scottish and German artisans seeking arable land or freedom of religion many of them complained to their leaders that the ban on slavery created a labor shortage that impeded local finances compared to other Southern colonies After Spain failed to conquer the area during the War of Jenkins Ear the province legalized slavery in altering the balance of power in the settlements Thousands of slaves were imported to work on plantations producing rice indigo and sugar Their owners mostly South Carolina planters were wealthier than the early settlers and soon gained most of the official political appointments in the Crown colony that replaced the trusteeship in br br br Revolutionary War and Antebellum years br br Georgia had two rival governments during the American Revolutionary War the appointed Loyalist regime of James Wright and the Patriot administration initially led by planter Archibald Bulloch After escaping revolutionary forces Wright fled the colony in but organized a return in backed by British military force After the war he left again in evacuating with British forces following the end of hostilities and victory by the rebels The British also evacuated thousands of slaves to whom they had promised freedom if they left rebel masters They were resettled in the Caribbean and London br Bulloch who died in and his colleagues founded a republican government In Georgia was the fourth state to ratify the new U S Constitution br Georgia had been settled along Atlantic Ocean and the Savannah River The drive of settlers for westward expansion made territorial issues prominent An expansion from the Altamaha River to the St Marys River and the drawing of southern and northern borders neglected a western boundary The colony assumed it would extend to the Pacific Ocean a nearer limit was the Mississippi River The federal government worked to reduce such early colonial claims in the interest of establishing more states In addition nationwide anger among the states about the Yazoo land scandal resulted in Georgia leaders defining their claim in at the Chattahoochee River up to its head of navigation at the site of modern Columbus and a line running north by west from there br In the early United States most Georgia politicians were aligned with the Jeffersonian Democratic Republican Party favoring strict constructionism in constitutional law and states rights over federal power Unlike the Federalist Party which backed strong central government Jeffersonians wanted a freer hand in both Indian removal and expanded plantation slavery Before the Revolution Georgia was home to the native Creek and Cherokee The advent of the cotton gin in which made short staple cotton profitable in the uplands of the state and the Georgia Gold Rush in spurred runs on land The Georgia Land Lottery tried to reduce corruption by giving native lands to poorer citizens but did so as native treaties such as the Treaty of Indian Springs were broken or revised br By the s Georgia politics was split by the Jacksonian Democratic Party and the Anti Jacksonian Whig Party Congress passed the Indian Removal Act of favored by Jackson to void Indian land claims in the Southeast and permit development The U S Supreme Court ruled against Georgia s encroachment on other Indian land in Worcester v Georgia in on the grounds that Indian natives were entitled to federal protection But the ruling was ignored by both presidents and the state and the federal government proceeded to forcibly remove Indians to west of the Mississippi River The Cherokee were the last to be forced out led along what they referred to as the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory during which many people died br Former Native American lands were developed for cotton cultivation and planters brought in thousands of slaves to work the new lands In the state legislature declared that black people were non citizens After the Compromise of tried to resolve slavery among the states as an issue of balance of power the Georgia Platform was accepted by many Southerners as the policy by which secession could be avoided br br br Civil War years br In the s most state Whigs joined a reinvented Democratic Party that became inflexible on the issues of supporting the expansion of slavery and a highly devolved federalism The victory of Abraham Lincoln who was considered a moderate abolitionist in the presidential election of was perceived as a threat to Georgia interests This large slave society was the fifth state to secede from the Union A founding member of the Confederate States of America in the state sent tens of thousands of soldiers to fight in the American Civil War br br br Reconstruction through the th century br As in other southern states white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature in the s through a combination of force intimidation and fraud with widespread voter suppression of black Republicans At the turn of the th century Georgia passed a new constitution and amendments that in practice disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites The exclusion of blacks from the political system was maintained well into the s The legislature passed laws to institute legal segregation of public facilities and Jim Crow customs governed many informal rules placing blacks in second class status br In the postwar era after World War II African Americans particularly veterans renewed their activism for civil rights including being able to exercise the franchise Conservative white Democrats formed the States Rights Democratic Party splitting from the national Democratic Party This group whose members were called Dixicrats was very segregationist It pushed for its candidate Strom Thurmond to be the Democratic presidential nominee in southern states Georgia was the only Deep South state to reject Harry Truman the national Democratic nominee as its candidate Thurmond ran as a third party candidate in the state br During the s and s Georgia made significant changes in civil rights governance and economic growth focused on Atlanta It was a bedrock of the emerging New South In Georgia s tenth Constitution was ratified and is the newest state constitution in the United States as of br br br Modern politics br In Sonny Perdue became the first Republican Governor since the Reconstruction br In its voters passed a ban on same sex marriage with voting yes The ban was invalidated in by the United States Supreme Court case Obergefell v Hodges br About half of all appropriations in the Georgia state budget each year are funded by state taxes with the remainder of revenue coming from federal grants and state bonds br In the early s despite a Republican trifecta in the state government Democrats won all three statewide federal offices Joe Biden narrowly won the state for his presidential campaign while Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won the U S Senate elections becoming the first Black and Jewish senators from the state with Ossoff winning a full six year term and Warnock winning to finish Republican senator Johnny Isakson s term The wins were reported to be due to the shift of white moderates toward the Democratic Party and the increased turnout of African American voters In incumbent Democratic Senator Warnock defeated Republican nominee Herschel Walker in the election winning a full six year term in office Also in Republicans however did win every statewide office in Georgia by margins of and incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp won reelection by a raw margin of over votes at over Democrat Stacey Abrams br br br Federal representation br br Georgia currently has House districts In the th Congress of
