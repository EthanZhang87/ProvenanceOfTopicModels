the A F laid the tracks to Musella instead When Musella became a flag stop the railroad offered better opportunities for farmers to market their products so many of the residents of nearby Ceres Georgia named after the Roman goddess of agriculture settlement also called Hopewell migrated to Musella Since cotton could be shipped by rail the cotton gin at Ceres was disassembled and moved
